0,"My mother had planned a disney trip for us 3, my bf and I and herself. My boyfriend (whose 27 btw) agreed to going and my mom paid around 2000 for tickets and hotel for 3 days. Bf said many times he would be going until 2 days ago he got into a huge fight with me over the fact he woke up with a stye on his eye and didnt want to ""look stupid"". I said if he were to not come my mom would be super upset, I had read online that disney tickets were non refundable. But luckily my mom was able to get a refund for both the park tickets and his hotel reservation. I had said we were broken up in the heat of the moment of being upset, I blocked him for one whole day and he ""reflected"" on the fact that he was acting out of line. I honestly feel like if the refund wasnt issued he wouldnt of had paid my mom back. He apologized to me for fighting over the fact he couldnt end up going and I'm over it now but my mom is pissed and I gave details of our relationship i shouldnt of had

What should my bf and I do to amend things with my mom? Should he give her some space before he apologizes for not showing up?",04Dec2020,1

2,"I'm a teenager. I sometimes have to come to grips with the reality of things. Typically, if something is accepted by enough people, I tend to agree with the majority (of what I see). Sometimes, however, what I think is morally bad is accepted by other people, and thus I go into a rabbit hole of not knowing what's good or bad.   


Any advice?",04Dec2020,1
3,I game with ppl regardless of age as long as they are good at the game. a boy I met from the game is 13 and he started calling me mom recently? He won’t tell me why. I know he has a mom and father in his life but idk the family situation. I told him it makes me feel weird but he insists on calling me mom. I feel like this is inappropriate but I can’t tell? I don’t know what to do about this,04Dec2020,1
4,"So I have this friend and without giving too much info, he seems like he is interested in me. And he doesn't have much boundaries and is kinda clingy too. I don't want to be involved with him romantically because I don't see him in that way and never will. Also, I don't even want to be close friends with him because he makes me uncomfortable with his lack of boundaries. 

I am fine with being good friends, but how is that possible if he has feelings for me? I don't want to lead him on in any way, but I don't know how to say anything about it without hurting his feelings. 

I feel like he thinks I talk to him because I am ""interested"" but I'm not interested at all. He can't take a hint even though I make it obvious that I want distance.",04Dec2020,1
5,"The only times it’s ever happened was when people were being dicks. Guys in class saying “Hey ____ youre fucking gorgeous” and then laughing away, obviously taking the piss like they always have. Girls screaming at me in the street saying I’m “soo fucking sexy” and laughing at me. I try not to pay attention and before anyone says “maybe they mean it.” Trust me. I can tell by their tone they don’t. By the way the turn and whisper to their friends and smirk and laugh and mock me. 

It happened today for the first time in ages. I walked to school and passed two guys and girl and the guy called out saying “Hey you’re great!” I ignored it and she kept calling. Getting annoyed and laughing. Ended up getting into school and I felt like shit. 

I hate the shit because now that these few people use these positive words in negative ways I can never hear them positively. Even when I know someone means it I don’t believe them. I get reminded of the other people who didn’t mean it. The people who did it to embarrass me. I know I’m ugly. I know I am. It just fucking sucks to have to be reminded of it everyday. 

As well today, a girl who is nice to me and my friend and works on essays with us a lot passed us by and started compliment my (very fucking beautiful) friend. She passed me and then called back my name and said “you’re beautiful too! As usual!” And even though I didn’t believe it. I knew she did it to be nice. I didn’t like it that much but having someone try to be nice to me after someone used the same word to mock me in the same day was nice. It made me feel better. But it still fucking hurts.",04Dec2020,1
6,"(Throwaway acct.) I just recently found out that my grandfather has to undergo triple bypass open heart surgery. In response to this news, I feel nothing. No sadness, worry, anger, confusion, etc. It’s not like we aren’t close or he is estranged, it’s actually quite the opposite. We’ve always been close, very close, and my mom (it’s her father) is torn up over this. I’m honestly struggling to empathize or give the proper emotional response in this type of situation. I’ve never really had a problem expressing my emotions, it’s been more of a recent thing, the past 2-3 months perhaps... This discovery is a little worrying (although i cant seem to make it resonate enough that im scared), and I honestly don’t know what to do.

9,"first of all, thank you so much for taking your time out of your day to pay attention to what i have to say. it truly means a lot. i’m so blessed that you want to help a lost and confused soul like me.

so i have been trying to figure out on my own for the longest time how i should live and organize my life, because it is such a mess and i can’t seem to get it under control. then i thought, maybe we should hear from other people on what they would do if they were me. 

so picture this: 

you are an 18 year old girl who has the biggest dreams in life. you want to do everything, and i mean everything. you want to travel the world, meet all kinds of people from different cultures and backgrounds, you want to learn so many things, make fun and amazing memories. you want to be a better person because you have had your fair share in sinning. you just want to experience life as much as possible before you die. you just have the need to have a fresh start, a clean slate.

you have one problem though. you don’t know where to start or how to do it. 

because you consider yourself a perfectionist, it’s hard to accept the fact that you aren’t perfect. so whenever you make a mistake, you tend to give up on your “new life” and you go back to square one. it’s getting almost impossible to meet the goals you want to achieve and be who you always dream to be. you feel like your life is slowly slipping away from your fingers. 

this person is me. but if you could be me, what would you do? 

thank you.",04Dec2020,1
10,"I'm sorry if it's a fairly commonly asked questions. But whenever there is a major bad news i hardly feel sad or such, and mostly have a logical approach to it. For instance my grandfather passed few months back and i was with him till his final breath (we were really close) but during his funeral i hardly felt sad unlike my cousins or others. Even when i was young i knew about my father's extramarital affairs and also about my mom's but never reacted. And even when they were discussing separation i hardly reacted. I'd get sad over small things sometimes or after watching a sad movie or show but when there was a major issues i hardly ever reacted, I'll simply be numb to it. People say it takes time to process emotions but even after months I'd still not feel anything. My reasoning always have been things happen this is part of life. Btw I'm 18, and sorry if this sounds like a teen problem that'll be over soon. Also i should add that I've been watching movies  and reading books with moral values from early teens like Road to perdition, The pursuit of happiness, Schindler's list, Kiter runner and such.

12,"I moved in with my great-grandmother and we’ve been having a great time together. She’s pretty lively considering her old age and we joke around with each other a lot. 

In her basement, she has a life-size Santa doll/statue that’s startled us on a few occasions. A few days ago, I moved it to the bottom of the basement steps as a joke, and she thought it was hilariously scary.

So today, I’ve had the idea to move the doll into the dark empty room across from her room to startle her. However, I thought to myself, what if she gets startled so badly she haves a heart-attack or seizure? 

Am I being paranoid or is that a real possibility?",04Dec2020,1
13,"How do I explain to my mother that not everyone I talk about are my ""friends""?

You know how you have those people you've just known, and how they aren't necessarily your friends? Those are most of the people I'm ""friends"" or acquaintances with. I know they aren't my friends because if we ever had a group project or anything like that, I'd always be a second choice. I always see them (the people who are my acquaintances, whom I once thought I could be friends with) hanging out with each other, without me. That kind of lets me know where my place is in the relationship. 

How do I explain this to my mom? She told my doctor about this and they want me to talk to a therapist and see if I have ""social anxiety"" (which I don't think I do).

My mom gets mad at me because I never invite these people over, but why would I, when I'm only a last thought to them?

Along this train of thought, I have ""friends"" who always ask me for answers, and they never talk to me other than that. I always feel pressured to give them answers because I'd feel bad and embarrassed if I didn't because I've known them for while. Although they are only acquaintances, I have no one else to talk to in class other than them. I'd rather be a second to last choice than to be no choice at all.  It's really difficult for me to speak to new people and to really become ""close"" to them.  Should I still talk to those people?

I am really sorry if this post didn't make sense, I don't really know how to explain what those people are to me.",04Dec2020,1

So apparently we talked a lot about sex that night and I told her we should have sex for some fkn reason (I’m bi but don’t want that) and apparently I kissed her. (Not forceful people anything) (She said she might have kissed me back but doesn’t remember cause we were both drinking and it was a long time ago.) she went to the bathroom to pee then came back into bed facing away from me. Guess I wanted to sleep with her cause I proceeded to say we should have sex then kissed her back for about a minute or so before she went to the bathroom to throw up and call a ride to go home. 

Things were a bit weird between us after that cause of course they were. But about 6 months later she wanted to get coffee and catch up and we started getting close again. I asked her and apologised about that night which is when she filled the details in for me. She told me I need to get over it and she considers it a weird night but a funny bar story. I feel so terrible about making her uncomfortable. It was so weird and out of character I can’t stop overanalysing it. I think about it all the time and can’t stop.

20," About a year ago I came up with a business idea that does pretty well. I had been doing it for a while and the next thing I know my best friend wanted to get involved and as selfish as it may seem I didn't want him to contribute because it would only cut into my profits and it is my idea. I was being a pussy though and I told him that we could do it together and to avoid confrontation and seeming selfish I led him on to believe this idea. So for the past couple of months, he has been hyped up thinking we are going to run things together. Again since I am a pussy I lied to my friend and said that I quit and that I was gonna resume business later but this time with us doing it together. All along I was actually handling business by myself. To make a long story short he caught me red-handed and I feel like such a piece of shit. The only way that I rationalize this in my brain is that it is MY idea and I have the right to do things by myself but I shouldn't have led my friend on thinking he was going to be my partner. I have seen many friends come and go and I know that most of the time it is unwise to combine friends/family and business. This friend isn't just some pal either he has been ride or die all throughout elementary, middle, and even high school. Our bond has gotten so close that I think he expected me to be okay with him being my partner, and without really asking first he kind of just inserted himself in the situation, which leads me to my moral dilemma right now.

22,"I'm a senior in high school. Last year, this asshole classmate of mine (who was and currently is in the same grade as me) spread an embarrassing photo of me. I was teased for a couple of weeks before everyone moved on. The picture was of me looking at a girl's Instagram post of her senior photo in a classroom, with my eyes closed and mouth open. Basically it looked like I was jerking off. The girl obviously blocked me.

Overall, he was never really a nice person to me, and he never really respected me. As a matter of fact, he also disrespected my property one time. One time, in a classroom, I was on my laptop, watching a video called ""How to get a girlfriend"", and I minimized it to look at colleges. The kid came up to me, and in front of me, put his fingers on my keyboard, maximized the video, laughed at me, and told some classmates in the same room.

This year, I got revenge by slandering him brutally online.

Before the retaliation, I asked him if it was him to took that picture of me. He said that he didn't do it and then told me that I was a cyber stalker and had a ""creepy obsession on the girl"". A friend of mine who I told about this situation told me that he was gaslighting me.

Eventually, some time later he eventually gave up and admit that he did take that picture of me, after I impersonated him on social media, made awful posts, and sent it to about 5 people to try to get it to spread. I kept bothering him, by continually asking questions and insulting him, as well as slandering him online like I talked about earlier, and told everybody that he embarrassed me, made fun of me, and gaslighted me, effectively ruining his reputation.

He is saying that he didn't gaslight me, that I was spreading false rumors about him, to stop playing victim, and that what I did was worse because I caused him ""permanent damage"", because ""once something gets on the internet, it never goes away"". The posts were already deleted, but he is complaining that Google still saves the thumbnail of the posts, and that with the right keywords, it is possible for a college or employer to find them.

I remembered in the past, him saying and doing other mean stuff to me. I asked him about those, and he said that he didn't say/do that, even though I know he did. My friend was like ""Oh my god, that is gaslighting"".

So...

Who was worse in this situation? And why?",04Dec2020,1

It has gotten to the point where I dread waking up because the first thing I am going to see is the slew of text messages from people needing paperwork, a consult, a meeting, etc. All my classes have been pushed to the back because of how demanding this job is. My boss is not considerate that I am a student as expects an insane amount of work, and when I gently remind him that I can't take on new clients because I have an exam, he just brushes it off as though I can handle both. Spoiler alert: I cant. 

I missed out on so many classes I could have enjoyed bc of this job. Now I am stuck cramming for finals and fielding off clients.

I am not interested in doing real estate / apartment locating as my career. Not at all. I want to spend my time in college taking on internships in field I am interested in, participating in more orgs, that sort of thing. I would rather have a part time job that doesn't have great pay, but when I clock out, I CLOCK OUT. I cant bring my work home with me. This experience really taught me that I need to stop taking short cuts to what appears like easy money. My mental health is collapsing but I feel guilty that I am letting this opportunity (aka money, lets be honest) go to waste. I feel like I should be thankful and push to like this job. I want to pay my tuition off, I don't want to drown in debt. But I don't want to work in a field that I absolutely hate.

26,"I dont really know where to start, i love my son but im beginning to lose hope with him.

He has always been really shy and socially awkward but the last 3 years it has just completely hit rock bottom.

He never leaves the house anymore unless he has to, in fact he always tells me ""if i had a choice i would just stay inside for the rest of my life"" and i think its gotten to the point where he gets anxious whenever he even has to leave the house, sometimes i see him shaking near the door and stalling time by walking around the house (im assuming, delaying the inevitable) its just sad. On top of this he seems to have no real friends and hes never been in a relationship, the last time he had a friend over was when he was about 11 or 12... he is almost 20 now. I think he could be gay, theres nothing wrong with that either im fully supportive if he is but i cant even work out if he is, ive never seen him talk to a girl or having any kind of relationship with one ever (in person or online) and when i asked him about it and told him it was ok if he was gay he said something along the lines of ""i dont know if i like boys or girls"" which left me even more confused, i should mention as well that he doesnt seem to have much interaction with males either but its more than he has with females.

The most concerning part though is that he doesnt really seem to have any long term goals at all, he currently works at mcdonalds and whenever i ask him what he wants to do for a living he just says he wants to stay at mcdonalds and maybe become a manager or assistant manager one day. Now look, theres nothing wrong with working at mcdonalds even as an adult but wanting to work there for the rest of your working life? Even in some manager role just sounds quite depressing to me. I know somebody has to do the job but i really dont want my son to be the 50 year old guy that is still working at mcdonalds, i would feel horrible. I was thinking about maybe threatening to kick him out if he doesnt make an effort to find a better job than mcdonalds but i just cant do it, he always pays his rent on time and even does a fair bit of housework but i cant just let him keep doing this can i? He says he just wants to live with me until i pass away and then he will buy a house with all the money hes saved and then just do whatever for the rest of his life, but i just cant stand the thought of my son being that old loner man who achieved nothing in his life, imagine looking back on your life and realising you achieved nothing but work at mcdonalds and never found true love. 

I look at all these parents on social media bragging about their kids getting engaged, having kids, getting good jobs etc etc and i cant help but feel like i failed because my son hasnt really grown up at all. I love him but what would i brag about on social media? That my son lives at home still and dreams of being a mcdonalds manager? I just feel like i failed him big time. I hope someone can help shed some light on this situation because i feel like the worst parent in the world.",04Dec2020,1

29,"In April, I decided I wanted to lose my virginity. This guy wanted to be friends with me, so I was like “hey, here’s a candidate.” At first it felt like he was in love with me. That he actually wanted me and that he wanted to be my friend. So in May, we started dating. 

It was good at first, but I started to be really toxic. I wouldn’t communicate well. I was bitchy and moody constantly. I don’t know what changed. I used to be such a nice person, but when I started dating him, I wasn’t by the same person. I was antisocial, snapping at my friends and family more. I don’t know. I just felt on edge a lot.

He didn’t want me to tell anyone that we were dating. I did end up losing my virginity to him in June though. I loved him, really. Or at least, I thought I did. 

Things went downhill when I was “kicked out” in August. My parents were divorced and living in different towns, so I moved in with my dad. Where it was basically me taking care of myself and being in a room alone from August to October. He liked the fact that I was away from my mom, because she was always trying to get me away from him. He was an adult, I was a minor. She noticed that I was changing. I think she thought she was doing the right thing, which she probably was. But I thought I was gonna marry this guy.

I could’ve been a better girlfriend, but I don’t know. He ignored me for a week in September. and I feel as though I knew the relationship was starting to come to a close. I panicked. I don’t know why I was so scared. He isolated me from everyone. I couldn’t talk to my friends, my family, I couldn’t work. I quit my job because of him. I stopped talking to my friends because of him. The one person I counted on to be there for me, was never there.

I tried to kill myself multiple times, because I just had this overwhelming sense of “I have no one”. I never experienced it before. I never felt it before. And I couldn’t cope with any of it. I ended up going inpatient, and once I came out, he dumped me. 

I will say, I did make him listen to me try to kill myself. Almost every time. I feel like I only did it to get his attention, because he wouldn’t talk to me ever. He got bored of me. He didn’t want me. I gave him my virginity at 14, I gave him my innocence. 

When we broke up, we originally just took a break. He said he would decide at the end of the break if he still wanted me or not. It was supposed to last a month, but after a week, he said he didn’t want me nor feel anything for me anymore. It didn’t make me upset that he didn’t feel anything for me, because I can’t force anyone to feel anything for me or force someone to be in a relationship with me. That’s okay. But he just wasted my time.

After back and forth for about a week, I blew up at him. We tried being friends, but it didn’t work out because he was just an asshole to me. I told him I deserve respect. He got mad and told me to find respect somewhere else. 

I blocked him, then texted him again (I know:( ). I apologized, and he gave me half assed replies. He said we could try being friends in December, but over the next few weeks leading into December, I’ve begun to dislike him. He did a lot to me, and just threw me away at the end of it. I get why, honestly, but it just hurts. It feels like he just got with me to lose HIS virginity, and didn’t care about how I felt. :(

How can I get over this? Was this my fault? Am I overreacting?",04Dec2020,1
31,"Hi all!

First of all, I love what you do here!

Not a super serious one, but I'd appreciate some input nonetheless.

My sister graduates from nursing school tomorrow with honors after a ton of hard work and dedication and many difficulties along the way, and will start working in February if everything stays in place. Unfortunately, due to COVID, our university has decided to cancel all graduation ceremonies. She's pretty torn up about this; she's worked her butt off for years to get where she is, and now she feels like its just another checkbox filled out. The recognition she will get from our parents and other family members will be slim, if any...I plan to take her out for breakfast tomorrow and drinks Saturday to celebrate, but I feel like that's not enough, especially since I also have to divide my time up between this and my winter university classes.

There was talks about celebrating in May, when I'll graduate, but she'll have been out and working for several months by then. I also don't want to overshadow her accomplishments.

How can I show her that her hard work does not go unrecognized?

I thought I could restart the mission but this one took me 2 hours to complete and this was closest I've been to completing it. I thought I'll try and if I don't well that's good but I finished it and now I can see her grave in the cemetery and it's the saddest thing I've ever seen. She really loved shooting things and everytime she fired her gun she something like ""your gonna get shot"" and ""how do you like it."" She loved to tinker with bombs and loved explosions. Her last words were ""I guess shooting things is lame... huh. It hurts to shoot someone and it hurts to get shot"" then she fell over and died. At least she died doing what she loved: shooting things. Anyway I paused the game and I threw my headset on the ground and I started to cry. I'm still crying an hour later. Loosing someone in that game is like loosing your best friend. It's hard because you really get attached to them. I love you and I'll miss you Wendy. Know your death was not in vain and we will avenge you.",04Dec2020,1
34,"Hi guys, today I had experienced some severe emotional abuse. I have been friends with a girl for roughly 10 years. And we got into a falling out due to me not attending a party she threw. I later received a text saying “Idfwu, you’re a clown etc.” and was very taken back because I’d never talk to a friend that way. Fast forward a month, I received a DM today, saying horrible things about me. She then messaged my boyfriend saying “she drugged you and fed you mashed potatoes to go through your phone” my boyfriend blocked her. She then VENMOED him the same message, and then proceeded to create a fake number to text me, saying watch out, you messed with the wrong girl, i ignored and blocked all forms of contact. All this seems completely irate and irrational, but I’m having a hard time moving forward without feeling a sense of guilt. Furthermore, I’m scared of what she will do next, slashing my tire etc. I’m 24 years old, not used to this type of drama and behavior and have a hard time rationalizing getting over such hurtful behaviors. I definitely could use some advice!!! Furthermore, her parents both suffer from severe mental illness and have been hospitalized, I assume a possibility of genetics with her although I don’t want to justify this. Just looking for similar experiences/ psychological responses to deal with the pain/ her behaviors, or how to handle the situation. Thank you!",04Dec2020,1

Now, the places and names have been redacted, so bear with it. We had been talking a bit before this, but I want some points I should bring up, or things that I should say.

**-F         I’m sorry, by the way, you seem to genuinely want to help and I’ve been denying all of it.  The issue is, if I need something/someone to motivate me, how the fuck do I come across that? Whenever I find something I enjoy any hope I had gets crushed within days of finding said interest  And a person? As nice as that’d be it’s me we’re talking about, I feel like that explains enough  Though I agree with you that I need motivation, finding motivation just seems impossible** 

\-ME     It'll come. In the meantime, you just have to be ok with handling the day, and just completing the day. even if you didnt do anything. I went through a stage like the one you're going through, back at \[BLANK\], i didn't have any friends, i hated life, and i was forced to be with bullies. But i just tried to see the better side of things, to hope the next day was better. and, that day finally came. when i came to spotswood, i felt good! i was looking forward to the future! there were nice people around that i could associate with, and be happy.  

\-ME     For me, it was people and lifestyle, but for you, it could be a hobbie or a video game.

41,"All I did was make a post about being from a low income family and struggling with issues. I stated how I live in a 1 bedroom apartment with 5 family members and how since it’s an old building we experience problems such as roaches, leaks, mold, toilet not flushing and sink malfunctions and leaks , no heat.

I said how I got frustrated and told my mom that living in a poor home comes with problems and my mom said be thankful you’re not homeless. I always express how thankful I am but all I said was it’s not fair how parents take away from my struggles and that just because someone is in a worse situation that doesn’t mean our problems aren’t valid because they are just as any other persons. I also said I’m sure rich people have their struggles too. 

Someone had the audacity to say where are priorities because no heat and that I am able to post here with WiFi. That is such an ignorant thing to say. Do they not know that some buildings are in control to turn on the heat and they take advantage of low income tenants. Just because you are low income does not mean you are not allowed access to WiFi and a phone bill. This is so beyond me. 

Another person had the nerve to comment their own struggles and tell me to leave my home if I hate my parent that much which I never even stated that I hate them. They clearly missed the point of my post and did the same exact thing by invalidating my feelings and saying they had a worse situation. Just because I have a roof over my head doesn’t mean that my parents haven’t physically,mentally, and emotionally abused me while growing up because they have. I made one post and people assumed that they know my entire situation. 

All I wanted was for someone who related or to even be open to understanding that where I’m coming from is very reasonable to feel like you are struggling sometimes. Yes I am appreciative that I have shelter and food. But dealing with a bad living environment due to being low income takes a toll on my mental and physical health.",04Dec2020,1

43,"I 18F have recently been having a lot of issues with my anxiety over these past few weeks. It’s not severe, especially during the warmer seasons but fsr winter always seems to really kick my ass. Right now, I’m trying to go to sleep but I won’t let myself out of the ridiculous fear that I won’t wake up in the morning. 

Every single time I almost drift off; I jerk myself awake again. It’s kind of embarrassing; but for some odd reason I’ve become terrified of sleeping alone, which is really out of character for me. I, for the most part, have always been a bit of a loner and it’s never bothered me before. I guess it’s because I want someone to make sure I’m not dying or dead? Idk. 

I have been to the doctor before and spoken about it and they did put me on medication; but it caused me to have a full blown panic attack in the middle of the night, which freaked me out, so I simply stopped taking it. 

I still don’t really know what to do. I hate feeling my own heartbeat because I’m scared of something being seriously wrong and it’s keeping me up at night. Then, I’m depressed during the day and I’m always tired. I just really don’t know what to do. I’d like to get a therapist; but I’m worried that would be stupid because I don’t think my anxiety is bad enough for that. I wonder if it’s even anxiety at all or if this is stuff that regular people struggle with as well?

I live in Coastal South Carolina, near Myrtle Beach. 
Where I live borders a patch of woods about 500-600 feet deep and maybe a mile long. It’s suburban area. 
Where I sleep, there’s a window I can look out directly, (my rooms on the second floor btw!) and every once in awhile I’ll look outside the window and just stare for a little 
There’s two houses and backyards that face my backyard so the only light I receive are my neighbor’s back porch lights. 
So I just lay there and look out, and I notice this random looking dog start pacing near my neighbor’s fence. I was already chalking it up to my neighbor taking the dog out but then,, haha,, I remember he owns two Pomeranians!! Not a skinny looking black dog. So I just laid low for a little and kept watching, now thinking it’s some emaciated bear and hopefully it was, but it happened to have a seriously pushed in face. The way it paced, and then eventually the way it propped itself up on the fence made me think otherwise. So now I’m just confused. It’s been a few days since I saw whatever it was and I’m wondering where I should talk about this or if I’m just seeing this all in my head. It’s just weird how long I was watching it for.

Despite every being good in life for me right now, I’ve started to feel somewhat lonely both socially and romantically. It’s pretty hard for me to find friends despite me trying hard. I’m looking for advice on how to find people to hang out with?

My school holds ‘come in days’ occasionally to encourage us to meet up and socialise, but most people are rural and never come. I go to non-structured social and youth events as well, like last month I went to a queer youth event and despite it being really fun and meeting new people I didn’t have much in common with them and we never really kept in contact.

I’ve talked to some of the people in my class but most of them are pretty distant. I’m not really into sports or drama so I can’t really join any clubs either.

I’m interested in a lot of things and I have tons of hobbies which makes it disappointing that I can’t seem to connect with anyone at the few events I do go to.

51,"I (M 28) have recently moved out of a one bedroom basement apartment in rural Maryland that I was living in for two years. The rent was 800 a month, which is actually pretty expensive for the area.

Upon clearing out stuff that I had stored away and didn't really use, i noticed that most of my stuff was completely infested with mold. Most notably, there were huge patches of black mold in the bedroom. I never noticed it because my bed was pushed right up against it. I figured that if the mold was that prominent, then pretty much all my stuff was compromised and decided to play it safe and throw away most of what i had in the apartment. Im talking about my mattress, furniture, clothes, bedding ect. Literally $1000's worth of stuff. 

My landlord has not inspected the apartment yet since i moved out and i have not brought up the mold yet. How should I confront him about this? Should I demand that he compensate me for damages to property and health? I've literally been living in mold for 2 years and am lucky to not have health issues. I do take partial blame for not noticing, but I never imagined that any one would rent out a place with this serious of a mold problem. Also, MD is very humid so i always have a dehumidifier running most of the year, so it's not like I was helping the mold thrive.

 I know he will play ignorant, but i know for a fact that he knew about the mold when i rented the place. When I first viewed the apartment, there was already mold in the bedroom. He said it was because the window was accidently left open when no one was living there. He said that he'd paint over it and that i had nothing to worry about. Keep in mind, this is someone I somewhat trusted because my family and I have known him for a very long time. You should also know that since Ive started renting from him, I've heard from several sources that he's known to be a bit of a slumlord.

 I forgot to take pictures of it but i will make sure to do so tomorrow before I talk to him. Any advice would be great because im not a very confrontation person, but I am seriously upset over this.",04Dec2020,1
52," I have a dream. I am in a point in life where I would love to get in touch with a wine maker from the north of France that is in financial problems. Now, hear me out. I was having a talk with an estate planner who wanted to invest some of my money on the stock market for a profit. Many investor companies work that way: you give them money and if you're lucky enough they invest well they take a percentage and you get more than you gave them. But I don't see the fun in that. I don't want to give someone my money to do what he likes, I want to follow my own passions. So as a reply to what I would like to invest him I said I was looking for a small wine maker in the North of France, who was married to a wife that was in a sneaky relation with his neighbor (for instance, this is very specific, but not a requirement), and he would be getting a divorce. Now if he can't afford to buy out his SO I would love to get in contact. Or maybe they inherited a winery from their parents and need a little support. I won't be like a bank. I would love to take some friends or family over every now and then to taste some of the wine, stay in a nearby bed and breakfast or hotel, take a couple of cases home for Christmas, etc. Living the French live. But I wouldn't not get involved with running the winery so much. If needed, of course, I'm there for advice, but the owner can do what he wants with making the wine. If three years down the line things don't work out: so be it. I'd love be become small part owner, but not so the original owner can't do what he wants anymore. The owner would have to speak English though. I'm from the Netherlands myself. I own a bar with a beer brewery, but being part of a wine makery is one of those dreams I always had. And I'm in the position to follow that dream now. If you know anybody that would fit this profile, or if you are this person, please drop me a message and we'll talk. I'm not a big investor or anything, I'm just a wine lover with a dream.

To give a little background, I’ve agreed to watch my sister’s baby every other weekend, fri - sun, while her and her husband work. I was pressured and guilted into doing it, but because I was available on those days I agreed to it in the end. However, as the weeks go on I’ve gotten more and more hesitant about doing it. You see, they’ve become such control freaks that my every move is monitored, hovered over, and scrutinized. I’m not getting paid to do it, and I’m being forced to watch him at their house instead of my own. I feel like they’ve taken complete advantage of me. My sister is someone that you can’t confront about things, whether it be serious or minor.

Now, I love my nephew and enjoy spending time with him, but I literally dread going to their house because of them. In the time that I’m there, they’re only gone for an hour a day, meaning the rest of the time they hover obsessively.

Is it wrong of me to tell a white lie to have a weekend alone where I can breathe and not be bothered by them? Am I being an asshole and doing them wrong? I don’t know what to do. I can either tell her I’m feeling fine and go, or carry on my lie and get out of it. All opinions welcome, as I genuinely don’t know what to do. Thank you.",04Dec2020,1

Recently my dad told me to give one hour to study for law as well just incase engineering didn't work ...but that is not my concern 

The problem is I'm having trouble studying.i have lost all motivation to study for engineering and I'm just sitting here playing games or doing reddit...I have tried every form of motivation but I just stop after 1-2 days 

I have not tried law but i find same will happen to me if i pursue law degree .

I have developed interest in editing and stuff and i enjoy it but I'm afraid my parents don't think it's any form of career(which it isn't)

I am too afraid to tell them about me whats going on with me coz they will become super mad .  

Plus my dad is a gazetted officer and wants me to do better than him but I am just terribly confused what to do 

TLDR: I can't find myself any motivation to study for law or engineering degree but i editing and other YT stuff but i""m afraid it's not a liable career option

If you guys could tell me ways to atleast motivate myself i would be grateful",04Dec2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 I stumbled upon a video in my recommendation about growing up with good facial structure. I didn't really care about such at the time but I said I'll click it cause why not if it'll be helpful in the future.

This guy ""Brett Maverick"" went on to advise clenching your jaw when taking pictures and such. Me knowing nothing I trusted him instead of researching more. Even the comments we're encouraging me to do so.

 I knew something was wrong the second my jaw one day just clicked in place and remained in pain for a long time after clenching. I ignored it and moved on only to be hit with severely bad aesthetic changes. I've had enough problem with them ever since doing his ""jaw clenching technique"" so I I'll only talk about them further if I need too since I tried to move on from them... but the real problem comes now 

 Getting severe TMJD (A condition in which the jaw joints don't meet properly)  from his clenching I also got very loud tinnitus. A constant buzzing in my left ear that now is migrating to both ears and it's so loud I can't sleep. I can't enjoy silence. I can't meditate, I can't focus on anything! Anywhere I go even in mild noises I'll hear it. Every time I tried to get away or cope with the problems tmjd caused me or just forget about them the tinnitus was always there to remind me of what tmjd had done to me not only aesthetically but also mentally. 

My confidence from how my face took shape from ""jaw clenching"" was below sea level. I used to be ok with the way I look and didn't bother much until I noticed people went from calling me handsome and being able to lead a normal life to calling me ugly and laughing at me to the point even my family noticed something was wrong with my face and I was too scared to go out with my friends and make memories because I didn't look like me anymore. I decided to be a man and got past that but everyday, this buzzing reminds me that this crap follows me everywhere. 

I said I'd never make this post but I just can't take it anymore. As I stand here in my room and hear the noise getting louder in my other ear I know my life is only getting worse ever since that video. I said I'll be a man and grow forward but it's only getting worse and I just got 19. I never thought I would get this unlucky in life.  

 I've been to many doctors confirming this and done many expensive scans such as MRI and blood vessels scan the only thing remaining left is orthodontic treatment for my bite and teeth which I've been told to go for.  They did say my my molars were damaged so bad that my left side molars don't even touch when I close my mouth  but hopefully it'll fix my tinnitus at the very least since that's something I feel many could barely take.  Sadly just being 19 and with this whole Covid I don't have enough money for treatment but it's my fault to begin with for listening to him and the comments at the time.

I don't know what else to do. I said I'll move forward like a man and get treatment but the sound is getting louder and louder. I can't sleep. How can I keep moving forward anymore? I'm slowly forfeiting my life.

What if I do manage to fix the jaw damage it caused me but the tinnitus doesn't go away? It's so loud and anxiety inducing I can't take it. I feel myself going insane slowly and I am sorry for bringing this here but I feel so lost keeping it all to myself.",04Dec2020,1
66,"Hello, I have to babysit this brat until 10am. She's full of energy and likes to try and eat dangerous things. I need advice on how to handle her, because I'm partially tired and it's going to be a little stressful",04Dec2020,1
67,"This is my first reddit post, so try to be easy on me. I may not be the best storyteller, but I really need advice. For context, I am 17F and my biological dad is in his late fourties. Warning: to give proper context, this is a LONG post.

So, the best way to sum up my biological dad, who I'll refer to as John, is that while my mom was in labor with me he decided to go fishing. Not *before,* literally during my mom's contractions. John came from a huge family of slavic immigrants, and wedlock was seen as a HUGE no-no due to their strict religious practices, so before I was born, they got married as what was essentially a peace offering.

This was a big mistake. My parents only stayed together for about three years before my mom divorced him due to many factors: He spent more time fishing and hunting than with us, he was verbally and occasionally physically abusive towards her, and he loved cocaine *way* more than he ever loved me. They tried counseling but their counselor diagnosed my father with narcissistic personality disorder and literally told my mom to run while she still could. My mom lost every single possession, including her car, in the custody battle to make sure I didn't grow up for half my life around him and his family, so I only visited him every other weekend at the most.

Growing up, I hated visiting John. He obviously always wanted me to be a boy, and would try to take me... you guessed it, hunting and fishing, which I never enjoyed and made it clear. He tried in some ways I guess, but everything always had a catch-22. He would take me to work with him... so he could show off how good of a dad he was to his co-workers. He would take me on play-dates with kids of his friend's... so he could either hit on their single moms, or get drunk with both parents. Take me to parks downtown... so he could take photos of us and post them on facebook. You get the picture. These were the *good* moments with him.

The bad was heavily affected by his addiction to coke. I'm not by any means hating on addicts, but John took out his addiction on me. He would go out on benders often, and almost always take me with him. This included multiple occasions of me, a 7 year old, standing in the family friendly areas of specific bars waiting for my dad to come back for *hours.* He would have intense mood swings that he didn't even attempt to suppress from me, in fact, he would blame me for the problems in his life. One example, used multiple times, was that his girlfriend at the time broke up with him because he didn't see me enough. He would often say things like this and/or use me as his therapist, while I hadn't even learned my multiplication tables yet. Once, a long story I'll brief, I pretended to be sick so I could visit my mom, and he had to take me home. He proceeded to cry, scream at me about how selfish I was, and loaded me up in the car while he was still a sobbing mess. As we were driving, he said, ""You know, OP, I have these things called anxiety and depression. I take meds for it, because they make me suffer. One day, you will have to deal with this too, and I'm so, so sorry."" Before swerving on a bridge and almost driving us off of it before he came to his senses and acted like it never happened.

So, understandably, growing up, I started asking my mom to stay home from John's more and more frequently, to which she complied because she refused to force me to do something I didn't want to do, and I saw him about twice a year (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and sometimes Easter) by the time I was 12. He would always text me and go between begging to see me, or saying ""your grandparents don't have much time left, don't you want to see them before you go?"" and holding his dad's (pretty hefty) will above my head. I got used to ignoring it, as I knew it was mostly crocodile tears and, let's face it... I was born a girl and a child of wedlock, I wasn't getting much in the will to begin with.

In the summer of 8th grade, I decided to see him twice outside of holidays, because he had claimed that he changed. Once we saw a movie (great, no talking) but the next was... another story. My best friend of 3 years at the time (now about 7?) was over when John wanted to pick me up to hang out and I asked if he could join us. (Important note: he is a trans man but wasn't out at the time. To respect him, I'll be using he/him.) John agreed, and pulled up in his convertible, where I sat in the back seat while my friend took shotgun as I was a lot smaller and could fit in the back. John proceeded to drive us downtown, talking about himself the whole way, which I was used to, but the big red flag came when we stopped at a red light in the city.

To the left of us was a homeless man, holding a sign but mostly minding his own business, to which John yelled at to stop being lazy and get a job. As in, *very* loudly, to which I flinched and and my best friend visibly jumped at because of how unexpected it was. John then turned to him and asked, ""Why did you jump? Did OP tell you I abused her or something? Because that would be a lie."" My best friend, obviously nervous, shook his head. John then said, ""Good. Were *you* abused?""

Yeah. He started driving after that, because the light was green, but when we got downtown he just dropped my best friend and I off at a coffee place and said he was going to the gym and would be back in an hour or two.

Yup. So... that's about the last time I hung out with him. Through High School I got busy, going back to mostly ignoring him (he would spam me with very manipulative texts on and off) but texting back every few months to keep him in place. I would still visit on Thanksgiving/Christmas to see my cousins on his side. Then sophomore year came around, on Thanksgiving at his house my boyfriend at the time broke up with me and turned out to be cheating on me, and he was annoying the *shit* out of me with his constant nature of talking about himself while I was dealing with this. I decided not to go to Christmas, and the next year I decided I wasn't attending Christmas *or* Thanksgiving with his side of the family. He didn't take it well.

I then sent him a very, very long text about how until further notice I wouldn't be talking to him at *all* and I would appreciate it if he didn't reach out. I included how selfish he was, how I was a human being and not his material object to show off, how I love my family but can't stand to be around him. He simply said he understood and I haven't replied to him since -- coming around to about a year. He still talks to my mom, who despises him but feels he has a right to ask questions, but I have made it clear I am not contacting him.

Recently (past month or so) he has been reaching out to my mom to tell her he's a changed man and has been going to therapy. He sent me a text on his birthday in October saying ""It was my birthday today"" and I didn't respond, so maybe that hit him harder than expected. He says he has a stable job, is sober again, and is getting back up off his feet and that he really wishes to reach out to me. He bought me a birthday gift a few months before (that my mom picked out) and I didn't think much of it until my mom told me he was also wanting to pay for my surface pro screen (I do digital art) to be fixed as there's a huge crack in it as a Christmas present and it is *not* cheap, as in, over $400 most likely. I read through their texts (with permission from my mom) and I want to believe that he really has changed and is trying to do better now but... there's just so much inner turmoil about this and so many layers to our relationship. I don't understand why he's just now trying to do better, when I'll be a legal adult in less than a year now.

I know blood isn't everything, and I very well could just keep accepting gifts and ignoring him, but part of me feels guilty because I do believe in second chances. But he's had *so* many, and no amount of money can change the fact he traumatized me as a child. What if he hasn't really changed at all, and I just get even more disappointed than I already was/am? But at the same time, what if he really has been putting in the effort and has changed drastically compared to the man I once called my dad? I really don't know what to do here.

Anyways, I (F17) moved 2,000 miles away to a new state seven months ago with my mom, stepdad, two half brothers (4 &amp; 8yo) and my doggies. I left all my friends and family behind. At first I was excited to live in the country but right outside an awesome city, and I couldn't wait to make new friends, but then covid-19 got way worse. With my mom being immune-compromised, my brothers and I have been doing school online so far. 

My high school has been slowly increasing their student capacity because they've been so safe and doing really well with the pandemic situation, but my mom says that she will not be letting me attend school this school year (I'm a senior btw). Because of this, I have met absolutely no one from school, the only people I interact with are people in my neighborhood (all parents and little kids), and there's no one in the neighborhood for me to hang out with except for this kid (M15) who goes to a different school. My mom keeps telling me to hang out with him but he's just as introverted as I am and I not the kind of person to force a friendship.

I only talk to my friends (from back where we used to live) on group chat and facetime. Other than them and my teacher with whom I talk to on zoom, I have no one to talk to. And I have no idea how to meet people outside of school. I hide in my room and mostly only come out to cook for my family, do chores, and sometimes watch TV when I'm in the mood (which is rare nowadays).

76,"I (20F) have lived with my two roommates (20F and 21F), who are two of my best friends, for about a little longer than a year, and I've always felt pretty comfortable being with them and talking through the issues that have come up. One of them, I will call her 1 for simplicity, has been dating their boyfriend for about two years, has been going through a slump with him. 1 is bisexual, and she told me at times she missed dating women, plus she's so young that the idea of committing so soon to one person stresses her out. The second, I'll call her 2, has also been exploring her own sexuality and dating just within the last year or so, and with being in quarantine I can tell it took a bit of a toll on her as well. I, on the other hand, think I might fall on the Ace spectrum, so I have never had the inclination or been comfortable with that aspect of myself because it feels so personal to me. Both 1 and 2 feel a lot more comfortable with talking about stuff like sex than I do, although it doesn't bother me as much as it used to.

1 told me the other week that she was considering breaking up with her BF, and I helped her come to the conclusion that maybe making the relationship less serious would help ease her anxiety. Plus he is moving across the country when he graduates, and she doesn't think long distance with work well for her. So this led her to have the conversation with him, not sure how detailed, where they mutually agreed on having an open relationship. So with this knowledge, I assumed that she would be looking for people to date around with as safely as she can with the pandemic. What I didn't expect was to come home one day to 1 and 2 in one of their rooms, I guess having both deciding to experiment with each other, and just going for it.

When they came to me about it after I found them, I really didn't process what was going on until they point blank said it. It really threw me for a loop, and I think they expected me to react differently to it. I kinda was under the impression that having a roommate agreement, with your friends too, meant that this kind of situation was out of the question. Sometimes unexpected feelings and things happen, I understand that, but since I know that this thing was only started as something not at all serious for the two of them, if it fair of me to be uncomfortable with it?  It has really changed the dynamic of our interactions even after 2 days. Seeing the two of them together is especially strange, because I can't really understand their prioritizing their sexual wants over preserving our friendships. How do I explain this to them, and am I being unfair to them?

Thank you for reading this, If you made it this far \^\^, and please let me know if you have ever experienced something similar. It would really help ease my mind, since this is stressing me out to the point when I haven't been able to think about much else.",04Dec2020,1

I very recently (2-3 days) joined a group chat for sharing well... hentai. whatever, really.
Now, about 75% of the group doesn't actually text or participates but a couple of dudes do and share pics and videos during the day. The issue is that very recently someone asked to be sent pictures of ""niñas"" (girls in Spanish). This immediately looked to me like a red flag, but I brushed it off because I thought no one would send anything or someone would even tell him off. BUT nobody did, in fact, they DID send pictures of clearly minor girls and at first I didn't believe it. It made me sick, yes I really don't enjoy watching nude underage PEOPLE (whatever the gender or non-binary whatever really), mostly because I have two smaller cousins that I really love and would give my life to protect both of them. 

Back to the topic, I REALLY want to report this group as fast as possible but as this app requires your telephone number, I fear that I can be traced and get in trouble for sharing this type of content (I haven't shared anything, I even deleted the pics from the chat).

I'm 24m but I've been having motivational and general life issues now for a while but I've clawed myself up back in August or so, trying to find my way back to finish my college degree. Then I got a really great opportunity and advisor for one of the final things I need to do: a thesis.

Now initially it all seem to go ok until last month where it all started to go down hill inexplicably. After an initial phase of intensive contact with my advisor and their group, I went on to try to do thing on my own. Doing great for a while and then found myself stuck on something, not understanding a lot, panic set in and then completely lost my motivation, dragged my feet, not doing anything and was sick for like a week and a half or so and ever since then have basically capsuled myself in, completely shut off communication to the outside world. Done nothing productive and completely avoided anything for more than a month.

Now my advisor and some of the group members have been trying to contact me but I've been way too anxious to even answer. With nothing to show for, they increasingly got irritated by my silence and now my advisor has been writing me disappointed and angry mails about what is happening and set a deadline of when the whole thing gets canceled.

83,"A few years ago my wife and I made a big change, packed up and left the city and found our piece of paradise in the countryside. The place was perfect; very quiet country side road off of a quiet winding road. One of the simple things we enjoyed was being outside at night and the complete darkness. Now, we're on a road maybe 1.5km long with about 10 houses on it offset from each other. Lots range frkm 3-5 acres.  So basically, a lot of space, and a lot of trees between each home. We previously could never see our neighbours. But in the last couple weeks, a neighbour across the road and offset a bit has installed the brightest exterior lighting known to mankind. And it's just one freaking bulb. But this thing is ridiculous. It literally casts a glow halfway up my 700 foot driveway (and theirs is probably 300 feet) -and is strongly visible inside my living room.

84,"This post may seriously sound like a rebellious teen post, I know. I just want to know what I can do to possibly help myself in this situation. I'll try to type this as best as I can due to my age and since this is my first post.

In all honesty, I'm willing to say I am somewhat scared of my own Dad. I understand he was born up in a strict household, but it isn't an excuse for what he's done to me. Firstly, I have always had really bad issues with my self-esteem so it's hard to feel proud of myself, even as a kid. Due to this, I've always felt as if I needed the praise of my parents, especially my father. He's the kind of man to never smile unless he's downed a beer. My Mother on the other hand is a sweet and kind woman who I love dearly.

From the age of six to eleven, I was heavily influenced to hunt and shoot. I was forced to go to shooting ranges and come with my dad in the early hours of the morning to watch him shoot deer and turkeys. I never wanted to, but I felt like I would disappoint him, so I tried my best to make him proud. Now, this is where it all begins to go downhill. When I was around eleven, I had told my Dad I didn't want to hunt and I didn't want to shoot animals. He understood, and I thought that was that. Until I learned my dad had signed me up for soccer. I didn't mind soccer, I used to be an athletic kid. So, my eleven-year-old self decided I was gonna make my dad prouder than ever before. One night, I had a soccer game and my dad had told me I needed to empty the dishwasher. My forgetful self agreed and went to the game without emptying it. 

After the game, I obviously took a shower and was exhausted so I fell onto my bed and fell asleep. All was well until he stormed up into my room and demanded to know why the dishwasher wasn't emptied. My eleven-year-old self just looked up at him with tired eyes as he then grabbed me by my wrist and dragged me downstairs, pointing at the full dishwasher. I had told him I had forgotten, but I explained I could empty it in the morning before school. My dad then yelled and screamed at me for about half an hour about how lazy and worthless I was. I don't remember much about that night after that except for the fact he dragged me back upstairs, grounded me for a month, and made me sleep on the floor that night.

Ever since then, I was a bit afraid of him. I didn't trust him as much, and our relationship slowly began to crumble. We'd fight, getting into yelling matches at least once a week. This continued but I eventually learned not to yell back, perhaps eventually causing this mix of fear and hatred for him in me. About a year after that fight, he started to go more and more on his phone, and would only talk to me when he needed something to take his anger out on. I eventually just learned to deal with it, as he became less and less emotionally available for me.

By the age of thirteen, I had gotten used to the fact that my dad didn't care. He would only pretend to at family gatherings or when friends came over. To my friends, I had a ""Perfect"" family. Now I realize how messed up my family is, no matter who's responsible for it. By the way, my Mom is a kind and sweet woman who I have always loved dearly. She understands why I'm upset so much about this but is always trying to make points that I cannot understand, maybe it's an adult thing I don't understand yet. I know I'm young and I don't always make the best decisions, so I wanted to post this to see what others thought about this.

TL;DR: I want to know if I'm just a rebellious teenager or I'm actually seeing things the way others do.",04Dec2020,1

86,"am I in the wrong for not wanting my sister to date a 19 year old?

My sister is a wonderful, kind hearted girl. Who is experiencing her first crush. I asked who he is and she mentioned someone who I graduated high school with. My sister is 14.. just started high school. And this makes me extremely concerned for her well being because when they hang out, he doesn’t drive her home until 2 in the morning. What kind of person keeps a 14 year old out that late?! When I was 14 I had an older guy groom me the way this guy is by saying “oh you’re so mature for your age” etc. Which after already learning it’s not because you’re mature;  its because you’re easy. I don’t want him taking advantage of her, especially since I knew what he was like while I was in high school with this guy. When talking to our mom about it she said she trusts that she will be smart and I told her it’s not her I’m worried about. It’s him pressuring her, trapping her, etc and not knowing what to do. I see this as very Predatorily, especially since legal age of consent is 16. I can’t control her since I’m not the parent, as well as I don’t want her to resent me and the friendship we have together.",04Dec2020,1
87,"I’m on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues. This is also my first post. 

Right now, I am studying for a diploma in accounting. I’m decent at it (in my opinion), I understand the whole subject quite well and am having no problems studying it. 

However, I’m not sure this is what I want to do in life. I’ve tried some accounting work at my mother’s job, and I found it boring. It just didn’t fit right, so I quit after a week or two.

I am, however, interested in writing. I do love to write stories, albeit I’ve only wrote in essays for school exams. But I do find joy in writing and would love to pursue this as a career.

This is where I’m stuck. I don’t know if I should go for accounting or writing. I know that if I can finish my diploma. I can at least secure a decent income in the future if things don’t work out and just be a full time accountant. But it just feels so wrong, like it’s not what I do. I am worried about how my career would look like as a writer and if I can even earn enough. What do you people think I should do?

89,"Is it normal to be in a relationship and never really feel in love? I know this sounds horrible but when people say it I just say it back to avoid them being hurt. To give some background I think I’m permanently damaged from my past. I can only remember being in love 2 times and I am currently 30yrs old. The first time was when I was 18 and fresh out of high school. I met this guy that was 29yrs old. He worked at Lowe’s and asked for my number. He kept saying “you’re just a baby” when he found out my age and was hesitant to tell me his. Once I pulled it out of him he finally admitted he was 29. I had never experienced a serious relationship when I met him. I had also only had sex once with the guy (a friend of mine) that I had lost my virginity to. I was very sheltered and shy. I believe he was drawn to that because he preyed on my insecurities and my innocence. He started off very kind and I fell hard for him. I was head over hills in love. I would do anything he said. Eventually he started acting different and kept trying to get me to be sexual with one of his friends. He was trying to pass me off like I was some type of property. I still stuck around because I was scared of losing him even though I never agreed to doing anything with his friend. Things got really weird when he told me to bring a friend of mine over so he can have his friend come over and we can all drink and chill. Eventually a game of truth or dare came about. His friend dared him to let my friend suck his dick. Apparently my friend was more promiscuous than I knew because she did it. My heart broke and I was never the same after that. I didn’t understand how you can love someone so much and they can turn around and hurt you like that. I realized he never cared about me. After that it was years before I would love again. Eventually around the age of 24yrs I met another older man. It took awhile but he really came off as charming and perfect and I fell hard for him. I was more in love than I’ve ever been. Once he knew I loved him he confessed that he was married, and had a open marriage. I was horrified. I was disgusted with myself because I had slept with a married man. I hated that he took away my choice to make that decision by hiding it from me. Ever since then I’ve never been the same. I have deep rooted trust issues and I can never fully let my walls down. In between I’ve dated and have had more men lie and cheat but at least I never loved them. I want to love but I think I’m broken at this point. Does anyone have this same feeling?",04Dec2020,1

From the 8th grade I was going to sleep and waking up with the dream of studying abroad, of living in the normal country, with the dream that I'll leave my home country where I didn't want to stay for any reason. We are not the ones who can afford it  easily. Ten thousand bucks we were saving from the day I said to my mother that I could have such an opportunity and still saving them so I could've lived there with a roof above my head and not in hunger. 
The main problem that I have a passport of Russia but the Russian law says that to go to the Czech ambasy in Russia I must have a residence address in my passport. I never had one. 
The law of the Czech ambasy in Kazakhstan  says that I could apply for a visa if I have a registration in Kazakhstan or in Kyrgyzstan. And I have a proof that I have been living in the Kyrgyz republic for a long time. But it's a separate documents and in the ambasy they requested a sing pice of document that states that I live in Kyrgyzstan. And that simply impossible, we can't get a registration for a period bigger than half a year.
One more problem is that I couldn't seamly cross the border with Kazakhstan due to covid restrictions. I bought a flight form Bishkek to Istanbul to Astana which costed my family 650$.
I all ready paid for my study. I already studying czech language for four months. I already gave up around 5K in euro.
I'm lost, it's seems like my whole life is a joke. Like it's never been something right in my life. Like I'm a looser.

I don't have many options. I can try fly to Russia spend lots of time waiting for the visa and living there without a hope that I will get a visa. I can come back to my country of birth and live my life there like a looser who haven't achieved all he had promised. Or try to emigrate somewhere else. But where ?

I have a situation that is laying heavy on my noggin. For context I will tell you that I am a 22 year old female working for a big French fashion company. And I have worked in fashion since I was 14. Lately I don’t feel.. happy? Doing my job fulltime.  The money is good but the work is not that rewarding and my travel time each day is around 3 hours and that is also beginning to take its toll. Everything would be easier for me if i lived closer but I’m not prepared to leave my entire family and boyfriend behind. I really have mixed feelings about my current job.. 
my boyfriend asked me if I would not be interested in taking a job in his office since he thinks I would be good at it. That of course would mean waaaayyy better working hours and get home in about 10 minutes everyday. But I am a pretty hyper upbeat person so I’m so scared I’m going to hate working at an office and regret leaving my old job in a store! 
I have maybe thought about working part time for both of them, or just one day for the store. That is something that I would like but in my country you will pay way more taxes if you have 2 jobs instead of 1. 
Please give me some wisdom on this matter because no one around me is able to give me good advice on this.

106,"Below is some backstory, basically I just want to know how not to care when I be rude to someone.

At work, I deal with people who are just assholes. For example, this guy at work was made a shift lead and I trained him. I didn’t think he’d be any good after a while of training but the manager made him a shift lead anyway because he needed one. Okay, I think bad call but okay.

I come in these past few days and we have a rule, no shift leads in the back for long periods of time. I come in and he’s in the back. Okay, maybe he’s doing something important.

I go talk to the manager and he leaves for the day and I am there watching the new shift lead to make sure he is doing what he is supposed to be doing.

He’s one, goes to the back for thirty minutes, leaving the other people to stand around and do nothing. I tell him he needs to come to the front and run his shift, not me. He tries to argue but i say no, come to the front and run his shift (also, this guy has never liked me because he didn’t like the way I ran things. I ran things a lot more tight to control labor and food cost). He didn’t like that. The old manager (who quit) let them do whatever but I make people work. 

He didn’t like that. I asked him a few months ago how he liked the changes we were making and he said he didn’t like them. Fair enough and I respected his answer but told him it is what it is and we gotta adjust. 

Fast forward to these last few days, he’s been trying to push me out of the store by saying “oh, you don’t have to be here you can leaving” or “it’s slow, you can go.” I’m not stupid I know he wants me out of here but I ignored it. He has a negative attitude.

Today, he was just rude so I took him to the back and basically said as a shift lead, as a higher up, you cannot be acting the way you are acting. People look up to you and if you act like that, you are giving a bad example to everyone. Whatever opinions you have of me and the owner (he doesn’t like the owner either), you need to keep them to yourself while at work. I am not having this conversation again with you. Fix your attitude and do your job or I will find someone who will do your job.”

He didn’t say much after that but I hate being rude. What do I do to not care about being straight up to people?",04Dec2020,1

I didn't do really anything about it because I didn't think it was that serious since it was a fairly old building.

I tried to tell my landlord and he said that there's nothing to worry about and that there's locks on all the windows and the door. After that I kind of just pushed it aside until about a couple days later I came home and I could see that the windows were all open from all sides, but only slightly cracked. The upstairs house has stairs that leads to it and the stairs are in front of my front window. They are doing work on the house above but it is been held off for months(due to covid) and there is a gate on the stairs. so I am able to see if there is anybody coming to and from there If I wanted.

114,"Hi y'all, 

I just turned 22, and I have a lot of issues in my life that I need advice on. This is going to be a long read, but I hope you will take the time to help. I will break each issue down into their own section, so I do not have to make multiple post for each issue. An answer for each issue is not required, so only answer the ones you are confident with. I apologize if multiple Issues in one post isn't allowed, but I don't intend on posting these individually if its taken down.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 1: My mom has been trying to get me on the free health insurance for months now (I forget if its Medicare or Medicaid...) but I was turned down the first time with no reason given, and now they just will not answer her calls at all. We cannot afford even the cheapest health insurance, our only car is falling apart, our roof is leaking, and we often have to go without showers for weeks as we cannot afford propane for our water heater, so paying anything for health insurance is out of the question. 

I have had severe Anxiety and Depression for many years now, but with no way to see a therapist or get on any kind of medication. Because of the Anxiety I am unable to work, I really want to work so I can get money to pay for the things I need, but even the thought of leaving the house is enough to make me throw up. I just don't know what to do. I haven't even seen a doctor or dentist for years. If anything is wrong, we just have to wait until its bad enough to go to the ER. We just can't afford it on the single disability check we get every month. 

I am also Transgender, but obviously, no money to start HRT, and even if I had insurance, insurance often does not cover that kind of thing, especially the free ones. I hate everything about my life and who I am, but I can't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 2: I have a compulsive eating disorder, I've managed to not let it get super bad by only drinking water and nothing else, but I eat all the time, whether im hungry or not. If food exist, I want to eat it. If I force myself to not eat it, all I can think about is the food. It will ruin my whole day until I eat it. I want to lose weight because im a fat ugly potato and nobody will love me until im skinny, but as hard as I've tried for years, I cannot beat this eating addiction. Obviously, getting any kind of mental help for it just isn't possible for the reasons above. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 3: My father is extremely mentally abusive to my mother (he's too smart to get physical), and it's been this way for over 15 years, but we simply don't have the money to leave. We are stuck with him and its slowly killing us all. We have no family to retreat to as they all abandoned us. We don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 4: I was in a long distance relationship for just under 1 year. We never met in person as we were on opposite sides of the country, but we spent many hours every day in video calls and social games. I truly loved this person and I truly care about them, and at first, everything was wonderful, but as time went on, I started noticing that I never felt loved by this person. I broke up with this person because of it, although we are still friends and still talk. 

It's been over a year since then, and I've come to the conclusion that me not feeling loved most likely had to do with the fact that I did not, and do not love myself. Looking back at the time we spent together and our chat history, there were many times where they showed me just how much they loved and cared about me, but I was too blind to see it because of my issues. That most likely made it impossible for me to feel and accept their love, and made it hard for me to love them as a result.  

I've thought about them every day since we met, and I want so badly for it to work out between us, but, even if they'd want to start over, I am not any different as a person, and I will likely have the same problems because of my severe insecurities and mental disorders. But the longer I wait, the more I risk them finding someone else, and if that happens, I will never be able to live with it. Mostly, I just want to know what I'm even suppose to say to them, its not like I can just ask them if they'd like to get back together with me...

In 5 years, this probably wont even matter or affect my life in any way. It is actually taking a very negative toll on my mental health as i am a perfectionist and have always gotten straight As so I feel like i have to always get straight As or people including myself will be mad at me.

116,Im five months pregnant and Im a server and I have been battling management since I found out I was pregnant. They came at me about eating during shifts and sometimes still do. Most nights they give me ridiculous sections of six to eight tables. I work in semi fine dining with coursed meals and wine service and even not being pregnant thats a lot to handle. Whenever I go to management about my section being too much to handle they just act annoyed and like im being a brat. Sometimes I get smaller sections but they are usually shitty and i only get four tables in a shift. I cant live off that either. I have met with each manager multiple times in a polite and professional way. Even spoken to my gm and agm multiple times about specific issues im having and with specific people. Some of the managers even tell me that youre not that pregnant you can do it. I legally dont have geounds to sue these people at this point and i feel like they are intentionally being shitty to me to make me quit. We dont have hr and my manager intentionally gave me thr wrong contact info for his boss so I could not tell on him. At this point i just want to quit but cant afford to.

During undergraduate I somehow, despite being without exaggeration the worst student in my major, managed to get some research work with my professors and now by some miracle I've made it to graduate school. However I'm still a god awful student. I promise this isn't an exaggeration. I failed my way to a bachelors degree.

Overall i started getting really exhausted all the time and had barely any energy when i went to work. I guess this made me a bit more lazy than usual, as i never want to be the slacker. Just yesterday, a few of my coworkers and I had a position meeting (where members of the same position meet) and the two “leaders” told me and my other coworker that some of the Vets and Vet technicians have noticed that there is a lot of sitting around/cellphone usage/overall slack. They basically said that this is grounds to go to management, but they wanted to have a discussion first. I really appreciated that they decided to talk to me about it first before it got worse. I didn’t know how to react so i nodded and agreed and thanked them. I am so beyond embarrassed that i’ve been acting this way at work without even realizing it. Overusing my cellphone at work seems like the most pathetic thing ever and I basically am mortified that we even had to have this discussion. i held back tears the entire rest of my shift, and i am currently at home crying about it now.

125,"I literally have no clue what I'm doing here but I really need to know if I'm a terrible person for doing this. Okay so I'm 16F and my grandmother is 58F, all of this started years ago and it hasn't showed signs of stopping anytime soon so I had to cut ties. Btw this is gonna be kinda long, I have a lot to unpack but I desperately need advice so please stick around.

When I was about 9 my grandmother was diagnosed with leukemia, she already has a slew of serious health problems that have been around since she was in her 40's. So you can imagine how distressing this was to the family because we thought we wouldn't have her around for much longer, my mom especially was crushed. Anyway I used to spend every weekend with my grandmother since I was 3 (my grandfather died when my mother was 8 so I never had the pleasure of meeting him), she and I were very close even though she wasn't a stereotypical sweet/caring grandparent. She developed a drinking problem after my mothers dad died and she was absent in my mothers life for the most part, always out partying or working very late. My mother had to basically raise herself after her dad died, she cleaned, cooked, and took care of my grandmother all when she was very young. None of this was fair on my mother but it was decades ago and it seemed like everyone had moved on and she had forgave my grandmother. So I keep up the routine of spending every weekend with her for another two years before I start to realize how truly toxic she is. When I was younger I absolutely adored her and loved spending time with her, even if we just played games or watched a dumb movie together. As I grew up though I started to notice how she treats my mother and just people in general. It started off with me just noticing a few small things like being rude to a waitress or a random snarky comment directed towards my mother. I spoke to her about how it was embarrassing to me that she treated people like that in public and she immediately apologized and promised she would stop and said it was just the medication talking and not her true self. Surprise surprise it didn't stop, now to be fair she does get quite a few steroid shots in her hips to help her walk around without as much pain. 

Anyway fast forward a few years when I'm about 13/14 and I stopped spending every weekend with her. Her health got really bad and she had to have a nurse visit with her three days a week and help her shower/cook for her. That nurse was my mother. Every day my mother went over to her house she would come home in a terrible mood and either be really angry or really sad, I didn't know this was my grandmothers doing until a couple months later. I went with my mother one day to visit gram/help her out with making food and cleaning up. I saw firsthand the way my grandmother screamed at my mother and constantly told her she was a bad parent and she was an idiot for marrying my step dad( my stepdad is an amazing person and he loves us more than anything in the world, my mom is also an amazing parent who always without fail puts me first). I think she was just jealous of their relationship but whatever, when we left I asked my mom if my grandmother was always like that and she said yes. So I told her she should quit and just try to distance herself from someone so negative and toxic, she did, her mood drastically improved almost immediately and I was glad to see she was back to her normal self. I thought that was the end of it, I was wrong. 

My grandmother would text me almost every day telling me she misses me and that she doesn't have a lot of time left and I should be ashamed of myself for not visiting her when she's dying, Im very susceptible to guilt and she was using that against me to get me to do what she wanted. I was didn't want to see her because of the way she treats my mother and just how she acts in general but I knew that if I woke up one day and she had passed I would never forgive myself. So I start visiting her more often for another year, we have on and off fights where she does something that should be unforgivable and then comes groveling back and tries to apologize and guilt trip me again, it always works. I was very depressed around this time and suicidal, she is the root of most of my problems. My mother completely cut off all communication with her and I'm really glad she did, shes in general way happier and upbeat. Around this time I start seeing a therapist because I had a panic attack at school from all the weight pushing down on me and I guess somebody called my parents to let them know, probably a good idea because I had a plan at that time( if you know what I mean then you can probably relate). She tells me that I should completely cut ties with her and try to move on from this and I did exactly that. 

It still wasn't over though, the guilt of completely ditching her eats away at me every day and I'm worse than I've ever been, I know if I wake up one day and she died I would never forgive myself, and a weight like that would most definitely push me over the edge. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done, I didn't have it in me to block her though so I still get her messages telling me I'm a terrible person and I'm going to regret this almost every day and I'm starting to believe her, did I make a mistake? She might change if I come back and tell her how serious the consequences to her actions are but I know i'd just be lying to myself.",04Dec2020,1

I keep blocking them but they won’t stop and I’m concerned for my safety at this point because they keep mentioning coming to see me and trying to give me money so i feel guilty about not contacting them.

So to start, I \[m16\] was around 13 when this first started. I had recently come out as gay to my friends but I was still very unsure and curious about my new-found sexuality. I was trying to explore my identity to the best of my abilities I guess, as I really didn't know anything at the time. There was a friend of mine who was a year older and was also openly bi. And I happened to have what I thought was a crush on him.  
So skipping over a few of the less important details, like me being lead on for like half a year, my heart kinda being broken, and him, what I can see now as being manipulative, he wanted to have a relationship with me, but only on his own terms.  
This first time I was really in a ""relationship"" of any sorts. But it was more or less just being friends with benefits. And at the time I was pretty young, new to everything and had never done anything like this before of course, nothing sexual nor romantic. I barely even knew the difference.  
He made me do a lot of things I was really uncomfortable with, but he made me feel like I had to. I really wasn't into any of it, as it were, and I know now that I'm Ace (sex-repulsed), but I sure as hell didn't know then, so that really hindered that.  
I'm not going to go into much detail of what actually happened, but it made very incredible uncomfortable, and even if I did say I didn't want to, he made it seem like I had to. I felt completely powerless, and now I regret so much...  
This went on for about 2 years? Maybe a bit longer  
I genuinely hate myself for all of this... I feel like it's all my fault.  
I'm actually pretty depressed, and I probably have PTSD, but both of those aren't really related. They just make it harder... trust, guilt, relationships, mental health, etc...  
Anyways, my question is this; what would this be called?  
Sexual assault, abuse, rape, etc?  
I've never felt brave enough to even talk about this. I never felt like it mattered enough or anyone would care, so I wouldn't even know what to call it.  
But I feel like I should talk to someone about it, as it's eating me up inside  
I don't actually know where to turn though, which I guess is another question in itself...

131,"I (21F) still live with my parents and i let a boy (22), who I’ve been talking to for a little over a week now, stay the night in my room. 

I wouldn’t say my dad is really over protective but he wouldn’t like the idea of me spending the night with a boy in his house who he hasn’t met. And this boy is maybe not the kind of guy he’d want me to be dating. He’s a really sweet guy and we both like each other but he comes from the ghetto and my family is pretty upper class. 

After a week of talking we decided to go for a late night drive, then we got taco bell and i invited him into my room to eat and watch cartoons. It was 2 in the morning by that point and i just let him stay the night but i told him he had to move his car to the end of our driveway, and he did. 

My dad woke up early and went from a run like he normally does and he noticed the unfamiliar car. He asked the neighbors (who we share a driveway with) if it was theirs and they said no, but that was going to be my backup plan. 

He asked if i knew who’s car it was and i lied and said no. I still play dumb about it but i think he’s onto me. He says he wants to start locking our doors more because of the unknown car parked in our driveway. 

What should i do? I’m worried if i introduce the boy to my dad he’ll see his car and know what was up and that i lied. I don’t want to stop talking to him over this but I don’t think my dad will like him because A) he comes from the ghetto, and B) i snuck him in and lied about it. Should i just come clean and tell him why I’m scared to introduce him? Should i stop talking to this guy? I don’t know if we’re going to date for sure but we’ve both admitted we like each other and we have so much in common; i’d like to keep seeing him for as long as i can. 

Also, i think a week is plenty of time to be talking before spending the night and he didn’t even have the intention of staying over that evening, we just wanted to keep spending time together.

So I know I need to just move the fuck on and yet for whatever even I catch my self thinking what ifs or getting a slight jolt of excitement when I get a message from her. 

Like why the fuck did I become so attracted to her and why the fuck can't I just move on. The logical thing to do would be to try and create some sort of distance, not forever but just till I could get it together and move on.

Not from a person living in a 1st world country seeking jobs,  but from a guy living in a 3rd world country seeking better apportunities from the hellhole chaotic 3rd world country that I am in right now. A person doesn't really choose the country that they are born. I need a country that is welcoming to foreigners and is designed in a way to help foreigners establish themselves in the country.

143,"I was hanging out with my “best friend” and we were looking at our old Tumblr. We would message there back and forth and I remember revealing something to her at the time. It’s something about how I was this loner in middle school who used to eat in the bathroom and everything lol. She said that happened to her too and we kind of built a friendship through that since we had similarities (we both moved to the US years ago + her experiencing the same things after moving). So going back to the day we hung out, we came across that message and she laughed and said “that actually never happened to me”. She also just kept saying “I lied when i said that” while we kept reading the other messages. I know this is dumb and happened years ago but like i feel betrayed. Our friendship pretty much was built on a lie. Should i stay being friends with her?",04Dec2020,1
144,"I (18 m) used to go about a year ago but I had to stop due to covid. It opened up a few times and my dad goes to some kind of exercise thing, but I don't think I want to do it at the moment.

I want to build some confidence, so I thought working out would help. But I think that I need a trainer to help me, because I think not having one before seriously and probably irreparably damaged my lower back from not working out properly.

I'm very young, but there are times I'll stand up wrong and I feel a very very very sharp pain in my lower spine and have to lay down on the floor until the pain stops. 

This pain can come up in really any scenario, when I sit down, when I stretch, etc. It doesn't happen often but it's has happened many times.

Should I go back? Because I can't afford a chiropractor, or a personal trainer.

I really want to get into self improvement but I can't stick to a schedule unless I go somewhere. At home workouts just won't work. But machine workouts could hurt my back even more, also covid is a big issue.",04Dec2020,1

150,"So I have recently tested positive for Covid 19 and my boyfriend and I just got off the phone with one another. I told him what I was worrying about and I told him my dillema with school. which from what i told him was that i would have to take an “I” (incomplete) for my classes. Making him believe that they were going to take away my classes that I have worked so hard on to keep up to par all semester. He then started to tell me things like your gonna basically not be able to take your classes youve already signed up for bc of covid nah. and I took it as he was getting to into it. Instead of asking me which classes I had to get an I for and explaining myself he just thought every class would be an “I” and assumed the worse. I’m pretty tired of him doing that and not heading me out, but he keeps trying so hard to be there for me when he has gone through a lot this year. Just he hasn’t been himself since he got a new job, and gone to his moms for thanksgiving, so it’s bumbed me out. I had some time to think about it and To me it seemed he was getting upset at the people and was seeming like the people were there cause he is on my side, but he says some negavtive things like your drop out or no this is wrong or that’s how I take it due to my mom he always says. But anywho I told him I didn’t need him , but wanted him, and choose him. and I haven’t heard from him since our talk and apart of me feels like we aren’t doing somethig right , bc he got pretty heated when i told him that he had to ask me which classes. and it’s odd he tells me he wants to empower me, like i’m not empowered enough. he also said things like so i need to go find someone to feel like a man , i want to be there for you all the time. But i’m not always needing him all the time. He told me yesterday he would call me and instead fell asleep like he does everytime he comes home. When I think if he would’ve called yesterday like he said he would the call would not have ended like he did. cause he didn’t even want to stay on the line and was saying i was being mean. I don’t know what to do , apart of me knows he loves me no matter what. but the other part says I’m doing nothing but hurting him, and that maybe I should just let him think about for a while , or maybe just end things I don’t know I’m half sick, and I just wanted him to call and check on me like my best friend has !",04Dec2020,1

153,"Recently we’ve (my husband, baby and I) moved into an apartment complex. 
We moved in the first the day before Halloween this year. 
It’s a pretty big complex. 6 or 7, 3 story buildings with 24 apartments in each building and one big office in the middle. There is also a playground, dog park, pool , gym, fire pit and computer lab. 
Its decently lit in most areas at night and it’s gated entry so I felt pretty safe going to the gym alone at night, walking my dog etc. 

I noticed something odd about a week into living here though. 

My brother came over with my grandma and baby cousin to pick up somethings I had stored for them. Since I’m now in an apartment, I didn’t have room anymore. My grandma and cousin stayed in the car and my brother came in. 
Chatted and blah blah blah, I decided I’d take the baby and walk my brother out to the car and say hi/bye my other family members right out in front of my balcony on the side walk ( I’m on the first floor).
We walk out and hug, byes, etc, and I notice on the third floor directly above, there’s a guy staring at me/ my brother and was not shy about it. 
My brother and I just looked at each other and smirked and brushed it off since it was weird. We figured he was just nosy. 
He eventually went inside soon after. 

About two days later, my little family is loading up in the car to go out. We see that same guy again, but with a girl. I figured they were a couple or a hookup or something like that. But he made direct eye contact with me and I looked away, but every time I glanced over. He was still looking. 
We drove away.

I few weeks go by and it’s still just random and awkward staring. 

Then this week, things changed rapidly. 

I was out walking my dog around 11:00 am, but it was gloomy and raining so I was just focused down on my pup so my glasses didn’t get covered in rain drops. 
We walked around the side of the neighboring buildings. As we walked up to a row of bushes, I heard heavy breathing and shaking coming from it. My dog barked and we booked it back to our apartment. I told my husband about it but he didn’t give it much though.
I don’t know who it was but I didn’t want to stick around to find out who would be crawling around in the bush. It could have totally been someone tweaking . My town is known for that but either way it was scary and after today I’m wondering.

Then today.....
I was putting up lights for the holidays on the balcony and I noticed I front of it was that neighbor walking by, he made eye contact I looked down and kept singing Madonna like I’d never saw him. 
I glanced up a few second later to see him pacing in the dark parking lot and the walk off.

Fast forward about 2 hours later. I’m walking out the door to go to the gym. I look in the breeze way and there he is. 
Just standing there. I look at him and he walks up the stairs to the second floor. 
 So I just walk out and head to the gym.
I’m there for about 1 hour and 10 mins. As I’m cleaning the equipment I was using and a friend calls me so I answer and chat with him as I’m walking out. I look around and the lot is empty and I’m a bit distracted by the call but then half way into the parking lot I see him. Standing on his balcony with a tripod and a camera pointed right at the gym which by the way is extremely well lit inside with massive windows. You can see everything that happens inside from my building and the neighboring one. 
I try and pretend I don’t notice but at the same time I’m starting to think Either I’m crazy or he is.
I decide to stand off to the side of my building to finish my phone call before I go in (in case my baby is sleeping.) and he picks up the tripod and camera and sets it inside then goes in and stands there behind his glass balcony door and just stares. I’m freaked out and my friend notices I’ve stopped talking and is asking questions. I speed walk inside and tell my husband what happened and he’s not too worried? 

Am I crazy? Am I delusional? 
I’m freaking out. I don’t consider myself someone who’s anything more than chubby and average looking so my brain is telling me this guy is just weird and I have nothing to do with it. 
My brother and my friend think other wise and this guys a creep. 
I’m just worried for the safety of my baby. I don’t want to be out with her and god knows what this guy does. 

Any advice?

157,"A neighbour friend of mine who I get on with well recently proposed to his girlfriend and they are now engaged. Unfortunately it’s not all good news, as two months ago I noticed an unfamiliar car in the driveway while he was at work. I work from home and my desk points directly at their driveway, so while this unfamiliar car was there I saw the girlfriends mother arrive with two wrapped up dinners. She used her key to enter the house and what I saw next was a heated argument ensue, the mother yelling at her daughter and storming out of the house, the girlfriend following out after her in just a dressing gown. This is when I overhear the mother shout quite loudly “how could you, He doesn’t deserve this”. 20 minutes later, I see a man leave. Now, I know for a fact the neighbour does not know what happened, as the day after I asked the girlfriend how the dinner was, the one her mother had dropped off. She got very defensive and asked me to not say anything about the mother or the other man. I said to her “well perhaps you should”, to which she said “there’s nothing to tell”.

like I exfoliate before I shave and it still doesn’t do anything. I also try putting oil on my skin right after I shave because I’ve heard that helps with the strawberry legs but it still looks like there’s hair on my thighs even after I’ve shaved and I just hate the texture. Any tips?",04Dec2020,1
161,"i'm really lost and just need advice, as i'm just tired of dealing with this shit. using a throwaway account for a variety of reasons.  

to provide some context, i, along with some friends, are small-time twitch streamers. none of us have large communities by any means (we all have less than 500 followers, none of us are big names sorta deal), but have tight-knit groups that overlap quite a bit due to our friendship. we're all doing this for fun, and we met due to our shared love of gaming. 

not too long ago, one of my friends, who's probably the most popular out of us (which isn't saying much as we aren't popular streamers), had a confrontation with someone who is a twitch partner (twitch partners, for those unfamiliar, have large audiences with thousands of followers and can make lots of revenue from streaming due to them being prtnered). for some reason, i'm not entirely sure why, twitch partner decided to focus in on my friend, using their legions of followers to mass report his account for some questionable things that he said on stream when upset, attempting to get his account banned. personally, i don't think he should have said those things, but that's beside the point.

since then, our life has been a living hell. twitch partner has made it her life goal, seemingly, to make our lives miserable. my one friend has stopped streaming due to the negative feedback they were constantly receiving. twitch partner has been harassing and even straight-up bullying some of my friends just for being connected to the one they were mass reporting. however, it seems that nothing that we do can stop it, as trying to ignore it is difficult, as one can imagine, and they seem to be enjoying all of the attention they are receiving. twitch won't do anything about it, as i don't believe it's against their terms of service, last time i checked.

so here's my dilemma: i've been on hiatus from streaming for the past three months as i returned to college, not bringing my gaming computer with me. i really want to go back to streaming, as i'm finished with finals, but i don't want to be harassed. 

i'm really unsure of what to do. i love streaming so much, and i don't want to give it up, but i'm so scared of dealing with hundreds of people harassing and bullying myself and my friends.

162,"  so recently I tested positive for covid. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. It didn’t go well like I wanted it too. I’ve been going through a lot before covid and he hasn’t been there for me since he got back home, due to a friend passing from covid. 
  The convo started out fine, till my issue about school came up. He thought the worst of what I said, and kept giving examples of the negative outcome I was not get myself into, because I trust my professors. Then I told him don’t call me baby. I did this because he kept making these examples about how my decision was going to negatively effect his future with me. When to begin with the whole school issue isn’t an issue at all just a big worry, bc I know the consequences. 
   I know men like to feel manly but the way he says it makes me feel like i always have to be a damsel in distress , bc he tells me he is helping me be more empowered when I don’t need him i want him he is a choice. He didn’t take it well. and mentioned should i go find that with someone else. your all i want to be with. he just wasn’t happy and thinks this relationship is one sided , bc I changed the subject while he was bringing my confidence down about my life , and he has me worried about even talking to him.
   when i talk to him it’s nothing that makes me feel better , cause it’s all too deep and it’s not simple. also i haven’t heard from him since i’ve said that and we got off the phone he just wasn’t happy. i want him to be happy , but i feel like i won’t ever do that for him, it’s hard to confide in him cause he hardly questions how i am doing. my best friend has facetimed me for two nights now. I don’t want to loose him. but i would like him to just trust me , and allow myself to come out without him saying I do something wrong or tells me i’m just getting taken advantage of or thinking for me. or doubting me or telling that he has counted every lie i’ve ever told him. when it’s not easy to just tell him things cause he barely asks about anything unless i bring it up. it’s just so complicated. 

he told me yesterday he would call and didn’t , since he’s been back in town i’ve offered to see him, and something is always up. he just hasn’t been himself. I don’t know what to do from here. I’m scared, and frightened.",04Dec2020,1

Like they’d probably call me a simp (sarcastically tho haha) for hanging out with two girls who have boyfriends. And I do have a struggle with sometimes befriending girls instead of dating them, when I don’t do too great with the ladies to begin with.

I mean one of them has been more tomboyish sort of and I felt like I was hanging out with a homie, but usually it’s just me and her but she brought this one friend that was pretty girly, and I kind of felt like weird about it.

Basically it felt like I went on a girls hangout, and I was always friends the the more laidback one, but the other person decided to come. I’m reallly high right now and having all these existential thoughts of how this is something that’s bad, that I’m just acting deneutered (having no balls) for some reason.

I have seen her sat at her desk quite a few times assumably doing university work (I live in an area dominated by university students) and have seen her looking at me a couple times with a smile but obviously can't take any hint from that as it is probably just human decency. My idea is to leave a note on her window as I walk past on the way home one day when her blinds are drawn saying something like 'you look cute sat at your desk, message me *phone number*' but I don't know if this would come across as a creepy move (even if anonymous).
I'm quite a good looking guy or so I'm told and don't think I'd be any kind of disappointment to her expectations if she was to message me and want to hang out, but I don't know if this is the right approach? Any advice from any source would be helpful, thank you!",04Dec2020,1

But it’s hard to leave because I have a full time job and pay my bills and live “comfortably”. I only walk out with about $100 every two weeks to save. But I can’t imagine living the rest of my life in this town alone, I think about the future and how sad and depressing my life would be if I lived alone like this until I died. 

It’s hard to keep in contact with my family through text and phone calls especially with how busy life is and tbh there’s not much to talk about when you’re not around them. I hate this town, it’s so small and there’s nothing to do. But I also hate my hometown because right before I left I had this huge breakdown (or whatever you wanna call it) and kinda lost my mind for a few months. So now every time I visit home I feel like crap because of the bad memories. I’ve accomplished a lot and have grown a lot since I left. But I feel like I’d be back in the same old rut if I was to move home.

I’ve tried to do online dating to not feel so alone but all that’s done is killed my confidence honestly. It’s really made me feel like I’ll never get with another girl because of how few matches I get. It’s just so hard to give everything up and move home because on paper I’m doing the whole adult thing right but I’m just not happy and don’t want to waste my life alone and waste precious time away from my family.

186,"TW: sexual assault, mentions of drug use
FYI i’m on mobile so sorry for anything and i haven’t really proof read anything so sorry for any mistakes and i was just getting down my thoughts so sorry if anything doesn’t make sense
ok so i know the title sounds really bad, but hear me out. First of all, I always look tobelieve the victim first in all circumstances, but because ive known and experienced this person first hand, there are things i’m beginning to question. For both my and her sakes, I’m going to use a fake name and call her Elle. 
So a few years ago, at my (currently 14F) friends place, Elle (currently 15F) told our group (we were the only ones there) about how her grandfather used to sexually assault her when she was around 4-5 i believe. Now we all felt absolutely horrible about this, because how could someone do that to a child? and don’t get me wrong, i do feel bad about Elles situation - at the time she was in the foster system, as her mum was in rehab for drug use and i never knew anything about her dad. i believe she is now able to live with her mother, although i haven’t kept up to date at all so im not certain. 
Elle told us how anyone she’d told about these incidents (the police, a therapist i believe, etc.) never believed her and said she was lying. i did find this hard to believe but not impossible. None of us knew quite what to say about this, as we were all 10-11 and had no experience with dealing with that sort of situation. We tried to be as kind and comforting as possible. 
Now onto why I question this story. While i feel bad about Elles background, she was one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever known. One day she would be my best friend and another she’d be making me miserable. She always knew exactly how to get under my skin and used that to her advantage, often leaving me crying purely from texts. there was one situation in which she, along with a few others of our group, decided it would be a good idea to introduce me (on instagram) to a girl that had cancer that i was 90% sure was fake (almost 100% certain looking back now) but had enough doubt that they could guilt me into feeling terrible for even suggesting it. 
I currently have Elle blocked on all social medias I have and have no intention of ever getting back in touch. This is due to the ways in which she treated me and not this specific situation. I moved schools around a year after she told us about her grandfather (unrelated to this situation) and only still talk to 1 or 2 of my old friends. However, i have recently been reminded of my old school, and especially some of elles actions and I have been reflecting a lot on my time there. This has led me to begin questioning whether she was telling the truth about this situation or just making up another lie to manipulate us like she had before. i know she’s lived a hard life, but i’m wondering whether she has exaggerated it slightly. 
however, even just typing this makes me feel like a terrible person. who am i if i’m doubting a possible rape victim?? i don’t have any intention to bring this up with anyone else in person and i have never told anyone many parts of this story, but it has been eating at me and i want to know whether it makes me a bad person for even thinking like this.
i can’t quite explain what elle was like through a text post, so it may be hard to express how i fell about this girl, but i hope i’ve done a good enough job in explaining the situation.

Oddly enough, I could have it paid off on Christmas day. 

The thing is though, by doing that, I'll have no presents for my immediate family for Christmas.

He can't drive anymore [unsafe], so I knew he was slipping into depression. I love him to bits, so I thought, two birds. I'm helping him tolerate his new situation, and covering myself for Christmas. ) but I have done nothing for my mom or best freind/roomate.

We went on an extremely special date a few years ago and  *Absolutely out of the blue*  she told me that she kissed one of our mutual friends right before we started dating/were talking. It stung and was really fucking weird/hurtful to randomly bring up but I let it slide because it was before we were official. 

Forward to this last Thanksgiving night. It was a wonderful day that we spent alone together, absolutely perfect. We both got wine drunk and then stoned and crashed into bed where she randomly looked me DEAD in the eyes and said “I cheated on you in 2017”, rolled over and passed out. I didn’t sleep that night and haven’t slept more than 3 hours a night since. I confronted her what she said and she told me that she was just off her meds and was making a joke. A joke. Haha. I then told her how scared I’ve always been about her cheating due to my past and the fact that she kissed our friend (during a time I interpreted as being exclusive). She fucking denied ever telling me that she kissed our friend. 

I’ve been extremely susceptible to gaslighting in the past and I’m horrified that this is what’s happening here because she’s in denial. I can’t eat. My senior finals are next week. I’m in a state of shock still that I can’t shake... which is horrific timing.

201,"I finished high school with some pretty good final exam results, sent some university applications. I haven't got enough points (like 6 on a a scale that goes up to 180) to be into the film production studies, but enough to join studies related to history and tourism. Me, my best friend and a guy I'll be calling John rented and apartment in a city we all would've been studying and moved there.

And here's when the problems begun. Our parents agreed to pay up for the apartment; the costs split into three weren't bad, especially considering the overall quality and location of it. Then, after roughly one mont of studies, John tells us that he moves out in December. We had an argument (not because he decided so, but the way he presented this) and told him, to call his parents and make a manly decision because there's almsot no chance that we would have found someone to replace him and the costs split in two are too big for our parents so it would mean that we all would have to move out. Later that night he said that he stays, but then he travelled back to his hometown, and when he came back he basically took his stuff and moved out  immediately.

Fortunately, our landlord agreed to lower the prices. They are bigger than they used to be, but acceptable for our parents to pay for. But it's not my biggest problem.

The studies, they are just not for me. All the lectures are remote via Teams, and they don't interest me pretty much at all. I chose them with not the passion in my mind, but rather earning money after I graduate. Every day I feel worse becasue I have to sit down behind a notebook for a 4,5 hours and after that I don't do nothing basically (I'm too tired to read a book or even play some video games and there's already dark when i finish so I can't go running or excersise, plus it's cold here and I don't wont to risk my health when there's pandemic all around). I'm not exhausted physically tho, so I also developed some sleep issues.

I would like to find a job. And if the job would be good enough, I would just drop out from the University. I don't have too much expierience, but enough to find *something*. I would like to feel actually tired, to come back to apartment and go asleep. Not to mention earning some money (right now everything I have is money from my parent which I feel stupid to ask for). 

But my parent's, well, they aren't really happy about that. They want me to finish at least first year and they said that if I'd drop out, I would have to pay up for apartment (which I fully understand, and I think it's acceptable), but I worry more about the relations between me and them.

&amp;#x200B;

From what they told me, I treat him like a child because I always look after him by taking him to the bathroom. He's been struggling with hurting himself for a while (he is getting help), and when he goes to the bathroom, I get anxiety/panic attacks because it stresses me out that I know he is hurting himself, and I can't do anything about it. 

I understand that I shouldn't take him to the bathroom (we are both teenagers), but part of me can't deal with the fact that he's in so much pain he has to go to the bathroom multiple times an hour to do things to himself. I want to help him, but by doing so I make him feel like I am controlling him.

I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable or like I'm overpowering him. I've sent him a message online because we aren't able to hang out, and I want to try and fix anything I have done wrong. I've asked him what I can do to make him feel more confident/comfortable and less controlled.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I just wanted to say sorry if I've ever made you feel bad or uncomfortable because of a way I have acted or something I have done. I didn't know what I was doing was controlling towards you, or made you feel babied or childish. I'm sorry if I have negatively affected you or done something that you haven't agreed to. I would never personally want to hurt anyone, including and especially you. I understand that I might be a bit over the top and have tried to look after you too much (if that makes sense).  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to try and make you feel more comfortable around me and I want to mend this issue, so I wanted to ask you what you want me to do to help you feel more comfortable and feel more in control. What is it I can do (or not do) that will help you to be more free. How can I help to make you be who you want to be?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't want our friendship or anything to take a bad hit from this (and if it does, I hope we can get through it), and I want to change my attitude to better suit you, because if it is toxic (as our friend said), I want to change how I act so I am not controlling you.

212,"So I'm 17 and my siblings are both 4 and my parents always hit or slap them when they misbehave no matter how small. They could answer wrong to a question and get hit. It got to the point where they are scared when a hand gets close to them, they flinch and stuff. It's quite hard for me to watch, especially because I was never hit in my childhood. I also tried talking about it with my parents, my mom just straight up says she is not doing it and I'm lying, my dad says he doesn't need advice because I don't have enough experience with kids and I'm too young to ""lecture"" him. But I believe that there genuinely nice people tho. I don't know what to do. I'd appreciate any kind of help.

213,"I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of days ago. If you’re interested l’ve got numerous posts on my profile- short of it is she was mentally and at times physically abusive. I know it was the right decision. 

I’m someone who deals with stuff best by just getting on and keeping moving. I’m obviously allowing myself time to heal, I don’t want to just download tinder and sleep with the first girl I can. However there’s a big hole atm, I keep looking at my phone expecting to see a message- they are just never there.

My ex was also extremely possessive, made me follow girls I’d been friends with for a decade, ones I’d never even kissed. I want to go back to chatting with people, small talk etc. 

I’m also conscious of her. Whatever she may have done to me, I also know she’s a sensitive soul. Our university revolves around the sports club (through which we met). All the sports teams interlink, you are only one step away from anyone else in the club type vibe. If I was to start chatting to someone in the club, she’d find out about it and I don’t want to hurt her.

So my question is- when’s an acceptable amount of time to start getting on with life? When can I go back to chatting to girls etc etc?",04Dec2020,1

216,"Hello, I’m (16F) who is currently living with my brother (20) in our home country. My parents reside in another country and we used to live with them until we left for college. 

My brother moved here 3 years ago and things has been rough ever since. He has a difficult personality; egoistic, selfish, unable to make friends, rude way of talking. However, he can be a fun guy if you can converse well with him. He also neglects religious duties, wakes up in the evening and sleeps at dawn. It’s extremely difficult since he’s my only mode of transport. Moreover, he doesn’t clean or take care of his hygiene and is currently infected with a fungal disease + we found a live cockroach in his room while I helped him tidy it up.

His classmates in his first college bullied him, mainly because they just couldn’t connect with his personality and so he dropped out after the issue went to the department head. 

Now he’s in his second year of college #2 and his personality has become rougher. He entered this college mid way through semester 1 and a month later online classes started so he wasn’t able to make friends. He claims people ignore his messages in the group chat and treat him like an outcast. But from my perspective, I think they’re just either too lazy or busy to reply back. That was the first thing he got triggered about.

Now onto trigger no.2. Long story short, he didn’t attend class for 1 month, got barred from 1 subject and received warning letters from 3 others, haven’t submitted any assignment or done any quizzes, have also never learnt and spends all his time cooped up playing games.

His excuse: “the lecturer always ignores me when I enter class”. I don’t even know how to comprehend that; maybe he wants attention because our parents aren’t here. But our parents have never ignored us; it’s more of him ignoring them. He doesn’t like them controlling him, so they don’t. But when they don’t control him, he thinks they’re neglecting him. He wanted a car, he got one. He wanted to raise his allowance, he received an extra 200. It obviously sounds like he’s spoiled but he doesn’t release it himself.. He doesn’t know how hard our dad is working finding money in another country and how depressed my mom is from all the problems he caused. Yesterday, my mom and I talked about what to do with him and we cried our eyes out. It has been so rough on my mom and my dad doesn’t even know all of this. My mom wants to keep it a secret from him as she knows my dad will react harshly so she’s been trying to resolve it for months now. 

I’m tired of taking care of him, like a damn maid. But I do it because it’s the only way I can help my mom. His results last sem was horrible and i don’t even know if he can pass this sem. My mom doesn’t know what to do with him. We can’t just throw him in the streets and if she takes away his gaming, he might act up and become even more aggressive. He loves aviation so he’s currently studying a degree in aviation but it looks like he lost all will to study. He doesn’t care anymore and once, I heard him say “I want to forget the world and be by myself.” He has never spoken up about his feelings so I’m worried he might do something bad to others or himself. 

Please help. Thank you for your time.",04Dec2020,1
217,"This is my first time posting on Reddit so I apologize if I say anything wrong.

Last night I confronted one of my best female friends (I trust this girl with everything) about why she had been distant with me ( I already knew why but I just wanted the closure of her telling me) and she returned saying that she had lied to me previously about her relationship, and and she told her new boyfriend about me and how me and her were really close and I guess he perceived me as a threat and made her stop talking to me.. so after finding this out, I kind of just let out all my emotions on her (I'm not an emotional guy I actually hate people seeing me like that) and then ended on telling her ""goodbye. I will always be here if you need me"" but I didn't really mean the goodbye, it was just a cry for help and now I fear that I've lost her forever and that's all I've been able to think about.

I'm genuinely for for someone just to tell me blunt on what I should do because I honestly don't want to lose her.

Also because I assume her boyfriend is controlling and she is very loyal to him now, she doesn't reply back to any of my messages for like a week and if she does, it's like I'm talking to a brick wall. It has been this way since they started dating sadly and that's what gave it away.

I didn't recognize the person that got hit itself, Basically there were 2 paths and in the middle of those paths is a train track. But on both paths there is like a fence too prevent someone from getting on the train track. so the guy i saw in my dreams climbed over it and the moment he looked too the left the train hit him and after the train left i saw his body parts and lotta blood all over the place.

**- I dreamed about getting beaten up.**

Also this time i didnt recognize anyone. basically what happend, it was at midnight and I was on the train station alone, a group of ppl 5 to be exact all in black clothing shouted at me but i did'nt reply next thing i know i was laying on the ground getting beat up. than someone hit my head and  i woke up with a headache.

221,"My husband (29m) and myself(26f) live in an apartment complex. Over the past few months, my neighbour (80F), who lives alone has been suffering from worsening dementia.

It started out with her bringing home a bag of apples everytime she went to the shops (because she would forget that she had apples at home), leaving her with piles of apples. It progressed. 

Being the young ""tech savvy"" neighbours, she would in the past come to us maybe once a month to help her (online banking, fixing her cable etc) but recently it has become nearly a daily event. Huge tears, panic attacks, saying how she can't remember anything.

A few days ago she called me to her flat because she keeps running out of electricity. I got in contact with her son (about 55 years old) and tried to fix her electricity problem as well as express my concern about her. 

Yesterday, after she had another breakdown, my husband sent a message to the son again about her physical health and mental health, and he deflected saying that it is because she has electricity problems. 

This morning we find out that she had turned her underfloor heating on (we live in South Africa, and it's almost summer) and forgotten it on, hence the electricity consumption. 

I messaged the son and asked if I could turn the stove off at the switch board as she receives meals on wheels and therefore does not need to use the stove. I'm so concerned that she burns the apartment complex down because of her memory. 

He told me I shouldn't turn the stove off, and that the electricity situation is sorted. 
What can I do? 
She is putting many families at risk- and her son shows no indication of moving her to a more appropriate living placement. We are also leaving to spend time with family in a different province and won't be home to help her for about a month.

224,"No guilt, no shame, no happiness, no sadness, no anger, I'm just so dull. The way my country works is that at the end of middle school you have the choice to take a specific series of tests, and if you get a certain grade or above at the total you go to a specific type of school, I wan the only one in my middle school who succeeded, and the only one out of 96 in my whole state, (high school in here starts at 16), so I should maintain the success I have, but I just don't care, my grades are the worst grades in my whole class and I didn't shed any tear, or fee any guilt, I didn't even say to myself ""I need to work harder"" because I literally don't care.

226,"(TL;DR included at bottom of post)

I (17F) have been struggling with depression since I was about eleven years old. It's always been this cloud hanging over my head, but lately it's been at an all time high. For me, it manifests itself in a lot of different ways. I feel empty and just generally low much of the time, I get spurts of unwarranted anger and lash out and my parents and siblings, I constantly overeat (resulting in a massive weight gain over the past couple years), I'm overly emotional, and find myself crying often, sometimes randomly, because of feelings of self-hatred or neglect or the general ""my life is so shitty."" I've even had some suicidal thoughts, though I'd never act o. them. And lately most of all, I have a total lack of energy and motivation. When I was still in therapy (started going to first therapist in Spring 2019, went for a few months then stopped; started going to my second therapist in fall 2019, stopped in Spring 2020 because of Covid safety- still haven't been back), I mentioned to my therapist that it often felt like there was a literal weight on my chest when I was laying down in my bed, like it was holding me down there and I physically couldn't get up. It still feels like that all these months later. I can't walk my dog, I can't do homework, I can't shower or brush my teeth or hair, I can't wash laundry or clean my room. My room has gotten filthy lately: clothes and shoes and art supplies piled up, dirty cups and dishes literally growing mold on my desk, etc. And it's to the point where it's taking a serious toll on my hygiene as well. It's disgusting to admit, but I genuinely don't remember the last time I brushed my teeth. I think it was sometime before Thanksgiving. I just can't find the energy or motivation or willpower.
I only have school on Thursdays and Fridays (Covid- I have online school the rest of the week), so I literally shower once a week on Wednesday night, just because I have to be showered for school. I also only brush my hair on Wednesdays, again out of necessity, and it usually takes three plus hours. I have incredibly long, thick hair, and it mats into large clumps from me laying in bed all week. I usually have to put conditioner or shea butter in it while brushing just to get it to budge at all. Last night I timed myself and it took three hours and nineteen minutes.
Anyway, my life has been absolutely miserable lately because of my depression and the ways it's impacted my life.
My parents have done their best in helping me deal with it, but neither of them has dealt with this kind of thing personally, so I think it's really hard for them to understand. But they're trying. My mom was actually the one who suggested I try therapy in the first place. She's also offered to wash and fold my laundry for me, just to make stuff a little easier on me, and it's been really nice to not have to worry about.
Anyway, my mental health is not improving, and I don't think it will any time soon- not on its own. Back when I was in therapy, I did notice myself doing slightly better (my therapist and I developed a simple nighttime routine for me to keep up with my hygiene, and other stuff like that), but nothing significant or incredibly helpful. I'm ready and more than willing to go back to therapy whenever Covid dies down a bit and it's safe to do so, but I need a solution now, and I think I need to go on antidepressants. I'm not living my life right now. I'm not enjoying anything. I'm spending my time laying in ben sobbing or eating or sleeping and feeling completely miserable. I need help. Since I live at home right now, some stuff has been manageable, but I'll be living on my own in college soon, and I won't have parents there to help me with my laundry or remind me to brush my hair, etc. I need to be in a better headspace before I'm able to live alone and support myself.
Here's the problem: my parents really don't want to medicate me. They mentioned this to my old therapist once. So I don't know how they'll respond when I tell them it's what I want. I'm worried they'll try to preach to me about the negatives of antidepressants and encourage me to go back to therapy instead.
So how do I go about telling my parents that I think I need antidepressants, and convincing them that it's what's best for me?
Additionally, if anyone has advice on how to better manage depression while unmedicated, I would really appreciate it.

TL;DR:
I (17F) have been depressed for years, but it's recently gotten much worse and I think the best option for me is to go on antidepressants. My parents don't want me to go on meds, and expressed this to my old therapist once last year, but I think I need them. How do I go about asking my parents and convincing them that this is a necessary step for me?",04Dec2020,1
227,"This 18 years old girl is some kind of YouTuber with 200k followers, she doesn't tell much about her financial status but she seems to belong to the upper middle class based on her house furniture, car, clothes variety and lots of other info that I've gathered about her throughout these years. She looks beautiful, she is a talented makeup artist and more important than all of these, she is extremely nice and polite. I knew her since she was 14, the way she talks and behaves in her videos, her choice of words and her mindset have always been far superior to vast majority of teenagers out there. Maybe it's because of her middle class status and the fact that she has always been in private schools and she has good parents who taught her manners and adopted her like this. 


What makes it more strange and interesting is that I'm from middle east, I'm not anywhere close to her. She lives in US, Ohio. It might sound weird but it's not unrealistic. I'd do whatever it takes to go there and meet her. I've talked to her a lot through Instagram comments, she is way too nice to me just like she is to everyone else. But I know how to make her talk so our conversations are usually longer. But before telling her anything about my true intentions, I want to surprise her with something. Something big, an offer that she wouldn't refuse. Despite her having a decent life, she has a huge wishlist on amazon which costs thousands of dollars. Clothes, digital devices, jewelry and a lot more. 

Imagine how happy and thankful she would be if I buy every single item in her wishlist. She already likes me or at least has a positive view on me. Doing that would make her actually love me, she will be convinced that I'm the man worthy of being with her and then I will try to talk about the real deal.

The two of us were drunk and we ended up sleeping together in my room. Had a really nice chat afterwards and she stayed over. She left me on read on Snapchat for a day and I gave up, she then sent me a snap asking if she could come over. I accepted because why not? She came over and shared some personal issues she was dealing with and she stayed over. We didn’t have sex that night I just didn’t think she was in the over mind set for it. She ended up coming over 3 more times to stay over until she had to quarantine before she went home. She’s said that I’m the only guy she’s come back to from a one night stand and that she’s never been in a relationship before. She also said she isn’t good at texting and doesn’t use Snapchat all that much. We kept talking over Snapchat while she’s quarantined and she is definitely better at it now.

So before I start ill give you some details:

19 years old. Around 5'6-5'7. Male. I take lamotrogine (due to epilepsy). I dont smoke or drink alcohol. I Have epilepsy, a peanut allergy and OCD.

When I was younger I would eat anything. Vegtables, fruit, anything. But when I was 3 I was scolded and afterwards I started to become a lot more picky (I know this sounds odd. It does to me too. I dont know why it happened.)

Fast forward to now and I can only eat the same old foods. Burgers, Pizza, sausage rolls. Basically just junk food.

If I try to eat anything new, even if I like the taste and would eat it again, I cant swallow it. I throw it back up. I have no idea why. Its been like this for ages and I really want to get it sorted out.

I forgot to mention. When I was younger my parents gave me a peanut butter sandwich. This is the first time I remember this sort of thing happening. I spat it out (because i didnt like it) only to find out i was allergic to peanuts afterwards. I dont know if that could be related to it..?

236,"Alright kiddies. Before we start, for obvious reasons this is a throwaway account. Why? Because I have friends and family that are very active on reddit, and I seriously don't know if they would be estactic about what I did.

So... let's start from the beginning. 
I'm a 29 year old dude who just got of work. Corona is at a all time high, so lets just say I have to work a little overtime at my job. Essential worker thing, if you get my drift. So It's around 11:00 PM, just got of work and I'm heading home, It's early cold December, so It's starting to snow- alot. So as I'm walking towards the bus-stop, I actually didn't even notice the  body on the floor. Until I hear a cough. I turn around and their she is, some fucking girl on the side of the street. 

So, I'm confused because of the obvious, ""Why the fuck is their a child on the street in the middle of the night?"" So, I stop in my tracks and just look at her. Wondering if she was even alive. So I just ask the kid if she's okay, she doesn't talk much and nods yes. She looks like a 8- 11 year old girl, so I ask where her parents are. According to her, they just ditched her. Told her to wait their and never came back, she doesn't even know where the hell they live and she's been in this spot for 2 days, living off food of the kindness of passerbyers. So a few thoughts go through my head. 

One: This could be some runaway kid, who ran away from home.
Two: Could be a entire beggar group and their using a child to get them money, which is kinda fucked up. 
Three: Maybe she got lost and exxagerated, but it's the middle of the night.

It's really cold at the country I'm in. So I wasn't heartless enough to consider leaving her their. I have morals. So I just ask if she wants somewhere warm to stay in, she nods yes and I take her to my place. As weird as that might sounds to some people, I just can't walk away. It would be immoral. I let her take a shower, get a nice pair of small clothes that were previously my little sister's and now she's asleep on my couch. It just dawned on me what I did, and in my  bedroom I'm typing this out. What the fuck do I do now? This is unbelievable- Do I call child protective services? Put her into the messed up foster care system? I have the funds to take care of a child, but not sure if that would be even legal, I don't even know where her parents are! I just need some help.

237,"Long story short. I'm 24, she's 22, we've had issues but they were always trumped by the good times and laughs. We dated for 5 years and everything was awesome. Because of covid whe felt alone and she has abandonedment issues from childhood trauma.

I messed up and didnt make her a priority in my life in her time of need so she broke up with me. Days later we wanted to talk about things and she told me that she slept with another guy who she previously told me not to worry about.

She was sad, they were both drunk, he was there, and they hooked up. She told me that she felt like she cheated on me and regretted it immediately.

This exact situation has happened in a previous relationship before and in that past relationship, it was over right then and there for me. I blocked her and never talked to her again.

But this time it's different. This time I don't feel mad at her and I don't feel like it's ENTIRELY her fault. I messed up and did not prioritize her which made her feel alone and that is, as a boyfriend, my job and i failed her.

Now I am at the point with this girl where I genuinely do not care that she slept with this other guy because thw important part to me is my future with her. Call me a simp but I don't care what she did but it still bothers me.

What can I do to help myself not be bothered by the fact that she slept with another guy, or am I selfish/shallow/incorrect for trying to feel this way.

I love her, nothing else matters to me other than my future with her. I am working on fixing things with her and I am optimistic that we can work things out. But I don't want this one instance to loom over us.",04Dec2020,1
238,"Sometimes I believe that the only reason I'm not happy, is because a part of me thinks I'm not worth of it. 

I know the things that will make me paranoid, depressed and anxious, but I can't stop doing them. I keep watching bad news even knowing they will make me depressed. I keep mindless scroling throught social media, even knowing that I will be completely tired and feel empty inside. 

I don't even do the things that really make me happy, because I fear not feeling it, or at least, not feeling like I used before.

244,"Hi, first time poster! i would love to hear some fresh perspectives about this problem I'm having...

me and one of my best friends (9 years of friendship, basically feels like family) are both digital artists, and we are working on a few projects together, like a comic, trying to make some songs, and our long term project is to be able to make a phone rhythm game like love live! or bandori. all with the OC's we have made together.

Yesterday we were talking about the game and the topic of making outfits for the characters cards came up, and since I've told her before i don't celebrate Halloween, i went ""maybe we could make season inspired outfits, since i don't do well with spooky time, and to be fair we can do just winter instead of Christmas"" (i absolutely love Christmas, my friend dislikes it) They said that's why they leave the writing/creative part to me, they just want to draw, so i can see if any topic makes uncomfortable and want to take it out. i thanked them for always being this patient and understanding with me, i truly feel blessed to have them. it's just this time they responded with ""no, i don't understand you at all, i just don't care""

well, that really made me feel weird in a bad way. and then they ghosted me for the rest of the day, even jumped off a discord call with our friend group when i joined. they seemed  uncomfortable with my presence... then we sent some memes and they responded one liner texts like at 2 am.
all of this made feel real guilty, like I've made them angry or upset, when that wasn't my intention at all.

the thing with me and Halloween, is that well, I've been a Christian for a few years now, my family always have been. when i was little i absolutely hated the church, but in my teens i found myself being happy in it.
i don't think (i hope not!) I've been the pushy Christian friend who tries to shove it down your throat, i just try to respond truthfully on how happy it has made me to believe when my friends ask.
they always seem weirded out tho.
(they don't belive but i don't mind, love them either way).

 i have never ever celebrated this day, i know people enjoy it, and i respect them fully!  
i just don't feel right doing it myself, and that's why it would rub me the wrong way to make Halloween themed anything for the game... anything that has to do with the occult i just nope out of there real fast! (it really scares me, even if it is cartoony).

so i guess the advice I'm looking for is how i can talk to them in a way that won't upset them and make them feel worse... i love my friend dearly and this project is our biggest dream since we were kids, but i don't want to do something like this that makes me feel this way...

245,"The girlfriend of an ex-friend visited my LinkedIn profile, which she found, according to the analytics, by looking at someone else’s profile (there is this feature called “people also viewed”). 

The problem is, earlier this year, this woman forbade us from talking because she was jealous. She called me (even if we didn’t know each other), saying I bother her and that she wants to be left alone (though the ex-friend and I weren’t even in the same country). 

So I blocked both of them on Fb/Messengers and that was it. But I discovered that before our call she was sending me texts on Fb, deleting them, blocking and unblocking me so I don’t see them. I didn’t think much of it.

However, we’re on a Fb group where she can’t see my content because she is blocked, but she “likes” other people’s comments that directly address me and disagree with me. I happen to know these people so they told me.

Cuz I live next to an elementary school and the kids play soccer ALOT and their soccer ball comes into our backyard ALOT and they either climb the fence over to our house and get it themselves or they ring our doorbell. The reason why it is so frustrating is because my grandma is always home and they always come ring the doorbell multiple times at like 6 or 7 in the morning while everyone is asleep and my grandma has trouble sleeping. Sometimes its during their recess which i find completely mind blowing that the teachers let elementary kids walk out of the school to ring our doorbell to get their ball.

252,"There is a TL;DR version at the bottom. This version is too long, sorry for the rant. 

Growing up I (26F) was extremely close with my 2 younger cousins. My grandparents lived with my uncle (dad’s brother) and my parents took me to his house multiple times a week and spent almost every weekend at their place. There is literally no childhood memory of mine without my grandparents, my aunt, uncle and my two younger cousins. It is a common practice in my country to call your cousins your siblings and I literally just referred to them as my brothers that anybody listening in on my conversation without context would I assume that they’re my younger brothers. 

Suffice to say like how all good things come to an end, my dad and my uncle got into a squabble which was very very nasty. I was about 19 or 20 and my younger brothers (let’s call them S and V) were still teenagers. I was very close with them and even if I wasn’t visiting them as often as I used to because of college, I still talked to them pretty regularly on the phone. Their parents kept the children out of the squabble but I was very much involved in everything that was happening in this fight. Though I was not a participating member I knew what the fight was about and how my dad and uncle treated each other. My brothers just knew our parents were fighting but they didn’t know what it was about. 

Cut to 2 years later (yes the Cold War went on for about 3 years in total) S was just going to start college and he was going through some tough times. When I say we’re really close I mean like I literally used to treat him like my child and took care of any need he might have. He called me up and said he wants to visit me for a couple of days because it was getting overwhelming for him. Just the weekend before S could come, my uncle said something that crossed the line and I was deeply hurt. I had a lot of pent up angst and frustration and I really wanted to be left alone. I called up S and asked him not to come because I was dealing with things. 

I had my pity party going on for weeks before I reached out to him and he was livid with me. He was so angry with me because he felt like I abandoned him when he needed me the most. I feel like an asshole for doing that to him but I had no idea. I’m genuinely sorry for what had happened and did not mean to hurt him. To make things worse I left the country around the time things were getting better in my family. 

Everyone got together and reconciled to a certain extent but S is still mad at me. I have literally groveled for his forgiveness and I don’t know what to do. My uncle passed away very recently and it was a wake up call for me. I really want to be there for S. I still talk to my aunt and other brother quite regularly and I check up on him. 

I know I love S dearly and I want to establish a relationship with him. I understand that he doesn’t want to do so anymore. But I cannot shake this feeling and because I don’t want to abandon him. It’s been 4 years since we last spoke cordially. He’s only 23 now and I thought he’d be over his teenage angst and accept my apology but he hasn’t. 

Basically I’m looking for advice that will either fix my relationship with my brother or coping mechanisms to accept defeat. 

TL;DR version: Was really close with my cousin but had a falling out due to a problem in the family. He(23M) felt like I(26F) abandoned him while I had no idea what he was going through. Its been 4 years and I’ve asked for forgiveness at multiple occasions and he’s still not forgiven me. Any advice on how I can reconcile with him?",04Dec2020,1

255,"I think we all have these feelings to one extent or another. I guess I've just been struggling with feeling confident or satisfied with everything I've done in the last couple of years. I began a journey of self improvement around the time I was 12-15 where I pushed my body and mind to the limit. I made  sure to go to the gym, not miss workouts, take extra classes and test out when possible, doing this allowed me graduate college and highschool a year early (finished by  20) and eventually apply to medical school. In doing so I also built and maintained  a great physique and good strength (like 95th percentile of male lifters in my weight class), however despite all this, despite making sure I do everything right, I'm still disappointed in myself for the hiccups I experienced early on in life/early in life.  I'm also still mad at myself for not being more social and never really making many friends. 

It feels like this is the story of my life, where I've felt alone for the last ten years, and just focus on myself. I was never invited to parties, or have people invite me to hangout. It's just been me this whole ride here. Now if you were to ask me if I were to trade my success for these desires I would say no a million times out of a million, however the thoughts linger. 

 I'm not depressed or anything just disappointed with how things have ended up. I want this feeling to pass by but it's always here. I think moving and going to medical school would change that, but maybe not. Perhaps it's my mindset.

256,"I’m putting an eating disorder trigger warning here because I don’t want to upset anyone.

I (F17) struggled with an eating disorder when I was 14 until I was 15. I lost 35 pounds and my lowest weight was 101lbs. I am 105.6lbs now, but it was something that I really struggled with. Mainly because of insecurities about my weight, but I grew out of it because when I lost the weight I felt more confident about myself and my body. People gave me compliments and loving attention that I wanted. It made me feel terrible, because I hated that it felt like my weight defined my worth, but it felt nice for people to think I was attractive. To this day, people still tell me I’m one of the prettiest people they know.

I don’t know what’s happened to me, but I’ve noticed recently I’ve been starting to count my calories and restrict myself again. My doctors tell me I’m underweight and I say I’ll fix it or work on it, but I’m so scared of gaining weight. My ED has always been in the back of my mind and still affects me, but just not as severely as before.

I know I should tell someone but the evil thoughts in my brain is scared that if I get help then I will gain weight and I have no idea what to do. I am so stuck. Logically I know I need to tell someone, and that I might hurt myself by restricting myself further, but my fear of gaining weight is so prominent in my life.

I have some messy drama going on in my life that is not caused by me, and it out of control. It’s pretty bad and I do not like drama, it gives me bad anxiety. I have been panicky and my heart has been racing and I’ve been wanting to cry ever since the drama erupted.

It’s definitely something that cannot be resolved anytime soon. It’s pretty serious. I just want to forget about it for the time being and be more relaxed. I genuinely didn’t do anything wrong and I don’t think anything too bad will come of it, it’s just the idea of what happened and what was said and how it might continue in the future. The said person will always ‘be around’ per-say.

261,"one of my cousins (who is almost like a best friend to me) is super irresponsible. she's 20, and goes out with so many different people every week. everyone in our family didn't like it, but her mom (my aunt) doesn't care. not even exaggerating, she's probably seen over 100 different people and friends during quarantine (she doesn't like to wear a mask around them, they share vapes/drinks, hookup w her, etc).

about a week ago, she told me she had tested positive for covid (which wasn't a surprise to me at all), but she said she's had it for 2-3 weeks now, and her symptoms are gone. my aunt continued to let her go out and see all these different people (even though in her region, they're supposed to be in lockdown). the most ironic part is that the guy who spread covid to her, invited a bunch of people (including her) to his apartment for his birthday.

my aunt decided not to tell anyone in the family (except my cousin told me, but my aunt doesn't know), which i wouldn't have a problem with, if it weren't for the fact that she was coming over tonight.

today is my sister's 10th birthday, and in my region, we are allowed to gather with 10 people indoors. my parents are super freaked about covid, so we will be in the garage, all wearing masks and hopefully distancing, with my parents, sister, grandparents, cousins, and aunt/uncle (which is 10 people). in the past when the covid numbers were low (like july-august), we would often have family gatherings with the 10 of us, no masks, no distancing, outside, pretty care free.

the issue im having here is although my cousin is symptomatic, there is still a small possibility that she could potentially spread it to someone else. my grandparents will be there, and it would absolutely destroy me if they (or any of my other family members) got covid because of her. 

ive talked to her about how she could spread it to them, and she said ""you need to stop talking about it, ive heard it from my parents for the last 3 weeks"". then she goes on to play victim about how IM the one being mean to her, but she can't even take responsibility for her actions, and still thinks its okay to see her friends/regular hookup ppl!

im complemplating on whether or not i should tell my parents about her diagnosis, because although it is the safest option, it would rip apart my relationship with my cousin, and my mom's relationship with her sister. i just cant help thinking that if one of us were to potentially die because of my cousin's recklessness, my sister would live with that guilt for the rest of her life, that her birthday was the event that killed someone in our family.",04Dec2020,1

265,"Alright here’s my story so basically I sit in a teacher classroom during lunch and been doing since day 1. But a month ago there’s this group of girls coming to lunch because they found out they were allowed in (usually your not allowed because of COVID-19). I didn’t talk to them much because I had nothing to say but about a week ago I’ve started to get to know 2 of them because the rest decided to do other stuff for lunch. Anyway 1 of those girls I’ve been I guess “getting to know her” for about a week which was fine. But yesterday she did something unexpected. We were walking towards our individual classes and like as we walked she started to try annoying me (didn’t work because it really didn’t bother me) and I asked her why she likes to annoy me. She said that because you won’t do anything (which is true I guess because I really didn’t do anything). So she became bold and like locked our arms together and said that even if she lock our arms I won’t do anything and again I didn’t. We basically walked while we were both really close together and then like as we about to part ways she said I smell good and stuff. I lowkey think this was weird because we recently got to know eachother for about a week.

Today, we were in class eating lunch and then like we started to just look at each other and talking without saying a word by just like swaying or head and nodding, stuff like that. In all honestly I though she was just being weird and acting her normal self. But after we left to go our separate class and then I asked her “how are you going to annoy me today” then she locked our arms again and then proceed to say “this will be our thing for now on”. I asked her “does she do this will anyone else” jokingly. She said “No, your the only person.” I said “don’t I feel special”. She said “you should”. Then we parted ways. Idk if she is trying to act friendly or genuinely interested in me.

My question is basically is she just acting friendly or does it really mean something else? Also a side question that I don’t really need answer to but could use your guys opinion. I know her Snapchat @ but should I search her and add her because a friend told me about it or should I ask her directly (I feel like an idiot asking about this one)

273,"Hi all,

I’m dealing with a lot of fallout in my life due to what the PRTG has done to my mind for years now. I’ve been looking online for information about anybody else who has had this problem, but I can’t find anything. I think they’re removing it. Any other victims of the psychometric loading and conditioning process - how do you deal with it? I’m trying to move on and live a normal life, but it’s so hard to leave it behind. Any advice would be great. Thanks.",04Dec2020,1
274,"Hello all I’m really looking for some advice here. I moved into this apartment in May and my neighbors constantly argue. It’s not just a quick spurt of anger but loud “F*CK YOU’s” and every other curse word under the sun. It’s slamming doors and stomping. At one point I even thought it was getting physical a few times. I contacted my apartment manager and they said they can’t do anything about it and I need to call the police. I felt a little uncomfortable with calling the police because I wasn’t completely sure if it was physical and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. But at the same time, if it is being physical maybe I could be saving someone’s life. I lost my aunt to domestic violence so I’m very sensitive to the possibility. 

After another very loud argument and strange noises I called the non emergency line and got transferred to the police. I’m not sure if anything really happened. But they were quiet for a few months instead of their usually monthly or biweekly arguments. They recently starting picking back up. They’ve been arguing for the past three nights straight. I woke up at 4am on Tuesday, 3am Wednesday, and 2am last night to extremely loud yelling, slamming and undetectable noises. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m concerned about their safety and now I’m concerned about my sleep. It all just sucks. If anyone has any advice that would be really great. Thanks so much.",04Dec2020,1

277,"First time poster and obligatory apologies for mobile formatting. I’ve (20) just moved back home for the break and my relationship with my brother (16) is stronger than ever. I love that he can come to me for advice and I helped him get his girl too. Some context is that I’m the more academic and leadership kid and he is the more sporty kid. We’re becoming more transparent with each other and I learnt of some of his ‘extracurriculars’.  It was a huge shock for me to find out he had a lowkey nicotine addiction for a month before he lost his vape AND he smokes weed once a month. Since when did my baby brother do shit like this?! Now I’d be a complete hypocrite if I banned him from any of this because it’s not like I haven’t tried these things myself. I am personally just not a fan of regular usage of any of this stuff so it makes me feel iffy and I feel he is too young. Last night at 3am I accidentally caught him after he snuck out and he told me that his friend was going through a tough time. Mum and dad are literally the best and super chill that I’ve never had to sneak out growing up and they’ve always been rather lenient provided we keep up our grades and are responsible. I’m just shocked he would pull this shit considering our parents are pissed at him for not studying hard during his exam period which is now over. I’ve just earned my “cool sister brownie points” which I want to maintain so he will always feel safe coming to me and I guess exam season is over so he does get more freedom but I don’t think that excuses him sneaking out. On one hand I understand he’s being a good friend but on the other, he’s young and he should be following the household rules. I admit I’m an overprotective sister and probably a bit uptight but I can’t help but worry. I literally could not sleep till he got home so I don’t know if anyone else has ever dealt with these kind of worries but how do I ease my mind in future when stuff like this happens?",04Dec2020,1

I told my mother about it and she was had mixed feelings since I would have to move away. I am definitely worried since she can't speak English and depends on me for help with translations. I'm still in the interview process with another company that would pay me about 15K less (based off of Glassdoor estimations), but this one is about 30 mins out from where I live. Fortunately I don't have any college debt since my tuition was paid off by scholarships each year, so money isn't the biggest issue but the 15K difference is a lot.

But yeah I miss the guy I want him as a friend but I’d also wanna flirt a little the class accuse him of liking me and me not liking him back but I do like him back he tries to keep it on the low low but when it’s night the texting begins and stuff just gets really real I opened up to him and actually felt comfortable not “I wanna end this conversation somebody kill me kill me now” 

There’s this other guy I used to like not anymore but I think he might think I still like him when I try to show that I like him he probably thinks that I’m using him just to make the other guy jealous. How do I show to him that I’ve completely let go of the other guy and that I really really really like him I don’t want him to have doubts about me. I wanna flirt but I’d seem desperate (which I am) but I’d lose my dignity my value for being a girl who flirts

291,"Hello, I'm totally a cat person and I've waited my hole life to adopt my own. Thing is, it's kind of disappointing... 
I chose her because even though she wasn't my ""dream"" cat, she was described as very affectionate and hug lover, and this is all I ever really wanted from a cat. Turns out she absolutely isn't ? She never asks to be pet, doesn't like to cuddle, never ever comes on anyone's lap. She is 7 months old, so it could be a phase. But here is the main thing : sometimes she's really cute, sometimes I just want to kiss and hug her etc, but I feel no connection between us. We baby sitted a cat for a week before getting her, and I had a better connection with him in a week than her in a month. And she will probably be my only cat for 15 years or so, and I don't feel like waiting for 2 years for me and her to finally bond. Other cats, I could always feel like I would connect to them when we were getting along, and since she's my cat, I'm supposed to feel even more connected to her, like I have a special bond. 


So I know I can find her a loving home that's for sure, but I'm a very indecisive person, and part of me still has affection for her. I just feel like I should connect more with her, and that she isn't suited for my lifestyle (I'm always home and could use a support animal, and give it love in return. But she doesn't want affection)

292,"I'm pretty young (19) and I just have no clue what to do. I want to get into the film industry for a career, it's the one thing I'm super passionate about. And I also want to take a few years and travel around the world nomad style. Those are the dream goals for me. But right now I feel like I'm stuck at a shitty job with no realistic way to get to my goals sometime soon. 

I got fucked by my counselor in high school, she told me I didn't have to take the SAT to get into a CSU (California state university). Which was just flat out a lie, but was too late when I figured that out. So after high school I couldn't go to anything other than a community college, and I hated school in general so I dropped out. 

Right now I work at usps as a mailman, and I make pretty good money, but I work literally 13 hours a day 6 days a week. And that's killing me physically, mentally, etc.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to work every second of my life just for a glimmer of hope that I might be able to do what I want in life someday. That's too much of a depressing thought. School? Wont guarantee me a job or place in the film industry and might leave me in a worse position than I am now. 

I'm thinking about buying and renting out a few houses for a passive income, but I'm not sure I'd make enough to be able to fund myself, film or travel.

I feel so hopeless in life. Is this job really all my life is going to amount to? I don't want it to but I don't see a realistic way to achieve my outlandish goals. To make it worse my dog and absolute best friend in the world is getting older, and my greatest fear is having to live without him someday.

294,"So I hold a Christmas party every year for my friends as we've been close since we were kids. My Wife hates this girl that is best friends with my buddy's wife. This girl, we'll call her Susan, is very loud, very obnoxious, and she seemingly goes out of her way to try to prove people wrong. 

I don't have an issue with her personally, I barely talk to her. However, my wife can't stand her. I think what really set her off was when she was over last time my wife warned susan not to pick up one of our cats. This specific cat wasn't keen on being picked up. Susan decided to do it anyway and was rubbing it in my wife's face that he was letting her. 2 seconds later her neck was dripping blood cause he attacked her. 

Fast forward a year later and we didn't invite this individual, Susan's friend who is my friend's wife asked me if she was invited. I haven't responded  yet, I spoke to my wife and said, ""they're massively unpredictable, I think suffering through one Christmas party is better than a potential blow up."" She mentioned that it's her house and she can decide who can come. Which is 100% fair, and susan isn't liked by the majority of the friend group anyway so I get where she's coming from.

297,"Hey!

So, as the title says, my mom just scheduled a trip. During a pandemic. To fucking Belize. Without telling me until it was too late. (For context, I live in Austin, Texas. Belize is a long way away.)

If I didn't live with her, that wouldn't be as much of a personal problem, but unfortunately I only turned 18 yesterday and so she bought me a ticket without telling me. I hate family trips, and she knows that. Plus, again, there's a literal pandemic going on. Needless to say, I'm not thrilled about going.

My mom is acting like I'm the crazy one for not wanting to go, and she just keeps talking about how incredible the trip is going to be. It does sound pretty magical, but I'd rather stay home where I don't risk contracting COVID. Plus, we're supposed to leave the day after Christmas, so this was pretty sudden. She made me call off work already, and I just... I don't know how to tell her I'm not going.

I've never liked family trips, but I figured since I was still a kid, I couldn't refuse. But now that I'm 18, I don't have to go, right? I don't want to go. My aunt, who lives with us, seems really jealous, and I'd happily trade places with her. The only problem is that she has two young daughters who also live with us (they're not even 2 yet). I could maybe see if she'd be willing to go instead of me, and I would stay home and watch the babies with my grandmother. 

How do I say no? I need a solid argument if I'm going to be telling my mom, because she never listens to me when I do this kind of stuff.

301,"I'm (22m) living at home with my family. My family consists of 2 girls and my mother who is getting older now. Anyone who says ""just move out"" I would clearly love to but working on a minimum wage job while furloughed means moving out is not an option at the moment.

The problem is that they are constantly changing things in the house, putting in new carpets, swapping furniture's from room to room and because the family has 2 girls that aren't strong enough and my mother who is becoming to frail to do any of this, it is always left to me to do. 

A basic conversation will go like this with my mother, 

Me: ""What's that?"" Her: ""paint and wallpaper"" Me: ""What for??"" Her: ""The living room."" Me: ""You just decorated the living room about 6 months ago??"" Her: ""Yea, but it doesn't really feel like me, you know?"" Me: "" . . . "" Her: ""Can you move everything out of the living room and paint, or are you gonna stay on your computer all day?""

Also keep in mind that I am on my computer managing my investments that I have made while also doing work for courses. But because my mom is older now they all make me feel guilty and if I decline they will scream curses at me and tell me to move out despite me paying rent already to live here...

I liked him and went for it, he voiced his concerns etc but I talked to him more and he got over it. We started being sexual over text but I made it clear that i didnt want a relationship and were planning to meet up after I turned 18. 
He was taking too long to reply every time and my excitement wore of because of it, i stopped trying so much and we didnt talk for some days. I started thinking that this isnt what I imagined it to be and last time we talked I voiced my doubts. He went off saying how what I did hurt him and how his whole perception of me changed because of it. Yesterday we talked on the phone and he said that he really cared for me and didnt text me much cause he didnt want to seem pushy about things. Basically completely turned the narrative around to make it seem like he cared so much and I hurt him, he even said this was one of his worst experiences with a relationship and how he was feeling so bad about it. He ended up saying he doesnt know if he's gonna feel okay towards me at some point in the future and we hang up. I even said sorry to this man for not thinking it through before I made my move. He also apologized for going off so hard the other day and said he had drunk a bit that night.

I feel like shit today. I was hurt by how he was acting and ignoring me and this is why I chose to stop this and now he turned it all around to me hurting him. I feel like my feelings got completely invalidated, I would at least want him to acknowledge that he hurt me. Idk how to cope with it. He was a very important person to me and I looked up to him.

305,"Hello there, I am a 21-year old college student who is currently staying at home for 2 months for the holidays. Big mistake lmao. I already knew this, but COVID-19 had made my mom crazy. To sum it up quickly, she is a total germ-freak and she has become agoraphobic. Aaaaand she projects this fear on everyone in the house and shames us for leaving the house at any time, effectively barricading us in the house. She even does this if we want to go to the grocery store. She has been doing this since March of 2020. So yea, it's been 9 months of this shit and I'm going insane. 

I've recently started seeing someone and he is now my boyfriend. He lives near my hometown. I specifically asked him and his family to take a COVID-19 test before I came to his house and they did. They tested negative of course. I went to his house last weekend and it was great. I informed my mother that I was planning to go again this weekend and she went ballistic. She started screaming at me about how I'm lazy, selfish, and stupid, all of which are NOT true. I am constantly doing chores around the house ON TOP OF my school classes and studying for my future PCAT exam. I have a near perfect GPA. I hold this family together, since my mom doesn't even know how to communicate with her own son and she has to do it through me because I'm the only one he willingly talks to (bc he hates my mom lmao and i totally get it). Additionally, my mother told me that she doesn't give a fuck about the student organization that I am in charge of, which literally raises money and provides therapy for children with cancer. Whenever I ask her a simple question, she lashes out and insults me for 20 minutes straight instead of giving me a straight, logical answer. Plain and simple, she has become a selfish, heartless woman who doesn't care about anyone but herself. She has little to no regard for my feelings. I am doing schoolwork and housework for 12 hours a day and she chooses not to acknowledge anything I do. And if I don't do it for 1 day she throws a fit. 

She was pissed at me for going back to my college apartment this past semester since all my classes were remote and idk why? I stayed locked in my home from march-august and yet she wanted me there for longer??? She's obsessed with me and she becomes noticeably upset when I try to hang out with people other that her. She makes me hate her more and more with every decision she makes and she thinks she is incapable of doing anything wrong. I haven't seen my friends in months and everyday she assures me that she's going to try her hardest to keep it that way. 

Lmao: if you still don't believe she's crazy, I tried getting the mail from my mailbox back in June and and when I brought it into the house, my mom slapped the mail out of my hand and hit me in the face...over getting mail...she literally thought...the mail...had coronavirus............do y'all see what I'm dealing with. And that's just 1 example; I have many more. 

I've asked all my friends for advice and they don't know what to do because she is so mean and unpredictable. All I want to do is see my boyfriend. And we just stay in his house, it's not like we want to go out. We're literally just planning on making pizzas together, we're not doing drugs or going out. I know him and his family are COVID negative, yet she still has some problem with me seeing him. How can I get her to agree and be ok with my plans to see him this weekend??

306,"My friends have talked about me behind my back, manipulated me, gaslighted, made fun of my looks/hobbies, bullied, and got others to go against me. I personally have done some bad stuff like talking bad abt them and venting too much(I would tell them about my thoughts on suicide/anxiety). We got into fights and had to talk about it in school with teachers. I fully acknowledged my mistake and I have learned from it while they denied what they did and blamed me. During 7th grade i moved there and they didnt like that I spoke english (we live in an asian county) so I had a hard time making friends. I noticed they were just being fake and secretly bad mouthing me. I had fake friends the whole year. During 8th grade I left one of my friends and stuck with this one friend who i had a good relationship with and we formed a group with 2 other people, one of them was this girl that i poured water on during 7th grade because my friends didnt like her (she was known as an overall bad person). My friends also stole her ID and repeatedly stepped on it. Since i became friends with the girl, i apologized and all was well throughout the year. During 9th grade, my mental health was bad and my friends found out i was self harming. They mocked me and laughed about it except for the one girl i had a good relationship with. We ended up fighting and again they blamed me for confronting their behavior. After that i attempted in the bathroom but my one friend noticed what was happening and tried to unlock the door with the others. They talked me out of it and said sorry. later that year, we fought again since they were still treating me like shit and i could feel that they didnt like me. They got my friend to go against me. I managed to make 3 friends and my old friends tried to get them to go against me. They even cornered one of the girls in the bathroom and guilt tripped her for staying by my side.

She ended up arranging a meeting with them again and i expressed how i felt and admitted my mistakes. they brought up the water incident and i admitted it. I told them it was hypocritical of them to use that against me when they stepped on her id and were the ones to tell me about how they hated the girl in the first place. once again they denied everything and i ended up being the one to take the blame and apologize.

307," I (26F) started seeing my boyfriend (31M) about 6 months ago now, so it is a new relationship. By my request, due to the pandemic and other personal reasons, we ""took things slow"" and didn't declare ourselves ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" until the end of October. After 2 years of being single and really settling into an independent lifestyle, it's been an adjustment for me (my previous relationship was long distance and ended in an extremely ugly way). I'm trying to get used to being in a relationship with someone nearby, who I can see frequently for dates, sleepovers, and just to hang out and ""do nothing"" together.

One area that I'm reflecting on is whether it's important, or normal, to know what my partner is thinking about. When we spend time together, we listen to music, talk about life / the world / our friends / state of the pandemic/etc. But I often feel that I don't know what he's thinking, or ""where his head is at,"" and I don't know whether it is invasive or intrusive to be asking all the time. **Is this an important part of a relationship? To have an instinctive, general, overall awareness of what someone is thinking, if you're close to them? Or is it normal to feel like you are each in your own minds, thinking over things and only sharing what matters the most?**

I guess I'm trying to discern whether I need to open up and share more. I feel close to him when we're together spending time, but distant and sometimes disconnected when we're not. Kind of like turning the relationship switch on/off. I'm sure that being in a pandemic and having to negotiate our risk regularly probably doesn't help.

Anyway, any insight or discussion would be helpful. Thanks!

TL;DR: I'm in a new relationship and would like insights on whether it is important to have a general, overall sense of ""where his head is at"", or if it's normal to feel like we are only sharing the most important pieces of our internal talk track with each other.",04Dec2020,1
308,"The title is pretty self-explanatory.

Here’s a bit more details anyways. Some days ago I had to get rid of my old mattress and I have been sleeping on a couch every since.. and my nights have been terrible because my legs are too long (among other things but that’s the biggest issue). 

Anyways, back on the matter ; I received today (at 12:34AM to be precise) my new mattress and it was packed in a box so it would normally need to be left alone around 48h so it can go back to its natural shape. But I can’t spend another night on this couch and wait two more days. 

Would it mess the mattress somehow, if I were to sleep on it before the hours needed ? Like, would I prevent it from taking its actual shape ? Or is it okay and it doesn’t risk to do anything ?",04Dec2020,1
309,"So I am a supervisor at a “24 hour emergency center” that always has a TV playing on the call floor. We save it for news, weather, and entertainment when business hours are over. However, we have this one guy who plays News Max the entire day. 

Now as a supervisor, I want to remain “politically neutral” as I don’t want to come off as playing favorites due to political affiliation. But the shit on News Max lately has been...questionable. 

Do I tell him to change the channel to local news (which is what I’m leaning towards) or do I let him watch whatever despite it kind of bothering me?

News Max is straight conspiracy theories and strictly Pro-Trump news and I don’t think it’s professional to watch it (I would say the same for any other opinion based news organization). 

I just don’t want this guy to get retaliatory on what “other people get to watch” as we don’t really have a strict policy on it. I fear he’ll blame his “liberal boss” for not allowing him to express his freedom of speech (which he doesn’t have at the work place, tbh).

311,"**Sorry for the Long Story**

**Background and Prelude**
I’m a 15 year old boy who’s in 9th grade living in Sydney, Australia. I have been accused of many things that have made everyone hate me. These things are, from my knowledge; said I was going to rape a specific girl (let’s call her Isabella), said I was going to pump Isabella with cum, that I pinned girls against the wall (not sure if people think I did it to specific girls or just “girls” in general), said I wanted to beat/bash 2 certain “eshays” (if you don’t know what they are please google them for better understanding and you’ll probably have an idea of what they’re like. they are like wannabe thugs and gangsters, chavs, etc). Let’s call these 2 “eshays” Cameron and Joel. Some people also believe I said I wanted to kill myself. These are just the things I know and there is a pretty good chance that there could be more that I am not aware of. These incidents have happened around 3 months ago but people have still not forgotten. It is an endless cycle of people not caring then caring again. So far I have been called a pedophile, a bitch, been punched, been constantly physically harassed (sprayed with a water gun, had the back of my shoe stepped on, etc), pushed and shoved; trapped and sieged in my school’s bathroom and math block, etc. All-in-all my situation is bad and it never gets any better in the long run. What makes it bad is that for a long time I have had a bad, unlikeable, annoying personality which made many people dislike me from the get go. In Australia we have Primary School (K-6) and High School (7-12). There were many rumours albeit no true circulating about me doing perverse stuff especially in 7th grade, things like looking up girl’s skirts, watching girls change at school camp, etc. These days I never go outside because I always have a fear of being caught by my grade and getting into a brawl like during a previous incident. The problem about this is though not my whole grade bullies me, a significant plurality friendship group (the “Eshays” including their girls) make up over 25% of the Grade (57/~310 people). They will always back up each other in a fight. These days there is not much I can do when the Eshays harass me, they are usually between okay~skinny to muscular, somewhat know to generally know how to fight, and are in at least packs of 3 wherever they go. I want to do things with my life like get a job, hangout with friends, etc but can’t because my mom doesn’t have a car and I have to take public transport. The Eshays are a common sight in public.

**Timeline**
On September 1st I started texting this guy, let’s call him Lachlan. Around 2 or 3 months ago before that me and a girl fell out (we were friends) mainly due to my behaviour. After some back and forth talk he offers to send messages to her. I take it a step further and ask if he can pretend to Isabella that he’s sending the messages and not me. He agrees and I ask him to tell her that I regretted messing up with her. He offers to make it “I regretted fucking up with her” for authenticity. I agree, he sends it. In the meantime I tell him I have a plan to get my high school social life back on track with a plan. I say I need to sort out stuff with Cameron and Joel (I was unaware that sort out meant fight). He then asks why I said I wanted to fuck her, I then realise he made a mistake and said I wanted to fuck her. I then joke “Oh no, now she thinks I want to pump her with 20CC’s of liquid dream killer”. She questions this and I tell Lachlan to fix it and say it was a mistake. He doesn’t reply. As the final message on this day I say you can’t leave me hanging like that. On the 2nd of September he says yes I can, I then proceed to start sending fight threats jokingly but according to his friends he thought I was being legit. On the 3rd he informs his friends who are close with the eshay group which makes up 25% of the grade that I said I wanted to rape and pump Isabella with cum and many other things that I have mentioned before and things I’m unaware of (he said a lot but I don’t know all the rumours). I was then approached by a small group which escalated quickly into a medium-sized crowd which the day ended in my whole grade finding out about me and a fair portion of grades 10 and 8. That evening, I leak the messages to some people to prove my innocence. With limited success it spreads. I faced harassment for around week until my messages reached Cameron (one of the top dog eshays in their group). He then thinks I want to beat/bash him (up). With me trying to lay-low it takes a long time for the eshays to find me. Eventually a crowd of 100-200 people were going around the school searching for me while spreading the news about me on how I said I wanted to “rape a girl”. They find me and it’s bad, I need to be defended by 4 teachers. After that it’s generally calm, only the eshays are harassing me. But it ain’t over. Throughout the 2nd-crowd incident until now I’ve been again, constantly harassed. For example a few key incidents are the multiple times I got shoved in the hallways by a specific kid who we’ll cal Noah, when I was trapped in my stall by a Head Eshay who we’ll call Tyson, when I got punched on the holidays in public around 2 months ago, etc. It just never stops and always seems to get worse no matter what I do or how low I lay. School will be over in 1 1/2 weeks and then a month and a 1/2 vacation will insue.

**Plans and Goals**
In my situation I don’t care about social reputation anymore, it’s beyond repair I just don’t want to be bullied anymore. But it still hurts to see everyone dislike me, it’s worse than before this incident. I sit alone or with a loser in most classes (the losers are chill though, I like em’). My Mom emailed a report/list I created to the principal with people I do not want in a class with next year and she said she’ll try her best. The list totalled to 57 people out of approximately 310 people. I also asked the Deputy Principal if I could have any potential end-of-year awards handed in private instead of going up stage infront of the school. I just want to be a low-key kid in the background for a year or two and then I’ll try fixing my reputation. But I don’t know how to do it because everyone keeps shining attention at me by either calling me out for being a pedophile or a bitch, etc or bully me. I plan to stay away from the Eshays during recess and lunch but they are spread out everywhere making it difficult to find a place to hangout. Other than that, I plan next year (10th Grade) I’ll focus on studies and get good grades and stuff.

**Mental Health**
When people bully me there is nothing I can do because they have a massive group to back them up and they are usually aggressive, sporty, athletic, and muscular. For example, today (Friday) I was called a pedophile and a bitch by a guy we’ll call “Riley” in the office and that Tyson guy flipped the middle finger at me when I was walking into the office. Thankfully it wasn’t that bad today but days are sometimes better or worse. But it usually follows a pattern where things get and feel better overall and then it gets worse and the bullying gets worse and then it gets better and repeat. What hurts the most for me is how everyone in my grade are starting to become friends with everyone and each other while I’m practically a social outcast. I can’t hangout with the people I want to because the Eshays hangout very close to the areas where the people I want to hangout with hang. I’m the anxious type and even if one person just flips the middle finger at me once I think about it anxiously for the rest of the day. I just want to be accepted to be down to heart honest and I hate being outcasted from pretty much most people. That Isabella girl used to be kinda close and seeing everyone being super nice, friendly, and friends with her kinda hurts, a lot. Makes me feel like even more of an outcast and a hated loser. It’s very easy to tell that everyone dislikes me but no one says it. I can see it in the way EVERYONE looks at me and talks to me. Even though no one says it, I’m always “that guy, that kid”. Even before these series of incidents I was always treated as the chill weird guy. I hate this so much, I just want to be accepted and I know it’s bad. I’m also an attention seeker and I do things for attention to be brought to me (not the incidents, bad boy attention, or bullying attention but little things like talking loud, being a bit of a “rebel” (using phone in class, listening to music), etc). I’ve been kinda stressed from my mental heath knowing everyone hates me and sometimes in class I lose it when I can’t take it anymore. I have these “drunk moments” where pretty much I have zero control and responsibility over my actions and I tend to do and have embarrassing moments. It’s usually from my mouth that gets me in trouble in general but it’s especially the case for my “drunk moments”. I wish I could just be truly chill and be quiet and not care about wanting attention and wanting to be accepted and liked; and wanting to be included with everyone (because everyone are becoming friends). I want to be the chill kid with a couple boys by my side just going through high school being low-key having fun. But unfortunately, I don’t think that will ever be the case ever again.

**Extras**
No I can’t move schools for multiple reasons no matter what. Yes, I have made friends and do hangout with others from other grades. I know school isn’t everything and no one will care a few years from now. No, I cannot get police involved, I considered it but after talking with many I came to the conclusion it would go nowhere because it’s just lite high school drama (My “rumours” compared to politicians scandals are nothing). Yes I know, f*** those kids, I get it, I got my future ahead of me, but what do I do?

And then he says, ""Sorry, but I really had to do it"", and turns around to get in the car.

Finally, I ended up closing the door and remained calm, even if mentally I had a whole Zoo with every animal escaping.

He’s told me straight off the bat he’s in a mental hospital (I probably wouldn’t have responded if he hadn’t sent this, I found it a bit weird/creepy to message me out of the blue ‘can we talk xx’) but hasn’t (and doesn’t seem to want to) told me why, or much at all for that matter.

I do have anxiety and a panic disorder, and already this situation has caused me quite a lot of distress (not knowing much about him or his situation has unfortunately on times led me to fear the worst, such as he’s been sectioned until a trial date etc. I know this is my anxiety talking so trying to tell myself it’s ridiculous!!). I know he must be having a really difficult time, I’m just not sure if I want to become friends as I find it a bit strange as to why he’s chosen to contact me, and I feel really uncomfortable not knowing anything. I also feel uncomfortable knowing he is a guy, and he used to ‘fancy’ me when we were about 11 (he wrote me a love letter and gave me a necklace, I however I didn’t even like boys so was pretty grossed out/embarrassed/horrified by it lol). I guess I’m freaking out about it quite a lot, and wondering about all these ‘possibilities’. 

He’s recently sent a very vague message re. being ‘incarcerated’ and ‘seemingly imprisoned before a trial’ and I don’t know if this is just an analogy for the hospital, or his way of telling me something more? I asked this (in a nice way) but he hasn’t read the message or replied in about 3 days, as far as I can tell he hasn’t been active online. 

I want to do the right thing, but I also am aware of how this is affecting my already pretty anxious state, and I’d just like a bit of advice. 

Should I message his mum or brothers to let them know? I thought this was a bad idea but my friend has suggested it. Should I call the hospital? Is there anything I should or shouldn’t be doing?",04Dec2020,1

We’ve taken trips, we live right down the street from each other, we talk and usually see each other every day - it’s honestly great. However, he is planning on attending grad school is Colorado or Chicago (we live in TX currently). He is set on leaving TX, and I am planning on staying in TX because it’s what’s best for me. We both don’t want long distance. We’ve known for awhile that when our leases are up on our apartments in august 2021, he’ll be moving for school and I’ll be staying in TX, and that our relationship would come to an end. We accepted it awhile back, and accepted that we love our relationship and would enjoy it for the time we have left. Now that it’s December (7 months from the end date) I’ve gotten anxious about it and have been a little more emotional. It feels like a long time - but it isn’t.. we talked openly about it - that it would be sad and rough for both of us, but we’re young and have separate plans we’re not willing to change. I felt better after talking openly about it. but this morning I woke up still feeling a little sad. Maybe it’s the thought of KNOWING how heartbreaking it will be when it comes time, who knows. Has anyone gone through this or have any advice on how to deal with this? I’m aware this is a very *unique* situation, and not many couples stay in committed relationships with someone w/ a set expiration date. Any advice is welcome

351,"I am so stressed out. I have been talking doctors all year - I think I have a skin infection. Derm says no. My PCP gave me a round of clindamycin for staph infection but this circle on my face won't go away. Its been 6 months at least. Derm says its PIH. Ok haven't tested his theory yet as I'm taking a round of muciproprion prescribed by PCP. I have a week of this and then I can try a week of antifungal to see if that helps before I move on to another 2 months of antibiotics my derm wants to give me. 

Since I started taking spironolactone my skin has been exfoliating a lot when I put on lotion. I've not thought much of it, I assumed it was normal and they would be considered grits. Sometimes as this exfoliation process goes on I see little thin hairs coming out of my skin. They get wiped out basically. Still I didn't think much of it, it was annoying to get it off of my hands but nbd.

Yesterday. My hands are really dry because I've been washing them so much between medication applications and things like that. I go to put lotion on my hands and there is an excessive amount of these hairs coming out of my knuckles and the top of my hands. I'm watching them come out of the pores. I'm not picking them out just massaging lotion into the dryness. 

There were so many it would or could resemble a sh*t ton of ants crawling on my hands. I looked at hands intensely for 5 or 10 minutes and waited to see if my boyfriend notices this crazy sh*t. He doesn't. I dust my hands off on my pants and we go take a look at his firebird. I go back to the car a little early. Make a phone call and decide to Google it. The first thing I see is mulligans disease. I'm like omfg im schizophrenic. Then I read that its been connected to a certain strain of lyme disease. Like it's a legit symptom. 

I've been trying to figure out my health problems all year and started fmla one week ago. I didn't feel mentally capable of providing care to people with disabilities at this time.

I'm scared to tell my doctor. I want to schedule an appointment for lyme + mulligans. I'm scared he will not take me seriously and just go straight to mental health.

358,"Regarding a former boyfriend

It’s been a while since we broke up and I think I’m over it mostly, but I always catch myself asking why he acted the way he did. I don’t want people calling him names or anything, just a rational explanation. 

Back in late 2017, we got into a relationship. And he convinced me to move in with him fairly quickly (I am an international student and dorms are expensive) we moved in together and I realized he has no interest in being the kind of person I was hoping he would be. Things turned sour and we because toxic and I got really lucky when a family decided they would take me in. This family insisted I break things off which I of course didn’t listen to. 

Here is where things get interesting. I left the apartment dec 2018, he went back to his family that lived an hour away around the same time. We started talking in January 2019  (yes I initialed the conversation) then around March things started to get really fishy, and he finally told me he found someone else. (He has done this before while we were living together and I figured he was bluffing again) Thing is he wasn’t and I just didn’t know.

He kept his distance throughout the following months, messaging me every now and then and then blowing me off. I feel pathetic recounting these events because I just kept letting him back in. 

Finally in July, we met and I actually found out that he has a new girl friend, and he basically cheated on her with me. He was promising all these things like he will come back and leave her etc etc. He left to go back where he lived and told me he didn’t want to be with me. 

Time goes by and he messages me again, I tell him some mean things I didn’t really mean but I wanted to hurt him. I don’t hear anything from him after that. I think I even messaged his Instagram or something because he didn’t have one, and idk I just don’t have self respect I guess..

2020 comes around, Jan 2020, he emails me thanking me for the time he got to spend with me (what????) and I responded with a “thanks” or something, later in feb, I send him a paragraph and he blocks me. (Which I appreciate) March or May I find out his girlfriend is pregnant. They have twins now. 

My question is, if he was seriously preparing to make a life with her, why the hell did he keep roping me in. He clearly must’ve found out about the pregnancy in Jan, so why email me at all?? 

Is this a thing men do? Am I missing something?

I was allowed to go to the library because they were reviewing, and my friend whispered for me to stay. He knows I love the library though.

Just found out that my grandad died and he basically left everything to me which is quite quite the sizeable amount. My aunt and cousin are obviously not very happy about the fact And my parents don’t care too much to be honest. I’m 22 m if that helps. Both his daughters ( my mom and my aunt ) had a very strenuous relationship with him. I was the only one who took time out to get to know him talk to him etc etc. I actually liked him a lot and I used to talk to him about shit I won’t talk to my parents about and I smoked my first cigar with him and tbh I only wanted this walking stick he had and I told him that too like I called dibs. 

Anyways when my aunt and cousin found out they were seriously pissed cause they assumed they were getting something? I really thought that was a wrong thing to assume cause of the arguement a they had and to an extent the ones he had with my mom. They said they had to deal with him and they are his blood too so they deserve their share, half for my aunt and her family and half for my mom and hers. My aunt is divorced so she’s low key a bitter person but we have never argued before this and maintain an okay relationship. It’s not like they are financially unstable as well both our families are very well off and things are generally good. So I’m wondering whether I should give them something as a token or idk

371,"I would like to preface this by saying, I love my grandma. She's been in my life since I was little and has always been there to help. However, as of late she's been problematic. I'm not sure if she's been slowly changing, or if I'm just noticing it now, but she's been really invasive in my life as of late.

&amp;#x200B;

I have crippling social anxiety, so making friends has always been really difficult for me. Early my sophomore year of high school, my grandma tried to convince my parents to homeschool me for a year, or transfer me to another school because she thought one of my friends were gay, and thus a bad influence on me.   She also pressures me on a daily basis to move out and get an apartment with a bunch of girls, whom I've never met, despite the covid factor (I still live at home while doing online school, but do free babysitting for my parents in return)  

&amp;#x200B;

She claimed I was brainwashed because I dare suggest we better educate border patrol agents, said I'm not allowed to have a serious boyfriend until I've had at least 3 serious boyfriends (???), and that I'm too young to get married despite the fact that I'm the same age my mom was when she got married...and I'm not even engaged.

&amp;#x200B;

She's also broken into our house to paint it without my parent's permission, told us to tie my autistic brother to the back of a four-wheeler and drag him around because she saw it on tv and ""it works"", told my parents that they need to hire my aunt as our maid because our house is too big to clean by ourselves, (no it's not, and my aunt has clearly stated that she doesn't want to be a maid), and sassed me and my brother for wearing masks around her because my aunt it ""not sick, just depressed"" and ""face masks are just a red herring put in place so Biden can turn us all into communists without us realizing"" 

&amp;#x200B;

She also accuses my mom of not liking her or her side of the family, ""even though she's done nothing wrong"" because my mom doesn't take her advice, leading to a lot of arguments between my parents, (she's my dad's mother)

&amp;#x200B;

The final nail in the coffin was when she told my mom yesterday that she should come to my therapy appointments with me because I would feel better (no I would not, you are not invited).   I love my grandma, but she's really? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I also want her to stop spying on us (she lives across the street), gossiping about us, and telling me, or more accurately my mom, how to live my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My grandma is a crazy person, but I love her because she's really sweet and makes me cookies. My mom is an awesome woman who doesn't listen my grandma's crap, and thus gets more of it than even I.

my boyfriend adores christmas. and he loves to give gifts. he's been so generous and kind and loving for the two years we've been together, and i really want to make sure he has a good christmas because this year has been fucking awful for us, as i'm sure it has been for everyone.

so obviously there's some things preventing me from doing anything for him.

1) we can't go somewhere because of covid
2) i lost my job and don't have any money. not even my savings account has money. i had to move back in with my dad to avoid homelessness.
3) i can't do sex work to make money because i'm not sexually appealing to most people. (trust me, i tried)
4) i live with my fucking father so we can't even just spend quality time together. (he also lives with his parents because he's still in college, and i can't drive🙃)
5) i'm not a creative person when it comes to like. physical art. i suck. it's bad.

last year i gave him a box filled with little slips of paper that had things i love about him and things that would make him happy, and a little leather sketchbook. but i don't even have money to do that again. because i don't have nice boxes. i don't even have a shitty box, now that it think of it. not that i'd want to.

basically, i'm at a loss for what to do. all i have is myself. i can't even cook a nice meal for him because he doesn't like food. i feel like a shitty partner and i don't want him to be sad on christmas and i don't want him to get me something and all i have is like. a handmade card. i would feel so so stupid and awful. please give me ideas. anything. please.

Some of my event friends, who I go abroad with and do all major music events with disagree with the vaccine, refuse to take it because of side effects and untested. Even though they’ll happily take drugs. They refuse and hate the idea of proof of the vaccine or that there will be restrictions on them for not taking it. 

It just seems a little hypercritical and ignorant to me. On one hand they hate isolation and what it’s caused, but then refuse to take part in the thing that could end it. Almost to the point of being an anti vaxxer, conspiracy theorist. 

It’s not my place to tell them what to do and I won’t. However their viewpoint has certainly changed my impression of them and I don’t know what to do about that.",04Dec2020,1
378,"i have been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. Im 17 right now, so i know he wont be the last person i end up with nor do i want to end up with him. He is just my first long term relationship and we have been friends for about 4 years too. I dont know if this is normal and every relationship will be like this and im just overreacting, or if its an unhealthy relationship.

Nothing wrong has happened in the past month or so. But ive been wanting to break up with him off and on this entire year because of bad experiences ive had with him and times he treated me kinda poorly, but ive realized he is good at manipulating me because i always end up apologizing for how i feel after arguments, and he even once convinced me to not break up with him when i tried to (2 months ago). We also have very different veiws and goals in life etc. I have this thing where ill feel good feelings about him and ill plan to hangout with him, and the next day, ill be dreading seeing him snd ill be in a terrible mood because i want to spend my time doing other things. He also watches tv a lot and is on his phone and ps4 a lot, and im the complete opposite i dont find that stuff fun i want to do more creative things like art and be outside and he hates that.

*****The problem is i am still attached to him, and when we hang out and nothing goes wrong i enjoy it. I think we are still attached to eachother because we both act like we love eachother when we are together sometimes. ALSO i always think about all the good memories weve had and how ill miss them. 

..And I think about how we get along well and we can always talk without it being awkward. (Are all relationships like that??? In my head i keep assuming this is only one where ill feel this comfortable with him)(i dont always like the conversation topics but its never awkward)

i also dont know if its the wrong time to break up because its december (almost holiday??????) but then when else do i do it? After weve bought eachother Christmas gifts???????? Im so stuck and i wish i did it 2 months ago when i had the chance but he seemed so hurt and like he really wanted to stay with me.*******",04Dec2020,1
379,"Background: I live in the same house as my parents and siblings.

I strongly urged my parents to not go to the store to get a christmas tree, and perhaps to not get one at all this year, but they decided to go anyways. They do wear masks when going out, and went during the hours the store had set up for ""at-risk"" individuals. (my mother has a preexisting condition that puts her at a higher risk for death), but I'm still disappointed that they chose to go out for such a frivolous purpose in the grand scheme of things, especially when covid cases are killing more people in the states than 9/11 every day and our home county is listed at the highest level of covid risk possible. And to drive the point home, we even had a fake christmas tree that we could have used as backup.

I'm not sure if I can convince them to stay isolated for the five to twelve days, my parents don't take kindly to advice I give them when they have their minds set a certain way. I'm worried about our health and safety. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",04Dec2020,1

381,"This is the first time I have ever posted on the internet, so please give me some grace. I do usually have trouble deciding when to act/how to act, but this is different. I will try and be brief, because usually I give too many unnecessary details. 

I am a college student (20F). Last year, I briefly dated a guy, Fred (20M) , for 2 months. The relationship did not work out, but we remained friends. He is great: funny, smart, genuine, honestly kind of a dope. I broke up with him, kind of mutually, because he simply was not ready for the relationship I wanted/ the kind of boyfriend I needed. I wanted someone to share my life with, and he liked me, but did not make time for me. We would not see each other for a few days in a row, and barley texted: it did not feel like we were dating. For him, I think simply being in a relationship seemed like a big deal. When we broke up, we sat down and I basically told him that I was not happy, that I wanted a kind of relationship where we spent more time together and opened up to each other more. I said I did not think he was ready for/ wanted that kind of relationship, and after a long conversation, he agreed that kind of relationship had never occurred to him/ he did not think he was ready. We were just on different pages, and would not be able to make each other happy in the long run. 

I have seen what bottling up feelings does to people, and I am someone who tries to be completely upfront about feelings: I like sharing emotions and thoughts. Emotional intimacy is very important for me. 

I want to emphasize that I do not have romantic feelings for him, or ever want to date him again. I thought our breakup would take 10-20 mins, but it ended up being a conversation that lasted for hours. I was brutal, but we both completely aired all of our feelings. He had dated other girls before, even been in year long relationships, and I think he was shocked that I wanted to be closer to him/get to know him more as my boyfriend: he said this was the most serious relationship he had ever been in. He actually seemed heartbroken that I did not think I knew him well enough, he said he shared things with me he had never told anyone else. For him, our short relationship was the most serious relationship he had ever been in because of the emotional intimacy (in terms of physical intimacy, he had done a lot more in other relationships). 

I know this is probably more information about our past relationship than is needed, I just want you all to know what kind of friendship we have now. 

Fred is awkward and very insecure. His parents (both of whom he loves very much) had a nasty divorce when he was really young, and they do not speak to each other anymore. My guess is his insecurity is because of some validation he did not get when he was a child, but I honestly do not know. His insecurity even sort of affected our relationship: he was not needy or anything, but he was constantly seeking validation from anyone and everyone around him. Part of the reason he was too busy to spend time with me was because he was constantly spending time at his fraternity house, trying to get “accepted” into the pack. (Again, this post is not about our relationship, we never argued about this at all, it wanted him to do what made him happy). He was so excited to have “brothers” (fraternity brothers), he said he could get some kind of family bond he never really had. 

Not only am I friends with Fred, but I am friends with almost all of his fraternity brothers. Their frat is not a stereotypical popular frat, but they are a cool group of guys who basically just like to chill and drink beer. They are also a little emotionally-dense meatheads, and there is definetly some toxic masculinity there (important to note, they completely respect women, it is more the fact most of them are insecure, so they make fun of each other for stupid stuff).  

As I have said before, Fred really seeks validation from people. Because of this, he is always asking people about his appearance, doubling checking his outfit before he goes out, etc. He really cares what other people think. All of his brothers in the fraternity mock him endlessly for this, which has made him into a bit of a “lovable” doof around the house (none of this is good, it probably makes him more insecure, but he kind of plays along). 

His insecurity is really toxic. He is a good guy, he has a very strong moral code on how to treat others. This being said, he loves the allure of a big money lifestyle often portrayed through the media and I think he is attracted to the status it can get him. Despite his draw to this, Fred has talked to me about how gross he thinks cheating is. Fred is many things, but he is genuine. He does not have much social awareness about how certain things sound when he says them, so there is no chance he would lie to sound good. 

Fred also really values my opinion. He does seek me out for emotional stuff, but occasionally if we see each other studying in the library we will sit next to each other and chat a bit (as friends do). Similarly, if we have a class together he will usually ask to go over homework together (this semester over Zoom) and we will end up talking a little. Usually these chats will turn into him opening up a little about emotions or his feelings about things. He cannot really talk to any of his other friends about these things (his friends are the fraternity brothers I am also friends with) and I honestly think I am his only friend outside the fraternity. Because we used to date, he is comfortable sharing his feelings with me, and knows I do not judge him for being sensitive or insecure. At the end of one of these Zoom calls this year he was being a little self-deprecating and I cut him off with “you know I think you are a great person, right? I know \[insert mutual friends’s names\] make fun of you, but you are an amazing guy.” He was trying to stop himself from smiling like a little boy, and told me that meant alot for me to say. He also ended it with a long pause, before quietly telling me that not many people say nice things about him, and he really appreciated hearing that.

This semester, he has a long-distance relationship with a girl from back home (they started dating sometime this summer over quarantine). I honestly do not know the details. Some of the fraternity brothers complain to me and my friends, as Fred tried to pull up pictures from her instagram to brag about how hot she is (gross, I know). A month and a half ago he got blackout drunk, and ended up sleeping with someone else. All of his fraternity brothers know this. They gave him flack for cheating, and Fred is determined that his current girlfriend cannot find out. Apparently, he has gone back and forth several times on whether or not he would break up with her over winter break, which has just started, but regardless, never plans on telling her. His fraternity brothers suspect he won’t actually break up with her, because they think he likes having someone “hot” to show people pictures of (it honestly does not matter, as his ex his current relationship is none of my business). 

I only found out about him cheating recently and I was stunned. I hold Fred in the greatest regard. Obviously he is flawed, but I think he is, to his core, a good person. I never thought he would be capable of cheating on someone, then lying about it. It is a really slimy thing to do. He was blackout drunk, which also raises other questions in my mind. My guy friends told me he has no recollection of sleeping with this girl, but vaguely remembers talking to her when he was drunk. Without a doubt though, he did sleep with her. Consent comes to mind, but he himself, when he was single, was down to sleep with absolutely any girl who wanted to sleep with him. The girl he slept with was also really drunk. I kind of don’t know what his reaction to himself cheating was, other than to know he was super insistent his girlfriend could never know. 

I got hardly any sleep when I found out he had done this. I know him better than most of his friends, and I am usually very good at judging people. I am one of the few people he opens up to, and I would have adamantly denied this would ever happen (that he would cheat). None of his fraternity brothers ever thought he would do this to someone. I was distraught thinking how someone I thought I could completely trust and completely know could do this. 

I was kind of nauseated and questioning reality, so I decided to google why people cheat. One of the first things came up is insecurity, and immediately things started to click for me. I know Fred is so insecure he is constantly trying to find validation for himself. But I also know he is a really good guy, this is the first time he has ever cheated, and he is probably feeling overwhelmed in insecurities and self-hatred right now. 

Here comes my reason for posting. I know his insecurity is something he needs to deal with himself, but he is not necessarily self aware enough (or secure enough) to realize this. I care deeply about Fred. It has never been my place as a friend (and definitely not as an ex) to “force” him to talk about his insecurities. But, I am worried that this could be the start of a deep spiral/cycle of more insecurity, self-hatred, and depression. I also know he does not have friends that are either aware enough or emotionally equipped enough to try and get Fred to address his own insecurity. His fraternity brothers told him off for cheating once, then never addressed it with him again, aside from occasionally bringing it up to make fun of him or make him uncomfortable. 

So, formerly insecure men of reddit, would it make a difference if I said something to him, or is it overstepping my boundaries? I have no intension of shaming him for the cheating and I would NEVER prying or ask about or even mention his current relationship, instead I want to pull him aside next time I see him and casually tell him how amazing I think he is, but also how much better he is than this, and how, since I think he is so great, I think he can work on this. 

I do not want to overstep my boundaries, but I also do not want to watch my friend have to hit rock bottom and have his own mistakes slap him in the face and destroy him before he realizes he needs to work on his insecurity and self-confidence. Cheating, for him, may be pretty close to rock bottom itself. I know none of his friends will do this, either because they truly do not care enough about him (and are okay with him spiraling) or they have no emotional ability to address this or have any kind of upfront conversation with him, and would rather ignore this. 

Men who used to have crippling insecurity and lack of self confidence/esteem, do you wish someone had said something to you, would it have made any difference, or could me bringing it up to him make him hate me? 

 I do really care for Fred and if saying something could help him, I would want to do that.  But, since it is not my business, is the right thing to butt out ?",04Dec2020,1
382,"For context, I (21F) live with two roommates while we are in school, and we move back with our parents between semesters. We'll call my roommates Sarah (19F) and Brittany (23F). Our local COVID guidelines state that anyone entering the province must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival.

Brittany's boyfriend was out-of-province for several weeks and had to self-isolate when he returned. She mentioned to us that she would like to see him anyways and asked if we were okay with that. We said that we weren't comfortable with it but offered to move home early so she could see him. Brittany left us hanging and wouldn't tell us whether she was going to see him or not until the night before he flew in, even though Sarah and I would need time to pack and arrange a way to get home.

Brittany's mom found out through the grapevine of her plans to see her boyfriend, and I assume talked some sense into her, and she decided she wasn't going to see her boyfriend for 2 weeks while he isolated.

Here's where we probably offended her. Sarah and I talked about it and talked to people who have known Brittany for a long time and decided that she would probably sneak out to see him without telling anyone as they are both (Brittany and her boyfriend) pretty sneaky. So, we both moved home, but we didn't tell her the real reason why, although she probably figured it out.

The thing is, she's clearly been sad and lonely while her boyfriend was gone and taking it out on us. We know that if we were the reason why she couldn't see him for another 2 weeks, she'd only get worse. Since Sarah and I moved home, Brittany has decided to see her boyfriend.

Was it mean of us to move out and assume she'd put us at risk?",04Dec2020,1
384,"I have a really cool co-worker. He and I have talked about hanging out a lot. He would always mention bringing other people, and I understood because he had a gf, and I had a bf at the time, and I wasn't trying to be in any drama or cause issues. The few times we had plans with someone the other person would cancel last minute, and then we would completely cancel the activity because he didn't want to be alone with me.(I guess)  Now we are both single and it's the same thing. I'm not trying to be with him romantically. I just don't have many friends and we both have a common interests in the same activities, and the extra people he invites always back out, and then we have to cancel because it's just us.

386,"I walk on egg shells trying to avoid fights , she then tells her mom and friends that im doing bad things etc and everyone takes her side. I deleted ig and all that so she can have piece of mind. And she has all these social medias with bare guys on it.. but i neger go off on her and make her delete her social media. This isnt the first time things have happened. I left one time cause i told her i was sick of being controlled . She begged for me back i came and still she hasnt changed. 

Now i bought a puppy for us ... long story short .. whenever we fight she breaks up with me .. and everythings my fault . She picks and chooses when to be involvd with the puppy. Im taking care of the puppy 24/7 

Last nite we faught because (me being extremely tired i left a jar of food out in the kitchen , and i thought it was her who left it. I told her that she was the one who left it but it was actually me cause she said she didnt but then she snapped, then she snapped about the puppy being in her room took the puppys blanket and toys and threw it on the floor and ignored me  all nite ) whenever we fight if i dont say sorry or im not the one to come and talk the issue never gets resolved.. 

It amazes me that someone is actually like this. I just paid the rent for our apartment but my name isnt on the lease .. so i dont bother her much in fear of her throwing me out on the streets. And i have the puppy now. 

Also the constant fear of her cheating on me, like whenever shes mad she does petty stuff like withholds things from me (iphone charger , vape , anything that i might wanna use)

Her ex has even told her before shes a horrible person. And im only ever happy when shes in a good mood. But then it will randomly just turn bad and i have to suffer. Shes in one of her moods currently. And if im not the one to try to talk or say “sorry” things will never get fixed and she’ll probably leave me . I just feel i messed my life up. I think shes pregnant too im not sure but shes spotting. And breaking out..

I wouldnt want a kid with her she neglects things and avoids her responsibilities. Smokes weed around the puppy and i just know its an abusive house hold. I do love her but i cant ever avoid the fights i dont want. It’s impossible. 


She bought me a game for Christmas, and she already took it back .. and told me were not doing Christmas this year , she took down the Christmas tree and everything. Its just constant toxic stuff. I just feel like the right girl would be able to understand and not be like this. And if she loved me she wouldnt want to hurt my feelings. But idk",04Dec2020,1

388,"Hello Reddit, I am a long time lurker but this is my first post, and this is the first time I'm asking for advice anywhere online. I also apologize in advance because this is going to be a very long post.

Some needed context:  
I have very few close friends because I filter people a lot; I am very sensitive to lies or any kind of dishonesty. I come from a very deceitful and chaotic family and I have always found refuge in very honest friends who keep my faith in people going. I also consider myself a very honest person, as it's what distinguishes me from my background and makes me believe I am hopefully a good person. Now for the actual story.

\----------------------------------

I have a friend, I will call him V, who I consider to be like a brother and I trusted 100%. I have known him for quite a long time and we were through a lot together, me helping him with his family issues and him listening me talk about mine. We were very close but we were also surrounded by a big friends group we frequently interacted with, and we spent a lot of nights in each other's homes playing social games or doing whatever; everyone also supported each other in this group of friends and we were like a very big family.

Me and V lived together for a few years as he kept me sane while I was going through a breakup of a 8 year relationship with a person I previously lived with. This was very important to me because he also listened to me when I previously lived with said person and was having relationship problems during our last year. Eventually, I had to move away back to my home city to fix some family issues and still currently live here, while V still lives in the same city, along with most of the friends' group I mentioned.

In this group, there were also two friends of ours who were in a long-term relationship, who I will call F and M. I am friends with M, although we are not particularly close but V was close to both of them, and hung out mostly with both of them after I left for home. A few weeks before I left F &amp; M broke up, but I missed most of the action while home (I live far), most of what I knew of the topic I knew through chatting with V online while gaming together.

Fast forward a few years and, while traveling to a city in our country for work, I meet F by accident, and we start to catch up. He is usually a very cheerful and warm person, but this time he looked like a wreck and he also acted cold &amp; depressed; I caught on to this and he dropped a bomb on me.

Apparently, when F and M broke up, F did not know the reason why M was acting strange and for most of this last year he never knew what killed their relationship, but 2 months ago he found out that actually M was cheating on him during most of their relationship and he only recently confessed online to, as M was emotional while in the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.

The kicker? M was cheating with V, and most of this was going on while I was still living with V, or when I was still in my last relationship. After F &amp; M broke up, M moved away but F stayed and moved in with V, he took the room I left empty when I came home. So for this last year, F was living with V, and he cried on V's shoulder a lot of that time while going through a breakup he didn't understand. V listened for the whole year, and comforted him while knowing the truth.

When F found out, he moved away and is now living in the city I met him at, depressed and not talking to V, who he considered a friend he trusted with his life (as did I). After confronting V, he admitted to his deed, and also admitted to having been the one who initiated the affair.  
I also considered V the most trustworthy person I knew, and that is the reason I considered him my closest friend, that is the quality I value the most.

After finding this out though, I am unsure of how to proceed. F is also my friend, even though we are not VERY close but that word still carries weight to me. If V managed to keep a double life and lie to F (and me) for years, do I really know if there are other things V is keeping from me also, but I just don't know because, like F, I believed him at face value?

V still doesn't know I know, and for all these years he was doing this, he was lying to our friend who he considered close, and also never told me about it. Maybe he was afraid I would judge him for his dishonesty, or maybe he didn't want to stop because he knew I would force him out of it or rat him out. He did not harm me directly, or lie to me about big stuff as far I am aware of, but this makes me think that if he needed to, our friendship would not be a deterrent for him to get what he wants?

Every bone in my body is telling me to confront V, to tell him I know, hear him admit it and ultimately tell him to go fuck himself. At the same time, I still care about him and we have history, and I have nothing directly to do with this issue, so I don't know if I should just ignore it; but if I ignore it, am I not also being a bad friend to F? V did not do something impulsive I can just forgive him for as a mistake, he planned this and remained cold and indifferent to this for years, even living with F while lying to his face. Personally, the guilt of what I was doing would have stopped me from even living with F in the first place, but to him it didn't matter, it seems?

An outside and neutral perspective from people here would be appreciated, sorry again for the long post.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR : My friend V did something horrible and cruel to a mutual friend I'm not close with, an action that goes against my whole moral fiber, and I don't know if the weight of my history and closeness with V should be reason enough for me to ignore or forgive him.

392,"This is a throw away account. I will post regularly on this situation I think. I'm sorry for my english, I am crying right now and I can't really find my word.

When I(16F) was young, I was often bullied because I was overweight/ugly. I lived with an abusive step dad and dad, wich make me think that all of this was normal. I never really complain about the kick I had, because I thought that It was like this for everyone. I always try to do my best, because I feel like I never was good enough for my parents and It hurt me now to realize how I throw away my social life just because I wanted to be seen by my parents. 

I never really love myself, so when I realized that I was Pansexual, I try to hide it. I was in a religious school, and LGBTQ+ wasn't really well see by the teacher, so I just hate myself more, thinking that I was weird, that I didn't deserve to live, that I was sick. 

It was around this time I promise myself to end my life at 18. I didn't want to be an adult, and I still don't want to become one. Everyday, I thought about how life is going to be hard, how pathetic I am and how I will not survive one year alone.

Three years ago, I met a girl who help me the best she could with that. She help me understand that my sexuality was okay, that I wasn't ugly. One year after we met she told me that she loved me, wich I do too.

We loved each other during 2 years. We were already thinking about how our life was going to be. When I was around her, I was feeling like I was worth something, I was feeling alive, like I found something in me that I lose when I was a kid.

She asked me not too long ago, if I still considerate to kill myself at 18. I told her that I wasn't sure, that I was happy with how my life turned out right now and that even if their were still small thing to change, my life become better when I was with her. She didn't say anything. I believe she had already realise at this time that her feeling for me were gone.

Today, she told me that she needed to talk. I already kinda knew what was going to happen, I had the feeling that something bad was going to happen. She told me that she wanted to be honest with me, that she didn't have any feeling left toward me. I try not to cry, because I didn't want her to feel guilty for me. I just ask her if they were any reason behind that, and told her that I needed some time. I didn't text her back yet, I don't know what to say. I feel like all of my futur just collapse in front of me. I don't want to tell her how I feel, because I don't want her to feel guilty about me and try to force herself into a relationship.

I lose the person who help me the most with my life, I lose the person who help me realise that life wasn't bad, that I just needed to change thing to make my life better. Telling you that I feel like a part of me died isn't strong enough to make you realize how bad I am right now. I feel like I will never be happy again.

Their is still 2 years left, and I lose my reason to live. I don't know what to do. I feel lost in my own feelings and I just want help.",04Dec2020,1

Now that i'm my first year of college (CEGEP, I'm in Québec) the paid education programs (especially for university) are looking really appealing and i really want to go for it after finishing college. 

The thing is that my mom has some really strong generalized anxiety disorder which makes anything relatively stressful a real challenge for her.

I then found out that he has been carrying on an emotional affair with his ex via texting this entire time, and it only confirmed his unavailability for a relationship.

398,"Hi all. Seeking advice for my home issue:

I live on a plot of land with a chain link fence on one side that borders my neighbors front yard. He has spoken to me once or twice and has been friendly if not pushy, asking me to come over and such and I decline. After living here for a while I’ve seen him yell at people in his driveway, scream over the phone, punch his front door, be derogatory to women he has over, threaten people on the phone, slam doors etc. We have some plants against the chain link fence so he can’t totally see me but he can if he looks hard enough and then he will try a conversation.


I am getting anxious going into my yard where the fence is because he freaks me out. I don’t know if me declining him makes him angry. I am a short girl and he is a 6ft firefighter-build sort of guy. I want to replace the chain link with a solid wood fence. But I’d have to ask his permission since he has to look at it too (I’m 99% sure it’s on my property though...) it would look best to replace the chain link completely but I can put it in front and that would definitely be in my property, it would just look a little weird. 


What should I do, about asking for a fence and dealing with him in general..?",04Dec2020,1

403,"Hello guys, i just want to clearify my situation. This convo was just a few minutes ago, so I'm still a little bit shaking.

It all starts when this whole thing started earlier this year. You know what I am talking about, right?

I first was on my mothers side. Her opinion is that the virus was created by the government, that it's just there to control us, that masks are dangerous and so on. I think you get what I mean.

After a while i realized how bad the situation really is. I started to block the conversation with my mother about this specific topic and tried to change to another. One day i just had enough and said that I wanted to move out. Not only to avoid these topics, but also to be more independent. And so I did. I live with one of my siblings now in an apartment, where I don't hear this stuff. I am 18 now, so in my country I could have my own flat, but I don't have the money for that.

Well, about two weeks ago our mother moved in with us. That's a whole other reason why. She helps us with the chores, gives us some money for groceries. Today was the final straw for me. My mom looked up a site about the vaccine that should come out and gave her opinion about it. She thinks that it's dangerous and asked me if I am getting vaccinated when it comes out. I said yes. I don't wanna live in an f-ing pandemic anymore, i never did. I just want people to be healthy and safe and not dying due to the virus.

After she held a little 'presentation' ( I don't know the word right now ) she started talking about vaccines all together and how they cause autism. This is were I had enough. I told her that this was bullshit and that she should inform herself more on how it isn't true. But she thinks that her non-mainstream media ( her words ) know more than the mainstream ones.

( I know I f-uped here ) I told her that if she has this opinion and not have anxiety to get herself infected or even others then she can leave and find somewhere else to live. After that she really yelled at me about this topic. She said that she was worried about me 'throwing my life away with this vaccine' and that she is my mother. Some of what she said was true. That I had to do not much when I still lived with here earlier and that she endured all my outbreaks. Tbh I had a lot a few years ago. Also I don't really give sources for my opinion on this topic, she's true with that. But it really stings me that she isn't aware of this whole situation in the world out there...

What should I do?",04Dec2020,1
404,"This is long I had to vent sorry.
Long story short I married my ex wife young, we were togother for ten married for six, I found out she was cheating on me back in 2014, 
One morning she came back from an appointment all happy and told me I was going to be a father for a third time, I had known for a couple months up until this point, and it made me sick getting intimate with her, we hadn't had sex in over five months, and she told me she was ten weeks along.

Which is when I told her I knew everything, she tried denying it and when her telling everyone the conception date it was shaky, she could never get it right. She didn't really realise how sloppy she got and assumed that when I suspected her cheating I wouldn't snoop.

So I left her, I got hate from her family, but after sending them the photos only her brother and father, apologised, my ex wife cut them both off after that. She begged me to come back but I refused, and within the month she moved her affair partner in, I found this out from our kids.

Our divorce was extremely difficult but after a year I was finally free from her!

I focused my life on work and the kids, and everything seemed great.

I meet my now-fiance 3 years after leaving my ex, she had been divorced in the last year and had a two girls, 5 and 1, I loved her and the kids and both my kids, loved spending time with these girls as well, 18 months later we move in togother, and we became our own family unit.

In August I proposed to my fiance and she said yes, both of us elated to finally be with someone who truly made us happy, the kids know and are now super excited.
I had to tell my ex, and up until this point she was respectful to my wife, but once she heard we were getting married, something changed with.

I still talk to her brother, and what he told me was she became obsessed with getting married, and brought it up several times with her boyfriend, this caused him to leave her, he became difficult with paying child support for Thier son.

Me and ex had kept a things friendly for our kids, and I offered to find her a lawyer, that wasn't expensive, I knew a few so thought I could make her searching easy for her, the thing is I gave her the number of someone, but told me she wasn't sure she wanted to cause more drama, I told her that her ex still had priorities to stick to he shouldn't walk away, and do the right thing.

A couple days later she texted me and asked if I was willing to give her extra money each month for her child, I told her, that he wasn't my child, and I gave her enough for the other kids anyway. She made it a point I pay for things for my fiance's kids all the time, and how it seemed weird I would do that while allowing to also call me dad, that was Thier choice, the youngest was still young didn't understand, she never meet her bio dad and the oldest, just one day started calling me dad after watching her sister do it for months.

The truth is sometimes I was paying for small things for the girls, but my fiance handled everything else for them. But my ex saw this as a huge problem, and acts like I am now loaded with money, the truth is I'm now, I haven't responded to her since she said that to me, but know she will bring it up this weekend when dropping of the kids.

I don't want to get legal involved like I did with the divorce, because I will be left emotional drained, she doesn't understand the word no to well either.

Is there anyway I could do this without constant fight or argueing with her?",04Dec2020,1

I decided to keep shut to see what he would say, after i told him i counted the reg last night he told me he went to the bank and got 50 singles with the $50 that was in the register.

She has told me numerous times that I treated her really well, and that she wishing me the best, and that if she could ever feel like she was able to do enough for me in return she would have stuck it out.

Over the time we've been apart we have had very little contact, as minimal as possible. A few conversations in person, some texts here and there, but barely anything. Both of us were just as guilty of starting convos. A week or two ago she had said to me ""when you reach out or ask for a second of my time, it puts a dampener on my mood, it makes me feel shitty about the way I treated you and left you."" And I respected that and hadn't bothered reaching out except for a simple ""Happy Thanksgiving"" (which was met with no response and I respected that as well). 

She came to me this week, in the middle of the night, to face me with an assumption of me that I'd never given her or anyone the impression I would do and requested something of me that had already been said and done with since the same week we broke up. I want to say ""do you really think that little of me after I treated you as well as I did?"". Especially since she made me feel the way she accused me of making her feel. I was doing well, wasn't thinking of her too often, wasn't getting in my own head. Then she reached out and I regressed quickly. I went back to hurting as bad as I did from the start.

418,"BACKGROUND: I handle all recruiting, hiring, and retention for a semi-large Construction Company. I'm 25 and for the most part, I enjoy my job. But for those who know the industry, you come across WIDE array of personalities.

I recently hired a gentleman, in his 40's, as a Laborer. He had a decent interview and seemed fairly excited for the opportunity,  actually clammering to start work right away. On 11/4, one day before his start date, he informed me that his brother had unexpectedly died. He asked if he could move his start date to 11/9, I gave him my condolences and told him to take all the time he needed.

On 11/8, the Sunday before his new start date, he asked to move his start date to 11/10. He informed me that he had to clean out his deceased brother's apartment alone and needed more time to do so. He was very apologetic about this request, but I saw no problem in granting him one more day.

On 11/10, he asked once again to push his start date out to 11/12. He said the loss of his brother had finally hit him, while he cleaned out the last of his possessions. I recognized that he likely needed way more time to process his brother's death and bit off more than he could chew. I told him to start on 11/16, that next Monday, so that he didn't feel rushed. He thanked me profusely and promised that he ""will not ask for more time after this"".

On 11/15, he asked to start on 11/16. This time, he admitted to having a two-day meltdown and needing to pull himself together. He was very apologetic, but claimed he'd show up on 11/16 ""no matter what"". After getting permission from my superior, I told him to come in on 11/17 so that he had more time to emotionally heal. I also informed him that we'd be forced to move on if he couldn't make it on 11/17, he agreed to this arrangement.

On 11/17 he reached out and informed me that he could no longer take the job. He thanked me for the opportunity, but said that ""life is just too hard right now"". On 11/22 he reached out and asked if he could have his job back, proposing that he start after Thanksgiving on 11/30. He claimed to be doing better and said he wanted the job ""more than anything"". We already hired several Laborers since we'd last spoke, so I informed him that the position was filled. He understood and thanked me for my time. However, he contacted me again on 12/3 and begged for a job. He worried that he'd ruined his chances of ever working for our company. 

As a fellow human, I feel for this man and what he's been through. I don't know how I'd emotionally cope with the abrupt loss of a sibling, especially in these times. I don't envy his situation and I hope I'm never faced with the same circumstances. For all he's been through, I'm sure he could use one damn break. If I give him a job, maybe that's the pickup he needs?

As a professional, this situation has presented a ton of red flags. Over the past month he's shown me just how unreliable and emotionally unstable he can be, does this sound like someone who turns into an A+ employee? Though I sympathize with his struggles and truly hope he finds success, I'm not confident it'd be here.

I can't talk to my dad about it because he gets defensive and my mom is sympathetic but I mean, I know they are probably worried sick too. I can't imagine what its like to slowly not be able to think the way you used to. I don't want to add any extra worry to their plates, because my mom has mentioned a lot that she's terrified to leave me alone in the world. 

I just feel like the day I've always dreaded and known was coming is here, and I'm just as unprepared and I thought I would be. I don't know where to go from here, or where to find support. My parents have insurance so I'm not worried about anything financially honestly, it is just destroying me mentally because its terrifying to have to realize that sooner than later I am going to lose my parents. I feel like I am grieving before they are even gone.",04Dec2020,1
431,"I (32f) live 1,600 miles away from my hometown and my mom. I’ve been gone (with occasional visits) for 10 years. My mom has taken care of (technically) my cat since then. My dad gave her to me and I left her with my mom. When it comes down to brass tacks, the cat is my cat. But she’s very much my mom’s also. 

A few weeks ago, Dot (the cat) got fleas. We have no idea at all how she got them. She’s been around no other animals and she’s been outside maybe 2 times in her life. She’s not been fixed. She’s never been to a vet. She will it allow it. She’s a feral house cat, if that’s a thing. She only allows certain people around her and she hides when a lot of people are around. 

Anyway, my mom purchased some of that liquid stuff that you put on cats’ necks. She was immediately more comfortable. Her whole demeanor changed. 

A day or so after that, my mom noticed that she was out all the time. She slept most of the time. And the biggest problem—she has been doing her business on the couch. It’s been like this for 3-4 days. 

Is this something that the flea medication could’ve caused? Will it wear off? 

My mom is very seriously considering taking her to a shelter if she doesn’t stop. Mom decided to move her litter box out into the living area, where Dot has been sleeping and doing her business to see if that helps at all. 

Does anyone have advice? I really don’t want Dot to go to a shelter...",04Dec2020,1

In the end, there was no trade off I could kid myself with, no ""but she's nice some of the time.."" as she did more and more obnoxious shit. I realised its time to give up and I have.

When he was applying to uni, he applied to oxford, he never got in. He then lied and said he did but he rejected them. He went to another uni and during his second year he applied to cambridge - he never got in. 

over the years and when he started to go to uni, he put on the posh voice and he would make it deeper. When he got a job, he carried on doing this. His higher up, once told him he couldn't do this. He did this during a presentation to a client. He really isnt self aware enough to see that this is weird and isnt what normal people do. 

Throughout all of this, he would make fake situations and make himself look really good. Or just make stories that he thought were interesting but no one else did. I would indirectly suggest that he was lying (I've stopped talking to him now) he then wouldnt tell me those stories. But would tell my little sister, who's too shy to say he's boring. 

Recently, he found out a friend was a amateur mma boxer and now he wanted to fight too. So he started training with this same boy (who lost more than half his fights). He makes these stupid noises and the worst part is he punches his mattress which shakes the whole house. He's not self aware enough to realise you're not supposed to do this. He makes this weird noise when hes breathing out. 

Also if anyone is doing anything with their lives, he tries to make them feel bad in multiple ways - this is the reason why is stopped talking to him. He's also unhygienic and has a ego complex and I frankly i dont want to know him.

Okay, so for the past three days I’ve been off from work because I don’t feel well. I had to leave work mid-shift because I had a migraine, sore throat and I felt like I was going to pass out. The thing is, I work in an essential field and we need as many people as we can get during the weekend. Naturaĺly, my boss is not so excited about me staying home, and so she tried to get me back to work asap. I don’t feel well enough to return yet though. And I feel so guilty about it. Also, I’m anxious that I have COVID so I managed to make an appointment for me to be tested because I don’t want to get back to work and make everybody sick. Just for the sake of me being back. 

I just can’t wrap my mind around the fact that I feel so GUILTY about being sick and staying home. Is this normal? I’m doing everything I can for my health and I also want to make sure I don’t have COVID so I don’t pass it on to other people, but I feel like there will be some consequences when it comes to work.

454,"Basically, I don't trust anyone who I haven't met or who hasn't met someone I've met. The internet is an exception. I trust women even less. The stuff that happened with Johnny Depp combined with hearing similar stories (some from irl friends) have made me especially wary of new women. My best friend is a woman, but I feel like I have sexist tendencies that didn't exist before and I don't know how to fix it. The issues are only with women I don't know. I trust all my managers (only one is a guy), my therapist, and obviously I trust my friend with every cell in my body.

I've been used so many times throughout highschool and it just happened again in college. All I want is to find someone that I can trust, so that I can raise a happy family and finally feel complete. I know I'm supposed to feel complete myself before I go for a relationship, but I don't know how. A loving wife and a family is all I want and I'm barely even an adult. I still have years before I can reasonably think about that. 


Also my best friend isn't an option. She's a sex-repulsed asexual, and every other woman I know is gay or in a relationship.

455,"Hi, I’m new here and this is something heavily weighing on me and my spirit and I’m hoping I can get some clarity from somewhere. I asked a friend about this but it didn’t help at all because she’s in favor of anything that caters to her and let’s her flex her knowledge and statistics 🙄. Little background information first, I’m Afro-Caribbean (yes that means I am black for those wondering the specifics) and there has been a lot going on in the black community ever since the death of George Floyd (please leave your views about that situation out of this thats not what I’m asking about) and currently there’s a huge gender war going on in the black community because of recent events. I’m sure that you’ve all heard of the hashtags “black women are so unprotected” and “protect black women” and I do agree with protecting black women the main thing about all of it that has me perplexed is the blaming of everyone for the actions of certain individuals. Even the ones that call out and hold the guilty accountable are still getting blamed. Those trying to see things from both sides, blamed (I’m not just talking about abuse with this one), those trying to figure out the whole story, blamed. It’s as if once you don’t say exactly what is expected of you to say you’re against the movement. I want our people to be united like we were just a few months ago and I do agree with the movement, I think some things are being gone about the wrong way, the bashing, generalizations, false accusations, assumptions are going to hurt us more than help us. So my question really boils down to this...Is it right to just hold the guilty accountable and make an example out of them or is it ok in these situations to blame everyone for the actions of those individuals? I ask that you please answer respectfully, if you don’t agree with someone don’t attack them if you don’t understand something don’t belittle the person. I honestly want to discuss this, find an answer and hopefully have some clarity. Thank you",04Dec2020,1

458,"Sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile.

I'm a 16 year old girl, autistic, and living with my grandmother (my guardian) since the age of 4 months old. Previously, I lived with my birth mother, who left me on the floor and basically let her dogs raise me. I don't remember it at all, but it's just what I've been told. (Because of the whole dog thing I remember I would constantly play like a dog, and at younger ages, even thought I was one according to my memory. I was told I ""was possessed by the devil"".)

My grandmother is your typical hardcore Christian trump-supporting boomer, which are views I certainly don't share myself but I have no problem with others having. However, she's also an anti-vaxxer, climate change denier, and hardcore conspiracy theorist. 

She tells me shit like ""she hears god talking to her"" (after talking to her, it's unclear if she is mistaking her own internal thoughts for the voice of god, or if she actually hears voices), and if I ever get upset about anything she tells me ""you're only like this because youre autistic"", or ""youre dumb because of your autism"".

Despite her repeatedly using my autism as something to nag me about, and being told from a young age by therapists that I need to get diagnosed, she refuses to take me to a doctor to get offically diagnosed because she thinks they'll take away her guns if she has someone in her house that's autistic. Oh yeah, she owns guns too, which terrifies me.

If I become overwhelmed and shut down because of my autism, she'll threaten to punish me for it. (ie. ""I'll take away your phone if you don't stop"", when I'm in my room crying in a ball on the floor. This always makes things worse.) She's always told me stuff like this. When I was about 5, my dad died. When I would cry over it, she'd tell me to ""shut up"" or to ""cry later"".

She also ""promised me to god"" at a young age, and forced her religion on me heavily. When I was about 8 or 9 she forced me to watch several Christian movies, some of which showing incredibly violent scenes of Christians being murdered. I remember she made me watch some show where a Christian guy had another man stick his thumbs in his fucking eyes because he was a worshipper of god, one where they rounded up Christians like it was the holocaust, (a girl got her head cut off in that one! fun!) and I remember being forced to listen to graphic descriptions of how Hell was in church at younger ages, maggots eating your flesh, skin burning off, the whole nine yards. Thankfully, she doesn't do the ""you have to watch this violent movie about death"" thing anymore.

I mentioned this before, but she owns guns. I don't think she'd hurt me, as I think she's still reasonable enough to know she doesnt want to go to jail, and upon asking her if she would ever injure me, she said ""No!!! But i think you'd injure me!!!"". She does the whole ""I wouldn't do this bad thing to you, but you'd do it to me."" thing a lot. When I was 13 she thought she had cancer and would yell at me whenever I asked to hang out with friends because i was ""leaving her to die"".

I don't know if I've simply realized she's horrible, if it's getting worse, or a combination of the two. Last night she screamed at me because I told her that no, my autism wasn't caused by vaccines, as vaccines can't cause autism. Things like this are becoming an every day thing. I don't know what to do. I can't fucking take it anymore.

Should I run away? I don't think that's a good idea because I don't think I could get a job as I cant drive, I'm bad at human interaction, and i'm not finished with highschool yet. I can't live with any other family members because they don't have room for me and I don't want to burden them. I don't want to call child services or anything because 1. I won't be a child in two years anyway and 2. I live in a very conservative area and i'm scared they wont take me seriously if i mentioned what she does and the way she thinks. I'm also scared she'll lie about this and say none if it happened, and that nobody will believe me. I don't know what to do, and I know running away is an absolutely horrible idea but I don't want to deal with this anymore and I don't think I have any other options.

Also, it was nice to finally be able to tell the shit i've dealt with to people, even if it was a bunch of strangers on Reddit. Sorry if I included any details that didn't seem very relevant. I don't want pity or anything, I just needed to vent.

TLDR: I'm 16 and my mother is abusive. I don't have anywhere else to go and I think running away is my only option. I don't know what to do.",04Dec2020,1
459,"Hi. I'm 17F and recently I've become so, or I've felt so lifeless.

I have no idea why I feel this way.

I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch (regarding female concerns, just medical issues) which isn't anything too big but it's causing me an immense amount of stress, so bad that just the thought of it is causing my legs to go weak, I feel like fainting, like throwing up.

I can't focus on my school work much because I'm so stressed, I'm exhausted and nothing feels right.

I've desperately been trying to find things that will calm me down- tea, baths, relaxing, sleeping, hanging out with friends, and even alcohol.

I personally don't like drinking, but if it helps me calm down when I need it most then I don't mind. I do ask my parents for consent so it's nothing to worry about for me.

These things help a bit, but only for so long. I can hangout with friends, but as some point I'll have to say goodbye and do my own thing until next time.

I've gotten so stressed that I've cut back on my coffee intake, my sugar intake, I don't really watch scary things anymore (I used to listen to scary stories all the time).

Awhile back at school, I talked to my friends explaining that I was going through something and my grades were dropping which wasn't helping. They said I should talk to my teachers and I should but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

Another time at school I had a little issue regarding the medical thing and I started to freak out. I don't know if anybody could really tell but I couldn't stop shaking and I was trying not to cry, I felt so scared and so upset, wishing I didn't exist.

I still dream of doing photography, and I dream of other things- finding love, owning a dog, etc. But I think about how badly I wish I wasn't born female and I just wish I didn't have to deal with all of this. (this is because of medical issues + kinda sexism from family too).

When I'm hanging out with friends or doing something fun/something I love, I don't feel this way at all. When I'm alone or not doing something fun/etc, these thoughts just seep into my mind and I can't get them out.

I don't necessarily self-harm, but sometimes I dig my nails into my scalp or I squeeze my skin. I try not to but lately it's causing me issues.

On top of that, my past it still haunting me. I know I'm 17 and it sounds cliche but I've been through a fair bit and I don't know how to feel about any of it. 

My main concern though, is that I'm kind of failing school. Mainly because of the stress but failing school just adds onto that.

I just wrote an essay I was fairly confident in, and I got a 65. It's not a fail, but it's not where I want to be. I haven't talked to my teachers, but I feel like I should.

I've been feeling this way for about 2 months I think. It has gotten a little better but I still just feel worthless. 

It's not too likely that I will end myself, I'm too scared to do that, but I'm also too scared to live. 

I don't know what I should do about this. I don't want to push all of this onto someone else, but I don't know if I can just leave it and bottle it up.

Some of my friends are supporting me, but they're also going through things so I try to help them too. I don't mind helping them since they help me back, but I still feel like I'm shoving all this extra weight onto them.

What should I do about this ..?",04Dec2020,1

462,"I'd like to think that I (31 F) have a great relationship with my husband's (28 M) family. We chat regularly and meet each other just to get together for at least once a month and constantly help each other. I have moved across states just to be with my husband so they have been my only strong network on my new home.

Fast forward 5 years, my husband and I had a very big fight that ended with us separating last October, with him going back to his family. We got back together after a month (late November), but during the time of our separation, only one of his relatives had reached out to see how I am doing, and I have heard from my husband that during that time he went and visited his brothers (he is the youngest), they have told him to forget about me and move on. I know that I have a reputation on our family as someone who can hold her ground and survive, but I felt hurt and disappointed that no one has reached out to me except for his sister, and it led me into thinking that the relationship we have is *family by association* and is not as a real true family that help each other fix things out (which is how we do it on my family).

This thought has been bugging me for a couple of days now and although I still chat from time to time on our group, my enthusiasm to help and be a family has diminished significantly. Now I am debating if I will even go to the Christmas get together. I'd like to hear your thoughts about this that can hopefully can give me a fresh perspective.",04Dec2020,1
463,"So I have a close friend who’s a guy for a while now (I’ll call him B). I was casually dating someone one for the past few months and ended things. Ended up talking more to B and somehow we can to an agreement of being friends with benefits. It’s only been a few weeks but so far has worked out pretty well. 

The problem is due to covid and other events we’re both back living at home and wanting to move out soon. B has proposed that maybe we should move out together (since we were good friends before the fwb thing). I think it would be really good, and because I have a puppy not many people want to move out with me, and while in school I can’t afford a one bedroom by myself. 

The only issue is I’m worried about things going south, since sex is involved. I have no feelings for him, and he says the same back (but I can’t help feeling like sometimes he likes me). We agreed to be straightforward if feelings come involved tho. But if we live together I’m afraid it’d get messy somehow. 

Another option we can do is move in together, but end our fwb. We’ve only had sex a few times and I think we could end it without it being too weird and going back to normal friends. But if we’re living together I don’t know how long that’ll last till we hook up again haha. 

He’s had fwb relationships before, but for me this is a first. And it’s going really well, and just as a friend it would be fun to move out together as roommates, but I’m afraid sex will make everything more complicated and messy",04Dec2020,1
464,"So last night my brother brought home a Long John Silver's family meal for dinner because my mom wasn't in the mood for cooking. One of the side dishes in the meal included Shrimp which i love, but can't eat cause i'm so called ''Allergic'' by my doctor along with a list of a dozen other things on a list i was given at least 9 years ago after being treated for bronchitis. I was told to stay away from everything on the list because it would ''Help'' treat it and make it go away faster. Well i never touched Shrimp once after until last night, and i took one bite from a piece and the second it went down my throat, my lower abdomen started to hurt but not enough that it worried me. I ate about 2 more pieces after that along with the dinner, and when i woke up this morning i felt slightly sick and nauseated knowing it could very well be the Shrimp. 

I'm still feeling that way but way better than this morning, but i don't have an appetite for anything and feel like i could vomit if i eat, but i did drink some liquid which helped a lot. I can still somewhat taste the Shrimp in my mouth so that could be very well what caused it...What do you guys think? Do i have food poisoning? Thanks!",04Dec2020,1

The main reason for his complaint was because we were doing a video call, where he kept asking if I could turn off the music that was playing in the background and going through my speaker and I told him I couldn't because this was hold music which was playing because I was on a phone call on hold. In retrospect I realize that I should have realized he probably didn't know what ""on hold"" meant, but he never asked me to clarify further. 

There's been other problems like I've tried to ask him stuff like ""Do you have any advice on solving problems that are similar to problem A"" and he'll explain how to solve problem A, to which I'll reply, ""Thanks, that'll help this time, but I'm more interested in knowing how to solve other problems that are similar to problem A"" and then he'll explain how to solve problem A again.

I kinda mentioned this with my supervisor when he brought up the complaint but I didn't use the words ""Language barrier"", I said communication barrier which I feel is less clear. **I'm mostly worried that if I say language barrier he might be offended and think/say ""I can speak English, I've been speaking it for the last few years while I've lived here"".** He is kind of pretty close to fluent, but I wouldn't quite say fluent yet.

475,"I do well in school (top in maths and sciences as well as top in languages (I do French, Latin, Spanish, Greek)) and my parents have always told me that I have the potential to make a lot of money like them (dad is a lawyer, mum is an investment banker in a high profile company). While this is the case, I want to become a surgeon, as medicine interests me in general (more than law). I think being a surgeon is the right job as I’m quite studious in nature (I genuinely enjoy studying), and I don’t particularly like the thought doing a job in which I have to rely on my social connections (although I know lawyering requires skill as well, but my main problem is that I don’t get on particularly well with people in general and my social skills are abysmal). I just want a high profile job in which I can hone my skills and climb to the top, without too much social proficiency (I know some is required, but I think I’ll cope). Most of all, saving the lives of people with my very own hands sounds very exciting (and certainly more exciting than making settlement offers).

Although I haven’t told them that I want to become a doctor, my parents have always told me that becoming a doctor isn’t worth it (considering the amount of training you need, late hours, not a particularly high pay etc.).

480,"Hi y'all, I'm 22 (F) looking at health insurance (USA) and I am confused. 

So copays... I pay that for my doctor visits and does not count towards my deductible. 

For example, I go see a doctor and my copay is $20. I pay that up front and it does not count towards my deductible. If I have blood drawn or labs ran, I pay that in full and that *does* count towards my deductible. I get medicine prescribed and let's say I have a $20 copay for generics... same deal as normal copay and does not count towards my deductible. 

So here is where I get confused. Is the $20 copay for the doctor visit the only thing I pay before my deductible is met, as long as I only visit a doctor and have no tests ran or prescriptions filled? Or do I pay 100% for the doctor visit until my deductible is met, and after the deductible is met *then* I only pay $20 copay? 

I need to go see a doctor once I have insurance, but I don't know if I will be paying a copay or the full amount and articles I find are very confusing. When does the copay start? Right away?

Also, I know a lot of this varies depending on the insurance I pick. I can't figure out what wording I need to be looking for to know if it's the right choice for me.

Last year she started taking HRT which have been known to cause cancer. Anyways she started complaining of chest pain a few weeks ago. At first she thought it was COVID-19 and took a test. It came back negative. So she saw a doctor who said it’s probably another viral infection and told her to take some time off work. 

I started seeing that she was googling her symptoms (and we all know what that does) so yeah, she has self diagnosed herself with cancer, and is in and out of hospitals trying to get a diagnosis. All tests for cancers are coming back negative and the doctors are saying it is just a viral infection which takes a few weeks to go away. 

However my mum has convinced herself that she is really sick and that nobody will believe her. I am on the fence about it because I am constantly worried that she has an illness when she complains about things. It is effecting the mood of the entire house. 

Yesterday she took another COVID-19 test which came back negative again. I see her googling symptoms on her phone every night, I told her not to do it as it always gives worse case scenario and to listen to me (who has a degree in computer science) and listen to qualified doctors who have trained all their lives to spot cancer.

486,"Sorry, this post is exceptionally long and appreciate anyone who reads the entire post and further appreciate if you can offer any opinions or advice 

I had been in the market for new employment for about two months. During October, a really great opportunity came about for me to interview at a corporate company who looked after great brands. I had passed two interviews and an assignment. The final interview was a week before the end of the month, my current employer requires 2 month calendar notice for resignation (this aligned perfectly if I were to start fresh in Jan 2021). Dreading the week, I had only received the email two days before month end, that they would like to offer me the job in which they supported with an offer letter and contract to sign. They had stated I needed to sign within 48 hours

The offer letter stated that I would have a CTC that is 30% more than my current employer, a signing bonus as well as quarterly incentive. This looked to be very attractive, especially to anyone looking for new employment during a pandemic. I had woken up pretty early the next morning to go through the offer and contract - I wrote down a few questions and I had emailed the prospective employer these questions. I stated that before I sign, if they could feedback these queries. Three of my questions were around the incentive and how it work quarterly. 

No feedback received for 6 hours and I was becoming really anxious as I needed to sign and I needed to resign. In good faith, I had signed both the offer letter and the contract and sent it back with my queries attached yet again. 2 hours after that, I submitted my resignation. 

I only received a response a week later from the company’s HR thanking me for signing the documents and said they would be happy to answer any queries. I attached my initial pre-signature queries again and said I would he happy to discuss this on a call. No response

I followed up twice again on email. No response. 

My current employer already started my exit process which included the removal of my medical aid and other financial endeavors and to expire 31/12/20. At this point, I started to become really nervous around the prospective employer’s onboarding process as I have not heard back from them for 2 weeks and I needed to sign a transfer letter for medical aid

Finally, last Friday arrived and the HR department said they would call me at 3PM. I waited by my phone and nothing. I emailed them and I said I am ready to accept a call. Nothing for the next hour. I emailed on Monday asking if we can pickup the conversation as I really need my queries to be answered and to find out about the onboarding process. No response

I sent another email yesterday (Thursday) with a bit of an assertive tone saying we really need to discuss before the year closes out.

Got a response early morning saying they would call me at 3PM. I responded with a thank you and asked if it would be telephonic or conference call.

3PM arrived and nothing. I had emailed them again saying I’m ready to accept a call. No response. This time around, I spammed the number  on the email signature until someone eventually picked up

Finally initiated conversation, I had prioritized the request for transfer of medical aid. Employer said they’ll send me transfer letter immediately so billing would happen in Jan on their portfolio. I then requested if I could run down the list of queries I had sent initially in Oct (pre-signature)

Employer had now stated on this call that the initial offer sent (with the signing bonus and incentive) was an error on their side - they had sent an incorrect offer letter. Time stopped for me as this one of the big reasons why I signed in the first place. They said that the contract doesn’t state the signing bonus or incentive and since I signed the contract, it is the concrete document that secured the acceptance.

I told them I would return the call as I needed to collate thoughts and facts. I called up a few people for advice and went through all my documents again. The contract doesn’t state the signing bonus or incentive, correct but also, the offer letter has a legal line in which I signed. 

Employer emailed back attaching a new offer letter apologizing and said they made a typo with the original offer letter. 

I received a call 30min later asking if all was fine with the new documents. I had started to challenge the employer now stating that:

• I had sent pre-signature queries which included questions around the incentive
• I had signed a legal line in the offer stating that I had accepted the offer based on the offer conditions
• Noted that a typo is an incorrect spelling or incorrect figure - the signing bonus and incentive was spread across two paragraphs
•If they are okay with retracting the offer letter and revising it, they should be okay with retracting the contract and open up for negotiation.

I had then requested the weekend to think about the next move.

15 minutes later, I had received a call from someone else. This person, I would assume, took the bad cop approach. New employer representative apologized for the error, said it was a high pressure environment and they were sending out multiple offer letters. I had mentioned the above bullet points again, re-iterating that this made me sign under false pretense.  New employer representative said the contract was a concrete document and they would take that as final signature

Continuing the conversation, the final phase was basically them saying that I can happily fight this and lawyer up but they are on a recruitment scout and they need to know if I want the offer (without bonus or incentive) or not. They have backup candidates in which they can make the offer to. 

They have given me the weekend and I need to make a decision by Monday.

Basically rock bottom, and needed to cover my security of employment - I called my current employer asking if they could make an offer for me to stay. They put all cards on the table and presented me with a good offer.

This whole experience left a bitter taste with me.

If you made it this far, I really appreciate it and would further appreciate any opinions or advice you can offer on how to approach it.

- When I'm angry and I really want to share my feelings about why I'm hurt, I start shaking uncontrollably and can barely talk without crying. So instead of facing someone who hurt me or offended me, I have to leave the conversation before I make a fool of myself.
- I want to shine at work and make my voice heard but I'm so anxious about public speaking that I start having a panic attack before presenting something. Even speaking up in a meeting makes my heart race and my whole body shake like I'm going to die or something.
- Talking about my feelings is extremely hard because even when I want to talk about something I don't even care that much about makes my voice shaky and I feel like I'm about to cry.

I've been through tons of interviews in my professional life, but none before my last few in which my wife and I (M) been expecting our 2nd child in about 6 weeks. I've read tons of posts on forums, reddit, wherever and there seems to be a split decision on whether you need to tell them during the interview or to save that info till you get hired. I'm firmly in telling them at some point during the interview, withholding that information draws doubt into the employers mind and puts me in a bad spot to start I feel.

Now to my current situation, I got through my first phone interview with the director (who would be my direct manager as well) and just finished earlier today my 2nd interview, a video conference with him and his team. At no point yet have I indicated that we are expecting a baby soon. There still is a 3rd interview, however he only wants to have that with his top candidate to iron out details/offer. It felt weird in my mind to discuss my situation in the group interview today, but I'm also very conflicted as to if I've waited to long this time around about telling him. I know legally they can't ""cut"" me due pregnancy (but it would be damn near impossible to prove that's the reason, and I wouldn't even attempt to try), but I feel as though once I say that, its all that they would think about.

The role I'm interviewing for is opening up due to one of his members leaving after getting into her nursing program (she was also in the interview). Her timeline to leave lines up fairly close to our due date and it might instantly eliminate me in their minds. I need this job, but also want this job as it lines up with many of the things I'm looking for, for me and my growing family.

Do I email the director asking if he has a few spare minutes to talk at some point even though he and the team are still interviewing other candidates? Do I just wait and see if I get picked as the top candidate and talk to him about it then? Would he feel duped or as though I'm untrustworthy or lackadaisical about telling important information if I do wait till being the top prospect and then he rescinds the offer?

I just don't want to fight with her over it and I don't know how to convince her that I'm going to be fine living in Brooklyn. what should I do?",04Dec2020,1
496,"Hey friends, thank you in advance for taking the time to help me with this.

I have seen in recent months that I've been falling astray in completing my required homework/studies, noticing a clearly ""lazy"" path in my college studies.

While I'm well off, I've unfortunately been taking advantage of my freedom. While I'm only taking 12 credits of coursework, I've spent a frequent amount of time working out, watching videos, browse Reddit/discord, and occasionally game online. I do complete my basic level of schoolwork to have two A's in easy classes and two low B's (at risk of becoming C-D's) in tough classes.

I know very well that I should be accomplishing more, as I have the advantage of:

\- not worrying about forced time commitments

\- having access to various resources (tutors/textbooks/academic YouTube channels)

\- (I think) I'm generally considered as very smart but COMPLETELY lacking motivation in schoolwork, as I can comprehend difficult subjects pretty quickly, but do so last minute

\- I have shown that I \*can\* display significant motivation, from working long hours to complete homework/studies rapidly (not thoroughly), develop robot/software projects, transform my body through exercise

\- In addition, my mother, father &amp; sister have clearly shown me what true grit looks like, studying/working till their mentally drained.

My parents have even put on the line that if I can't enter my (desired) computer science graduate degree program due to grades, I may be forced to take time off school to work. I personally can't disagree with this, since I may need to learn the value of my education in order to take my schoolwork seriously.

I've read enough stories about children significantly less privileged than me who've have been able to achieve significantly in academics due to sheer grit and hard work, so I need to ask:

How can I instill sheer Grit/Determination towards aceing my college studies?

500,"It's come to light recently that a friend had been (I think unintentionally and thankfully rather poorly) gaslighting us. We confronted him about something fairly small but had been building for a while, and we all expected a simple apology and a follow through of him making just a little bit more effort but instead he spent hours pointing fingers and shifting blame. He discredited people and basically told them their feelings were wrong, he almost entirely denied any wrongdoing, and he twisted words and conversations but blamed everyone else for twisting things. He also tried really hard to convince me everyone was lying and out to get him, when everyone else actually made solid points I could see whereas what he was saying made no sense.

I really do think he is a good person, or wants to be, and I care about his wellbeing. He's also had a rough upbringing and said he doesn't want to be manipulative or a pathological liar like his mom, and I believe him on that. I think he doesn't realize what he's doing is manipulative. I'm still in contact with him because he struggles with bad depression and reached out to me in what felt like a cry for help since we all left and he's been completely alone. If he truly does want to change and be a better person, is there any way I could go about discussing this with him? I'm not sure if this is way over my head and I don't plan on being able to ""save"" anyone, but I know in the past I've been grateful later on for people mentioning my mistakes so I can grow. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get through to him on this? In your experience, is it even worth the energy to try?

As a side note, knowing what he's been doing I am being very careful and will end up leaving at some point. I have two different friend groups backing me up and keeping me grounded in case he makes me start to question myself. Of everyone in the group, he always seemed to listen to me the most, so if there is a shot I can get him to realize what he's doing I'd love to try, I'm just not sure what to say or how to bring it up.",04Dec2020,1
501,"I'm on a wait list for therapy (emdr) right now and I'm hoping I'll be getting professional help in maybe a month or two.

My boyfriend and I had a long talk last night about how I've kind of become a different person. We've known each other for years but we've only been dating a few months, and I'm experiencing bad side effects with my medication right now so the worst of me is definitely coming out. I feel these waves of misery, can't eat anything. I don't lash out but I become bitter and then I withdraw. I have a really hard time explaining what's going on because I don't really understand it myself, and so much of it boils down to self-hatred and I don't know how to tell him that.

I haven't really been myself at all in the past year, but until recently I was much better at hiding it. Now I'm in pain so much of the time, and I'm uncomfortable, and I take everything he says so personally, and I never seem excited anymore. I'm more negative than usual and he really just doesn't like this side of me.

I want to try really hard not to make it his problem. I don't really know what else I can do right now. I feel like I'm destroying the only thing that's keeping me on earth right now and I feel horrible about it.",04Dec2020,1

503,"My family comes from a region in South Asia that is heavily cultural and religious - everything revolves around tradition. My mother (F48) wanted me (F18) to be a doctor for years and it took a lot of arguments and back and forth for her to let me do my own thing which wasn't even that rebellious or radical - it was computer science. I literally wanted to do anything but medical and cs is the only thing we ended up agreeing on. Thankfully, she isn't controlling over my career anymore but still cares about me getting A's and all throughout University which I understand. Now, her concern has moved onto my love life which I haven't even thought about at all and she's already telling me specifics about who I should be marrying... I'm 18. 

I used to watch a bunch of kdramas and my mom got into it as well - more than me really, and now she doesn't want me to watch kdramas anymore becuase she's afraid that I'll get ""brainwashed"" and end up marrying an asian. 

She herself had a terrible marriage which gave me PTSD so fun. My aunts on my mom's side also have a lot of marriage issues and really no one in my family has a good marriage. My relatives whose marriages went ""well"" were more of companionships that were arranged marriages without any love whatsoever. My mom did marry for ""love"" but her marriage went terribly.

It's just sickening that I'm only 18 and my mother is already obsessed with marriage and that aspect of my life. I understand that hers didn't go well and she doesn't want me to make mistakes but still. It's just, how do I tell her that she lived her life and now it's my turn to live mine?",04Dec2020,1
504,"Here's a rundown of the situation:


I'm 17 and live with my parents. My home situation is already stressful and grating on my mental health because of previous trauma involving my parents and I have been planning to move out ASAP when I turn 18. I have bipolar disorder and severe depression that I've been newly medicated for, and I also regularly see a therapist. To keep me stable, I do two things a few times every week: see my boyfriend, and go to the local rock gym. 

I never made these decisions without first consulting my parents to see if they'd be okay with them. My decision to go to the gym was based on the fact that they had numerous safety precautions, like a 25% capacity rule, a  heavy duty ventilation system, masks on at all times policy, no loose chalk, no getting within 6ft of another person (which you already don't do when climbing), and spraying down your hands with alcohol between every route. I've also recently not even been climbing, instead opting to use their fitness area which is almost always empty. I also consulted my boyfriend's dad, who is a doctor with a lot of connections in the medical field, and together we talked to one of his physician friends and determined that going to the rock gym a few times a week would be a low enough risk. 

As for seeing my boyfriend and his family, they're basically the only things keeping me sane at this point. The risk with them is really low anyways because they don't have a bubble at all besides their own family, so I'm essentially the only ""outside"" contact they have. So these two things are what keep me out of deep depression, at least until I can leave.

My adult sister recently moved in with us too and got a new job where she is considered an essential worker. This is all fine until she tells us that there are positive cases of covid in her facility, and each day she comes back there are even more and more. She thinks her coworker and another staff member also might have it. We think the risk is relatively low until she tells us there are even MORE cases and that if she's ""miraculously not positive"" she will try to move out ASAP. She works in close contact with a number of potential positive cases, some of whom are now CONFIRMED positive cases, every single day, all day.

So I told her I would be moving all of my stuff down to the downstairs bathroom (we share one usually) and that I wouldn't be eating dinner with her and my family anymore. I even told her that this wasn't a personal affront or anything. Everything is fine until dinner that night, when I come downstairs to get food and she starts yelling at me. 

She said that me trying to take precautions is ""rich"" considering that I see my boyfriend and go to the rock gym, and that I don't really even care about the safety of the family and that she wouldn't be pissed off at me if I didn't do those things. I tried to tell her that me going to a very sparsely populated facility with a lot of safety rules for 2 hours a few times a week is not the same amount of risk as her working in close contact constantly with positive cases, not to mention I never would have done it if my parents had asked me not to and been uncomfortable with it, or if a doctor hadn't cleared it first. I also told her I was sorry she was upset and that this wasn't a personal attack on her or her career, it was just me deciding to take extra safety measures. The entire time she kept rolling her eyes and saying things under her breath, so I told her not to talk to me unless she was going to talk like an adult, and she stormed off upstairs. My dad told me that I was wrong to be nervous about it because the risk level is basically the same anyways and my mom said that she was sorry but it was too late for us to do anything so they wouldn't be taking any precautions.

Basically now I'm living in my room and I don't feel safe coming out. My mental health is taking a steady decline because I already didn't feel happy or comfortable in my household, and now that I'm being exposed to a high covid risk and ostracized by my family my anxiety and depression have been worsening. 

I made some plans with my friends and my boyfriend's family about me leaving for a few days until I can talk to my therapist and get some professional advice. I have multiple friends who would let me stay with them for a while, not to mention my boyfriend's family, who have been supportive this entire time. I'm not 18 so I can't just pack a bag and leave without repercussions yet.

 I'm planning to tell my mom I want to leave, but I know my dad will be angry and they most likely will not let me go. I guess my question is: how can I most safely leave? And if I can't, how do I make living at home as safe and bearable as possible?",04Dec2020,4

He taught me to drive my first car which just happened to be a manual so extra fun for him. But he made me get us home and wouldn’t drive and damn it really made me appreciate him for being so I guess real about things. Anyway it’s been hard since finding out, all the memories flood into my mind and I just start to cry. I never really knew who my real dad was and honestly he was the closest I’ve felt to having a dad. Just miss him and wish I could have said bye. The last time we spoke he was in the hospital trying to get me to sneak some dip in. Classic classic mission he always tried to send me on.

507,"I am very superstitious, and I always try to predict the future by finding similarities between things and events. I always think that being around certain types of people, eating certain foods, wearing certain types of clothes, and certain days can be good or bad luck. I was in this habit since I was 11 or 12, and it just sticks with me. I cross my fingers all the time, and I even try to use physiognomy and psychology to interpret people's moods and thoughts. I feel really awkward about it. Not guilty, insecure, or angry. Just plain awkward, especially considering that I've taken many math and science classes, and that my family is rather religious.

For example, I remember that about 5 or 6 years ago on August 24, something terrible happened. Now every year around this time I am scared and paranoid that something bad will happen.

510,"So im im highschool and i have been classmate with this one girl. This year we went on a trip for 3 days with our class, and we got together. The first 2 weeks were great. I had 2 girlfriends before her and she had 1 boyfriend. I felt like she was a really good girlfriend and i liked how the 2 weeks have turned out. Then some problems came. We talked about them and kinda worked them out. Now we have been together for almost 3 months. 3 days ago i suddenly got really really sad. I even started crying out of nowhere. I thought about whats the reason im sad, and after 2 days of thinking and feeling worse and worse, i think im sad cause of the relationship. I dont feel like she loves me or wants me. She only asked me once if i want to hang out, all the other times through the 3 montsh i was the one who asked her. The thing that made me realize this, was that we would have had a new years party with our classmates, but a lot of us cant make it and it turns out she want to go to a party with her old classmates. I thought at least the 2 of us would spend it toghether somewhere like all our friends in a relationship. I even mentioned it and she just ignored it. She sometimes doesnt respond to my texts. She doesnt make me room in her schedule, i only meet her when she doesnt have anything to do. I feel like people put their partners a little above then others, but with her i feel like im under her friends. When im at her house she doesnt want me to leave but other than that i dont really see that she wants me. I see all of this and i will talk about this with her but i fear that she wont react right. I only hope that she is like this to everyone and not just me, cause if thats so we can work on that a little bit and i can get a little bit looser, if she really loves me, but i fear thats not the case. I dont want to break up, cause i fear what will happen when we go back to school, and i would see her again. I also fear our shared friends. I dont want to make them unconfortable and i fear some of them will be distant with me cause they dont know the story, and they will only see that i broke up with her. I dont know what should i do because suddenly im really really sad every day when im alone and i dont know what to do about it, other than talk to her, but i fear that we might break up.  
She is known to be like this a little bit, but i feel like if she does love me she would act a little bit different with me than others.

What do you guys think i should do, if she doesnt react well to what i have to tell her. Should i just end it cause you think it will be better for me after a time or should i try to show her what is a normal relationship is like?

511,"I'm 13 M, and I live in a family of four, my father, mother, and elder brother. A few months ago my father (56) lost his job due to he said and I quote 'backstabbing' from his colleagues. I'm saying that because I'm not 100% sure about that part. Also my mom found out about him being with another woman a few months ago and made him erase contact with her.

 Then again a few weeks ago she started having suspicions about him being with another woman (maybe the same Idfk). I know for sure my father's been with prostitutes while my mom was away in another country a year ago. I also know my mother's been cheating on my father too. My father's health is pretty bad too. 

My brother (adult btw) who I pretty much hated for my whole life due to him being unimaginably selfish and violent as hell (belts, slippers, kicks, stabbed with a pen once, choking etc.) is suddenly being nicer to me and I think its a facade and not genuine at all. My father just returned drunk today night. He's also tryna get into businesses and shit (which he tried like 2 or 3 times before but it never worked out). I did pretty well in my exams imo (my average score was 92%) but still got yelled at a lot for them. This isn't new, I've been yelled at my entire life for my Marks and I get pressured a LOT for getting percentages like 95 and 100. I'm also pretty sure my father wouldn't care if I committed suicide, he says shit like ""when you don't get good Marks you'll hanging"" and even str8 up told me to kill myself if I didnt get 95% and shit. Oh, and He said that to my brother too. 

I don't think this level of shit should even be possible, I've thought of suicide too many times but I don't feel like I should take away my own life cuz of what *they* did (my ego comes in there) and what's happening. I've been thinking of running away but I can't think of any way I would survive by doin that. COVID would 1 tap me if my imagination is realistic enough. There aren't homeless shelters or anything where I live (atleast to my knowledge) either. 

TLDR: My dad lost his job, he's unhealthy, he cheated on mom 3 or 2 times, mom cheated on dad at the same time, brother put on a facade of being nice after being an astonishingly selfish and violent jerk for my whole life, parents pressure me A LOT for Marks, sometimes tell me to kill myself.",04Dec2020,1

I’m already going to be in a lot of debt from my past 2 years (first 2 years don’t have any money owed) so that is the reason I am still going. But it feels awful to not be nearly finished.

I used to change my major a lot so I know it’s my fault but now I just don’t know what to do!!,04Dec2020,2
513,"The one I am having issue pushing out of my head today.  I was in a small degree mill school so there was about 20 people in my class.  It was the same group for 7 hours a day.  But the end of the third week I was starting to feel unwelcome.  Just little thing like if I said hi or good morning I wouldn't get a response.  I just mentally tried to push it off as people tired to busy or didnt hear and never pushed it. 

Finally in got a clear answer there was a cafeteria down stairs.  I decided to sit down there.  I made my food and almost the whole rest of the class was down there I sat at the same row of tables but about 5 seats away from everyone.  I sat down and had about two bites of my food.  I never spoke I was looking down.  And one of the girls announces "" she was done eating and was going up stairs to hang out in the classroom""  the whole group got up and went upstairs. I held back tear and tried to remind myself it's entirely possible they were just at this point of their meal. 

I finished eating wash my dish cleaned my spot and went back up stairs.  Went to my locker went to the washroom filled my water bottle.  And finally went back into the classroom.  I didnt say anything again and just went and sat down in my spot in the corner.  The same girl announces ""its suddenly crowded in here I am going to the bakery for some space who is coming with me"" the main group all got up and left again.  This time I couldn't hold it back I cried.  I went to the washroom to hide until I could stop.  I went back to the classroom the rest of the group showed up just after the bell rang. 

I stoped going to the cafeteria after that eating raw itchaban noodles to avoid burdening them.  They never did the group walk out as long as I didnt sit near them.  If I did go to the cafeteria to microwave my lunch I would stand beside the microwave and stare at it until it was done and go back upstairs right away.  

About a month later I got called to a private meeting with the teacher.  The main group had decided I smelled.  I showered every day wore clean cloths and deodorant.  I did walk to school every day in the winter so maybe I sweat.  I asked the teacher if she thought I smelt bad she said no I smell fine but she had multiple complaints from the same person.  I told her this was harassment using her and I want the person punished.  The teacher said she wouldn't do that because it was to much work and the person wanted to remain anonymous.  

I counted down the days until the course ended.  I wanted to cry almost every day.  The only other interaction I can remember having is one girl actively trying to smash her cell phone so her boyfriend would buy her a new one.  I said that it was kind of selfish to do that.  And got ganged up on by the other 4 of us who where forced into a group and sitting in the hall.  About how I shouldn't judge people.  

They made a facebook group and where going around making sure everyone joined so they could have reunions.  They never asked me to join but they made a point of asking the girl who say beside me.  I did eventually try and join.  A month later when I was added the only message was ""thankyou everyone for rejoining the secret group be sure not to tell her about it""  I left the group right away.

I stoped trying to be apart of group after that.  I am university now and even though it is harder for me I do it all online partly because I live rural party because I don't want to be in a classroom again. 

I never really knew why I wasn't liked.   I was facebook friends with about 3 of the nice people who would say hi but nothing else.  It did come out eventually that the one girl thought I was a conspiracy nut and that is why she made sure everyone hated me.  I ended up deleting them facebook and blocking them all.  

I don't remeber every talking about conspiracy. So I still don't know where it came from.  The only thing I could think of is at graduation 6 month after the course had ended I was talking to one of the girls who would talk to me when she needed something from me.  And I said it sucked the one girl got swine flu.  It was the queen bee who had it.  We were sure if she had the semi nice girl called over queen bee and asked if she had swine flu.  She said no she had H1N1.  I said they are the same thing they relabeled it as H1N1 because it was hurting pork sales.  She called me stupid and walked away.  I tried to say sorry.  

I have thought to find them again to ask why.  I didn't get good marks.  The teacher didnt favor me.  I am not pretty in fact I am fat and my hair usually was balled up messy on the back of my head.  I was no threat to the class of girls.  But I know I will never get an answer.  

How do I get rid of these thoughts.  I will add I have done therapy it's still hard.  And I have started antidepressants which worked well and I can feel that they are getting weaker and I havent been on them for 4 months.",04Dec2020,1
514,"One of my biggest dreams in high school was to graduate early, just like a year early. My reason for this was because I was already ahead and on track to do that and I thought why not? I only have one chance to graduate high school early, so why not right? But then came my junior year, I was caught up in problems and I let that affect my studies, so I ended up not being able to graduate that year and had to stay for my senior year. That made me really sad and even til today, I still am hard on myself for not accomplishing that goal. You see, I really really could've easily attained that goal, but I just let myself get distracted. That's what makes it even worse. The fact that it was already in place for me, but I just let myself go.

Then comes college, I took a year and a half off because I just didn't know what to do and I was so hard on myself for not graduating early and with the honors I wanted. I thought I needed a break to get myself together, but contrary to most gap year stories I heard, mine wasn't very life-changing. I was still the same. So, I started community college in a spring semester and since I wasn't able to graduate high school early, I made a new goal--to gradate college a semester early since I started in the spring. But guess fucking what? I can't achieve that goal either. I fucked up these past 4 semesters because of my depression. It's worse too because like high school, I really was able to achieve my goals, but I let my problems affect me and let myself go. So now, I have to repeat 2 classes for the FOURTH time next semester and I have to take a 5 credit math class again next semester and this math class is a prerequisite for a class I need for my major so graduating a semester early is really impossible for me. And I keep putting myself down for not achieving those goals and it makes my depression worse. I don't want to end up not graduating at all, so how can I get over this feeling of being worthless and incompetent?",04Dec2020,1
515,"I’ll try and keep it as short as possible. 

I got together with my girlfriend about 9 months ago. But recently over the last 2 months she’s been distant. She only comes round when it is convenient for her and the last time we have been “intimate” was also about 2 months ago. 

She only seems to talk about herself, never really asks how I’m doing and whenever problems arise in the relationship never talks openly about the problem. 
The only time I seem to see her is when it’s convenient for her I.e. when she has to work near me, which is about 2 times a week. On those nights she just stays at my place and we talk about her daily problem, I end up cooking, she rolls a joint, gets high and we watch something then go bed.

It’s gotten to a point where it’s a drag. Even though I like her very much, she acts like a child with given situations. Especially when I try to have conversations about problems. 

Yesterday my ex, whome I’ve been friends with for the last 6 years wrote to me, asking if I wanted to meet up. We message usualy in. 6month basis, from previous experience this has ended up in sex, other times it hasn’t. 

I really don’t know what I should do.
I don’t want to cheat on my girlfriend. I’ve been cheated on before. But at the same time it sucks that her behavior and inability to communicate is pushing me away from her.

*Update*

Your responses have all been somewhat unanimous.

I think instead of meeting my ex at my place I’ll meet her in Restaurant.

I’ve met her before when she was in a relationship 
and was having trouble and asked me for opinions. So I’m just going to do the exact same.

This will confirm to her internally that I’m in a similar situation as she once was and prevent sexual tension from happening. It will also prevent her from sleeping at my place.

I don’t want to break up with her just yet. The thing is we have similar interests and we work in the same field. It’s just I wished there were some aspects that would change. So I’ll just try and tell her that and hope she can understand.",04Dec2020,7
517,"I'm 30 years old and have never had issues with eating disorders. I work as a veterinary technician and ever since our first lockdown in March, we have been so insanely busy that we basically have no time to breathe, let alone eat during the day. At the start, one tech took furlough for 2 months and another panicked and thought she was sick, so was out for 2 weeks and then came back very part time, working 2-3 shifts per week for 2-3 months. During this time, only my boss and I were working full time. 

  
We don't schedule appointments from 12-2pm so everyone can take lunch, and the doctors can catch up. When it was just the two of us working, my boss and both doctors would leave for the entire 2 hour lunch period. I needed to cover reception for the first hour so the receptionist could go to lunch, but the volume of calls and people trying to walk in never slowed down. So, by the time she would come back from lunch, it would be a full blown shit show and because the phones were ringing off the hooks with people calling for medical advice, I couldn't take a lunch. This continued on nearly a daily basis for 2 months. I tried talking to my manager about it, but like everything, she blew me off. 

  
It's now December and I've lost a significant amount of weight (40 lbs at least since the start of the pandemic, 75 lbs since last july). I don't feel hunger anymore and I have to force myself to eat most meals. Even though we are more staffed up now (still short at least one tech though), I still find myself cleaning up after everyone else and taking care of all the work that no one else feels like doing. There is another tech that works here who just does what she feels like doing and leaves the rest for someone else (likely me), so I end up carrying both our weight. I have mentioned this coworker to my boss before, but they used to work together before they both came here, and she shows obvious favoritism toward this person, so she always makes excuses for her and disregards my complaints. 

  
I am the type of person who assumes so much responsibility and when I see things not getting done, I have to take care of it rather than delegate. I know this is a huge problem and I'm trying to fix it. This has become a serious issue this year because that means I am always sprinting around work, trying to do everything myself while the other techs just kick back and hang out. At least that's what it feels like. I finally have a virtual doctor's appointment next week and will hopefully be able to figure out what is happening to me, but I'm so unbelievably exhausted and burnt out. I can't afford to quit my job, and though I keep looking for other work, I haven't had any luck. 

  
I can't keep going like this and I feel like i'm wasting away into nothing. I needed to lose weight, so i'm not at a totally unhealthy weight right now, but i'm on the cusp. I'm 5'10"" and 135 lb currently. I haven't been at this weight since at least high school. But even though I'm trying to gain some of it back, I can't. I just keep losing. I'm so tired, anxious, sad, and angry all the time. My job is ruining my life and I feel like I have to choose between keeping a roof over my head and my health. 

  
I know I need to leave my job. While it's the least toxic hospital I've worked at, it's still toxic. That's just vet med. The coworkers don't care, the doctors expect you to basically have their level of expertise for a fraction of the pay, the hours are excruciating, and the clients are entitled nightmares. I'm trying to stay positive, but this year and this job are destroying my physical AND mental health (what's left of it), and I just feel stuck and don't know what to do. I know I can't be the only one going through something like this, so I figured I'd scream into the void in case anyone else feels like commiserating with me over it and sharing your experiences, I would love to hear them.",04Dec2020,1

She sent money over for the gifts and received a tracking number from global Express mailing shortly thereafter (https://globalexpressmailing.com/).

So I went to High School X I did my maturity exam there, got my diploma. 
Then half a year later I decided that I want to repeat my English(foreign language) test but now, instead of the general I went with advanced, which is harder.

Because I already left school X they've sent me to take the test in a different school, let's call ot Y. 

They took my diploma, and gave me a new one, but with all my grades that I did in school X. 

So because the application requires both the maturity exam and grades from the school in order for WES to process it, how should I prove that I went to school X instead of Y and I only did the advanced English in Y?

My mum and also my grandmother use social media quite a lot for example facebook, instagram, twitter etc and ever since i was really small they both have been obsessed with posting every small thing about me. I can understand that this was acceptable as i was younger and of course it’s nice to share cute pictures of my childhood but it’s just getting too much now. There is info of my school, city, age and pretty much every relative i have. 

Im also not 5 anymore and I have tried to explain that i would like things to be more private now as i’m getting older and i have the decision whether or not i want my info to remain private because it’s my life. She care about it and says i’m overreacting.

Whenever I’m doing something nice as a family or going out with my farther, my mother is always needs her phone near her and on her phone she’s either constantly sneaking pictures of me (when she knows i don’t like it) and posting them publicly without permission or she’s sharing the location of where i am. I don’t feel comfortable around her anymore and i don’t feel in control of what i do. My farther is concerned too. As soon we bring it up that we don’t like what she’s doing she gives the guilt to me and says that i’m “stopping her from sharing memories”.

BUT I literally don't have any alternative that could potentially interest me. I did what i was told and tried a few internships in different fields and I liked nothing.

I am afraid I will never be happy because I am doing the wrong job but I also have no idea what job would be better.

He thinks and acts like him now. And a few days ago he said we now know the truth as to why my father hitted my mum in self defense i was like wtf my brother he was smirking as well it felt so wrong i was in shock. That wasnt true at all. My mother never tried to hit him and even then its wrong to hit her in...such a way that...you know.

My brother believes him fully it hurts to see i feel like my father has gaslight me
Through him
He obviously knows my brother is close to me it feels like he is driving a wedge between us and yesterday my brother we were play around and he said that i was 'manipulated' he said that out of the blue he smirked at me and i asked him more questions he wasnt open to answering because of our father. It hurts to hear my brother believe him and my father manipulate him and before my father used to say there wasnt any violence or anything.
But now he's saying this
He's a snake
Like the rest of his family
And i suppose my brother is now too
They gotten so close i feel left out and i feel like my father is just doing this to hurt me especially because im taking my mothers side on this.

My back story is quite long my parents are pakistani muslim and came here to the uk they didnt like each other at all they were forced to marry eachother they are cousins. Then i was born this werent so good between him and my mother he used to beat her. My mother had no one here my brother was born later he may have autism as well and the domestic violence got so bad and my mother had to call the police we moved to a different city moved around looking for a permanent home. My mother then became mentally ill i think she has schizophrenia. She sexually assaulted us we got put into foster care. Father found out we now live with him.

535,"Why this is important to me:  

I have a **really** sensitive nose. I can smell dinner from about a mile away and when I get a cold I cannot stand anything scented (I learnt this the hard way trying to Christmas shop in a bath bomb/candle store).

This wasn’t too bad but getting into my teen years and hanging out with fellow outcasts obviously led to me becoming a bit familiar with a *certain smell* of a certain ‘green maple leaf’. I hate the stench of it, it’s horrible and even a whiff creates a bad reaction- a bit side-tracking but I accidentally walked into a hotbox room at a house party and wow did I have a headache for a long time. 

All of this to say that Mr Judas is something I cannot stand.

**The situation:**

My dad has a lot of friends from uni (he and I go to the same place- he’s retired and wanted to study writing blah blah blah). One of these friends is notorious for making lovely trinkets as well as dabbling in said special flakes.

My dad thought it would be nice to get me something for my birthday and seeing as I like foxes and anime (not a weeb but rip) he got her to create a nice package for me. Come my birthday I open his gift and I have a lovely nine tailed fox key chain in a plastic bag. I open it up and am immediately drenched in the smell. Half an hour of coughing later I managed to get the smell out of my respiratory system and decided to let the gift ‘air out’ for a while.

It’s now about a month after and my mum decided to bring all the gifts still downstairs up to my room. I had completely forgotten about the key chain until I opened my door and got greeted with a face full of special granule smell. 

I’ve tried circulating the air and getting other smells in but nothing seems to be working. Also the second I touch the key chain I get ‘residue’ on my fingers and they stink and then I have to wash my hands again- note the ‘residue’ isn’t actually visible but is clearly transporting the smell from the key chain to my fingers.

I’m sorry if I seem like I’m overreacting but I’ve got to sleep soon and I have no clue how to get rid of this stench. I also can’t leave my window open all night because it is freezing so I just feel a little backed into a corner and need a bit of help from peeps who may be a bit knowledgeable in this. 

Probably sounds bad from outsiders (young adult wants to get suspicious smell out of bedroom) but I don’t really care- I just want this out so I can sleep and get rid of the blooming headache building up. If not I may have to sleep downstairs tonight- though it won’t help my gecko living in my room.

Any and all help appreciated- feel free to laugh, I understand this is a silly situation and sounds *really* bad to anyone from the outside.

Sorry if I rambled, I'm just awkward and need some help please x",04Dec2020,0

We have been friends for a couple years but it’s just surface level friendship and we barely ever talk about things that are deeper. Only maybe once or twice. We mostly just make jokes in our engineering class we share. We live in a pretty secluded area of Florida surrounded natural land it’s pretty yee haw if you ask me and everything is extremely spaced out. It’s takes a long time just to get the grocery store. 

They gave very minimal details about the party and only gave me an address which he said was a ”house” his family had rented out and he was inviting a small group of friends to hang out there that Friday night. At first I was like oh okay! cool this should be fun and I didn’t look at the address until later. A couple days went by and texted him for more details about the party. I later found out the general time of the party was around 6 PM. The address of the party was an 1 hour and 30 minutes away from our town. This seemed a bit far to me and I was confused about the house we were staying in so I asked him a the house and he said they had rented it out for the week. So I’ve seen him everyday at school on time, so he’s either getting up early and driving an hour everyday from the house to school or not even staying at the house for most of the week and is driving from home to school like normal. Doesn’t that seem like a waste? When I asked him about who was going to be there as well he only said ”my friends” which I’m assuming are they people we both know and hang out with but usually when it comes to gatherings like this it’s established who’s going to be there at least among our friends it is.

555,"I live with someone who has a real problem waking up for work. Even though I don't have to, I constantly get pissed off and wake that person up because I know he/she can be fired from work. They would be fired from work, given how many times I've just barely woken them up at the very last minute. 

I'm tired of it. Obviously it's not my responsibility, but I need something that I could just use to condition that person to gtf up. I tried googling for some sort of app-controlled air horn, but to my surprise I couldn't find a single damn thing! I want to be able to just click a damn button and shake that person up from a sleep, no matter how deep. Hopefully doing that 100 times will condition that person to be a damn adult.

559,"Hey there. You all probably know that we're not living a fully-egalitarian world when it comes to gender equality. I'm always thinking that men and women could have close experiences in terms of personality and emotionality if there were no such BSs identifying us as X or Y.

 About a month ago, while I was researching about these kind of stuff, I started to notice that there are some articles saying that there is really a difference between men and women in terms of personality and emotions, and I was like ""BRUH."" . But when I started to deep dive into these, I was totally scared. They were not talking based on sh\*tty cultural assumptions, but the underlying structure was science itself. Since people in science wants and tries to ""really"" prove the arguments based on systematic stuff, I consider it as something that deserves lots of respect, unlike culture. That's where the problem started for me. According to those articles, there were indeed differences in personality and emotionality aspects. And those were there because of the roles of male and female in ancestral societies. They came into place because female had to look after the children, while male had to supply food and other sources to others. But let's focus on that for example, when I think about that in 2020, it doesn't seem reasonable anymore. We're not hunter-gatherers anymore, we have MUCH wealthier societies and because of that, me and other male people should be able to care about their children as much as women do, and that's because WE ALL ARE HUMANS IN FIRST PLACE, not men or women, and we can also do a lot of other good things about our children's wellbeing rather than bringing them food or money. Also, we shouldn't forget that women are much more employed in modern society.

And one of the weirdest parts of these researches is they say, in more gender egalitarian cultures (like Scandinavia), the gap between men and women widens. WHAT?

But still in a society that is on path to consider men and women more and more equal, it seems pretty much nonsense to have instincts that still divides us, because, let's not forget, we are miles ahead compared to thousand of years ago, and we all deserve to experience same emotions at same amounts because we're humans in first place rather than men or women.

I'm so insistent on this because as a male living in Turkey, I really feel the lack of emotional equality between men and women SO MUCH, and I consider myself as a person that is so emotional, as much neurotic as what women are considered to be, and tries to care about everything in life like a normal person IMO does. I really feel alone when I look at other male people. They absolutely don't deserve to be different. Yeah, they also have emotions but not as much as women have and in addition to that, they mostly seem like less-caring about things, their hearts are less-filled-with-love, their friendships seem much less to be emotional, and as the result they seem a bit more like robots in my eyes. In the end, most of my friends (like 80-90%? idk) are women because I feel MUCH better when I'm spending time with them. They really know how to live the life (chef's kiss). Those emotional moments between us are ADORABLE, I mean, really. I think enjoying that is everyone's right. And I'm totally not surprised since in socially terrible countries like mine, men are taught not to cry, not to feel emotions because that's the job of women, right? Am I a woman to feel something, huh?

Bruh.

We should be enjoying every emotion in our lives as much as possible. Love, hate, happiness, sadness; we all need to feel both awesome, terrible, and weird in our lives, because that's the meaning of it. We don't know what will happen to us when we die, we don't know if we have a second chance on this planet. We all have the same opportunities, have access to same sources as men and women. THOSE HUNTER-GATHERER DAYS PAST. It is totally unreasonable to still have different roles. We all deserve to be the same.

These are my thoughts, I think everyone should have same opportunities when it comes to emotions, but they are simply not given at all. We have a long way to walk even if we are becoming more and more egalitarian in every aspect, but those scientific sh\*t bothers, annoys and scares me so much. And after many days, I thought I need help of the many other people's thoughts, experiences and help around the world. And dear reader, don't forget that I love you just because you're a human that deserves to live this life! \^.\^

561,"Hey everybody, I’m currently a junior in high school and I have a 2.5 GPA. As you can probably assume based off my given GPA, I performed terribly academically my freshman and sophomore year of high school. Mainly due to personal issues such as depression. 

Junior year came around and I found myself having to take care of my mom. She’s currently having issues with her gallbladder which is putting her in an excruciating amount of pain. My dad is a truck driver so he’s home maybe once every 2 months and both my brothers work late. This leaves me as caretaker of my mother. 

As a result, I’ve missed several classes (zoom) which in turn has caused me to fall behind the rest of my peers. My grades are in ruins. And seeing my mom in pain has taken a massive toll on my mental health. Some days I find the stress to be borderline unbearable and It’s been especially hard trying to stay motivated to get anything done. 

I see no future for myself with my measly GPA of 2.5. And in all honesty, I view myself as a complete and utter failure. I’m lost and I just don’t know what to do from here. Is there any hope for me? Am I a failure? What are the chances of me even getting into college with a GPA like this? I just want to stop being an embarrassment to my family &amp; to myself. I just want it all to end.

I’m 23F, have my own place, and my boyfriend (24), lives with me. We’ve been together for a while- about 4 years now. And it’s a fucking nightmare at this point. Our communication has always been a problem, we don’t know how to talk to each other nor do we know how to listen. He’s very hostile, aggressive, and quick to anger while I’m the opposite. I don’t like to argue, don’t like to yell, or fight. But since were under the same roof it’s impossible to get along. 

This is where it gets real bad... he’s abusive. Mentally, physically, verbally, emotionally.. just all across the board. This has always been an issue and I’ve learned no matter how many chances I give and no matter how many apologizes he’s given, he will never change and will always treat me like this.

He’s put his hands on me, thrown me around, and knocked me over a number of times. When I go to try to call the police, he takes my phone. There’s damage to my apartment now from him throwing things and kicking the door. He’s broken several of my things within the apartment but even before that he had broken two of my phones and countless other things. 
He calls me out of my name constantly and says things to me no one deserves to hear. It’s taken such a toll on me and mentally I’m just breaking down. It’s all been going on for way too long. 

Before i moved into this new apartment I was living at home. And when I would try to break things off/block him, he would call me endless times, text me threats, would show up at my house even and has broken my bedroom window at my moms house. He’s shown up when I would be leaving for work and took my phone and I couldn’t get it back for a week.

I’m so tired of living with him and being with him. I have no support nobody knows any of this or how bad it really is. I can’t talk to my mom or family about it because.. I just can’t, it would literally crush them. I don’t have too many friends but I can’t bring this to them either. It’s just been getting worse and worse and I can’t take it anymore. 

My only one option is to call his mom and tell her what has been going on. But I’m so scared.. 

Any advice would go a long way, I don’t know what to do.",04Dec2020,1
567,"I initially posted this onto r/virgin but that sub is quite male-centred and at times a little ignorant to the experience of girls, so I'll try here. I'm a 17 year old girl. I'm originally from southeast Europe but I live in the UK and attend a sixth form college (basically a high school but only for students aged 16-18). Since starting there in September, I can't help but feel extremely alienated by the fact that many, and possibly most, students have sexual and romantic experience.

I understand that many of you will laugh at the idea of a 17 year old girl feeling insecure about this, but it's difficult to be surrounded by people who are experienced when you've never been kissed and not feel left out. Like, I just want to experience sex. I want to feel like I can be enough for someone sexually.

I've never kissed anyone, never been 'asked out', never done anything remotely sexual with anyone else. If I had to count the number of people who've expressed a sexual interest in me, it would probably be a number that can be counted on one hand. I try not to let it get to me, but it sucks, and it makes me feel unattractive. I'm autistic, and whilst I'm not, like, a Sheldon Cooper-type, I'm quite noticeably awkward and reserved. I feel like this is a curse in many ways because it restricts my ability to express myself freely. I'm not cold or stand-offish at all in personality but my disability masks this.

High school was pretty difficult for me and a large part of that was because of bullying, particularly towards my appearance. This spiked particularly within my last year, which ended earlier this year. I was constantly being called ugly to my face and getting laughed at whenever I walked past people. NOT that it would be justified if I wasn't, but I'm physically healthy, not over/underweight and hygienic. I also put effort into things like skincare, haircare etc. Given the amount of thought I put to my appearance, I genuinely couldn't understand why it was happening. I just assumed I must really be ugly in ways I can't change. It completely shattered the growing confidence I had in my appearance.

These two things combined worry me. It makes me sad that I'm at this point and have no experience romantically or sexually, but it also gives me fear that I will stay this way for some time. I genuinely don't think I'm that unattractive but I worry that perhaps I'm wrong for that. I should clarify that I am NOT an incel in any way; I don't harbour any anger towards anybody about this situation. It's just an insecurity of mine that I'd like to get support/advice from this sub for. I want to have sex, goddamn it!",04Dec2020,3

570,"Dear Reddit.

My girlfriend and I have recently moved into a new apartment, in the capital of our country.
After a few weeks, another tenant moved in upstairs from us.
Unfortunately, she then immediately started obnoxious parties, throwing cigarette buds out the window, playing loud music early in the morning and having loud sex in the wee hours of the night.

This has progressed to a level where it hurts our sleep cycles. Being awakened by a loud female moaning and a bedframe rhythmically hitting the walls, is not very conducive to a good night's sleep.

I ask you for any advice possible. I have written to the landlord, with no concern or action taken. I have even left her a note letting her know of the 'thin walls' in our apartment complex.

Hope you can help me with some creative advice.

A lot of the problems arise from the people I’m contracting for not being able to pay me on time or pay me at all. 

My landlord has been pretty nice but I feel she’s starting to get annoyed because this is the third time this has happened (I don’t owe anything, I always pay the full amount with late fees even though she doesn’t ask for it, I’ve never been 30 days late, For example, the first time I was 2 weeks late but paid in full with a fee I put in myself and then I paid the rent on time 2 weeks later) I texted her when rent was due and explained that I’m waiting on a check and would be able to pay her on Wednesday. She never responded. Normally, she says something back that’s very sweet and it eases my anxiety but this time she just ignored it, which is making my anxiety flair up like crazy.

She only calls me to cry and I end up lecturing her and sounding like a dick trying to get her to see a therapist. We've been telling her for years but she's convinced it wont help and hates therapists because of her time in ED clinics. I don't think her health is on the line right now, like she's not underweight anymore, but she wakes up hating herself and struggles with school and talks about suicide every time.

I've considered an ultimatum where I just wont talk to her until she gets help but I'm worried she might kill herself if she doesn't have anybody and it'll be my fault. 

Please help. 
Thanks.",04Dec2020,3
595,"My girlfriend and I have had to do a long distance relationship due to covid.

I made a post before about how all her messages are one word answers and theres very little effort to engage in conversation. She also started dropping me a message and then not responding for hours...

Anyway, today I decided to admit to her that I'm feeling really down and lonely and that everytime she initiates conversation and then ignores me the rest of the day, it really hurts. She proceeded to ignore me for 15 hours and send me a picture of a cake... 

I'm not sure what to do. It just feels like my feelings are being ignored and it's starting to really affect me mentally. 

What should I do?

I've had issues with being in a low place and some other more unsavoury ways of dealing with it for years but have only had school/uni (at the time) counselling and never taken it that step further because I really dislike talking about why I feel this way. I'm surrounded by people with diagnosed mental ilnesses and have noticed some things are very similar but I don't know how anyone actually knows if they should get diagnosed nevermind trying to.

600,"My brother (24) is ignoring me (25/f) and our sister.

This happened last January for like two weeks until my dad called him and told him how bothered/worried I was by the fact that he wouldn't reply to me. And then he acted like ***I*** was crazy for being so concerned.

He lives on an Air Force base in the western US and we all live in the south and southeast. He's 24.

Anyway it's happening again. I was trying to coordinate our parent's Christmas gifts like I did last year. We split the cost for their gifts and last year it went perfectly. This year the cost was WAY lower. Each of us only had to pay $18.32 if we all pitched in. My sister was being completely cooperative but my brother ignored the messages, if he read them at all.

He can't even muster the strength to say ""yes, i'll help"" or ""I can't this year, sorry"". Literally any response to indicate if he wants to help out or not.

Nothing drives me more crazy than being ignored. It's the easiest thing in the world to send a simple message. I don't even care if he wants to help or not. Just don't leave me hanging.

When he comes out of this funk, I ask him what was going on and he says ""idk, just didn't feel like answering"" as if that's acceptable at all. We had previously agreed that if he ever felt like this again, he should just do a reaction (on FB messenger) or send some kind of emoji, just to indicate that he's seen the message and he's not going to ignore me. It worked for a while, but now he's back to completely ignoring.

I can't understand why he does this but it drives me mad. I feel like he's doing it on purpose because he's unhappy and this is the only way he can feel like he has control in his life. He knows that his family will not abandon him, so he shakes us around and watches us scramble.

I have decided to just stop trying to talk to him. I am not going to pester him about the gifts and my sister and I have already purchased them. I am conflicted about whether or not I should send him gift for Christmas because I'm mad at him. But also because I think he will react callously to it.My parents sent him money last year because they didn't know what to get him and he just never cashed the check because ""he doesn't need it"". That pissed me off because it's a freaking gift. Like just have dinner on us. They're not doing it because they think you need help.

Idk, there's probably a lot that I don't understand about being in the military, but I just feel like it's the meanest thing you could do to someone, especially around Christmas.

601,"My roommate (57F) has been on a bender for about a week, and by ""bender"" I (32F) mean...

It's bad enough that she's been soiling herself instead of using the bathroom and just lies in her own mess, hasn't been bathing.

605,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on reddit, I know its a longer one but bare with me! 

So recently I've been thinking and realiseing this more and more. And honestly it has started to severly bother me, way more then ever before. To a point of constant underlying sadness. It could be called  an emotional crisis of sorts.

So I've realised that I have no idea who I am, like, not in the slightest. I just base myself on what other people told me and I always have. All my life I've been making sure I please people to the maximum, minicing, traceing and remembering every single little thing they said or did. The way they speak, the gestures they make, the things they most like talking about and phrases they use most commonly. So basically I have adapted myself to be a different person to every single person I know, to please them, avoid conflict, for them to see someone they like and stick with me. 

I think it all begun with my parents divorce. I was 6 at the time, thats about the time a kid starts to develop a personality I feel like. So both my parents weren't in good places at the time, my mom was in a especially bad place, I was living with her now, and I was always walking on eggshells around her. So I did everything in my power to please her and not iritate her further. My dad on the other hand, I was scared of him, he never actually did anything to me like at all, but I was always intimidated by the way he talked and his aura seemed treathening. The fact that I was mostly raised by my mom up till that point anyways didn't help the fact that I didn't know much about him nor how to communicate with him, so I tried to please him as well.

And the further I went I kept doing that with everyone cuz it seemed to work. All the friends I had in kindergarten, in middle school and anything inbetween, I've lost them all. All because of the fact that I was ""too good"", and not in an egoistic type of way, in a way that I again, researched all they liked and stuck to those topics, which I mostly didn't care about , being the kid that knew everyone elses problems because it was easy for everyone to dump them on me, I would soak that up like a sponge because all I wanted was for people to stick around me. My life fuel is other people's appreciation and compliments, I need constant approval to keep running. 

And what I've come to realise, these kind of relationships don't last. I'm 17 now, in highschool, and I've finally met some people that seem to be the right ones that will stick around. I love them all and I'd call them my first real friends. But I've started to do the thing again, pleasing them to the max for them to like and compliment me and now that I'm the one that has to talk or share something of my own... I don't know how to do it without it being shallow. Everything I ever did in my entire life is mimic others. My own words disgust me because they are someone elses, someone I copied them from. I have  a fear of sharing anything, this amazing trait especially shines in a 1on1 conversation, where I am downright misserable. This I realised a day ago when I invited a friend to hang out with and akward silence was not a stranger. And so, everything gets akward and people start backing away. I dont know how to stop this. I don't know how to talk, as soon as the spotlight is on me I shut down completely. I want to be able to share the things I want to share and say the stuff I want to say without the hesitation and the fear that everyone will leave me the moment they realise I feel like a blank sheet. I want to feel joy and have honest, heart tugging conversations with my friends and be stupid with them. I really really want to make myself me and open up , but I feel like I'm building a build-a-bear plush but I let other people pick the parts they like instead of picking them myself, it is my plush afterall. But I don't know how to do that, where to start. I feel bland and pathetic. This big wave of saddnest kind of comes and goes away, but a lingering emptyness is always here. And I am slowly but surely breaking apart, it happened before but this time I want to do the right thing, I really, with all my heart, want to build a real me this time.

I feel like this would be a right time to build my personality up correctly, finally.  I feel motivated and I really want to do it! So any advice on where to start would be greatly appreciated! 

I'm very glad I got this off my chest! Sorry for repeating myself do much and the bad spelling, English isn't my first language so I'm kinda limited for now.

610,"
I’m [25M] stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’ve been dating my girlfriend [25f] of 8 years since high school, and my parents absolutely despise her. My parents have been incredibly supportive throughout my life and have helped me through medical school (which I’m half way through as an international student) with my dad working long hours to put me through. The hatred didn’t start over night, and they’ve allowed me to bring her home constantly and been nice to her however. My dad has defended her multiple times and convinced my mom to look with open eyes many times, which she has, however her opinion has almost gotten worse. It’s been the cause of argument in our house for a long time. At one point I hid the fact from my girlfriend for a long time after which I told her and she was incredibly upset. 

Although the relationship was temporarily patched up between my mom and my girlfriend, it looks almost unrepairable right now despite my best efforts. My girlfriend knows my mom does not like her, but is unaware of this level of dislike as I just had this conversation with my parents recently. I plan on telling her ASAP and seeing what her response is.

Initially, this was because of some stupid things such as my mom not liking the way we looked together or other small things. However after a brutal conversation this week, she has brought up some legitimate arguments. My girlfriends parents have been nothing but nice to me, but my parents have reported them being rude/ non courteous (on multiple occasions such as not inviting them in for tea when dropping items off, not greeting them out in public, never have invited them into their house even when speaking on their porch), anti social, and having family problems (from talking to others individuals that know my parents). All of which have happened and are not exactly things that I can reason out or make excuses for. My parents have also reported my girlfriend being socially awkward on occasions such as being too touchy feely at the wrong times, not greeting them, being hard to hold conversation with and feel like she does so to spite or poke at them. They feel as though she’s not genuine and anything caring she may do is to appease me although I don’t see it that way.

Her parents are starting to make more of an effort after 8 years, however my parents l feel it is fake as I am heading towards the end of medical school and they are now showing interest. This being said my parents have not made a great deal of effort in the past but have always been kind to her parents.

I love my girlfriend dearly. My parents have told me to explore my options with other girls as I live abroad, and I’ve met other girls in my life that I could not see myself being as happy with. She’s been supportive of me throughout school and through a long distance relationship that she had no say in as I made the choice to attend school abroad myself. My friends like her and she is strong minded and motivated. That being said I have seen some of these behaviors they’ve pointed out. They’re worry is that even though I can tell her to change her ways, that she will only do so as a temporary fix until we are married at some point.

My mother has basically told me I have the freedom to Make whatever decision I choose, however she does not wanted to be involved with them whether they begin to make an effort now or not. She has said if I marry this girl, that I should not expect it to be a wonderful happy family that all sees each other often. 

My parents and sibling are truly important to me which I have told my girlfriend and she has always supported. I want to ideally have that happy marriage where everyone gets along. I’m not sure what to do as I truly love my girlfriend as well. Is this all a misunderstanding from lack of communication between our families (they’ve met more than a few times), or are they right in saying they predict the indications they’ve seen with her family will give me a tough married life with my girlfriend. 

I’m not sure what to do as I plan to have a conversation with my girlfriend as I go away with her family this week. Are these grudges and experiences so deep now that they cannot be mended? Will telling them only cause a temporary fix? I’m feeling like I’ve run out of options to choose between her and them.",04Dec2020,2

I do have a really good group of friends at home but I'm at uni for the next few years other than holidays, but at uni, while I like everyone and am a part of a fairly good social group, I'm certain that while they don't dislike me, I am without a doubt most people's least favourite person (e.g: if everyone was chosen one at a time, I'd be last). Nobody from either my home or uni friends really know that I've been struggling.

Because of my aforementioned quietness and awkwardness I know that I definitely take longer than most people to make good friends, and as such I've never had a girlfriend or even done literally anything with a girl. 

At uni, I feel really left out because my friends often go out but don't seem to consider asking me, which makes them sound like awful people but they aren't, some of them are some of the kindest people I have met. I put this down a little bit to the fact that I don't have a best friend at uni, I have friends but no-one really close, despite living together.

I also don't really seem to have any motivation to do basically anything, and I keep getting up after 1pm. Both of these mean I'm getting quite behind on my uni work. And when you study engineering getting behind is not fun.

621,"I seem to have a hard time telling people when they've hurt my feelings. I worry that I'm being overly sensitive or defensive, and I bottle up the emotions. But on the other hand, there's the school of thought that someone being an asshole to you is ""more a reflection on them than it is you"". So maybe I just shouldn't sweat the small stuff.

So when someone does something that hurts my feelings, I enter a spiral of thoughts: ""Does this transgression warrant me saying something? Should I be direct? Should I hedge with a 'maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, but ...'"". A lot of times, I just think too much and then don't do anything. I'd like to start being more direct with people, but part of me thinks that if I told everyone about any time they hurt my feelings, I'd be ""that guy who can't take a joke"".

622,"Long story short, she had a very tragic childhood. She was born in a brothel, to a mother who was keen on raising her in the same line. She was molested at an age as young as 4 years, by the clients of her mother. He own mother at times molested her. She had to move from country to country along with her mother as she kept switching 'place of work'. 

Fast forward a few years, she was rescued from a brothel where her mother worked in and had sold her to and was placed in care of a family that eventually adopted her. However, it came with a cost. She was forced to change her religion and given a new name. Many people in that family, who knew about her past, haven't accepted her to this day. Anyway, a few years after that, she fell into the hands of a guy who molested her on a daily basis, basically took her to a secluded place and masturbated to her after getting her naked for 2 years. Out of the fear of abandonment and losing her newfound family, she stayed quiet. 

Confided eventually in a guy, much elder than her (about 15 years elder to her, she was 16 at that time). The guy forged a relationship with her after getting rid of her previous molester. She trusted him and the relationship progressed to a physical relationship. As per her, the guy was very unhygienic and not her type (fat, short, someone who rarely took a bath), but she let him kiss her and do certain other things purely out of a want for acceptance. He used to pick her up from her school and used to kiss her in the car. Then he started taking her to hotel rooms where, as per her, he used to ask her to undress herself (strip down to undies, never more). He sometimes made her drink cheap alcohol too, but never had sex with her or as she puts it, was not really interested in her as he never really touched her anywhere more than her upper body and didn't force her ever to get totally naked. She never reciprocated (on account of his lack of hygiene, bad breath, and general non appealing features). 

Anyhow, she eventually told this guy the circumstances of her birth and according to her, his behaviour changed. He started calling her a whore and made her tell him the stories of her time in the brothel, sometimes making her imagine perverse stories involving herself, her mother and other random guys. And then he used to make her masturbate him, sometimes twice. (I didn't ask her much but she tells me that she was grossed out by her part, but had to do because she felt obligated because 1. He rescued her and 2. She thought he would accept her and give her stability). Sometimes he did show affection to her and according to her, they did have some good moments, but after a while, she felt trapped and did it with a smile only because she was afraid that if she leaves now, he would ruin her, which this guy did eventually. One day, she found out that he was married. She called her wife and he was enraged. He had took her semi naked pictures one time and posted them on the internet and the cut her off. It ended there after about 1.5 year of relationship (which involved no sex but about 10 visits to a hotel). After that, she left the country and disappeared from everywhere. No trace online. Adopted a new identity altogether.

A few other things about her. 
She had lied to me about almost everything before. I don't know if it was a defense mechanism or something else. She lied about simple things ranging from the name of her friends, whether she had a pet, details of her teen life, to whether she had ever been in a relationship before (she never acknowledged this one before) to high level lies such as telling me about the circumstances of her birth, her life, and her identity. These lies sometimes took the form of very grandiose and fictitious stories. Many of these lies in my view were extremely unnecessary too. (Revealing this information because I do not understand her. Can se be a compulsive liar? It might as well be true that her 'not having sex' with this guy is a lie too, or maybe that this guy didn't exist at all. She says by the way that she is a virgin and I will know when we d have sex, Idc about virginity tbh, but I can't stand lies on things that don't matter)

Anyway, I love her to bits and I know she loves me and would never cheat on me. She is very kind, loving and caring. I don't understand her lying, but if you take that away, she is the most beautiful human being ever. But this lying does trouble me a lot. And here's what I need help/advice on :-

1. You think she could be lying about this relationship or about the level of reciprocity from her end? (She has previously lied about being molested by someone who never did btw). (Please note that I am trying to understand her perspective as much as possible. It is difficult for me, but I am trying. I do not feel good when I think that she must be lying about something so traumatic, but the story she has given me sometimes doesn't add up. It has a few contradictions. She changed some details every time she recounted and there are some other serious contradictions as well.)

2. If you feel that she is lying, what should I do about it?

3. How to get the images of this older guy, extremely gross and unhygienic, making love to the person I love with all my heart? How do I tell myself to be okay with it? I am getting nightmares.

4. Assuming that all that she told is true, how do I get myself to hurt less (I am more hurt because she broke this to me an year into the relationship. Previously told me that she had no relationship before me and never kissed anyone before. I have had previous relationships before. Past sexual life never bothered me. But this hits different because I feel like I was living a myth that has been shattered. I want to gather myself again and love her just as much without hurting so bad).

TL;DR - Girlfriend had a tragic childhood. Born in a brothel. Molested by multiple men. Had a relationship with a 15 year elder guy, when she was 16 herself, who molested her too and posted her nudes online. Need help understanding her and getting over her relationship with this guy. (Never cared about my partner's sexual encounters before, I don't know why it has started bothering me now.) (She has a history of lying on very trivial things and sometimes her stories are very grandiose. She might as well be in this. I have not verified anything. I don't know why she lies. I love her regardless and have told her always. She keeps doing it.)

I fell like countryhumans should be more like hetalia like being more comidic but if that was true then I could just watch hetalia.

627,"I'm a student (24F) that lives with 3 roommates (24FFM) paying rent with my university's financial aid. My  3 roommates are friends, but I have social anxiety so I don't spend much time outside my room, which is the smallest. I pay equal rent, but they all graduated and have jobs.

My issues are that, they don't clean their dishes very frequently so we sometimes end up without forks, plates, etc.. Also they don't really inform me of the utility bills which is frustrating because all my money is coming from a set amount so I can't allocate any monthly excess until I have those utilities paid. They seem frustrated that I keep asking about them. On top of that, it's been incredibly hard studying in my room. If I had more space I would've gotten a second desk to create a separation, but I had to loft my bed to get my desk to fit. I'm really worried the decrease in productivity will extend my time at school.

I'm considering living on my own next year. I think I can find a place with cheaper rent, and if I over estimate what utilities would be on my own, I'd end up paying about the same total rent + utilities, but with more space, more ability to relax, and a better study space. I'm sure I'd get lonely eventually, but that takes me quite a while.

If I can go back to campus next fall, I wouldn't care about how much space there is in my room because I wouldn't need to work at home, and I'd probably go back on a meal plan and ignore the dishes again. I'd also have my higher paying campus job back so the sporadic utilities would be more of a pet peeve than a financial issue.

Am I overreacting here? Should I just tough it out til we can resume normal activity?",04Dec2020,1
629,"I have the question at the end of this and I'm sorry to drag it out with so much backstory but I want my perspective to be clear.
I'm a 19 year old male, I went to college for one year before dropping out, and I just put in a two weeks notice of resignation from my job at a grocery store.
Before going to college I was a very smart kid and avid reader. I was the kid that everyone said was going to be super successful because academically I was very smart. I was not the kid that got invited places though.
Going into college I wanted this to change but was disappointed that it did not. I am not very clever socially, I am not good at picking up hints or understanding humor and I can be very stupid when I open my mouth. So I usually shut up.
My frustration turned to bitterness and I developed a logical argument inside my head that made life look pretty gray. I was raised as a Christian and I used to be a devoted one but then I began to look at how unhappy I was and blame both God and science. My logical argument (which is pretty common I have found out) was either: 

1) God invented the entire world and set up all the dominos of both genetics and events that leads towards people inheriting and learning traits and characteristics. These people can be ""good"" and ""bad"" and do ""good"" and ""bad"" things and maybe they'll be sorted into heaven or hell or for all we know everyone goes to heaven. Bottom line is that every human action is made up of a multitude of factors but they all trace back to the all-knowing creator. And to the all-knowing being who transcends time every consequence is very clear to him, right? So, at first I thought 'how dare it judge people' but then I thought 'whatever' let it do with its creation as it wants. Why should I care if JK Rowling dislikes Voldemort or if Tolkien hated Sauron? 

2) The other logical argument is the same but in the absence of God. Here the position of every atom since the beginning of the universe are the dominos that predetermined the world and the animals upon it. (It was explained to me by my much smarter little brother that there is an aspect of unpredictability in the movement of atomic particles but my argument still holds if you look at the whole cookie that is the four dimensional universe. In this universal object that runs from -infinity to +infinity (along time) every event, past present AND future exist already.) 

This argument is volatile, obviously, because it contradicts concepts of ""good"" and ""evil"". It also contradicts individual responsibility, and also it makes life suck. The result of this thought process led me to give up on my classwork, drop out, return to my small town and get a job at the grocery store I used to work at as a highschooler. I actually intended to kill myself all through college and did not expect to still be alive right now but I got a job because it was a lot easier than actually going through with suicide (I have a loving family, guilt has been my primary dissuasion).
I've been working since August and dealing with depression the entire time. I realised pretty quickly that the desire for death wasn't going to go away so I started seeking counseling a month ago. That actually helped a lot; my counselor helped me to be content with the person I am who is not extroverted or spotlighted, but is kind and simple.
I actually became very inspired by the idea of pursuing this contentment and trying to be 'good' (ignoring that 'logical' argument). 

Finally, the Ethical Question:
At the same time as this decision to be the 'good' me I used to be I got into a conflict with a co-worker: I had been breaking the rules and working outside my scheduled shift.
I dealt with this problem by speaking with my manager directly before I got told on and that was fine because my manager was very understanding and forgiving. I had been afraid, though, because this was not the first time I had broken the rules, and I thought she might do some investigating and fire me. I have, since I got rehired, arrogantly been disregarding the bureaucracy that I thought I was above. This evolved from simple things to, despite the pandemic, having beverages on the sales floor while I worked (I deserve the hate for this), also purchasing cigarettes when no one was looking, eating expired products (again, so selfish considering the pandemic but I was washing my hands regularly if it helps), and eventually when my card got declined I stole a coffee and I went on to steal a few more. People have been fired for less at this grocery store and the current staff is so bureaucratic that these actions were really a disrespectful offense to everyone.
What I was going to do today was tell my manager about all of this and resign. I resigned, but I did not want to tell this manager who I have worked with for years and who has always been super kind to me, about the bad parts of myself.
Considering that she is more bureaucratic than even her staff I know my actions would offend her. It is now clear to me that my manager will not be checking the cameras and investigating my actions. My two choices now are to work for a couple weeks and then leave and pursue the 'good me' without looking back, or to be honest and take responsibility for my actions. I did break the law between stealing and buying cigarettes, but the consequences of breaking the law could ruin the future I am only now learning I could have.

A year or so ago she had liposuction and a Brazilian butt lift. She looks amazing! But she says online she’s never had plastic surgery and gets angry when anyone calls her out on it.

She sells online coaching and nutrition and from what I can tell she’s great with her online clients and really seems to care a lot about them. But I think it’s unfair that anyone thinks they can look like her with diet and exercise. 

She justifies it by saying everyone does it and that her advice and training is better than most and she actually cares about her clients. But it still rubs me the wrong way.

I’m 18, and lately I’ve been finding myself to view heroin in an unrealistic and glamorized manner. My favourite movie is trainspotting and I love the velvet underground and Lou Reed, I love the song “heroin”, so in a way I’ve been almost looking up to addicts. 

I’m also super attracted to the style of the characters in trainspotting. They’re very likeable, fashionable and present their idea of rejecting society in a way that once again seems fashionable. 

I obliviously have no interest in doing the drug in real life, but I constantly wonder how good it is. And I look up to junkie culture, not that I find it respectable, but I think it’s cool almost. Even though I know this is not the case and I don’t mean to offend anyone who has experiences with addiction, I ABSOLUTELY do not mean to belittle or glamorize the hell you’ve gone through. I have all the respect in the world for people who’ve successfully beaten addiction too!

643,"I'm just starting to create a style in my mid-20's and I feel hopeless.

From grade 1 through grade 6 I wore a mandated uniform at private school. Then I moved to a different country (the USA). The culturally accepted styles were completely different so it created an anxiety around everything having to do with fashion. In an effort to not be made fun of, I took on my own uniform during public high school, sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt, and a hoodie.

Every time I tried to find a style I always did something drastic because I had no idea how to create an outfit. I ended up getting made fun of every time I tried something new because I looked silly. I remembered seeing a film once in which the badass woman character was wearing a bandana on her head so one time when I was 13 or 14 I wore a bandana on my head to dinner. It obviously didn't match what I was wearing because our waiter made a comment joking that I looked like a pirate. This kind of shit happened all the time as I was trying to figure out what fashion was and because of it I developed an incredible sense of anxiety surrounding fashion.

I'm currently just out of university and I realize that I have never been able to find a style. I'm a vocalist and a performer and I realize that sometimes the ""brand"" is more important than the music. I need to cultivate a unique style that represents my brand and I have no idea how to do it. Every time I try to get something new I go to a department store and never buy anything because I end up crying from the anxiety in the dressing room.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? If not, how can I catch up to the rest of the world? How can I relatively quickly create a unique style with virtually no experience?

It might help to know that my favorite genre's of music are punk, R&amp;B, most electronic, and alternative. I tend to write music with a fusion of some or all of these.

TLDR: I grew up wearing a uniform my whole life and now I'm a performer in my 20's with no ""brand"" and I'm screwed.

646,"Hey everyone. I’m really at a loss on what to do right now. The weight of everything is really starting to come down on me. This might be a little long so read the TLDR at the bottom if you’d prefer. 

My parents got divorced when I was 4 years old. My mom was unmedicated for bipolar disorder at the time so for the first two years of their separation my dad took full custody but then they started doing joint custody and have ever since (I went to my moms on weekends and Wednesdays). 

Growing up with her was difficult. Sometimes there would be very little food in the fridge and she rarely ever did any housework so the house was a complete mess. We would have ant infestations every year because she left food out all the time. Sometimes I remember asking her if we could get food somewhere and she would treat it as if I was being annoying and incessant. “Relentless,” she would call it. And she would call me relentless anytime I asked for something that inconvenienced her. I remember our cat getting sick and I was concerned, asking her daily if we could take the cat to the vet. Rather than understanding my anxiety she would blow up at me and yell about money and ignore how I was feeling. 

My grandparents (dad’s parents) who live close by have never liked her, and my mom used this to turn me against them and convince me they were bad people. Anytime I brought them up she would make sure to remind me how controlling and toxic my grandpa was and how manipulative my grandma was. My grandparents are not perfect and there is a slice of truth in what my mom said but she blew it up on purpose to make me dislike my grandparents.

My mom made sure to emphasize these words with me about her dating someone: “if I introduce you to someone and you don’t like it, you take priority over them and always will and I will stop seeing them.” Hearing these words were a comfort.

A few years ago her on-and-off boyfriend came back around, and I started to realize just how uncomfortable he always made me. I hated being around him. He would leave boxes of his things in my mom’s garage as if he sort of lived there even though he didn’t. At this time me and my mom were also in the process of moving and he came over to “help” but all they did was smoke weed. At 14 years old I was packed and ready to go after cleaning up my entire room with three days left until we had to move out completely and the rest of the house, my mom’s responsibility with the help of her boyfriend, was a complete mess. Barely anything done. My mom’s close friend ended up enabling her by calling a mover to basically do it all for her last minute.

The moving situation made me upset and I decided to voice my feelings in a letter to my mom. Her boyfriend was still coming over quite often and I needed to tell her how I was feeling about him. I gave her this letter, which talked about how I thought this guy was taking advantage of her and I didn’t like him because he made me very uncomfortable. After smoking a bunch she came out and talked with me about it but the next time I came over he was still there. After a month and nothing really changed. She walked in on me crying in my room and asked me what was wrong and I told her how I don’t want him here and she blew up at me, saying, “Im doing the best that I can. This is difficult for me too” and basically turning it around on me as if she is the victim. I was in shock.

A month or so later I told her over the phone and reminded her of what she had said to me once about how I come first. At this time she was dropping him off somewhere. I told her that I wouldn’t want to live with her if he came around and she flipped her sh*t (for lack of a better description). At this point I stopped seeing him. A few years later my mom comes to me and tells me he is having family trouble and will be coming over for a visit when I am not there and wanted to run it by me. I asked my aunt who lives with us if that was the truth, and she told me she’s been having him over every once in a while for the past year. This really disappointed me. 

Her lack of motivation to clean or do much for me was caused by her stressful job, as she says. She is a CDP (works with drug addicts as a counselor) so I understand but as much as I understand that she literally does nothing at home. She comes home and smokes weed every single day, all the time. She is pretty much always high and that is not an exaggeration. Trying to have a conversation with her is almost always very difficult because of her dependency on marijuana. I’ve told her how the smell makes me nauseous and how I don’t want her to do it too much but she continues to reassure me that it’s not bad.

A common theme with my mom is creating this false narrative about our relationship. She paints herself as this cool mom who loves her kid so much and her kid and her talk about everything together and she takes pride in that but that could not be further from the truth. My mom and I have an extremely fractured relationship especially now. I’ve talked about all of this with my dad and he’s told me that my mom had gaslighted him. I realized that similarly I have been gaslighted my entire life into thinking her behavior is normal and our relationship is healthy, and I feel like her denial runs so deep that she can’t even admit it to herself that our relationship is so damaged. 

My dad recently told me more about their divorce and just how bad it really was. It started with my mom cheating on him (the man she cheated on my dad with IS the boyfriend I mentioned earlier.... by the way...) and moving out while being unmedicated bipolar (so she was unhinged). He told me he had the opportunity to have full custody and people on both sides of our family and my parents’ friends had written letters to the judge saying they wanted my dad to have full custody except a select few of my mom’s friends. My mom told my dad that she would commit s*icide if she didnt get to see me, prompting him to go for joint custody.

She consistently calls me baby names even though Im 18 and baby talks me as well. “Pumpkin,” “sweetie pie,” “munchkin,” and many others are nicknames she uses DAILY to name a few. She also will talk in a higher pitched voice and act like a child when talking with me, which makes me very uncomfortable ever since I realized it. My aunt has observed that I used to actually baby talk back to her, but I stopped after i realized how dysfunctional that is. 

I’ve been avoiding my mom, using COVID as an excuse to stay over there less. Now I am only going over on Friday and Saturday weekly to spend the night, but even this is too much. I hate every second of being there and it drains my energy. I hate being there. My aunt has told me how negative she sees me acting and feeling over there, and I can feel it too. It’s oppressive.

The part that makes me so upset about all of this is I know my mom loves me. She loves me a lot. Today she messaged me that she wants to do something with me this weekend and “we shouldn’t spend all of our time in separate rooms” and it triggered a wave of guilt because my answer in my head is a resounding “NO.” I know she is trying to reach out and do things with me, but I am beyond wanting to do anything with her. At this point if I had it my way I would never talk to her and I would be fine with that. But that leads me to feel guilty again because she still does love me and I feel like I am a horrible person for being so negative about her. Its an endless loop.

I’m at a crossroads. Its my senior year in high school and Im applying to colleges and my whole life is ahead of me. The stress created from this has crushed me, and I just spent an hour crying about this because the anxiety and stress is building up and is getting to be too much. I feel like my feelings are unjustified because my mom loves me and cares for me and wants to do things with me but at the same time she does pretty much nothing for me or herself and Im out of patience for it anymore.

I have no clue what to do. If I tell her I don’t want to live with her the drama will be worse than anything I’ve ever experienced from her and I bet that will be bad. But I don’t know if I can handle being around her anymore. I just don’t know. Please offer me advice or tips or something because everyone in my life who I have talked to including me is not sure on what I should say or do... thank you. 

TLDR
My mom is neglectful of me and always has been. There have been a lot of problems in our relationship and I don’t like living with her. Now that I am 18 I have the ability to cut ties, but I feel so guilty for it because I know despite the toxic stuff she does love me. What am I supposed to do :(",04Dec2020,1
647,"hey, bear with me as im sure this will be a little long winded. lockdown started in my country last march, and a month after- i matched with someone from a dating app. catch is he’s not from the same country.

we started off with just casual conversations and the occasional dirty stuff and right off the bat were clear that that’s all we both wanted. we’d talk all day, despite the huge time difference- essentially becoming a big part of each other’s everydays. before we knew it, we’ve been talking for 4months everyday, but despite that i never wanted to video chat. for me as it is, it was becoming a real connection (conversations started becoming more serious - life, family, feelings, dreams, all the intimate and vulnerable stuff, and everything else), and i was scared that if i actually got to look him in the eye, real feelings might develop. so the most that we’d do are phone calls. suddenly, it seemed like previous topics of past love/sexual experiences w other people were a little more inappropriate- where before its all we talked about, it suddenly felt like we’d both be jealous when we discussed these. we also promised to meet each other once the pandemic was over... and this was brought up time and time again, getting us both very frustrated that we couldn’t just yet.

and then suddenly he disappears... a few days passed before he messaged again and i didn’t expect it but it made me feel really shitty. when he messaged, he explained saying he’s been consciously trying to get off his phone and be more mindful of where he allows his headspace to be. he even said he blocked off the notifications from that specific messaging app as it was getting to his head... but i realized- we were talking on a messaging app that he doesn’t really use w anyone but me. my ego got in the way and i didn’t message until two weeks after. when i did... he didn’t reply anymore.

until about another 2 weeks after - and he started messaging me on another app. we said our i miss you’s and eventually started talking again every single day. this time- it felt more serious. less of the dirty stuff, more real life. and before i knew it, i agreed to start video chatting. that hit me... once i looked at his eyes, it really made the past months feel a lot more real. its like i knew him... even without meeting him. i wanted to know him more, and wanted him to know me more. and our conversations more seemed like that of two people really dating. even promising and concretely planning to meet each other once safe to fly. 

and then i got overwhelmed. it was another 2months of talking everyday and i got scared. i knew that if i kept going, my feelings will only get deeper. so i ended it with him. i respected him enough of course to talk about it before fully stopping- but i guess a lot of it for me was being scared that he might not be feeling the same exact way i was. so rather than knowing- i just told him i couldn’t keep up anymore.

now i knew it would hurt... but i didn’t realize it would for this long. i miss him everyday... and he crosses my mind quite a lot. so lots of times i wonder if i made the right choice. maybe the feelings were there because its an odd time and i was lonely? i never actually thought this type of connection could happen with someone i’ve never met...

i tried and am trying my hardest to keep my distance and not message just to stick to my word, despite how torn i feel about it. im a libra, so very stubborn and full of pride. but about 2months after he messaged me on the messaging app he only uses to talk to me- saying “miss u”. and then he never went back online again. i don’t know what to do... don’t know if i should reach out too. 

i miss him :(",04Dec2020,1

We broke up a couple months for just 2 weeks because I wanted to ‘experience’ the world but I ended up wanting to get back together.

649,"So I (18M) have PTSD. It took me a long time to accept and digest my diagnosis, and now that I have, I’ve been better at treating it.

Here’s the thing though, I live with my dad and his fiancée (along with my sister and her boyfriend) and they all know about my PTSD, from both traumatic events. The first was caused by my mother, and I have few fond memories of her anymore. It seems like the longer I’m apart from her, the more I hate her for what she did to me.

Some of the not-so-fond memories are from Christmas (I’m from a Methodist family, but I’m a Wiccan myself). She had pictures of me from when I was a baby on ornaments. Problem is, I hate them. I hate how feminine I looked (I’ve been transitioning for a little over half a decade) and despite those complaints, she would still make me put them up on the tree. And on Christmas Day, without fail, she would always cry for many different reasons. We didn’t appreciate the presents enough, we were being too grouchy, she didn’t like the fact that we never got presents for her (we were just kids), etc.

I’ve moved out from her house, but the stain of the memories of my deadname on the tree, the pictures of me, the fact that she would make me console her in the place of our father.

Now, things are a little complicated. I just got out of the mental hospital and am a little sensitive because of my new meds. My step-mom keeps egging me to help with the decorations, but I did tell her that I’m not a Christian and don’t celebrate Christmas. I thought I was fine with everyone else doing it instead, but anything holiday-like reminds me of the eight years I spent with my mother. My sister and her boyfriend started putting up the tree, and I couldn’t even stay in the room. I don’t even want to look at the tree.

I don’t know how to tell them this, they are supportive and everything, but I don’t want to ruin their Christmas, but I also don’t want to go back to the hospital. Any advice?",04Dec2020,1

You will eventually be angry or    stressed some time, because you are human.

657,"I met my fiancee in highschool when we dated for around 2 years. Due to situations out of our control (dad was military and moved) we separated. We reconnected years later (we were 15-17 in highschool and am now 34). We started talking things started happening and instantly we fell in love again. Through the last 2 years we realized we aren't the same people as we were in highschool but we working on it, things were going well enough wee moved in and got engaged. I recently (this week) caught her cheating on me with an ex, apparently the guy she was on/off again with before we reconnected. Before this I was in a ltr on/off/fwb relationship with the mother of my kids since we were 21. Nothing really stuck but since we had kids were around each other alot and things would happen and then we'd split again. It was most likely a unhealthy co-dependant relationship. That being said I haven't had to go date or meet people in a long long time. I moved when me and ex-fiancee moved in together because her dad was sick and we moved to help him take care of himself(cancer had to have a a stomach port put in ect). ( When we reconnected and talking we we've long distance bud would see each other on week ends and do the facetime thing and all that, she already lived in this state but we moved closer to her dad and moved in together) on a side note for people who I'm sure will be curious it's still close enough I see my kids on the weekend and such. So since I'm in a new place most my friends are her friends. And while most of us are still friends even without us being together it's also time and I think healthy to have some more separate lives.

659,"TL;DR I like someone but I just don't know how to tell them when they like someone else that we both know.  


  


I've been speaking to someone in a community for a while now and we're pretty inseperable doing anything. We're always calling, watching movies through Discord, creating projects for other people. We're pretty much attached at the hip. However, I know that they like and have feelings for a mutual friend of ours and I want to support them with going for that because I absolutely adore this person. But the issue is... I adore them.. wholeheartedly  but I can't tell them how I feel.  


They accidentally found out that I liked someone by a slip of information and now they keep asking me about them with questions like;  


Who is it?  
Do I know them?  
Am I close to them?  
Do they know you like them?  


And I just don't know what to say. Like of course you know them and are close to them, you are THEM. I don't know what to do and I feel like a world of emotional pain.

660,"Tl;dr: I just want to adult, but my family is really against the idea of me earning my own money.

Before I start: I say ""family"" and not ""parents"" because it's my mom and grandma.

So I'm 20F, turning 21 in February. I'm an only child, and my family has always been overprotective. I live in another country now and still have to call every evening to let them know I'm home and safe. They proceed to ask what i did during the day, what I ate, etc.

The more important aspect is money. I wasn't allowed to work in my teens because, apparently, it would hurt my studies. I'm not saying it couldn't. But they went with the ""it didn't work for me, so it won't work for you either"" approach without letting me try. Well, okay, I did get a part-time job at 19. After long arguments I finally convinced them it was helping with my foreign language studies (not a lie). 

I really don't want to sound like an ungrateful little shit. I LOVE my family and am eternally thankful for everything they've done to me.

But 3 months ago I moved abroad for college, and they insist on paying for all of my expenses \[tuition is free\]. Despite the fact that we already saved enough for the whole period of my studies (and I keep telling this), they keep talking about giving me more. I might need to mention that we are a regular middle class family. Never been in need, but definitely not rich.

I just can't help feeling like a spoiled child who can't take care of herself. I feel guilty for spending their money on unnecessary stuff (like clothes or decor elements), that's why I barely ever buy myself anything. 

I love the bond I have with them, but I also don't want to be home at 10 pm and report everything I did (I don't actually tell everything, lol). I feel like getting my own money will be the key to more freedom. I might get myself some nice things without guilt and just make my own decisions. Learn about money management too. Also I lost my phone recently. Completely my fault, and I think it's my duty to replace it.

So my cuurrent plan is getting a part-time job and only telling them afterwards. Telling how grateful I am for supporting me, but also how I feel about the situation. As for the extra money they keep trying to send me despite me constantly saying that I have enough and they can keep it - 3 options here:

1. Keeping it separately and paying it back as a gratitude
2. Start saving for something big
3. Donating to good causes.

Thoughts? Am I being ungrateful? Any advices or tips?",04Dec2020,1
661,"	I’ve never been a awful student, in high school I had decent enough grades to get accepted into a large 4 year accredited A&amp;M university. I graduated from high school last summer, and neglected to study at all dropping my already mediocre math placement exam enough to not gain access to the Calc 1 class I required to start a mechanical engineering path. Instead, I was placed into College Algebra, technically a class I have already taken. High School, I ended the year in Pre-Calc with decent grades. So I I started my first college semester a full 2 years behind every other kid in my field. I kind of expected this to happen anyways, because in high school I was also enrolled in both AP physics and AP physics 2 with a B- average and I made a 2 on both AP exams. Anybody who has taken an AP exam will know that colleges will not take a score lower than 3. In other words, the only classes I took in high school that could be counted for college credit, did not count for my college credit. 

	All of this is actually quite typical for an average college freshmen, according to my counselor. Yet, since this week marks the end of my first college semester, I should at least have the 12 hours of college credit from my General ED classes right? Well, no. As of December 5th, I am not a full time student. I don’t have even have 10 hours of class credits to transfer. Right now I have 9 part time hours consisting of: American History (3hrs), Intro to Anthropology (3hrs), Symphony Orchestra (1.5hrs), and Freshman Seminar (1.5hrs). I dropped out of English Composition and College Algebra in November. Currently I am failing the only 2 classes that count towards my GPA.

	I have yet to tell my parents who are paying the full 20k of tuition for this semester that I’m most likely not even eligible for community college. While my high school career was turbulent with many close calls and extra credit work turned in at the final hour, this seems like there is no turning back now. 2 failed classes and 2 withdraws on my permeant record. I don’t think I have the heart to look my dad in the eyes and say I flunked out of school when he worked 3 jobs to pay for it. I’m legitimately pondering if I could  take my guitar, my laptop, and some clothes, and leave the house to give my younger siblings some room to make better decisions than I did. I’m quite stressed, lost and confused about my future. I really do want to succeed in life.

The main issue I have is that the main people I work with don’t own their work. They do things on the fly and just “hope” that it works out, instead of doing due diligence to make sure things are correct. This leads to all sorts of disasters down the line. 

Then, they come to me and ask me how to do things. How to do things in their systems and on their projects. They’ve been there for two years, I have two months, and they’re coming to me asking how to do their job. This makes me both nervous and irritated. 

My boss also doesn’t communicate with me. All of a sudden I’ll be invited to a call about some new initiative that I was never informed of. My name will be on other people’s presentations, when this is the first I’m hearing of the project. It’s insane. Then I’m caught completely off guard and have to pull out answers on the spot. Very uncomfortable.

678,"Basically, I don't know what to do in general because I'm directionless and not good at anything but regardless, I would still be anxious about messing things up and not knowing anything.

For example, I wanted to work in PR, but thinking about how you can't mess up once and you have to fix ANY PR crisis, even if the evidence is stacked against you, will end up firing you and possibly getting black listed.

If you were a social media manager, if you don't garner fans and followers for their brands, you're fired/black listed.

Being a music video producer will end up getting you fired/black listed if your videos don't gain any traction.

If you were the manager of some kind of business, you'll get fired if your certain sector doesn't gain any sort of traction/profit.

If you were in charge of music for some company, you have to come out with unique stuff all the time and I can't imagine how stressful that is.

If you're an animator, the deadlines are incredibly stressful and if you don't hurry up and do everything, you're fired.

If you work in the gaming industry as a programmer, animator, modeler, etc, there is a ton of crunch time work and some of these people are putting in a hundred hours of unpaid work because the company demands a deadline that overworks these types of people. If they don't meet it then they fire you and easily hire someone else and the chance of working for another company is slim unless you have a TON of experience.

I know people say everyone makes mistakes but it seems that one mistake will get you in major trouble and possibly for life. I get that you can mess up sometimes as say a waiter or cashier and you'll be forgiven, but this doesn't seem to fly for many careers. Hell, I couldn't even be a waiter because I'm afraid of messing up people's orders and being blamed for everything (even if it isn't your fault) which is why I used to be a busser and would just clean the tables which didn't land me in any trouble.

I'm (21) the youngest child of three siblings. My older brother (25), who just got back from 2 years abroad, lives in Vermont with his girlfriend and is unemployed (this is relevant to a question I have later), and my sister (22)  lives with her wife in Colorado. They make pretty good money, and my sister just bought a new car. I'm still in college and live with my parents when I'm not at school. I graduate next spring and will probably be coming back here to live until I find full time employment. I have very little money to my name, my bank account is actually in the negative right now. I just applied for a seasonal job at a discount retail store the other day and I'm waiting on hearing back from them. I work during the summers and on breaks at a store near my old house, which is closed right now due to slow tourism in the winter. 

I've been helping support my parents financially for years now, mostly during the summers since I've been in college since that's when I'm home and have income. The past couple of years I've given them $2000+ in cash, which I never expect to see back because they are very low income. Neither of them work. My mother is disabled and my step mother doesn't work because of her own mental health reasons (they're lesbians in case that's confusing)

The main issue here is my mother's health. She has progressive multiple sclerosis and it's gotten very bad in the past few years. She can no longer walk, write, or do pretty much anything for herself. She just got an electric wheelchair the other day, which has improved her independence so much, but she still struggles doing basic tasks. My step mother has a hard time keeping up with my mother's needs. She has her own issues but in short, she doesn't do as much as could. 

My mother's situation is becoming pretty dire. She's losing control of her bowel and urinary movements, and for the last couple nights she's had accidents that she couldn't make it to the bathroom for. It's extremely upsetting and difficult for all of us to handle. I'm still trying to finish school and being here has made it so much harder. (my mother asked me to quarantine with them because the county my apartment is in is in the red right now, so here I am). For the last few years, I'm the only child who has been coming back regularly and taking care of them both physically and financially. 

This is all a huge burden on me and I'm at the end of my rope. My parents desperately need help, but they can't afford a home help aid and their insurance won't cover it. I have no savings since I don't work during school and I give them half my paycheck when I do work, and I have no job right now. I'm considering asking my siblings to help pay for a home aid to come in and help my mom with household chores and personal hygiene, because I still have school to do and can't help 24/7. I would pay them back when I graduate and get a full time job next year. I seriously don't know what to do right now. Please, please help me figure something out, I don't know how much longer I can take this.",04Dec2020,1
683,"Recently I told my Mom that I really don't care for religion and that I'm kind of ashiest. She sort of got into a bit of a fit, and I understand why. She is one of the most religious people I know, she even got a degree in theology. Over the past few months after I told her she's been saying things like ""Just let me know when you'll go back"" an other things that are like trying to convert me. She's also been making me go to more things like religious studies. I don't really mind it but It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't really know how to tell her to stop. Need advice.",04Dec2020,1

685,"Ironic because I'm kind of doing it right now. But I would like to know the safety of ""throwaway"" Reddit accounts. Can they be tracked back to a Reddit user's primary account, or location? By either the Reddit community, or maybe the mods?",04Dec2020,6
686,okay I know what to say to comfort most people but when it comes to one person they don't like it when it comes from me. It's not like they hate me because we are really close but somewhere along the way she stop coming to me for a person to talk to and I don't blame her. Most of the time I don't know what to say and it started this fear of talking to people about there problems because now I think I don't know what to say.,04Dec2020,1
688,"At age 30, I’ve had a little under a dozen partners or relationships in my life. I started dating later than most (around 18), and thought I’d be in love forever. I had never even kissed someone before, thought kissing was kind of stupid and wasn’t into it.

I had some bad breakups where, despite how hard I tried, my partners just weren’t attracted to me in the end. They wanted to stay close friends and not break up, but it felt too painful so I dumped them. 

Now, a few years later, I’ve just not been interested in sex at all. I don’t find myself even turned on in the least bit while I’m alone, and kind of have to remind myself to have solo time because it helps me sleep better.

I’ve had people hit on me, but I’m just like, absolutely repulsed. Sex, and intimacy, feels really disgusting and I’m just not interested in it. Part of me wants to work through it, but then when I think about being less of a control freak, I hate it!

Has anyone tried to recover from sexual aversion when they didn’t want to?",04Dec2020,1
