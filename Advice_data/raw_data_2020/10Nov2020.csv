I have fell in love with my 33 (f) teacher I 16 (m) and it kill me (I have been lonely because of recent lockdown).
What would you do in this situation?",10Nov2020,1
1,"This happens every term but it always comes down to this. I told myself that it’d now would be another chance to get through all the way. But I slept too much yesterday afternoon and couldn’t sleep last night, and now i’m sleepy as hell. I feel like either way if I go to school or don’t I’m going to feel dead and depressed so I’d rather not have to be like that in front of my classmates who I hate. I really need help on how I can stop ending up like this and just be more motivated to go to school. For the sake of my grades.",10Nov2020,1
2,I feel like I'm annoying someone when I try to strike a conversation through text. I've kinda always felt this way about texting friends and even my family. I've heard my family tell me it's not annoying and they enjoy talking to me but I still feel like I'm just annoying them. I just don't know how to stop feeling that way about texting people.,10Nov2020,1
3,So the reason I say I think is because he reacted pretty fast so I’m not positive it was porn but I’m like 90% sure because his fly was down and he shielded his computer from me. I really can’t move past this. I’m thinking of switching classes but I don’t want to like report him or anything because we all think with our dick sometimes and he’s really nice and a great teacher and doesn’t deserve to lose his job. What should I do?,10Nov2020,1

6,"It's my fiancé's birthday next week, and I really want to make it special. I've ordered a special cake to be made for him and I've got him a hoodie that he has been wanting for a while, but I couldn't get him much else because I have no job and can't afford a lot.

I was thinking of maybe leaving little notes around the house for him to find? Maybe I should do it on his birthday, maybe I should do it just for a random day instead? I don't know. Is it cringey? I guess it is but maybe in a good way? Hahaha.

Has anyone else got any other ideas of what I can do to make it special for him? It's been a tough time recently and I just want to make sure he has a good day, and I really want to show him how much I love him",10Nov2020,1
7,"Ok so this just happened about an hour ago. Im talking to this girl that i know and we were both heavily flirting with each other and we were going to hang out this wednesday. 

Well to put it short and sweet i found out that she was hanging out with her ex and i confronted her asking if shes playing me. She is telling me that she didnt hang with her ex and that she wouldnt have complimented me and say other things if she didnt have intentions of getting into a relationship. Her ex also texted me though and said “if i knew you were going to hang out with her i wouldnt have seen her again”. I honestly dont know who to believe but the girl is sending me paragraphs ab how she likes me and wouldnt ruin what we have right now just to hang out with her ex who cheated on her 3 times.  At the same time, i have her ex telling me the opposite. Any advice on what to do? Pretty sticky situation and i feel like shit rn.",10Nov2020,1
8,"So to explain why I’m scared every time I’ve ever had a crush on a girl it’s just ended in me becoming more depressed and being rejected which just makes my confidence in finding love dwindle more and more. The girl I’m crushing on is a friend from theater who is such badass person who plays video games and is also really fucking talented and beautiful. I’m worried that a guy like me who has low self esteem might be way out of her league though she does seem interested in talking to me when I reach out since due to covid the only way I’m able to see or talk to her is on Snapchat replying to her stories, she had replied to some stories of mine. Who knows maybe I have a chance and finally getting a girlfriend and finding love or maybe it’s just gonna be another one that gets added to the list of why I’m just gonna die alone. I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts",10Nov2020,1
9,"TL;DR: 18, strict evangelical Christian conservative parents, has been hiding who they are from their parents their entire life, their parents support gay conversion therapy and they are closeted LGBT, whenever the topic of mental illness comes up all their parents tell them to do is “pray more.” They do, however, have a therapy appt coming up soon but I can’t help but worry that it won’t change anything. The plan is for them to talk to their therapist and for the therapist to hopefully get them on mood stabilizers, but I don’t know how to get them through the time that it’ll take for them to get their mood stabilizers and for them to kick in.

more info if you’ve already read the TL;DR: Probably every other day I spend at least an hour talking them through a depressive episode. They aren’t holding a knife or a noose in their hand while it’s happening or anything like that, they’re not threatening me with suicide, they literally just rant about how much they want to die, and how much nothing matters, how nothing makes them feel better or works, and how they don’t deserve basic human kindness. I know it often helps to get that stuff off your chest in the moment, like usually later they’re like “hey sorry idk why I got so depressed the encouragement makes a difference and means a lot.” But at the same time they are concerned that they are weighing down our friendship and being a burden to me. Normally no, but these conversations are happening like, every other day. I’m doing what I can but it’s fucking tiring and it’s starting to piss me off even though it’s not their fault and I really don’t know what else to do. I don’t know how I’m going to keep my sanity while trying to help them find theirs while waiting for the mood stabilizers to kick in. And I can’t tell them that. We have a lot of friends, we hang out with them in voice chats, we watch movies and shows together, so it’s not like there’s a shortage of distractions or people who tell them that they matter and are loved. They just go on rants where distractions are pointless and then almost every night they make a half hearted joke about making it to the next day, or, “I’ll be excited to go do this thing with you eventually if I make it that long.” It’s not the joke that pisses me off. What pisses me off is I spend every other day literally gassing them up while they deny it or trying to distract/check up on them and they still fucking say shit like that as if they don’t matter to any of our friends or I. During their episode today I asked them if their friends mattered and they said “I don’t know” though. But that’s the thing - I know we do. Only when they’re not having an episode though - and it’s fucking tiring.",10Nov2020,1
10,"So, I'm on Lexapro 15mg and Mirtazapine 15mg. I really haven't done drugs other than nicotine, because I like the way it feels to get buzzed.

I really want some way to recreate the feeling of getting buzzed without, you know, destroying my lungs. But I can't do any drugs on my meds. Anything that interacts with seratonin gives me the risk of developing seratonin syndrome (and I also don't want to mess with my seratonin right now). I can't drink, though I don't really want to, and I'm fairly certain I can't take any prescription painkillers because of how it affects my blood...?

Anyway, is there ANYTHING I can do? How can I do it safely?",10Nov2020,1
11,"I work for a large company. I live in the states. I work for a great company, and I just had my first meeting with my new manager. She seemed pretty open and transparent until.... side note: my sister and I work for the same client she make slightly more money, doing the same job, poorly. We have compared metrics. I also have more experience. I told my new manager I want to make what my sister makers or rather I knew. I asked her how open reviews are done, raises are given, yada yada. She slaps me with a “verbal warning, for discussing pay with my sister.” That is illegal in my (Texas) state.

13,"So I’ve been away at college, and while I’ve been away, my sibling got sick. My parents say that they’re super Covid safe, but they aren’t. They go out all the time and don’t wear masks if they don’t have to. My sibling caught what my parents call a really bad cold. They don’t have a sense of taste at the moment, and they’re really scared because they don’t want to get even sicker, and they’re scared of giving it to the rest of my family, especially with our family thanksgiving coming up this weekend (where there will be very young children and grandparents with serious health conditions). What should I do? I’m at college 2 hours away, and I’m coming home this weekend. Is it possible for me to bring them somewhere to get tested and pay out of my own pocket? I’ve never had to deal with any medical bills or insurance or any of that on my own, and I don’t know if I’m even able to bring them to get tested.

15,"I am currently together but not officially with a guy. We both agreed on: nothing official until we meet. (Long distance)

We've been a thing since March this year.
Now this should all be fine but the thing is.
About 2 months after we started ""dating"" I called him and he bursted out in tears.
Telling me that he and his best friend broke contact. His best friend is also his ex.
He told me that before he met me they were planning on getting back together. Cause he was still in love with her.
He told me she found another man and cut ties completely with him. Blocked him on everything. 
He was devastated. 

Now cut to 8 days ago.

Him and I were in a call together as she calls him drunk. He hung me up and took her call. 
He told me the following:
She kept telling him she misses him, that she even made a subreddit with letters and messages she wanted to send to him. 
She also told him she needed to get an operation and the operation could be fatal. The operation was sceduled for the next day. Now 7 days ago.

Ever since the call he's been acting weird. Completely understandable. She unblocked him but is not responding to any messages whatsoever on any platform. 

Now I am unsure what to do in this situation. Cause he's certain she's most likely dead. But my guts are telling me she's not.
How everything was going I feel like she just wants to get into his mind again. Make him go crazy over her like he used to be.
I am saying this because the sub reddit with unsent letters's first messages is her complaining that she saw he changed his discord pfp to a commission of us 2 I had made.
She also called him drunk af, no one is allowed to drink if you have an operation scheduled for the next day that could even be fatal.
If she would've showed up hungover they would've send her away.
I just don't trust it, it feels fishy and I need some advice on how to handle this situation...

If she is just trying to get in his head again and its all a trick I can kiss my boo goodbye cause the way he has been reacting it feels like he still has feelings for her.

But if she has actually passed I don't know what to do either.

I told him to try and get in contact with a friend or family member from her to see if she's still alive. But he hasn't gotten a response yet.

I feel lost..",10Nov2020,1
16,"It’s not like depression, where I feel empty, because I know what that’s like. It’s not as if I’m living a bad life either. To be honest, I’m living my best life. I finally started exercising, I’m on a diet and nofap has been doing wonders. It’s just that I’m never actually happy when I’m alone. And not with anyone except like 3 of my close friends. 
I feel like such an outsider, even though I know for a fact no one actually dislikes me. It’s just that, in school, I know every group, but I’m not actually in any of them. 
My game with girls is weak af. Any girl who would actually be interested in me is either (and I know this is gonna sound shallow) uglier than Gollum or such a one dimensional bitch that I’d get bored after a week. Any girl I actually think I’d like to be with either doesn’t talk to me at all or is already with someone. One of them literally sends me streaks but doesn’t open any of my snaps like ffs. 
With my friends it’s annoying because they all play sports. I’m trash at every sport, and with the whole lockdown thing and going from my Mom’s to my Dad’s it’s difficult to find time to practice. 
I have absolutely no trouble in school at the moment, but I can feel myself falling behind in some subjects (Maths) and in others we don’t learn anything at all due to incompetent teachers (my German teacher thinks its more important that we know how to say potato soup and how to ask for a table instead of basic grammar and sentence construction) and also the other students being ‘disruptive’. I think with the at least 3 subjects that I learn nothing in and the others I’m falling behind in, I won’t do too well in my Junior Cert (Irish exam you take in your 3rd year of secondary school)
I feel I’m not happy with my stance socially, sports-wise and with girls. I need advice.",10Nov2020,1
17,"My dad is married to my mom but he's also married to another woman. He has kids with her too who are my half siblings. My dad lives with his other wife and my half siblings too, and he stays there during the week and comes here for one day per weekend. Some weekends he doesnt even come at all. My mom has never even talked about her, and she has never met that other woman. My mom is nice to my half siblings and she acts like she loves them but she makes it a point to me and my sister and says she doesnt care about them at all. She doesnt seem to care too much about my dad never seeing us but she has brought it up like two or three times. Strangely his other wife gave my mom her van because she felt bad that my mom's car was being fixed? We hide the fact that he is married to another woman from my mom's side of the family (the side I actually know). I do not kmow my dad's side of the family. I have seen maybe a few from his side but i am not close to them at all. I think they know that my dad is married to my mom, but one time we had to go home because my dad thought he saw some family members from his side while we were at a park.

Why is my family so complicated. Why doesnt my mom hate my dad for basically spending all his time with another woman and family she doesnt care about?",10Nov2020,1

19,"I'm 16F, from Spain. I'm in the first year of what we call bachillerato, and my grades are getting worse. I believe it doesn't have much to do with sloth, though.

It started to happen about four years ago. In primary school, I got what Americans would call straight As. I was great at everything. Some teachers and the school psychologist were convinced I was a prodigy. Then the last year came and I, at the tender age of 12, discovered two things. Fandoms and the fact that English was convenient to be fluent in. Now, I was a lurker everywhere I went, since I was super shy, but I took to writing fanfiction. This sparked something in me, and my grades started to decline from the max 10 and second best 9, to 8s and 7s. It was in high school when I started considering writing my own original works, from what my best friend told me about my fanfiction (aka, ""you take so many creative liberties it might as well be its own thing""). Last year, I wrote my first original story, and it was actually decently successful for a book that was written in English, my father insisted and self-published it. Last year was also when I started failing math, and getting considerably bad grades in everything else. Always the passable 5, at least.

And this year, I think it's too late. It started this summer, when I decided to actually organize my ideas, and the thing I wrote ended up becoming a trilogy. Unfortunately, the end of summer crept up on me and I couldn't write the third book. It's still pending, considering I need all day to write properly and I can't do that when I have school. But I have an overactive, almost painful imagination. Back when I started writing fanfics, I made a habit of writing every day. Ever since, there hasn't been a single day where I skipped that ritual, either on paper or digitally, I would write no matter the cost. This might be the reason for my restlessness. I can't simply not write, it's literally impossible, and because too much passed since an idea's inception (the trilogy) and now (I'm preparing another book), my head is permanently elsewhere. It's gotten so, SO much worse... when exams started, I got my first 0. Yes, I do blame my teacher for crossing out the entire exercise if it has two errors, but I'm also aware that I didn't memorize what I had to (even though it was too much to ask if you take into account that IT WAS A COMPLETELY NEW SUBJECT FOR ME and I had no choice but to take it).

I studied for days, yet the results were THAT bad. I wasn't even too distracted, I knew it would be hard so I tried my best, and I swear I had it memorized the night before the exam. Tomorrow, I have an Ancient Greek syntax exam, the first of its kind that I'm ever going to do. I'm scared shitless because I know for a fact all of my studying will be worthless tomorrow, and I'm under threat from my parents. If I fail again, I'll get my electronics taken away, and that means losing all of my notes and my writing software too. Yes, I'm far more worried about losing my writing than my grades or whatever else my parents could do to me. I could never give it up.

So, my question is, since they won't believe me when I say it's no use, what do I do? My parents are 65M and 55F, neither of them is very keen on listening to me or believing any of what I say. They think I'm just lazy. I probably left some things unsaid... but I hope I made my point clear.",10Nov2020,1
20,"Hi everyone! I'm new to Reddit, so please let me know if there's a better space for this question! I have a few tattoos, and am looking for an artist to get a tattoo of a hawk with a snake in its talons. I drove across the country when I was in college (a really pivotal part of my adolescence), and on the first leg of our trip a hawk flew right in front of our car with a snake. 

That being said, I know that an eagle with a snake is an important symbol in some indigenous cultures. It's also featured on the Mexican flag. I'm from New England and white, and not interesting in crossing any cultural appropriation lines. I'm not sure if my tattoo idea counts as cultural appropriation, thought the CMV community might have some input. Thanks!",10Nov2020,1
21,"Hey y'all, got a bit weird one coming to y'all.

I recently started to see the increasing bias of being attracted to pale caucasian girls and this worries me. 
As a young person of color, I find it hypocritical that I can believe I love myself for who I am and then feel attraction to exclusively the opposite (at least on the skin color spectrum).
It makes me feel that I am a little racist inside and it worries me very much. It's not that I don't find colored girls beautiful, just that they don't appeal to me personally.

I don't wanna have a bias based on such a stupid parameter, I wanna see what a person can offer me on a emotional/personal level before being attracted to them so heavily.


I'm so confused and don't know what to do, is there a way I can break this bias? Or do you think I should accept it? Please be kind to me if possible i know this a weird one and might offend some people in that case I'm sorry.",10Nov2020,1
22,"hi everyone. so i (16f) am in high school right now (im a senior, so i'm in my last year before I go to college next year) and i've been having some issues with schoolwork. i used to be pretty decent at school, I got all B's and above (except for in math where I got a C+ but fuck math) up until my sophomore year. that year was pretty difficult and i had some physical/mental issues, and I admittedly fucked up my own life and all my grades tanked. soph year, I also had a substance abuse problem, which I still struggle with a bit now but it's a LOT more under control. anyways, junior year, I got sober and tried really hard at school. studied for every test, took notes, turned in all my assignments on time, etc. I swear I tried as hard as, if not harder, than I'd tried before, and yet it still seems I can't get my grades like they were. even now, although everything is online, i find it increasingly more difficult to keep my grades up, even though I seem to be doing everything right. do any of you have any tips on what I could be doing wrong? 

I haven't been high during school/while i'm doing schoolwork since sophomore year, i turn in all my work, I study, and yet I still seem to bomb tests, no matter what class.

This time after expressing concern about the darkness of the colour when wet to three stylists. All they said was oh it’s because it’s wet . It’s OK. When it was finished being dried I get told it’s a beautiful colour. Not is dispute but it wasn’t the colour I had asked gir . I even showed them
A photo and said this is the colour I want. The original stylist then comes up and says I added ash to the colour . No one wants the creamy colour . This  looks more natural and will Hide your greys.

27,"Hi all!

Today I (18m) went to Urgent Care to get an issue on my tonsils checked out, and after a swabbing and some tests, they determined it was mono.

However, I told my girlfriend (19f) that they were going to do a mono test, and her assumption instantly went towards cheating (she has a history of awful exes who treated her terribly, so I understand, however, that’s NOT something I do. She told me that she didn’t have/hadn’t had it).
I swore up and down that I have never cheated and would never cheat (which is the truth). She has a hard time trusting people already, but I feel like I at least was able to get through to her on that end. As a guy who’s been cheated on myself, I understand that feeling and could never inflict that on anyone, especially not her.

My problem is I don’t know how to tell her I have it, considering the probable assumption from her. What’s almost as bad is I have no idea how I got it. The last time I saw her was when I flew upstate last weekend to visit (we’re long distance), and I left on Tuesday. Maybe it was from the plane? It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, because I don’t even share utensils/cups with my family unless they’re washed, and she’s the only person who I’ve had any physical contact with (in that regard) since then. 

TL;DR: I got mono but I have no idea how; I haven’t had any physical contact with anyone in that way except my girlfriend (who says she hasn’t had and doesn’t have it).

How do I tell her while assuring her 100% that I’m not cheating?",10Nov2020,1
28,"earlier in september my roommate (J) who has been super careless (no hand washing or hand sanitizer usage, hanging out with everyone, going to parties etc) has 7(!!) friends who were positive for covid, neglected to tell her roommates, and went to go get tested. I found out because I heard her saying over the phone that she doesn’t feel well and I gave her the night to tell us but she did not (our other roommate was going to see family that weekend). I confronted her the next morning about it and that’s when she told me her friends were positive and she was gonna get tested. 
me and 2 other roommates (B &amp; T) work and have been taking covid very seriously. if J had covid we wouldn’t be able to work for 2 weeks which is a whole paycheck for me. She is from this city and we asked her if she was going to go home if she was positive (where she has her parents to care for her from distanced, a backyard for fresh air, bigger bedroom, someone to cook her food so she doesn’t have to touch everything in the kitchen, etc) we said it wasn’t fair that we’re taking it seriously and she’s not and because she went to a party we had to lose a paycheck. we also said we didn’t want to start an argument and if she had to be quarantine in the apartment that we would figure it out and i offered to wash her dishes, give her my air fryer, and T offered to give her her mini fridge so she could stay in her room as much as possible (Mind you she hasn’t disinfected anything that entire time). She said no and has been flat out ignoring us like a 5 year old child since then.
Not a big deal but now it’s November, thanksgiving is coming which means i’ll see my family soon and I work with children (2 &amp; under) and i have my grad pictures coming up. I heard her coughing a lot last night and T heard her say on the phone that she’s not feeling well. 

My fear here is - what if she doesn’t tell us she’s positive? is there anything I can do against her if she doesn’t tell us she has covid? that’s endangering so many other people. we live in student apartment housing and i just have one more month that i need to deal with her bullshit.",10Nov2020,1
29,"It sucks so badly seeing all of my childhood friends become nicotine and dope addicts. It’s just weird, like I went to their 7th birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese with their supportive ass suburban mothers, and now they’re asking for 20 dollars to spare for some weed.

It’s hard though, I can’t just leave these guys, they’re all I’ve known since elementary school and they’re essentially my only friends

IDK if anyone listening has shitty stoner friends, but eventually they peer pressure the fuck outta you and there comes a crossroads where you have to choose if this is really how you wanna end up.

And I honestly don’t hate weed, I understand it’s use every once in a while. But it makes these people so damn lazy uninterested, and completely full of themselves, and this just isn’t what I want to be.

31,"So I have been thinking about having a threesome with my partner for awhile now and we have spoke about it, because I’m bisexual (and a girl) my male partner suggested a girl which I was fine with. However, I’m a very jealous person so at first I just wanted him to not have sex with her just foreplay but he stated it was unfair as that is not how it works. I understood and I’m finally accepting that if we did have one he would have to have sex with the other woman, and A part of me doesn’t want to see him do that it makes me scared he will leave me for her. So I thought of the option of a foursome, with another man to make it fair as we are both sleeping with the opposite sex I wouldn’t feel as like betrayed. On the other hand he is against the idea completely as he doesn’t want to see his girlfriend getting fucked by another man but he is doing the same to me but reversed.

i don't know how to be an adult for my dad. i don't know what to consider in my budget. i don't know how to stop smoking so much weed. i don't know how to stay strong and go to work. i'm scared. i want to help. i don't know how. i don't know even where to begin. i only have $800 in my bank right now and I don't know what to spend it on. i need things for work but i can probably make do without them. i don't know how to be frugal. i don't know how to exist right now. help.

tldr; mom in hospital, almost no income coming in from dad, i have a semi well paying job. what do i need to consider spending my money on right now?",10Nov2020,1
33,"I have issues with anxiety and depression. And it’s confusing to know sometimes if my problems are from that or if I’m just lazy most of the time. 

It’s hard for me to get up early, and even harder when my family likes to remind me that I have this problem. I’m a night owl, so if I don’t have to be somewhere the next day, I sleep in. Late. 

I’m sick and tired of my parents constantly reminding me of my issues, because I’m well aware that they are issues. I never remind them of their problems, but it feels like they like to remind me of mine whenever they are frustrated. 

Therefore, I want to move out. I’m an adult, and I would have liked to be at my own place by now, but I have almost no confidence. And whenever I gain some of it, my parents shatter it. 

They can be fair, but most of the time now I just hate them. My Dad is on a stupid diet where he can’t even think straight because he doesn’t give himself enough calories and on top of that he’s diabetic. And even though I’ve expressed my concern to him, my mom, and a therapist, they all say that he’s an adult and should be able to take care of himself. But I know they’re all just terrible. There comes a point where people will end up killing themselves before they realize what they’re doing isn’t helping. And I get plagued by the guilt that if I don’t speak up, my Dad will suffer for it. 

I think I have a place where I could live, but I would have to find a job. I’m the only person holding myself back right now. 

I guess I could just need some helpful advice and encouragement. This kInda turned into a rant, but I’m just so sick of living with my parents and feeling like a failure.",10Nov2020,1

I'm a senior in high school rn. Quarantine has given me a lot of time to really mull over things, and one thing that has been on my mind was this kid last year who was pretty mean to me. He basically took an embarrassing picture of me, and said mean things to me here and there, and touched my property without my permission once. Weirdly enough, it never bothered me much throughout the year, but it has been something that I slowly picked up on during quarantine. When I confronted him about why he said/did those things, he either says that it's a joke, or that he never remembered saying those things and that I'm an awful person for trying to ""gaslight"" him. He's full of shit, because I know for the fact that he said those things, but confronting him about it has proven to be useless because I've hit a brick wall with him. Some of his friends are like that towards me too. It's weird how I never really noticed or pick up on these things when they happen.

Is it normal to have past experiences like that, and in general run into assholes who disrespect your feelings and property?

Or do some people go through life never encountering scenarios where their property was never disrespected and they were never treated like garbage?",10Nov2020,1

36,"A coworker transferred from another department to my department several months ago. We work odd shifts due to COVID, and my company is pretty laid back, so we often communicate via text (although my boss communicates with all of us that work under him via email). This new coworker has been incredibly difficult to communicate with. Since I work more closely with her than anyone else in the department, my boss has come to me several times and asked me to get in touch with her when he has a question, because she has not been very consistently responsive to his emails. I generally have an easier time getting in touch with her via text, but it's still not great. It's clear sometimes that she doesn't even bother to even read the details of my questions or my plans for the next day, and she'll just respond ""k"" to something that requires more of a response. I'll also note that I have tried communicating with her via email instead of text, and it doesn't make a difference.

Anyway, two weeks ago, she came to me and told me that I need to communicate with her better.  It was very hard to bite my tongue since all of my coworkers have had an issue communicating with her, not me. I asked her if she had any suggestions for how she'd prefer I communicate with her better, but she didn't really give me an answer. She did bring up a specific instance where she claimed I didn't tell her about something ahead of time. I pulled up the exact text where I did fill her in, and I read it aloud to her. I thought the issue ended there, but she has continued to make remarks about my lack of communication since then. Any suggestions on how I bring this up with her tactfully?

tl;dr my coworker is awful at communicating. Everyone in the department knows this. However, she is blaming me for not communicating with her. How do I tactfully let her know that she is the one who needs to communicate better?",10Nov2020,1

38,"This started as a rant, but I have no idea what to do so I'm gonna post here

My good friend started dating this girl around two years ago. Me and his girl knew of each other, but never had any classes together or ever talked really. He introduced us to each other and that was that. About a year after they started dating she randomly texted me for some reason and we just started casually texting each other. It wasn't anything serious, just our daily life and what was going on in our world. As time progressed and we got to know each other, we started getting into more personal things and talking and hanging out. We texted each other daily and voice called all the time and hung out on occasion. She knows pretty much everything about me and I know pretty much everything about her. We know each others life stories, family, aspirations, relationships, sexual life/preferences, deepest darkest secrets and confessions, everything. I have told her that she is the closest person I have ever had to a girlfriend. Her parents even call me her ""step boyfriend"". At first when we started talking, I didn't have a crush on her. I honestly considered her to be a friend and nothing more. However around December 2019 is when we really started to get to know each other and started getting into the more personal aspects of our lives. That's when the feeling for her started to really develop. She has told me all of the details of her relationship with her boyfriend. She has told me that their relationship has significantly stagnated and is ""boring"". She puts more effort into the relationship and there are some problems that she has addressed that he doesn't really care to change. I really hate saying it, but this has given me hope. Around the start of quarantine in March is when I went head over heels for her. When quarantine started, being bored, me and her started exploring psychedelics together. We would smoke and take lsd or shrooms on the weekends and just hang out together. When we hung out and tripped, we cuddled, held hands, fell asleep next to each other and even slow danced. I have shed tears from her several times and I know she has shed tears from me too. It honestly feels like a relationship. I know there are definitely mutual feelings, but I don't know how mutual they are and it is something that I don't know if I wanna test for fear of losing my best friend. This last August, I moved to the other side of the country for university. Our friendship didn't change the slightest. We still texted daily and we voice called all the time. However these past two or three weeks have been different. She recently moved in with her boyfriend and said she was dealing with some personal and family issues and told me that she was going to take a break from social media and texting. At first it was fine, but I quickly realized just how attached and dependent I am on her. This is gonna sound cringe as fuck, but each morning when I wake up, first thing I do is check my phone and cross my fingers hoping that I have a text or snap from her. She is the only thing on my mind everyday. She even taunts me in my dreams. I fucking hate this. I wanna confess my love to her but I can't and I have hope for a relationship that is probably not gonna happen. Third wheel fucking sucks and I hate that I love her.",10Nov2020,1
40,"I never really had a troubled childhood and my mother did her best to take care of me. During my teen years all I wanted to do was play video games. However, I never was really held accountable for my actions during High School and eventually I stopped going. Mostly because I told myself that I didn't see the point if I wasn't getting paid to do so. How stupid I was. My mother enrolled me in online classes and that worked for a little while but eventually I started to slack on that and eventually stopped. Ironically, when I did go to High School, for the last year I was there, I only went to one class which was my Algebra class. I some how had the highest grade in the class.  Eight years ago, we moved back to my home state and before I did, I took my GED test and past it with such flying colors that the proctors told me they couldn't believe a kid like me stopped going to High School. If I had really applied myself during High School, I am pretty sure I would have ended up very differently but I just never saw the point even though my mom pushed me as hard as she could to stay in school.

&amp;#x200B;

After about year of being back in my home town, I finally got my first job at 20 years old working at McDonalds. Over the next 7 years and working part-time at only a hand full of jobs, I've made my way  from $7.25 an hour to now currently making $15.00 an hour. All of those jobs I had the opportunity to work full time. But I never stepped up to the 40 hours a week because I kept telling myself that I ""Valued"" my free time. My supervisors were baffled when I told them that I wanted more free time for myself than working more for the company. The problem with my thinking was that my free time was really just more time watching shows and playing video games instead of doing something productive. However, during the last couple years I've been really into photography and always wanted it to take off and become an income option for me. This past year, I really stepped my game up for my photography business but due to covid, I haven't been able to book but only a handful of paid gigs.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am almost 28, with only a GED to go to my name along with my photography business that isn't really going anywhere. I mean my business would probably do a lot better but I procrastinate a lot, especially on getting my name out there. It's really starting to sink in that I am almost 30 and I haven't really achieved anything in the past 7 years. It really became apparent when I just recently visited a younger ""lady friend"" in another state. I had made plans to come see her however, she was hesitant on me coming at that time because she had work, a lot of college classes to attend and homework to do. However, at the end of the day, she put in extra hours at work so she could get days I'm visiting off, studied as much as possible a so she wouldn't really be missing anything and did as much school work as possible before I came. She still had a couple projects she had to work on and classes to attend while I was there but she made time to get it done. I really admire that she just didn't put all of the school work aside just for me. I know a lot of people who would have. It really shows she is determined to get through her schooling and start into her career but also work super hard to get things done so she could accommodate me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After coming back home after my short vacation, here I am in my late twenties, still working the same part-time job for a little over 3 years now that only just recently bumped everyone up to $15/h and half-assedly trying progress my photography business. Today felt like one of the longest day in a very long time and I didn't really accomplish anything other than going to work for 4 hours and then later going to the gym with a friend. Other than that I have been home all day. I do enjoy trying to learn different languages but every time I start, even if I am making decent progress it only takes one little thing for me to stop.

41,"My boyfriend &amp; I had a sort of on and off relationship. All because of me. My fears, but also because he had displayed some selfish behaviors and I felt like I was carrying the relationship which was too much for me in addition to school, single parenting, pandemic, etc. 

The last time I ended things I really wanted it to be for good but I ended up reaching out again. He told me if I wanted to I could when I had ended things. I wish I never did though. I feel horrible about it. And now we are back together and have been for a few months and I feel trapped. Not to mention those selfish behaviors started up again. I was going to use that as my excuse to leave but he said he would keep working on it and so far it hasn’t happened again.

43,"I’m new to posting on reddit and not sure how to put this in words but I’ll try my best. Me, 14F, and my brother, 16M, haven’t spoken in roughly 3 years. In somewhere around March of 2018, he completely cut off all contact to me; blocked me on social medias and unfriended me online, but more importantly refused to speak to me in person. I don’t remember any conflict that may have caused this; we of course had our arguments but they were all over minor things and were quickly resolved. Now, if I walk into the same room as him, he’ll immediately abandon whatever he was doing to get up and leave as quickly as possible. The one time I kept following him, about a month after he cut me off, he took his bicycle and left the house, not coming back until after midnight. When he cut me off I was 12 at the time and my parents assured me that it was just a phase; I was happy to believe them and made no attempts after the first year to speak to him, telling myself I’d just give him space until he’s ready to talk to me again. Recently I’ve been wanting to reconnect with him because he’s almost old enough to move out and I may never have the chance to speak with him or get to know him past that point, but I’m not sure if it’s the right move. Is it worth talking to him again and if so, how should I approach doing so?

A few more details since I don’t know if I need to add on: We both live in the same house, we’re financially stable and both our parents are supportive. He still talks with my parents normally as long as I’m not in the conversation, and he avoids all family events. We have similar interests and passions (science, video games, music, puzzles) if that makes any difference. I don’t recall any signs that he was about to cut me off before he did, but I wasn’t very attentive as a 12 year old so it’s possible that there were and I just missed them. We’re both straight A students. At this point I’m just saying random information so if there’s information you need to know feel free to ask, thank you so much for reading this post!",10Nov2020,1

Hello, new here.

About a year and a half ago I hooked up with this girl. I had no intention of anything more than sex and I made that clear. Well after the 4th meetup or so, she said she was on birth control and I was stupid enough to believe it so I came inside her. A few weeks later she tells me she's pregnant. Hate me if you will but I cut all ties as best as I could as I was not in a point in my life where I could take care of a baby.

For months after I would occasionally wonder whether she had the baby or got an abortion. Again, hate me if you will, but I preferred the latter to happen. We were both not in good places in our lives and didn't want kids, especially together as we barely knew each other.

Fast forward to 10 minutes ago, I message her out of the blue mostly out of boredom. I bring up the topic as I'm genuinely curious, but she prefers not to disclose anything. At that point I assume abortion, which I was frankly hoping she had done, but I'm still curious so I push a little bit. She then decides to tell me, ""shes doing fine, with a good family"".

Holy.

Fuck.

I guess I'm a god damn parent, and clearly a shit one at that. I just don't know what to do. I DO NOT WANT TO MEET THE KID, at least not for like 20 years. I seriously want nothing to do with any of that right now. I finally am getting my life on track and pursuing a career. I don't know what to feel or say. I feel like I should tell my girlfriend, but I have no idea how to do that or if it's even worth it. I should've just left it alone when she didn't want to tell me, as I would've went about my life assuming she didn't go through with it which would've been fine by me. I realize I sound like a huge fucking immoral jerk and I probably am, but this is my story so I figure someone might want to hear it.",10Nov2020,1
48,"My girlfriend (24F, bisexual) and I (22F, lesbian) have been together for ~2.5 almost 3 years. We are very in love and are living together (and have been for the past 1.5+ year). Before living together we had sex about 2x/week? Which I feel like is pretty “normal” for a wlw couple. In the past year it has gone down like crazy. Maybe we’ll have sex once every two weeks?

The issue is that we want to have sex at different frequencies (basically I’m in the mood more frequently than she is). As a result we’ve been having sex much less often (I never pressure her to when she’s not in the mood). I try to bring it up with because I really want us to try to get on the same page (either have sex with a frequency  that’s good for both of us or come up w an arrangement where we can be in an open relationship where I am allowed to sleep w other people). She doesn’t like talking about it and says that talking about it makes her not want to have sex even more. She’s told me it’s not that she doesn’t love me or is no longer attracted to me, she just isn’t in the mood as frequently for some reason.

 I don’t really _want_ to sleep with other women, but sex is really important to me — just having that connecting with another woman, feeling sexy, relaxing my muscles, etc. When I don’t have sex for a while I get stressed/self confidence is low.

Anyone else been through this? Would love some advice. I’m so sad to see her sad/stressed about this and I am sick of feeling so low energy/low self confidence.",10Nov2020,1

There is no talking to her, because she doesn't know how to talk. She has extreme anger issues, and if I say anything to her, she screams at me. I'm afraid to say anything to her, and I'm constantly walking on eggshells. 

I don't handle screaming like a lot of people do. When she screams, I have terrible mental breakdowns with extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  I've been hospitalized twice now because of it. 

I've tried talking to her. Hospital staff, and my counselor, have tried talking to her. Other family members have tried talking to her. But nothing ever changes. I don't know If I can handle this any longer. I shouldn't be afraid of the person I live with. 

I don't have anywhere else to go, that's why the homeless shelter is my only other option. But the problem is, I have a cat. I know my aunt would care for her. But the thought of abandoning her hurts me. She wouldn't understand why she never saw me again. I know she loves me, and I love her.

Sometimes she comes to me, lets me pet her, sleeps on my lap, etc. And she almost always sleeps with me. Shes more loving toward me then anyone else in the house.   


But like a week ago Me and my mom got a new cat, because we've always wanted more animals in the house. But i didn't know getting this new cat, would cause my parents to give my current cat to my sister, because theyd always hiss at each other whenever i saw each other. so instead of getting them to get along over time, they're just deciding to get rid of her.  


Im feeling really lonely. Even though me and this cat were never like insanely attached, ive had her for 5 years and have just grow attached i guess. The thought of never seeing her again just makes me feel alone and lost. Me and my mom get along fine, but my step dad always yells at me, blames me for everything, always bitching and being negative. To the point where i don't leave my room into he's gone to bed because i don't want him nagging me. And this cat always being in my room, even though shes just sleeping most of the time, made me feel better i guess. i dont know, like she'd protect me or something, even though she'd prob be the first running lol.   


But when shes gone, theres not gonna be a cat in my room anymore. This new cat mainly spends time with my mom, and rarely ever comes in my room because the way we're stopping them from fighting right now is my current cat in my room, and the other cat in the rest of the house. So me and this new cat will most likely never bond.  


Im just kind of mad at this new cat now. Because of it im getting rid of a friend i had for 5 years, and my cat will probably be really sad and lonely, because my sister is busy most of the day so there'll be no one there. I just feel really bad for her.  


I havent cried in like 10 years, and this is the first time since then ive actually cried a bit. Im pissed at the new cat, my step dad for influencing my mom for us to get rid of this cat, and my mom for going along with it.

55,"Let me premise this with me saying I come from an Italian-American family and the one thing we are taught is that you work hard - nothing else matters you just have to work hard. If you have a full time job, you should have another on the side. And if you come to work early you should also stay late. I've been hearing this my whole life and **partially** agree and assume everyone else who has a normal work ethic feels this way.

I say *partially* because I used to feel like I'd work until I drop, but now that I'm older and have a fiancee, I don't want to push more than 8hrs a day. It's like when I was younger I had so much angst/energy that it helped me in working extra hard &amp; doing more than I needed, but now I've evened out.

I guess I'm also looking for some approval. I'm not happy with my career and my fiancee has never said anything positive about my work ethic and I'm holding some resentment (which I'm discovering as I type this). 

I worked my ass off from 18 - 24 until I taught English out of the country and I wasn't prepared for that. College was hard for me because I was behind in high school (emotionally, my grades were always good but I was never challenged or challenged myself) and then when I taught out of the country I began drinking heavily (only at night) because I was living a bachelor lifestyle, but also was dealing with a lot of anxiety &amp; uncertainty - but it looked bad, *lazy.* At that time I was 26, and then I worked my ass off for 2 yrs at a new job and still had a lot of anxiety, drank a lot with my coworkers, but I made up for it with my accomplishments and/or what I did for the job. I started to challenge myself more and fix my little mistakes &amp; shortcomings.

I moved back to the US and went to a coding bootcamp, but failed. I spent 8 hours everyday (literally I would time it) formatting &amp; editing resumes, coding, solving algorithms, and building websites. But with no avail. This happened for two years. At that time I struggled getting past interviews for any job in the US. Not only was I failing every tech interview but I couldn't pass the test for a lego job that I failed by 3 points and I had worked there for 3 weeks, I quit Amazon because it was tough, and I left Starbucks because I moved across the country. I wanted support from my fiancee but she was afraid that I had become/always been a slacker. I tried so hard I had to start wearing braces on my wrists (carpal tunnel), so I gave up coding. 

After feeling like such a failure, and wondering what my friends abroad would think if they saw what became of me, I lost \~15lbs and curbed my drinking to only the weekends/being with friends. I picked up reading and exercising again as hobbies and am overall doing much better. Two days before I was going to accept a job in my fiancees home country a relative of mine gave me a job offer in the US so I decided to stay. My fiancee and I have been wanting to live in the US together so this was our way of doing it. We're waiting on her visa to be approved, which has been paused because of COVID.

56,"So it’s a pretty long story and there’s a bit of context needed.

I recently moved to California for a few months for school, and in the past few months my mom and I have been getting more and more distant. 

Our phone calls went from everyday, to once a week, if even. She suddenly started talking more and more about how she was stockpiling weapons for when the Democrats took over, but I kind of brushed it off. I thought she was just exaggerating. 

I posted Black Lives Matter during the protests, and on my birthday she called me and told me she wanted nothing to do with me. She got over it and apologized. Again, I thought this was weird, but my mom is known to have anger issues occasionally, so I brushed it off.

We recently voted together, and she pulled me aside and told me that if Biden won, that a lot was going to change. She told me that she was going to liquidate her assets and move to Australia (no clue why there?), take me off her insurance, kick me out, and leave everything behind. Again, like an idiot, I thought she was being dramatic like she always is. Apparently I was wrong. She has stopped talking to me, won’t reply to my texts unless she needs something, and started getting serious about leaving the country. But that’s not all.

She texted me this morning about how she was prepared to die for Donald Trump, and that she was scared that Democrats were going to kill her to take her guns. She’s literally going insane. She has been talking about taking me off her healthcare plan (I’m 20 and am still in school). I’m genuinely worried because it seems as though she’s in some sort of cult. 

I keep reaching out but she shuts me down. My family has told me that she’s been talking about me behind my back. She refuses to help me financially at all. I genuinely think this is all because I didn’t vote for Trump. 

She’s also gotten back with her abusive ex who is super hardcore Republican, who hates gay people. (I’m gay). I can’t help but think he may have something to do with this.

I feel really isolated right now and I’m honestly scared. I don’t want her to disappear from my life completely.

Tl;dr: my mom has stopped interacting with me because I voted for Biden. She’s going insane due to right wing propaganda and she’s told me she’s going to cut me off. What do I do?",10Nov2020,1
57,"Every night. And I mean every night. I get extremely hungry. I get so hungry it begins to hurt and I can’t sleep. 

This causes me to eat a lot of food and sometimes I’ll go and binge on food without self control. If I refuse food, it takes a lot of will power and is surprisingly very tiring to do. My mind just can’t stop thinking about food. 

I’m not starving myself though the day, in fact it doesn’t matter how much I eat during the day, every night starting at 7 until midnight I just get hungry. 

Any advice on how to stop this? I already go on a walk from 8-9 and then take a shower, however after that until bed it takes everything I have not to go into the kitchen and scarf down 2 bowls of oatmeal, chips, candy, milk, cheese, and everything else.",10Nov2020,1

60,"Hey everyone! First time posting here. I’ll cut to the chase.

I am publishing a book about cycling across Canada with one friend (cyclist) and another friend (support driver). We did this at 17 and it took us 47 days.

All that to say, we are near the end of the publishing journey, yet, are still hung up on the title! Any ideas? Our current “working” title is this: “Three Guys, Two Bikes, One Car: A Cross-Canada Journey of Adventure and Woe”

It’s decent. Just not exactly what we are looking for, I guess.

“Genre” would be autobiography/travelogue. It is laid back, colloquial in style, a telling of a story by friends. Is written by all three perspectives. Themes would be about endurance and the ability to accomplish goals. Friendship and adventure would be other major themes.

62,"Hi,

I'm a current graduate student living in university-owned housing while completely remote. I am about 6 hours from my family and boyfriend, who recently started a new job in the northeast. I live in a 1br, so it's been really easy to social distance/isolate, which has definitely helped some of my covid-related anxieties, but my experience here has otherwise been terrible. A couple of weeks ago, the university updated my lease to say that if we experience a spike in cases, and the university decides it's unsafe to have students here, we can and will be forced to evacuate. I led a petition with some of the other students asking the university to reconsider this policy, but it's highly unlikely.

I have been looking forward to moving out since I got here in June 2019, and am now facing an extended winter break from December-February in which I will be sitting here, completely alone. I recently found an apartment in the same state as my boyfriend, and really feel it would be a better situation for my mental health, but I'm incredibly anxious about moving. It would be a 3bd 1ba, so I would be taking on roommates, but the space is beautiful and the other two seem really great. My spring semester seems to be fully remote, and though a lot could change between now and the summer semester, I can't imagine being in-person then, either. 

Somehow, it feels stupid to move, and the idea of just packing up and leaving and possibly exposing myself to other people terrifies me, but I am also generally drained. It could be really refreshing to just hear other people moving about. Is this a good idea? How can I be sure to keep myself safe? 

TL;DR: How do you move apartments during a pandemic?",10Nov2020,1

77,"anyway, context. Things were great between us and had slowly started to taking a nose dive due to many events in our lives.

I'm not very good at showing my love especially under a lot of stress and i come off as an asshole. not to mention i'm trans and my voice has deepened and made it even harder for me to not come off as an asshole or mad. Combine that with my korean heritage of stone face and minimal expression of emotions, things will worsen quickly.

we've gotten into some really bad fights and he's wanted to leave multiple times because of them. all of them over petty little things and most of the fights started because of me. I've been given like 10+ chances to fix myself and this last time i felt like i was doing pretty well i would say until recently...

recently when he was away for about 12 days, i poked around on grindr for shits and giggles and wasnt planning on hooking up with anyone on there. against my better judgement i was coaxed into a hookup. i felt terrible afterwards and couldn't bring myself to tell him and my other partners about it. 

after he came home, i asked first if i could hookup with people on grindr. due to the current state of the world, the answer of course was no. a day passes and i couldnt just continue with not telling him. so i told him. He's livid and crying, and I'm trying to say it isnt a big deal (im a huge idiot) and trying to play it off as nothing. He leaves the apartment to go and be with his other partners to be consoled. in the mean time, i tell my other partners about it too. They're hurt and breakup with me. 

at this time im laying on the couch absolutely mortified by my behavior and how i handled everything. i sleep for about 6 hours and awaken to my Husband coming back to the apartment, accompanied by his other partners, and he tells me that it's over, he's taking the cat and he's going to get all of his stuff taken out the next time i go to work. 

I dont take it well and react with anger and confusion but i dont challenge him at all and he leaves with the cat and some of the cat's things.

i finally process everything that had happened and cry the rest of the night. I wake up early the next morning dress in my nicest clothes and go out to buy flowers for him and my other partners. i show up at where he's staying and im crying and begging for them to let me in knocking profusely on the door. (this causes all of them to have a panic attack because they all have anxiety about answering the door) after about 45 minutes, i give up and leave the flowers on the doorstep. then i go sit in my car and message my husband to please give me another chance. after about 20 minutes of sitting, the flowers are slammed onto the hood of my car and im told to leave by one of their more physically fit friends. i get out and toss the flowers into my back seat and then get in my car and leave, my car tires screeching as i drive away. 

i want another chance but it's looking pretty hopeless as him and his friends im sure hate my guts.

81,"Watched porn on some normal sites, decided to search for porn on Twitter. Clicked on this one hashtag and scrolled for 10-30 minutes. Then I saw this one video that looked like an underage girl. At first I thought it was an actor or someone who just looked young. 

Then I clicked on the account, it was a new account and had two videos. It had another video with an underage looking girl. Then I found two other accounts that were connected to the first. One had two videos, and the other had three.

All of the videos (except one) looked like they had underage girls. All of them were sexual in some way, 3 of them showed the girls “top” and one of them showed a ‘little bit” of the girls “bottom.”

They all had Chinese text, I watched all the videos and finally decided to translate. I still had some doubt that it was a child, but the translated text said something like “contact 80284882 for more content of **lolita**” and some sexual words.

My heart just sank and I was hit with the worst ever feeling. There’s no way that was an actor. I just watched CP. I reported the account and just left it there. 

I couldn’t sleep that night. I felt like a pedophile, I couldn’t get the video out of my head, the girls looked 7 years old, yet I still had doubt. 

The next day **I went back to the videos.** I still had a little doubt, but now I’m 100% sure it was a child. I still watched them a second time even though I knew it was a child. 

This happened a few days ago. I live in the US and I’m under 18. I feel like I’m going to hell (even though I’m not religious), and prison. 

Am I considered a fucking pedophile now? What the fuck do I do? There’s no way I’m getting this video out of my head for a while. The girls looked 8 years younger then me.

83,"A couple of years ago, my wife (32) and I flew across the country to spend Christmas with her parents in the city where she grew up. While there, she reconnected with ""Hilda"", a friend from childhood who still lives there that she hadn't seen in decades.

We had a nice dinner with Hilda and her husband and everything seemed normal; we exchanged numbers, added each other on Facebook, sent a few Christmas cards, the whole deal.

Over the next couple of years, Hilda and my wife would occasionally text, but it quickly became apparent that Hilda wanted to be in contact much more often than my wife did. If they started texting, Hilda would keep texting all day long, with long updates about her life. She would also be the first to react or comment on my wife's Facebook posts, often within minutes of the posts going up, and would quickly message with follow-up questions.

It was more than my wife had the time, energy, or desire for. But she didn't want to be confrontational, so she didn't ask her to stop. She began responding less frequently, allowing a few days to go by in between messages, but the result was always the same: as soon as she responded at all, Hilda would message her back immediately and resume the hours-long conversation.

Soon Hilda messaged my wife asking if she wanted to have regular weekly phonecalls. My wife politely declined. Then Hilda began messaging asking to have video chats and online game nights, and then she sent my wife a physical letter in the mail, asking if she wanted to be pen pals. At this point my wife, freaked out, stopped responding, hoping that Hilda would get the message about the level of friendship she wanted to have.

Well, she hasn't gotten the message. The texts have not stopped or reduced in frequency. And the letters have continued; she has now sent four letters to my wife (another one arrived last week). Perfectly friendly letters, talking about her life, acting like she and my wife are pen pals. But they're not. Hilda never gets a response, but she keeps on writing.

So at this point it's almost scary. The intensity and frequency of the attempts to contact her have only made my wife sure that she doesn't want to be friends with Hilda at all. She's hidden herself from her on Facebook. Hilda has often mentioned wanting to come and visit us in the city where we live and, given that she knows our address, my wife is a little worried that Hilda will show up at our door one day.

Can potential employers or colleges see this mistake? I’m a little worried that something that feels like such a stupid mistake might affect my future. I just turned 19 two months ago, it feels a little soon to be blacklisted when I’ve never done anything up until this point.

So some new people moved in to the room next door and they have been eating my food-  almonds, honey, bread, rice, reasons, cheese I just some that I noticed. And I confronted them, they admitted to using the bread and cheese but denied everything else but I am sure they did.  they said that they eat it by accident, thinking it was theirs. Which is really weird considering the fact that the bread and the cheese were both completely different friends. And the cheese packet was a completely new one that was opened. I don't know if it's fake complacency calmer or accident or just plain out thinking they can get with free food but I'm unsure what to do next. I found out about the cheese last night and that was the final point for me. I felt so pissed because it was a completely new pack it up, how could they have opened it? So I messaged the landlord and told him about the previous foods they have been eating and the cheese. I did not outright accuse anyone, I just told him the facts as it is which is that the food has been declining since they moved in and they admitted to taking the bread once but denied eating the rice and that however I am sure someone ate 25% of my rice over night. I did not confront about the other foods however I left notes, “please don’t take my food thanks, it is expensive” on my honey and they stopped taking it after that and leaving the lid unclosed and attracting ants to it (wtf). I left a label “S” which is the first letter of my name on the cheese last night and maybe that’s why they knocked on my door today morning and told me they ate the wrong cheese- maybe it really was accident- or complacency who knows.

96,"On grandparents day this year, my family and I went to my grandparents house to celebrate. While there, about to leave, their dog ATTACKED my 3 year old daughter; the youngest one of our entire family. She did not do anything to provoke him. My grandfather's leukemia recently returned for the third time and treatment is not working anymore so he is just living with it. The dog was by his side when my daughter was walking around telling everyone goodbye when he just turned and pinned her to the ground with his teeth in her head. My uncle dove to her protection and had to choke the dog to make him let go of my daughters head. He did not just bark or growl or snap to make his point, he literally attacked and would not let go until he was made to. 
 
We rushed her to the ER, she has three pretty bad incisions but is healing well and is doing good thankfully. My big problem though is with my grandparents. Of course they felt bad it happened and paid for the medical bills. But they refuse to put the dog down or even get rid of it in any way. My parents have decided to have nothing to do with them. My husband, my daughter and I used to visit them frequently but haven't since the incident. I've talked to them over the phone a few times when they call to check up on my daughter and I ask how they are doing. 

My question is should I not have any contact with them like my parents want or should I just ask them to keep the dog locked up when we visit?

She has become a little paranoid, stocking up on huge supplies of food and water. She has been referring to the Democrats as ""evil"" and is convinced they've stolen the election. It seems to be only a matter of time before she falls into the QAnon conspiracy theory. 

This is all so out of character for her, and I'm concerned that something medical could be going on. What should I do?? For context, she's in her mid-60s and is retired.",10Nov2020,1
98,"been in a weird/sad/stressful situation since late August with my boyfriend. we used to live together, but he had a serious mental breakdown that landed him in a mental health hospital. for whatever reason, his dad-who hasn’t been in his life for 5 years up until now-decided the best thing for him was to live with him (his dad lives across the country from here), but took him on a flight back to his place literally a day after he came back from the hospital. I’m still a little pissed about it, I think his family should have waited a little bit before making such a drastic change in his life right after a serious breakdown, especially since he was only in the hospital for a week and they had just given him antipsychotics so they hadn’t kicked in yet. buttt what’s done is done I guess. 

my boyfriend’s family was in denial that it was a mental health issue going on and at some point, his dad took him off his meds (at that point he has been on them for a little over a month and was no longer acting delusional/manic/having hallucinations). I was on the fence about him not being medicated anymore so soon, but he was slowly getting better. I guess my boyfriend thought he was recovering super fast, bc then he felt ready to smoke weed again. I couldn’t change his mind on it, so I decided to just keep an eye on his behavior. 

about a week into my boyfriend smoking, he started acting strange again. he would text me/say super cryptic things, was saying the same stuff he said right before his earlier breakdown, even sent me a formula he wrote for the secret of the universe. I called his dad to let him know about his behavior and that he had been smoking again. luckily, I think his dad is starting to take his mental health seriously bc he told me he had put him back on the medication when he noticed a change in his behavior. so I’m glad I let him know my boyfriend was smoking again before he continued the medication. I told him it would be a good idea to put him in another mental health facility where he’s under more care/monitoring-for longer than a week-but he never replied back. his family is really against facilities, but I think they need to give it a shot especially since he and his dad are in a state that has pretty decent mental health assistance. at the very least, get the poor dude a professional to talk to...he’s medicated again, but it’s only been 3 or 4 days, so I know it hasn’t taken much effect yet and his recent texts confirm this. I’ve tried to text back reassuring messages, but he’s not all the way there so it gets lost in translation. I had gotten sick 2 days ago and felt horrible; all I wanted to do was be on the phone with him and hear his voice while I stayed curled up in bed. I asked if I could call him n he called me, but when I didn’t respond as much-partly due to pain, partly bc I have no idea what to say back to “god can come in his mouth”-he just hung up. I know he’s struggling right now but it still sucks to see it. 

after that, I decided it was best for me to give him space until the meds took effect. but he still has been texting me weird things and I feel horrible for not responding. but it really is like talking to a wall, or more like trying to talk to someone w a language barrier, or as if they’re hard of hearing (the simplest example I can give is I texted “I’m sorry to have asked” and he sent back “he never asked?”). I’m not sure if me texting him right now is helpful or harmful. 

then I thought maybe he shouldn’t have his phone at all while he’s in this state. I know he isn’t using it other than to text me his stream of consciousness, like he’s not on social media or using it to stay up to date with stuff bc he’s gone so far into his own mind, he barely picks up his phone (he was acting like this right before he slipped back into psychosis). but I worry it’s only a matter of time before he uses his socials to announce his theories on the universe or gets triggered by something he sees on his phone. I want to tell his dad to take his phone away until his meds kick in bc I feel like maybe that would help in the recovery process, but I’m not sure. I don’t want my boyfriend to think I’m ignoring him but at the same time I really doubt he’s thinking like that at all right now you know? I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: boyfriend has slipped back into psychosis and keeps texting me cryptic/manic things; not sure if it’s a good idea to ask his dad to take his phone away until his meds kick in or not. 

many thanks for any advice given. I’m also 100% open to advice on how to be a supportive person to someone suffering from psychosis. I want to be equipped to handle these kinds of situations in the future or better yet do my best to lessen/prevent them from happening. I really miss him and I’m very lonely now that I’m in this apartment alone, so advice on how to cope with that would be dope too, but not as necessary as the pressing issue.",10Nov2020,1
99,"Hi reddit, 

Senior in high school year. Ever since freshman year I was always shy, a bit socially awkward and introverted, that's just my nature but I had a lot of friends in middle school and then I went to a high school where I didn't know anyone from middle school. I made a lot of ""casual"" friends I'd talk to in school but I never really managed to find a group of people I could go out with on the weekends. Flash forward to senior year where covid has severely limited the amount of social interaction I can get in high school (I can only go in person two times a week). My biggest desire more than anything is to be able to get a friend group, but I feel like the situation is out of control and I keep trying to figure out ways to get around my situation.",10Nov2020,1

101,"One of my colleagues has been making my life hell since I started a new role four months ago. My team works in supply chain with a few main customers (other businesses). The problem colleague (we'll call him Ass) has a role much more customer facing than mine.  Ass uses this to his advantage, cutting off customer access whenever he can by bashing his teammates to the customer, stealing credit for the work we do, and blaming us when things go wrong. He has some of them convinced that he's the only person they can trust because the rest of us are incompetent.

Ass particularly targeted four of us that he felt threatened by, two of the guys changed their roles to avoid him and the other guy who is stuck like I am has just been taking it for the past two years. He recently confided in me that it's cost him a lot of stress and mental health. I came from another group within my company and am regarded by the higher ups as a high performer so I can be more outspoken. I've challenged the guy directly and he backed down from direct confrontation, but is still going behind my back and undermining me. I just had this confirmed from someone he talked shit to about me two weeks ago. 

I've tried talking to him directly, and talking to his boss but he just lies and his very non-confrontational boss chooses to believe whatever's easiest for him. One of the other four people went to HR and the guy supposedly got written up but nothing changed. My boss is aware but can't do much other than call out the most obvious lies if he happens to be in a meeting with us. I'm documenting in case I ever go to HR but our HR only steps in if someone steals money or breaks a law. Knowing that I'm being bashed behind my back is making me a little crazy, and I recently snapped at someone I actually like for making a mistake. I'm also less productive because I'm so stressed out.

If I can work through this, I'm in a great spot for a nice promotion within the next couple of years. I'm afraid the effect that this is having on my mental health is going to ruin my chance to promote though. Any advice on how to get through the next two years successfully is much appreciated! I love my company and would lose money if I left so I'd like to stay.",10Nov2020,1
102,"I'm eighteen, my younger brother is thirteen. I have no idea what to do, he has become this raging  misogynist and a white supremacist. I don't know how to prevent him from falling further down this rabbit hole, let alone reverse what's been done. Whenever I try to explain to him how hateful and hurtful his speech and philosophies are, he gets angry and retreats to the internet to be with the people that think like him. (he also won't listen to a word I say because ""i'm a girl""). I won't even get into his beliefs, because they are hard for me to even write down.

My brother is very intelligent, he built his own computer a year ago, so my parents won't take the internet away from him because, ""he worked so hard to build it"". I understand he'll find the internet if he wants to, I'm a teenager too, but its scary how my parents are enabling him. They are completely oblivious. They don't pick up on his little dogwhistles like I do, both because they don't spend a lot of time on the internet, and obviously are not a part of the alt-right community. There is no one else in his life that will intervene besides me, and I don't know what to do.

It's degrading to be in a room with him, if he were anyone else I would cut him off immediately. But he's my brother, and I know he is being taken advantage of and manipulated online- I just want to help him. I love him, but to be honest, I will have to end my relationship with him if he continues to grow up as this alt-right dude. I can't be disrespected anymore, I'm tired. I know this may seem dramatic, but I want my brother back. 

I give him nothing but respect and I beg him to go out with me to do all of his favorite things, go on hikes, go out to eat, take the dog for a walk, go ANYWHERE- his choice, just to get him out of the house and spend some time with him, but he refuses. I'm scared he's already too far gone at 13. He didn't learn this from me or my parents, they are both liberal, and his school is very liberal. It's all coming from online. This isn't like ""oh no my brother is becoming a conservative and I don't like his beliefs"", he's borderline skinhead.",10Nov2020,1

109,"I'm instinctively a bit of an asshole. Not villainous levels of asshole but an asshole nonetheless. I yell and say mean things sometimes when I'm upset and do selfish things sometimes. Occasionally I say something mean and only realize it a long time later.

My plan thus far has been sort of to contain my assholishness by zoning out when talking to people and keeping interaction to a bare minimum. Most of my socialization takes place in daydreams because it's a contained ""safe zone"". My family members sort of tolerate me as a ""character"" because they are nice.

Here are the problems I'm facing within this plan:

- I'm currently in a position where I have to interact with the same people for a long period of time, and I feel like my assholishness is seeping through the cracks. How do I stop this?

- I'm starting to get really bummed out about concepts like ""if you're good on the inside, the outside shouldn't matter"" because I have neither. If I try becoming a better person, I'm basically going to be forever fighting against the core of who I am as a human being.

I’ve accepted that life *iz what it iz*

I’ve accepted that I can’t always fix the shit show that is my life

But being socially connected with the people Ik irl is just so mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically painful and draining for me

I want to leave all my friends or at least stop engaging with them. Talking to them is draining. Keeping them updated on my life is draining (they often like to “spill the tea”). Being happy whenever I’m not is draining. Trying to get emotional help and sympathy from them is even more draining then just pretending to be happy, and sometimes even trying to keep them happy is just as draining. Sometimes I wish I could just run away to a secluded town and lead a new life all alone with little to no friends. If I even made any friends then this time I’d be sure to not have any “best friends”. But obviously for several different reasons I can’t just do that

Around this time last year I was having many dark thoughts but I never acted on them because I don’t like the idea of my friends and family possibly crying over me if it were to actually happen. I did do some things....but I stopped because the act of taking my own life is also just a really scary thought for me. I’m not exactly at that point again, but I really just want to get away from everything cause I feel like I might get that point again. I just want to stop being around people. I don’t want to hurt them, but idk how to get away from them without hurting them (like emotionally).

For some context, I actually tried ignoring my irl friends at the beginning of quarantine cause they said some things that really triggered me. I only started talking to them again whenever it was someone’s bday (also really draining) cause I still cared. At some point they got super mad at me cause I never FaceTimed them anymore and was always doing homework (this is actually kinda true). So I started talking to them more again but like, I can feel my soul being drained away again. Dealing with talking to people on top of my other personal problems feels horrible. 

But what do I do?

Tl;dr: Being social with friends and family (mainly friends) irl is mentally draining for me and I want to seclude myself from them without hurting them but idk how

114,"Hi, I'm 18F and currently a student at Vanderbilt University. It's a great school. It was perfect for me because it was prestigious and vibrant and I wanted the chance to go far from my hometown in the Northeast, and I do love it a lot. The only thing is, I've been having a lot of guilt about leaving my 75 year old grandmother, who essentially raised me from infancy to teenagerhood before she moved out, behind. She lives with my uncle and young cousin in Boston, about 30 minutes away from my hometown. I used to visit her all the time in high school because it was so easy, and it was really comforting for both of us. She's getting older and seems tired more often, and because she lived with us for so long, my parents don't like it when she stays for a while when she technically doesn't live with us anymore. Now with coronavirus they don't want her to come over for the holidays. I understand why, because she's not lonely or in a bad situation, and my parents deserve the chance to live alone, but it still makes me really upset, and it feels like I'll never get to see her now that I'm in college. 

I am so terrified that she'll get sick when I'm not on break and I won't get to say goodbye, or that I'm wasting the last good years with her being far away. I also worry that she's unhappy or not feeling well, and that she doesn't tell me because she wants me to live my life. I think the pandemic's really made me realize that she might not make it to my graduation, or my wedding, or my first kid like I always dreamed. I do love Vanderbilt and I can see myself being so happy here.  It just makes me so sad and I love my grandma so much, and I am really considering transferring so that I can be closer to her.

117,"So, here's the situation: I have a small family of 4.5 (wife, husband, two kids, and a cat). We are students right now, so Christmas is never really extravagant and we don't have the money to put into much for ourselves, much less family. Thankfully, we really only have two other relatives/families to worry about. Both families are pretty well off, much better than us anyway, so it can be hard to give gifts that feel appropriate for them.

The problem is, we would really like to go gift-less this year. No gifts coming from us, and no gifts coming to us. We aren't very rich and tend to live modestly, but there really aren't many extra things we need. Plenty of wants, sure, but we usually end up getting random items. We don't want more random clutter, so I don't want anyone to spend money on things we don't really want/need. But how do I say this without sounding like ""I don't want your junk."" Or without sounding like ""I don't care about you anymore, so let's just not do Christmas.""

I should also note, we also want to do this because it does get expensive since one of the families is very large (10 people), and we just can't do gifts for them each, so we usually do family gifts. But since we aren't as rich as them, it feels like gifting dollar store gifts to Bill Gates or something.

118,"I’m going into high school next year and I have the option of going to a public high school or continuing homeschool. My school life has been kind of complicated so far. Here is my schooling history:

Public School:
- Kindergarten 
- First Grade
- Second Grade
- Fifth Grade
- Sixth Grade

Homeschool:
- Third Grade
- Fourth Grade
- Seventh Grade
- Eighth Grade

I’m in a different state now so I wouldn’t be with the same people I was with in my last public school years. If I go to public school I want to go all four years. As far as learning goes I personally like homeschool better. I’m able to focus on extra curriculars more because I can be done with school in 4 hours. It’s very flexible and I learn just as much as I do in public school. My issue is I don’t know if I want to miss out on the “highschool experience.” It seems like a lot of people make a lot of great memories in highschool and I don’t know if I want to miss out on that.

She was a good friend to me growing up, and is still someone who I love very much, but Im losing her to her insane political beliefs and conspiracy theories.

It started when I was a toddler. My dad convinced her not to vaccinate me and she fell down the antivax rabbit hole. She wouldn't let me eat food dye, sugar, processed foods, etc. She thought they were toxic (Exp: food dye causes aggression issues). She then moved onto fad diets, like keto, raw food, etc, and forcing me to consume 12-20 vitamins per day. I didn't see a doctor until I was 12. 

In 2016 everything got worse. She became a die hard trump supporter and believed all the insane rumors, like that Mexican immigrants were forming an army to coupe the US, that if Hillary won everyone would be forcibly vaccinated against their will, etc. Nothing with any basis of truth. Now, it's gotten even worse. 

She is threatening to ""disappear"", sell all her assets and I don't know what then to avoid being put into ""concentration camps"" because she didn't want to be vaccinated. She refused to wear a mask due to ""long term health effects"" and is putting my dad, who has cancer, in extreme danger by being totally reckless. She also believes that now that biden has won, and I quote, ""there will be no home ownership, no boarders, no secular family (meaning the government will own your children from birth),. Mask mandates, more lockdowns, and forced vaccinations"". She also believes BLM is a ""marxist trained organization"". And that any extra money I make will go straight to biden and his administration. 

My dad also seems to be caught up in this, but not as severely. I'm genuinely worried for my mother and my father. If my parents ""disappear"" my dad won't be able to receive medical treatment. I do currently live with them as well, is there anything I can do? I'm terrified of losing them.

I’m a very calm person so I was more observant than emotional and I knew something was off with the way she was doing it so we talked for a while and I could tell it almost seemed as though she didn’t want to but had to. I eventually convinced her to stay for a while longer so that she could at least make a decision after we were together for a while. She seemed relieved yo hear that so of course that confirmed to me that something was off. A few months passed and I she was super emotional one day we were together so I asked her what was wrong and she told me that while I was gone in October that she was raped. This destroyed me mentally but I knew that it would be an insult to her and what happened if I let it myself become the focus and she begged me not to do anything so reluctantly I didn’t push who the person was because she refused to tell me (because anyone in my position would want to do exactly the same thing about it) and I knew it’s harmful to force a victim of that to report it if they don’t want to so I tried my best to just push it aside. I then found her a therapist and she steadily got better however I am under a mandatory reporting contract with my job so if I went to a therapist and talked about it, there’s a chance I could get in trouble for not reporting it or simply exposing something that she didn’t want exposed. After she was done with the therapy in August of this year she actually broke up with me. So now I was left in the dust with so much anger towards her, the rapist, and im stuck not being able to seek help out of fear that I’ll get screwed by the mandatory reporting issue or I’ll be diagnosed with mental illness and that will forever remain on my records. I have absolutely no idea what to do about this and it’s affected my life exponentially. Is there any way I can get help with absolutely 100% confidentiality? Or any other advice someone could offer me? 

Also I’m not suicidal because I’m way too angry to just lose like that. However I almost feel like every time I see a man I feel like “that’s the person who did it” and it’s destroyed me socially and I feel like I have anxiety and depression now.",10Nov2020,1

My issue is whether or not to reach out to these clients bc of similar background/ experiences with the knowledge of  things/ coping mechanisms that I have found helpful legitimately being that ive struggled with so many of the things they have. Would it be beneficial to reach out or let the ""rehab"" handle them? In my experience its a crooked business with a revolving door that seems to do the bare minimum if that.

128,"First of all, I'd like to say that my boyfriend hasn't made me feel this way. These feelings I have are just because I'm insecure and I've been hurt before. 

I feel very obligated to do exactly what my boyfriend wants me to do. He lives kinda far from me, so I usually feel obligated to sext with him (without pictures), even when I don't want to. I'll just push myself to do it because I don't want him to go get off to porn or with another girl. 

Again, he hasn't made me feel this way. I just have trust and abandonment issues. I've talked to him about it, and he says not to feel obligated. He tells me not to do stuff I don't want to do, but I still feel obligated. I'm a Christian and I hate knowingly sinning and repeating the same sin of lust so I cry after I do things with him. It just breaks my heart. 

I mean, no guy wants a girl who isn't down to do anything whenever he wants. So, I feel useless and I feel like a disappointment to him. I want him and I to just save it all for marriage, but I know asking him for that is foolish because he'll most likely just go jerk off to videos of women who are a billion fucking times better than me.

131,"Guys please advise me on what to do, please bear with me since I’m on my phone and I’m emotionally wrecked, and exhausted.

I’m 35 with two sisters, when I was young my dad owned a Chevrolet dealerships and he had an amazing child hood, around 15 years old my parents split, my dad turned to hard drugs and drinking and is still on a rolling binge for 15-20 years of alcohol and probably crack.

His father started those business and then left them to his son, to leave to me but when I was 20 or so he sold them, we didn’t talk about it he just did it and kept his binge rolling. He burned through his money fast and I’ve been giving him money for over a decade, I’ve been paying his bills and doctors appointments as his lifestyle has left him with severe copd and a dozen other ailments but he is in the end stages of life and we’re getting his will together and here’s where it gets sticky,

My dad is my main man no matter how bad he screwed me out of the business, I’ve always made sure he’s had food, electricity and health care and extra money, anything a drug addict will ask you for I’ve fallen for because I don’t want him going without anything. My dad still owns the property the business is on and it’s prime real estate, the current business pays 5600 dollars a month to him, that’s how much he wastes on drugs he makes 5600 a month just to party and still lives in squealer and begs me to pay and provide and I always have with food and medicine and I’ve literally done everything for the man he’s asked me to because our father son bond is insanely strong.

Now he’s making his will out to me to where I will get his 5600 a month and my two sisters won’t get anything but their third of the property if it’s ever sold, which It’s appraised in the millions, 

He wants to give me his standing in the llc and the money for taking care of him all my life and putting up with his shit. I can’t even tell you what’s he put me through from theft to identify theft and just everything a drug addict will do to hurt you or get money from you, I’ve bailed him out of jail more times than I can count and today I took him to the doctor and paid out of pocket for his visit, an ekg, blood work, lunch, and the attorney fees for the will and power of Attorney he wanted me to take over I’ve paid for it all, on a sub 20k a year salary!! My sisters have not kicked in anything except the occasional power bill. And he wants me to take the 5600 a month and just live my life to the fullest and split the property if it’s ever sold with them 3 ways.

One sister hasn’t seen him in decades and never came to the hospital when he was on ventilator machines twice a year for the last 3 years... my other sister moved way out west to live, and never visits or calls or even cares really, 

I feel like it’s my birth right to own the last little bit of it by owning the property, I don’t want them to feel like I robbed them, but I feel really entitled to the money, they both do very very well in the financial area, and have left me with him to deal with all on my own, I feel like I deserve it, like it’s mine and should be mine. Our mother feels the exact same way, but I still feel like it may be wrong? I don’t want to cheat my sisters out of any additional monthly income, but is it a dick move to keep it all if it’s willed to me and they all of a sudden what it? One of them said she was happy I was getting it but I still don’t know. It would change my life drastically and when I talked to my sisters about it they just say they’ll figure it out when he dies but when he does it’ll be left to me? If this is how my dad wants it should I even feel guilty by taking it?",10Nov2020,1

140,"Ever since I was little I struggled with school. I went to a small private school in 1-3 grades. 1-2 were amazing and have some of the best memories I ever made in them. In 3rd grade all of my male classmates who I had known for 2-3 years at that point started to bully me. I had a sub at that time because my teacher was pregnant. The school had tried to help me, but nothing worked. I was then forced to move across the country to a different state and was homeschooled which I failed at. After a year of living down there I moved close to my home state and did homeschooling again for 5th grade still being a pretty bad homeschooler. In 6th grade I got put into another small private school. It started off okay but I started to get bullied again and the teachers did nothing to help me. The school also ignored me when it came to classes, extracurricular activities, and my feelings. This lasted through 7th &amp; 8th grades too. At the end of 8th grade COVID hit and we had to go online which helped a bit. Now this year in 9th grade I am going to a completely cyber school and have discovered that with being at home I am getting distracted easily. I love the amount of opportunities I have here and how much stuff they have for being online. I also love the freedom but it is too much for me. Right now I am seeing about getting my classes changed to a learning style that fits me better. The thing I need advice on is what to do next for schooling. I have never found a format that works for me, and yes I know that every format will have its flaws. I would like some outside opinions on what I should do. I would love to be put back into an in person class but I do not want to start over and I never really fit in especially around where I live. I am a completely nerdy girl who loves anime, movies, books, video games, etc. Most of the girls around here are girly girls, even the jocks. I have interacted with many of the schools in my area and none of them I would like to be apart of. So what should I do? I am going to stick with online school for this school year so by the end of the year my feelings might change. I just want some more opinions on the matter and if you need anymore information I would be happy to provide it!

141,"I've (28F) started a research program at my school and there's a chance that I can move over to a PhD adding about an extra 2.5 years of study (so far I've done 1 year). I'm in a computer science field. 

I do like research but I know that after I graduate I won't want to work in my area of research. Also the lab I'm part of isn't the best, my supervisor knows the theory but hasn't ever coded so can't offer advice on statistics, coding, experiment design. Another PhD student quit 2 months ago, another research student is moving on to another better lab to do their PhD, a PhD graduate told me not to do a PhD in this lab and the only cureent PhD candidate has questionable methods i.e. skipping steps using random code that they don't write. Additionally, the lab includes other members on publications they had no part of which is not allowed. A lot of the PhD will be self taught as my supervisor can't offer much guidance.

I would be doing a PhD for the interest but it'll cost me the time I could have spent earning money and experience in the workforce. But I would enjoy the research and investigation processes along with developing my coding skills. And I'm not sure what I would want to do after I finish a PhD, I'd be happy in a civil servant job and save/invest and retire early.

I guess I'm torn between wanting a PhD and the ethics of the lab.",10Nov2020,1

144,"Earlier this year I was hospitalized with severe depression and made a pretty good recovery. While there were other factors involved, one factor that has been consistent with a drop in my mood is when I like someone. 

Things could be going absolutely great, I could be dating this person, I could be in love with them, things could be going meh, things could be going nowhere, or things could be horrible and yet seemingly no matter the situation, I begin showing depressive symptoms. This has been going on for years and I think it was a big factor with my severe depressive episode earlier this year. 

I have so many other things that should be bringing me to a depressive state of mind, yet I have been denying for too long that the reason seems to be romantic relationships. 

Just recently I thought a girl was interested in me and I held casual/flirty conversation with her. That same day I began feeling the way I was when I was at the beginning of the first stages of my last depression. 

I had began eating healthier, not abusing alcohol, and I was pretty contempt despite the many stressors that I am experiencing. 

As soon as that girl was in the picture (it was going pretty smooth and fine) things went downhill fast. I began watching videos on BestGore again that I thought I was never going to watch again, I stopped eating better, I had a fuck it attitude, I have drank alcohol 3 days straight and was so drunk yesterday I couldn't walk right, and my mood has been steadily declining. 

I realized she likely wasn't interested and just cut ties and I feel like I may already feel a tad bit better. 

Why am I so mentally incapable of having a relationship? I mean to be fair all of my past relationships ended bad. 

The first ""gf"" I had I didn't even have a phone and so over the summer nothing happened and I broke up with her. She called me nasty shit but she was also a but psycho (would sit in a dark room crying wondering if I actually like her... got out of there thankfully) but this was in middle school so whatever.

In middle school again I really liked a girl and always sat with her but she was older and not interested lol. That made me go a little weird and was around the same time I picked up the habit of watching really bad videos. 

Then I moved (military) and got a ""gf"" in 8th grade. She paid no attention to me and never brought forth a proper reason for liking me other than that I paid attention to her. (Another weird emo type deal I guess) She also lied to me about going to a dance or some shit and that hurt my little middle school heart haha. I know it's all insignificant but that really hurt since I really wanted to go with her. Broke that off in Freshmen year of HS after I realized she is just there and not doing anything. Forgot my birthday, never did anything for me, etc. 

Then in High School I dated another girl and we went too fast I think. We decided we were just better off as friends (I still talk to her today, she's cool and I like her as a friend) but what hurt a bit was when I called her to break up the first words out of her mouth were ""OH THANK GOD."" She right away said that's not what it sounded like but that it was just because she thought the same of me (as in just friends) but nevertheless that fucking hurt a little. 

Then in Junior year a girl and I were actually doing really good but never dated. She had abusive parents (idk why I seem to be attracted to those girls, I never know their situation but almost all so far have been not the best in terms of mental health) and never had time. She kept manipulating me with stupid Tik Tok challenges, leading me on and then dropping me, leading me on and then dropping me, so on and on. That REALLY messed with my head. Add on top high school stress, no sleep, some trauma from watching really fucked up stuff (and feeling emotions I did not want to feel when watching those things), feeling a bit left out of the whole High School thing, and varying family issues, I fell into that depression. I looked awful. I stopped talking to anyone and anything. Ate lunch by myself and separated myself from everyone I ever talked to. Lost crazy weight, no sleep, pale as a mf, barely nudging myself through the hallways, just wanting to sleep or die (I had non stop suicidal thoughts and it drove me insane). 

That puts us to now. Got out of that depressive cycle and felt like I was going back with that one girl. I right away was scared of the depression coming back from it, I was overthinking things, and I had overall shitty mood day and night. Not depressive and not 24/7 per se but it was slowly getting there again.

Why? Does anyone else have this? I have been in denial about this likely being the triggers to my depressive cycle because I feel so stupid that a likely non significant potential relationship shifts my mindset so bad. I have a million other things that could easily throw me into a depression for legitimate reasons but a girl? Why? It's embarrassing to have that be the reason and makes me feel like some softy child and that's why I think I am in denial about the whole thing. I don't understand it. Is there some underlying issue with this? Vulnerability? I don't get it. 

Any help, experiences, or comments would be really appreciated because I want to be able to function like a normal person. Knowing that relationships trigger my depression is not great because that feeds the thought cycle of being single and alone my entire life, which adds on top of other depressive thoughts.",10Nov2020,1

151,"so a little about myself, i am about to be 20 years old. my bf and i just got our first apartment a week ago. he is an electrician and makes great money and i am a nanny that makes okay money. well, here’s where the problem comes in. 

the family i nanny for has been driving me crazy.. from the second i got the job till now, 6 months later. the two kids are just absolute monsters. no discipline, no respect for anything/anyone, no manners, very violent, etc. just awful. long story short i want to quit like, now. but because of covid it’s hard to find jobs at the moment. i could find another nanny job, but that’s where another problem is. i’m just done dealing with families on that personal level. yes not all families are bad but from the couple of nannying gigs i’ve had those families just ruined it for me. i want to work at a daycare, which would be easy to get because i have all the qualifications, but there’s literally 0 hiring near me. and before people try to tell me well you’re still gonna have to deal with families, i’m aware but a daycare setting is way more professional and just completely different vs being in the family’s home. i’ve worked at a daycare before and it was just so much better than being a nanny imo. 

my bf definitely makes enough money to support me and him right now, plus my mother is kind enough to give me sort of an allowance (i help her out a lot) so we wouldn’t have to necessarily worry. but i’m worried in like.. a moral stance? even though my bf said he doesn’t mind, i still don’t want to put all responsibility on him basically. i want to be able to contribute. but staying at my current job is literally tearing me apart, and like i said i can’t really find any other work right now.

A has her first presentation soon, and when we had a work day together I thought her presentation idea sounded interesting. We are teachers, and she wanted to present on how sleep affects us and how to identify what we can do to work with our bodies. She was really nervous because it is her first presentation and a lot of us have been here a long time, so she didn’t want to do something that was overdone. I don’t think I said it was awesome, but I felt like I must have encouraged it because she got excited about it and was really into it.

I’m not good at presentations. No matter how hard I try I cannot nail one for the life of me, and a lot of my coworkers don’t even try in our meetings. My boss took me aside once to tell me my presentation didn’t have anything to do with anything (it was on disaster preparedness and how to protect ourselves - we are in a natural disaster prone country and no one pays attention and I think people should know what to expect or do).

Today B messaged me raging about how she wasn’t doing the proper presentation and how of course we know how to sleep, most of us have major problems or kids and don’t get sleep so listening to someone talk about sleep doesn’t have anything to do with work. I mentioned I didn’t realize it was just going to be about how to sleep more and I didn’t mean to encourage a bad presentation and she tore into me for encouraging it because I’ve been here for almost 6 years and should know better, and how everything A does reflects on B.

I want to offer real advice to A on how to choose a good presentation topic and offer my help gathering information, but the presentation is in two days. Should I apologize? I don’t know what to do. I didn’t try to sabotage her. 

The last presentation batches were on “how to read books”, like, I thought her topic idea was at least interesting and could be helpful in some ways. I understand that focusing on an area she needs to improve on was important, now. But I had another important conversation to have with her that day and I wasn’t there for that so it didn’t cross my mind.

Should I apologize or try to help somehow? Or just let it go?",10Nov2020,1
155,My right eye feels heavy and it’s irritating when I try to sleep because it feels like it’s pressing against my skull whenever I close my eyes.

They require we do so many tasks before a deadline and it is so much that it is insane. We can't do the things we need to because their system keeps crashing or constantly gives errors. This is new program and they have been rushing to cram as much info and work out of us as possible. One girl from our group quit, others are reasonably just as stressed and now I am starting to cry and become stressed because I can't do the assignments with my schedule. I have 3 hours after work to eat, clean and by the time I try to work on this it crashes and I have no time left.

One that can be sharpened and last her some time. She’s a home cook so I’m just looking for something that’s nice and affordable.

160,"I (17F) have had depression for a while, and anxiety since I was a kid. I'm diagnosed and medicated, but a big part of me staying stable is having stuff to do. Unfortunately... That's not an easy thing to do. I did an IOP program, which helped a ton, and since then I've been busy catching up on missed schoolwork. Today was my first day of not having enough to do, and it sucked so much. Like, bam, instantly suicidal? Grrr &gt;:(

I really like the concept of assignments. I don't like the topics of a lot of them, or the fact that the grade is going to define a lot of my future, but... I like that I don't have to do anything other than follow the guidelines, the criteria. I really like that it's preset. I also love to write essays, in particular, if it's something I'm excited about and there's a specific reason I'm writing it (i.e. to analyze a particular text, and answer a research question, etc.). And I like doing easy algebra, it's so... methodical. 

I don't do great with deadlines, I want to put that out there. They stress me out. But I also get the most work done when there are deadlines, usually early... I just need it to be low-stakes/low-pressure.

The thing is, if someone just told me to write an essay about whatever I wanted, I'd be stuck. Having too many options makes it impossible to start. I'm bad at motivating myself to do projects precisely for that reason: there's too many things for ME to figure out. I need something pre-set. 

How can I get something like this outside of school? How can I hold myself accountable to someone else? Who would that even be?

And some more specific questions: are there any apps for people like me, who struggle with this? Or websites where teachers dump their old assignments that I could possibly use as a reference, or something?",10Nov2020,1

162,"I'm in a new relationship and I am living with my boyfriend and his parents during lockdown. It's a bit of an eye-opener the amount of chores he leaves for his mum...? This might turn into a bit of a vent

For example he leaves his laundry in a pile right outside of her bedroom door each night. It's got to the point where I feel embarrassed about it so I pick it up in the morning and do it myself. He says he's never done his laundry (even when he was at uni a 2 hour drive away for 3 years he'd bring his laundry home) 

He's never cooked dinner for his parents, EVER. There was a bit of tension last night - he was playing the new FIFA with his friends and his mum had cooked dinner and called for us. I was doing uni work and headed out when I realised he might need a couple mins to finish up - he then said he'd be out shortly. 20 minutes later we'd all got about halfway through before he joined us. His parents were a bit annoyed and when he came out his mum reminded him that she's currently mourning and cooking dinner last night should be the last thing she's doing. Which caused him to get a bit upset and sniffly in the kitchen (audible to the living room where his parents were, I'm not sure if it was purposefully over done so they could hear and know he was upset!). 

I talked him through his feelings afterwards and reassuring him it's normal to feel this way sometimes as it's how you can reflect and grow as a person (giving some very recent examples where I've felt exactly the same). However.. it just seemed like he was seeking for me to say ""it's okay"" so that he gets reassured that what he did was fine. I completely understand that at our age we should be able to have the flexibility to join a bit later if we want to. But that doesn't sit right with me when his mum always does all the chores and cooking but gets rudely dismissed when she calls him for dinner, especially when he's so dependent on her cooking for him. 

I suggested that he could cook for them tomorrow, which in itself would be a big gesture for them. However he got frustrated and said he didn't know what to cook. I suggested just to think of any dinner recipe (even stuff his mum cooked last week) and it'd be perfect. 20 minutes later he came at me with fancy recipes that'd have cost around £10 to get ingredients for. I suggested to choose something cheaper but if he sends me the cash I'll pick up the ingredients whilst he's at work, but he then got a little upset and that gave me the impression he expected me to buy the ingredients. I'm also worried he expects me to cook it for him as I'm currently studying at home whilst he works until 3:30pm and gets home at 4:15pm. (32 hour week).

Anyway, there have been other small instances that were similar. I absolutely want to have this conversation with him in a warm and welcoming way so that he doesn't feel cornered or ridiculed in the slightest. However I'm struggling on how to have this conversation and not have it sound overly blunt :( I attempted amidst the upset last night by saying that change is scary, no matter how small the step may seem to others, and that we could start tomorrow with me showing him how to use the laundry machine. He agreed, but again I was met with his clothes outside his mum's door when I went to the loo at 1am. I want to put that down to it being habit for him, but it also makes me a bit sad that it doesn't seem he was genuine when saying he wanted to do his own laundry.

I'd imagine it might be an important to detail that he is roughly 10 years younger than his sisters (over 30) and his mum has always been a stay-at-home mum. Meaning that she has always done the chores and cleaning whilst he grew up.  

I definitely don't want to paint him in a bad light, there's so many details you can't fit into a Reddit post that could change how a person is perceived! I've tried my best above, but of course I can try to answer questions in the comments.",10Nov2020,1

And even then, neither of us knows where we want to live in the future yet.

166,"Hello, 

I'm 29 year old F and I am in a relationship with 28 M. We met in college around 2012 and started off as friends all through out my college years from 2012-early 2016 and then we started dating in July of 2016 after I graduated from college. The plan was to move to Cali to become a news reporter and bet famous but that didn't happen because I decided to fall in love. We had our ups and downs, not too major and probably only had a handful of arguments. I do have some concerns on commitment since we have been together for four years and there has been no talks about our future. And in this trying time a lot of couples are being very dependent on each other and I get that. 


Anyway, my boyfriend is really nice and helpful and he has helped out in many ways than one and I love him. 

Before a go on about what is happening now. I have just a little background on my life before him. I come from a single parent home my mom was born in Florida but raised in Los Angeles and left her life there to move to Cincinnati Ohio with my father who later left our family (I was born in Los Angeles and so she has always told me that that is my home)  when I was 11 years old and so my mom raised my brothers and I on her own with little to no help besides help from my grandparents and family friends. 


Since the divorce, I've been the family cow steering and helping everyone out. Trust me I didn't mind at the time but looking back I've never had my own life/identity outside of my family.  All of my college years were focused on driving my family everywhere in my moms car and never really having time to myself. I would complain to my ""friend"" now boyfriend  at the time that my family wants me to do this and that and I am too exhausted. 


During college I juggled unpaid internships while working part time in retail and then also being a full time student. But my mom needed the help and I would do anything for her because I love her. Even in college I went for Journalism for the hopes of being on TV and I believe that ""dream"" stems from needing attention after my father left the family and needing validation from strangers.  I never really cared about the art of journalism, just being on TV and that was so stupid and immature of me. I thought that if I got on TV I would be rich and help my family out financially and all would be well. Cringy, I know.


 Anyway, so when I started dating my boyfriend in 2016 after years of me rejecting him due to having my identity and goals linked to my family. For the first time in 2016, I gave love a chance. My boyfriend and his family is from Europe but they lived in Cincinnati for many years and so his family resides here. Right before Covid19 blew up , which was November of 2019, I decided to move out of my mom house for the first time. I was  28 at the time and fast forward to now, my boyfriend has been temporarily living with me at my apartment with is a mile away from his parents house.

 I don't consider us ""officially"" living together since most of his stuff is at his parents house and I think he is only living here so he can work from home in peace and spend time with me. So back to my mom....her brother bought my aging grandparents a house in California and now her parents are pressuring her to move in with them after covid or in the next year or so. 


Once I found out that news, I've been very depressed and crying everyday but I love my mom with all of my heart and having her move back to Cali is going to break me because I like having her around but I know that in her heart she wants to move back to Cali and have for year and here is her chance. 


I like Cali as well and would like to live there but I dont want be in crammed in a two bedroom house with my grandparents and mother. In the perfect world I wish I could provide for my mom and set her up with a place in California while I have have my own apartment there as well. California is beautiful and it would he nice to live there but I also love my boyfriend and don't want to leave him. I am conflicted now because the thought of me up and moving from my boyfriend breaks me heart and the thought of me seeing my mom fly off to Cali breaks my heart as well. 


My unrealistic second dream is to make money off of youtube so I can stay with my BF in OHIO and visit my mom in Cali (if she moves there whenever I want). Speaking of YouTube, that has been a dream of mine to have my own beauty channel and I  regret not working  on that after I graduated from college after my other dream did not work out. I think I liked YouTube more than college. Oh and another background  on my childhood. 


Before my father cheated on my mom and left the family for another woman, my dad would take me to acting classes so my mom has always said that I should have been an actress. Did she say that because she grew up in Cali and has put that pipedream career on me? Idk, I need advice, I am very depressed.  Since I was born in Los Angeles they always tell me that LA is my home not Ohio....I'm so sad and I need help, should I see a counselor? Is my childhood and my moms regrets affecting my own relationship and choices. Fyi: my mom is doing what's best for her parents, her dad is 81 and has stage for cancer and her mom needs hip replacement.",10Nov2020,1

169,"I'm in a relatively fortunate position where, in a couple years, I'll have my student loans paid off and be able to go down to half time in my current job and still make a very comfortable (though not wealthy, per se) living at about $80K. I would not have benefits, but would -- I think? -- have more than enough to save for retirement and pay for health insurance. I like my current job, but I can't say it's my passion. 

Alternatively, I could go back to school for a year and a half and then enter a helping/people-focused field and make around 60K (gradually going up, but likely never topping 80K) working full time. I know I would love this field and be passionate about how my work helps people.

173,"I'm currently a freelance video editor working for a moderate-sized YouTuber (900k subs and growing) and have an opportunity to work for a large channel (15m+ subs) as a full-time editor. I'll be leaving out the names of these channels for the sake of anonymity. 

The channel that I'm working with now helped me out of a dark place in my life by giving me something meaningful and fulfilling to work on rather than the monotonous grind of retail (no judgment if you enjoy retail though.) I started with him two years ago when he had 600k subs and watched with joy as our community grew to what it is today. He's in the process of becoming an LLC so he can hire me and his other editors as full-time workers rather than simply being freelance, meaning far less headache with self-employment taxes, but it won't be finalized for another few months.

The channel I have the chance to move to has a community and content that's drastically different than what I'm currently working in, but it shouldn't be a problem to adapt and adjust to it over time. I don't see much personal growth with this new channel due to the content being simplified and aimed at children, focusing on fast-moving gameplay cuts to keep their attention rather than the animation heavy content my current channel provides. The major benefit however would be the pay difference. Having 14m+ more subs than my current channel, I would be getting paid a good deal more than what I am now.

The way I see it, it's like an audio engineer with an up and coming band getting the chance to work with the Wiggles. On one hand, you have personally fulfilling work that you deeply enjoy making, but on the other is a potential for far more money.",10Nov2020,1

175,"I live in a condo with a shared parking lot area, in the desert, where it is extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold now, in the winter. When I first moved here in July, when it was over 100 degrees every day, my husband and I noticed that we could hear a dog barking from our neighbors patio at all hours of the day. This same dog would often escape and run rampant around the neighborhood with no collar, and eventually end up with me and my husband, or our other neighbors on the other side catching her and taking her home. We also live on a busy street so besides the obvious, we were also worried about the dog getting hit by a car. 

I am a huge animal person and have several rescues myself so this situation was literally impossible for me to ignore. Hearing the dog barking constantly really upset me and sent my anxiety through the roof. I called animal control twice and explained the situation but nothing changed. One night after I caught here running around at around 11 pm I decided to finally just ask my neighbor if I could just have the dog and she agreed. She paid for her spay and now the dog lives with me. The dog, Luna, cane with no leash, no collar, no toys, shitty food and was scared of the stairs for some reason and wasn’t housebroken at all, even though my neighbor told me she “had accidents occasionally.” We have had her for about a month now and are slowly starting to see improvements in her behavior. 

I was hoping that would be case closed but now SHE HAS STARTED LETTING ONE OF HER CATS OUT TOO. The cat comes straight to our house and cries outside the door, which makes my dogs go nuts. A couple of nights ago she was crying at the door at 1 AM and it was below freezing so I let her sleep in my bathroom. Every time she I’ve returned the cat to her she stresses that she’s “becoming an outdoor cat.” And insinuating that I shouldn’t keep returning her. I am not a very confrontational person and I really don’t want beef with my neighbor but I am fucking pissed off. 

My husband thinks I should just ignore the cat but I am literally incapable. My parents told me to catch her and give her away or take her to the local animal control but they are a kill shelter, and with all the fuss I’ve made over her so far, I know my neighbor would know exactly who took the cat. I am at my whits end and any advice is appreciated. Please be nice. ✌️

TLDR: My neighbor doesn’t care about her pets and let’s them run around in a dangerous area. They keep escaping and coming to my house. Animal control isn’t helping.",10Nov2020,1

When he’s clean things are awesome and I love this man with all my being. Tonight got really bad though! 

For the past few weeks he’s been acting different. He’s been hiding his phone from me, leaving late at night to go to the gas station and will be gone for hours, his attitude toward me has been absolutely appalling, I noticed money missing from my wallet he claims he didn’t take and pretty big withdrawals from our bank account that he has no answer for. Because of these actions I believe he’s been using again. 

About a week ago a bag full of clothes, a cell phone and other personal belongings showed up in my car after he had used it. When I asked who’s it was the story changed about 4 times before he was set on it being a random homeless guy that left it in there after he gave him a ride. Obviously this was far fetched seeing as how his story had changed so many times in a short period of time. Well long story short tonight I found out that it was the bag of his old drug friend who had left in a hurry because I was on my way home from work and knew I wouldn’t be happy with him in my home. After talking to this man I again asked my boyfriend who’s it was giving him the opportunity to tell me the truth and he stuck with his original story. So I packed a bag and tried to leave. HE LOST HIS SHIT! He yanked the keys out of my hand and wouldn’t give them back. He set them down and I picked them back up and tried to leave again only to have him grab me in a tight hug from behind and and then threw me to the ground still hugging me so tight I couldn’t move. I yelled for him to get off I couldn’t breath and he put his hand Over my mouth and told me and I quote “to shut the fuck up before the cops get called” then he continued to hold me down on the floor and told me “I’m doing this because I love you and you’ll regret leaving” when I told him I wanted out of the relationship he he screamed in my face “that he would die without me and that I was a dumb bitch” then got up grabbed his keys and mine and left.

I owned it because being drunk is not an excuse for it. She told me that she thinks that breaking up is the best thing to do. Many tears were shed. Then she would proceed the weekend not talking to me which is extremely abnormal of her. Today (Monday), I went to her in the morning and told her that I am sorry and that is something very out of character for me to do. I don’t think that I did what her friend claims I did. I talked to her at the end of the day again and asked her if I can talk to her in private during the week. She told me she is pretty busy. She asked what exactly I had to talk about. I told her I have spent time putting together substantial evidence that I did not do it and that her friend may not have been truthful. She told me she was frustrated and she saw holes in both sides of the stories. She told me she would be finishing her work for the night. I responded telling her I have someone that has known this friend for a long time and could see her lying because she was jealous of our relationship. I told her I just want a chance to show her that I didn’t do it. I plan to let her read that. Respond to it whenever she wants. But I plan to talk to her on Friday and ask her if I may present my evidence (seeing as she doesn’t ask me to present it sooner). What do I do.",10Nov2020,1

I’ll try to keep this short. I have recently gained an interest in politics that was kickstarted by COVID-19. Once the election came around I voted for Joe Biden. Once I got home my mom asked me who I voted for. I couldn’t say anything so she got extremely pissed correctly assuming who I voted for. She yelled horrible things to me along with my older sister until I isolated myself in my room. After about 5 hours have passed I felt it was ok for me to join the rest of my family again only for my dad to give me a look and tell my older brother who’s more far right than my parents that I voted for Biden. A whole new fight begins that was worse than before. I asked my mom very angrily why she would tell people and this upsets her even further than before. The fight gets to the point where I call her a bitch then she charges at me to choke me and I roughly push her away over and over cuz she kept coming back. Then my dad holds her back and yells at me for fighting with my mother and tells me to leave the house. I was kicked out temporarily at night with just my socks, jeans and a t shirt on in 40 degree weather and nothing else on me but my phone. They called me and told me to come back after about 4ish hours and I had no choice but to come back.

This is not the first racist ordeal that has happened. I know she’s gotten talks about them but idk about warnings. First ordeal was when she was new and literally asked a customer if they were so and so ethnicity, that she knows a few words of the language, is she speaking right, can he teach her, etc. He’s stunned of course and leaves. Ordeal number two is she once asked if a customer was a legal citizen...wtf. I don’t know if I should report this to higher up as she has already done this a few times now.

191,Me (16f) and my ex (m16) are best friends but pretty much since we started talking again after the break up (it was a good few months I was over him by them) we’ve had a sort of friends with benefits type situation. We didn’t have any romantic feelings left only sexual and we both ended up confessing it. It ended up starting this whole thing. I ended up getting a boyfriend for a bit but we broke up twice so it obviously didn’t work out. During those times he’d always be my shoulder to cry on or someone I’d go to for advice (but also just regular friend talks). After the final breakup we picked up where we left off but are still amazing friends. Since I’ve started going on campus for school again I’ve seen and talked to him a lot more. Before I came back to school I’d always had no trouble with not catching feelings. I think being with him in person again has made me start liking him again. We’ve talked once about if we’d ever get back together and he basically said no (idr what he said specifically). There was just a lot of factors that go into it and why we shouldn’t (I also told him I didn’t want to but at the time I didn’t). I wanna tell him how I feel but I don’t want to ruin what we have. And if we did somehow get back together I don’t want to break up again and not be able to be friends like we were before.

195,"In my adult life my mom has really disappointed me. She’s not a horrible person or anything, I do think she wants to be loving but I just don’t think she shows love the way I accept love. I need people to be reliable and, when I express myself, to acknowledge my feelings. That’s just not what my mom does. She isn’t reliable so several years ago I just kinda stopped asking for anything from her. In turn, she is hurt that I don’t allow her to be there for me. And I’m hurt that I see my friends who lean on their moms as best friends in adulthood and I don’t have that. And when I express feelings, my mom has always dismissed them or turned the conversation into something about her own feelings. All of this makes me feel very disconnected from her. Recently I was talking to my husband about how my mom is never there for me and he said well you never let her be. Maybe you need to give her the opportunity. That brings us to now. I just had a miscarriage last week. It’s still fresh and raw and I can’t shake this fog of sadness. I’ve told select friends who have been really sweet but it’s hard to feel supported through text alone. So I’m contemplating telling my mom. The problem is I just don’t think I can bare the disappointment if she doesn’t get this right. If she makes this about herself or isn’t supportive, I think it will just crush me. But the little girl inside me just wants my mom. I want comfort and warmth and just safety that only a mom can give.

I finally managed to get a job at a popular lotion/soap/candle store after doing at least 30 interviews since February, it was all good, then I got a SECOND job offer at a big-name hardware store. I took it out of impulse. So now I'm working two jobs on top of being a college student.  I've made a list of pros and cons for both jobs

Soap Store:

Pros

* All the employees are girls my age (i.e. I can finally make friends)
* Pay is higher than I'm used to ($14/hr)
* Environment is one I am comfortable in and love (Smaller boutique, unique people, mall)
* There's employee discount (I can't remember if there's any other benefits)

Cons

* They hardly schedule me (I am only working 9 hours this week)
* I was hired as seasonal, however, the manager already said they'd most likely keep me since I'm doing well

&amp;#x200B;

Hardware Store:

Pros

* Pay is the highest I've ever had ($15.25/hr)
* There are employee discounts and health benefits
* I get scheduled a lot
* Employees are older, but are generally nice to me

Cons

* I am not used to standing 9 hours on solid concrete and am now constantly sore
* Scheduling person ignored my preferences on shifts and I can't get a hold of him
* Not an environment I know
* Have yet to make friends there
* Scheduled for days when I am needed at soap store (I was hired at soap store because I had weekend availability, but the hardware store now keeps scheduling me on weekends)

203,"I am taking a Psychology class and was assigned an extended response question about how people learn prejudice. I used two examples that she says I ripped off from her:

-My example: A guy has a sizeable social media account and makes an offensive joke toward Asians. He receives backlash and is forced to make a public apology. Over the course of this, he loses a portion of his social media following.

-Her example that I “ripped off:” A guy is with his friends and says something that is discriminatory toward LGBT people. His friends do not like this comment and tell him.

Am I crazy, or is her calling this plaigiarism a reach? Here’s the other example:

-My example: A little years her mother ranting that older people cannot drive properly and should have their licenses taken away. Later, she hears on the news about an accident where an older person is at fault. This causes her to grow up with a prejudice toward old drivers.

-Her example that I “ripped off:” A teenage boy hears his father talking about how women are not as good as men and should stay in their assigned social norms. He hears other people talking like this, so he models their behavior.

He’s very loud and annoying, and he doesn’t seem to know what privacy means. Basically, he’s a snitch and wouldn’t even hesitate to reveal your secrets to others. He’s also one of those two sided kids, like he has one personality with adults and another one with his friends. Now, Henry’s parents, they’re mostly nice, but they’re really harsh. I mean, they just kind of say thing without thinking of the other persons feelings. They would make rude remarks about your appearance, like “oh, you got fatter” or something similar.

205,"I really need some help! Hopefully, someone may have some similar experience or advice.

Over the weekend my next-door neighbor woke me up to let me know someone sideswiped both of our cars that were parked in the street. The damage was pretty bad on the right side of our cars. We examined the crash area and found blue paint chips littered in between our two cars which were not from either of our cars.

The first thing I thought of was to check our Ring Doorbell Camera! Unfortunately, the camera does not capture motion from the street, but it does take a snapshot every ~10-20 seconds for its timeline. It showed that at 7:42 AM that there was no damage to the vehicles and at 7:42 and 20 seconds the cars were physically shifted and now damaged. We did not see a suspected car in the video... 

We canvassed the neighborhood for others that may have rings or cameras on the block, but to no avail. That was until my neighbor noticed our OTHER neighbor's car, a BLUE Toyota, parked in their driveway had severe damage to their front left bumper, consistent with the accident. We took pictures of his vehicle, took a sample of his paint that was chipping off of his vehicle and then rang his doorbell to confront him.

We were so sick, we had spoken to him earlier in the day and in retrospect, he was acting a bit nervous and had pretended to take a call to leave. Takeaways from our conversation -

1. He denied he hit our vehicles, though he seemed extremely nervous and shaky.
2. He indicated someone hit and ran HIS car just THE DAY PRIOR in a different town (Convenient isn't it)
3. I asked if he called the police he indicated he did although when asked if he filed a police report for that incident, he did he didn't.
3. I asked if he took any pictures of the damage to his vehicle prior to today.(Which would coaberate that the damage to his car happened prior to this morning). He said he did not take pictures of the damage to his car, but the police did. The officers that came when I filed the hit and run report said that is not something police would do, especially if there was no report filed.
4. I asked if he ever parks in the street, which may have explained why blue paint may have ended up in between the cars that were crashed into. He said he never parks in the street.

Let's be real here - HE DID IT, however without video recording and physically seeing it seems like an uphill battle, which the cops indicate. What we know/have -

- Photo of the damage to our cars with blue paint scrapped against our cars 
- Photo of the damage on the neighbor's car who hit and ran. Of course a blue vehicle and with white paint scrapped from my white car.
- Physical evidence collected - paint chips in between our cars. We have samples of both the hit-and-run vehicle's paint and the paint chips at the accident site. We put it under a microscope at x250 it is IDENTICAL, a unique shade of - ""Shoreline Blue Pearl"" paint applicable to Toyota models.

My neighbor and I who had our cars crashed into both have insurance, however, it is still $1,000 deductible for each of us which is tough as I was recently laid off. It also just really upsets me to just let him get away with it. We already began our insurance claim, no evidence submitted yet but indicated his insurance information license plate, etc. on our claim. The officers that responded did say he has a 'TLC' license plate so he uber, lifts or uses it as a taxi and will likely file a claim with them too.

Is there anything I can do to strengthen my case to the insurance company  so we are not stuck with the deductable or make it more difficult for the perpetrator to get away with this?",10Nov2020,1

Basically my problem is that I feel as if I’m not one of the boys or I’m not someone that people exactly want to be around. I used to just have fun and be funny and be able to be super fun to hang around I think. Then all of a sudden when I was in grade 11 I started smoking weed and vaping a lot and ended up hanging with the same group of friends pretty much every single day. This group of friends were I think real friends at first but as we went on our relationship became very dependant on weed and we would smoke it literally every time we hung out. This drained my bank as well as my energy for a lot of things and I guess I got extremely clouded by the weed and YouTube netflix lifestyle and didn’t really aspire to do much else. I played some sports and worked out but I didn’t really do much else for my social life. Didn’t hang with new people, didn’t try anything new just kind of did the same stuff that I always did, talked to people at school a lot but then after school I wouldn’t  try to make plans with them I would just smoke weed and watch YouTube and Netflix. I’ve now quit both weed and vaping and don’t have a desire to go back to either because I could tell how much motivation they would drain and how they would make me content with being bored. I realized this and wanted to stop but it’s been literally 3 years since I started this unhealthy lifestyle and I don’t really know if I’ve progressed in that time and I really think it’s too late to make new friends and create a lot of good memories. I see other people I know who never smoked and they have huge friend groups and love their lives and have so many memories and experiences with their friend group actually going out and doing things while I’ve just been smoking weed with the same friends or alone for a long time. 

Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and do it all over again because I definitely had the opportunity to have all these experiences I just feel as though I wasted my time and now I’m here to pick up the pieces. Also a side note I haven’t yet started post secondary because of grade 13 and then a gap year because of Covid but I’m planing to start this upcoming September 2021, I’m hoping to make a ton of friends there and get my own sober friend group but that’s uncertain and I’m worried it won’t improve and I’ll never find my friend group.

I know this doesn’t seem like a huge problem but it’s caused me to feel quite alone sometimes in the way I feel like I don’t have any real friends or connections with people.",10Nov2020,1

I am empty inside. 
I feel nothing good and everything bad.
Every moment that goes by feels like agony.
I just want the emotional suffering to end. 
I don't see any way I could overcome this feeling.
Not even $1,000,000 would cheer me up.
Not even all of the drugs and money in the world could make me feel better.
I see no reason to keep trying. 
If I stay here until I'm old, I'll be unhappy for life no matter what I accomplish.
No matter how good I do in life I'll feel like a loser and a failure and I'll never get back what's important to me 
I have no body on earth left to lose. 
I have no family.
I feel like I gave someone a piece of me that I can't get back and can't live without. 
I'm starting to think I would be better off,... You know.
There is not even a single aspect of my life I enjoy or like. 
There was only one aspect of my life I looked up to. 
Now there is nothing. My entire life feels like misery.
I can't drink or smoke the pain away and push-ups and video games and going for a walk and sleeping it off and watching videos and talking to other people isn't helping. 

I can't get the thought to go away that if I just stop existing all of this will be over and I will finally be free of this shit. 

How do I make the emptiness go away? How do I feel normal feelings again? 
I feel incredibly pathetic and selfish for saying all this because if you were to compare my life to that of someone in a third world country it would be like I was living the most lavish life in the world. So many people have it so bad in life that I feel like a piece of shit for even feeling the way that I feel inside. I feel bad for having feelings.

212,"So, I (24F) have a little sister (19F) we’ll call “L.” To give back story she’s not the most giving person in the world. You ask her to pick up food on her way home and you’ll Venmo her after and she’ll immediately turn it down. She’s breaking my moms heart because she lives at home but doesn’t help around the house, barely helps with rent, and is in her room the entire time. My mom has to clean up after her, my mom is sharing her car with her right now and she doesn’t help with gas or anything. My mom takes her to work and picks her up everyday. A few weeks ago she got into a car accident, this is why she doesn’t have a car at the moment. To top our issue off right now is that I’m having a baby very very soon and in a toxic living space (that I’ll be out of as soon as I get in touch with a landlord I’m trying to rent from) and my mom wanted me to move back until my son is like 4-6 months old so she can help me, also so I can help her because she’s having a hysterectomy and will be out of work and bed rest. L immediately threw a fit and said absolutely not a chance in hell, because she doesn’t want to hear crying. 

Anyways. I have a bombass credit score, it’s over 760. I’ve worked my ass off for it. A credit score like that isn’t easy to get. I’m trying to get a house within the next year so my son has a lot of room to grow. So I get a call at work, and she calls me (with attitude) asking if she can put me down on her car and so-sign. The nerve, am I right? I say I’m not comfortable with that because I don’t know how she is financially at all. I know she spends money like it’s nothing though and that’s a no for me. I don’t trust anyone enough to co-sign on anything let alone a damn car. “My credit score will go down because they’ll check it” “only by a few points!” And then she hangs up when I explain why I’m saying no.

Now she won’t talk to me. At all. And I’m sure this won’t change anytime soon.

Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for saying no? I work hard on my credit score, on my money, I have a deathly deathly fear of ever being in debt. If I have under $1,500 in my account I’m freaking out. If my credit score goes down at all I’m calling to see why and what I can do to change it. I have a future with a baby in it, I need to think about him.

I apologize in advance for how long this is but I tried my best to only put the stuff I thought was important.

PREFACE:

I (21M) began dating my best friend of a long time. I thought this might end up being a forever relationship just bc of how long we've been friends, and how perfect our chemistry is but unfortunately it did not last long.

The last couple months of the relationships ended up emotionally and socially killing me. It ended up being a postive feedback loop of me trying to hold all my horrible emotional shit inside to avoid her feeling bad for me, as she already had enough burdens. I felt more like an assignment rather than somebody whom she loved. This was my first relationship with somebody and it made me feel like I wasn't even worth a few minutes of her day.

I felt worthless for months. I held on to the relationship though, as I figured once winter break came along, we'd catch up on all the missed time.

After some time, she told me the distance killed her feelings for me and that she did not want to be in a relationship anymore. We ended it well. 

A month before the break-up I was very depressed and for the week after I was aswell.

I decided I needed a break from everything and deleted my social media. Everyone's numbers were blocked aswell.


THE ""BREAK"":

Right before my break, I told a close friend, Beta (F20), that I was taking some time away. Beta was a someone that, before my relationship with my ex, had feelings for me and whom I had feelings for aswell. We just did not know at that time so we never did anything about it. When I had originally gotten with my ex, one of my other close friends, Theta (M22), started liking Beta and they began to talk. 

Sunday:

A day after I took my break, I unblock and contact Beta and ask if she could talk. This was just as friends and it was because she had offered to talk if I needed someone to talk to.  I also enjoyed her company in general. Beta asked if, instead of talking, we could go to the park on Tuesday and talk about life in general. I thought this sounded really fun and agreed.

Tuesday:

Me and Beta went to the park to watch the sunset and talk. Afterwards, we cuddled up side by side and she put her head on my shoulder. We continued our talk.  I started catching feelings for her again.

Wednesday:

We talked over text and call and she told me that she had also decided to take her break a couple days after I took mine. Wednesday night, I told her i liked her. She did not say yes or no to my feelings but rather that she had actually liked me earlier too.

Thursday: 

We went to the beach. It started off normal but at night we held hands and she put her head in my lap and asked very personal questions (""Do you masturbate? Do you care about losing your virginity to somebody who isn't a virgin? What kind of porn do you watch? What turns you on?"" Etc.. I answered and asked her the same questions. We held hands on the way back to my car. At one point she asks if I think Theta's feelings for her were real and I say something like ""I'm biased ofc but I don't think so"". 

Friday:

We hang out all day. At one point she mad texts Theta saying his feelings for her aren't real. Theta gets very hurt. Beta says it's because of me she said what she said. I feel like shit. At night, Beta and Theta talk it out. During this talk, Beta says stuff like how can I be such a bad friend, I went after the girl of a friend I've been close with for 15 years etc. I did not know any of this until later. Beta later calls me and says she just wants to be friends. I agree and say its very weird for me and Theta to be after the same woman. I still feel really shitty and call Theta at night and tell him how Beta had only done what she did bc of me, and explained everything that had led up to me confessing to her and why I said what i said and how it led to her going off on him. 

Theta gets mad and goes off on Beta saying how could she spend all this time with me when shes avoided talking to him for a week. On top of that, all the hand holding and lap sitting. Beta gets mad at me and asks why I told him everything and how it was her story to tell him, not mine. 


AFTERMATH:

I apologize to Theta about going after the same girl he liked. He said he understands the situation I was in and why i said what i said. Beta starts her own version of stories saying that she was very uncomfortable the entire time and that I used her and that she had told me multiple times no and that I still went after her even then. I say it was a completely mutual thing and that we both fucked up by going after each other. She tells all her and my friends that I got mad that she rejected me and, as a result, went after her and Thetas relationship for revenge. Everyone thinks I'm a horrible person and the couple of people that know my side are asking if I am going to tell everybody or leave it at that.

I've already patched things up with Theta. There wasn't supposed to be ""sides"" to the story but now there are, as what she's saying is different than what I'm saying. Should I tell everyone she's told her side my side of the story or just move on and assume no ones gonna give a shit about what happened pretty soon? I really don't want to make this anymore messier than it already is.

I've already asked Beta if me and her can meet up and get our stories straight but she refused. What I did basically killed everything between Beta and me and her and Theta. I don't know what to do. Should I feel bad, should I forgive myself, can I forgive myself, why did I do what i did, am I really the only guilty person involved, will my other friends even listen to me? I really don't know.

I've been in my thoughts for a while now and feel really horrible, lonely, hurt, abandoned, tooken advantage of, and stupid. 
Is this situation as big as it seems in my head or is it really not that big of a deal and am I just in my feels?

Thank you to anyone who reads all this.

I look forward to any/all feedback available.",10Nov2020,1

220,"A few years ago my grandma had the basement of her house turned into an apartment with a separate entrance.  She has told me multiple times that she had this built with me in mind, because it's the basement of the house that was my dad's until he died about 16 years ago.  When my aunt and uncle decided to have their house remodeled they moved in for what was supposed to be 6 months but has turned into 2 years completely rent free.  They moved in right before I graduated college, planning to live in that apartment.  Since then I have rented 2 different places.  Their house was finally supposed to be done (it's been pushed back multiple times) in September, but work was stopped due to some bad decisions my uncle made with contractors.  They have been telling me it was almost ready and talking about painting it for me and such for MONTHS.  Now my lease is up in 2 weeks and I my grandma just told me that the house won't be done until December and they won't be out before my lease ends.  I lost my job due to Covid back in May. I don't even have this month's rent and have been planning on being rent free by December.  I truly do not have the money to sign on for another year of my $1,200 a month rent.  I really don't know what to do. If I renew my lease what happens if I break it later? Due to covid rules you can't be evicted, but what happens if the lease ends? Will I ever be able to rent anywhere if I don't pay my rent? I'm scared.  Is there a nice way to ask my aunt and uncle to move to an extended stay because my grandma wants them out and i'm weeks away from having no place to go?",10Nov2020,1

226,"I posted earlier bout issues with my brother acting verbally abusive and my mother disregarding my feelings, but I've realized on the deep end what's really going on. I feel super alone. But not alone in the sense where I have no one. I feel alone WITH them. Lately whenever I get upset, my mom says it must just be a medication issue and invalidates my feelings. And whenever I talk to her on the phone, she usually starts to bring up all the things I haven't done. Like how I don't have a boyfriend or didnt hire a maid (more on that in a sec cus i promise its not as prissy as it sounds). Like recently she keeps trying to push me to hire a maid to come clean my apartment. Even though I'm in college and I keep telling her and even showing her that I genuinely can keep my apartment clean on my own. And when I don't hire the maid she acts super upset and mad at me but doesnt even take the time to consider the fact that I genuinely have been doing just fine. Or a while ago, cus she was scared that I would fail a class, she pushed me to pay someone to take it for me. And even though I kept saying I didn't want that she wouldn't listen. So guess what, I gave in. What was the outcome? I got caught, and failed the class. Or a while ago on a zoom call with my college advisor her and my mother kept arguing about my classes and stuff each time we had a call, and nothing got done. So finally I put my foot down and said I made a prepared written statement addressing my concerns and stuff and told them both I wanted the space to genuinely say how I felt. And what was the outcome? We got everything done in that one meeting alone. Like this has been consistent, and it keeps me feeling like theres a glass cage around me where I'm watching things happen all around, and viewing chaos, but she doesnt seem to hear or validate that I'm affected. 
And also recently, my brother lost his hs buddy. And hes been going through a hard time. And I fully get that. We have a rule where he's allowed to stay at my apartment as long as he gives me a 24 hour warning so I can make sure it's clean and stuff. Recently he's been just showing up. And if I try to talk to him about it or act upset cus its so sudden, he says I'm selfish and cusses me out. And then he's said recently that I'm selfish and that I don't care about his feelings at all. If I didn't care I wouldn't be here typing this. But here's the thing, when we argue he has made threats to come and flip out on me and screamed at me. I keep trying to tell him to just stop reacting and to listen to me for a second and he won't stop. And he says that I wasn't there to support him when his friend passed away. A little context, the night he found out was the same night I had a friend over for a movie night. He came home and just seemed kinda sad so I asked if he was fine and he said yeah and that he was going to go to his room. So I tried to make sure he was okay, figured if he wanted maybe some tea I could make him some or something but then went back to my movie night. And later he came out and told us what had happened and I told him he could absolutely hang out with us and were there for him if he needs it. He seemed completely okay with that, even my friend said so. And so flash forward to a few weeks later I had planned to have a movie night with the same friend. And he came home 30 min before asking to watch tv, and I said yeah he could until she arrived cus we had it planned. And he then tried to get me to change my plans and invite myself to her place. I told him thats unfair and I'm not going to do that and he called me selfish again and flipped out. And to this day he thinks I was being unreasonable, and yesterday he suddenly twisted this on me and said that I was never there for him because I didn't send my friend home when he got back that night, and cared for him. When the next morning I gave him a huge hug and let him talk it all out, I even defended him aggressively when another friend invalidated him. But I can't be expected to change my plans for him completely. And I especially feel that its not right to turn that on me now when he never gave me an indication that he wanted that in the moment. 
Now flash even further forward, I talk to my mom today about all this and she defended him and said I was acting off the past few weeks. And I told her exactly why and she completely invalidated my feelings saying its prob a medication issue.


And then she said that my brother feels so alone rn because his friend kicked him out of the house and now he feels like cant stay with me. 

I've been repeatedly trying to make it obvious that I care and that I am here and that I am smart and kind and loving. And that I am selfless, not selfish. And she told me all this about him getting kicked out and used it as a some excuse for him acting this way towards me and acted as if I just somehow had known this. How could I have known that if no one even told me?

I understand he may feel alone cus he doesnt have many people around. But rn I also feel alone WITH these people sround because I feel like they don't hear me.",10Nov2020,1
227,I stepped on the scale for the first time since covid hit today and it was unable to register my weight and kept erroring out and going to 400lbs. My whole life I've been overweight besides a short 2 year period where I had a meth addiction and lost about 250 pounds. (The high and the rapid weight loss were very appealing to me until I lost a tooth for no reason .) But now it's as bad as ever I'm almost 29 years old I cannot remember the last time I was at a doctor bar an urgent care visit 2 months ago to get antibiotics for an abscessed tooth (don't fucking smoke meth kids) and now I'm fucking scared. I always thought to myself yeah I'm fat but I can still move and get around but it's to the point where I am out of breath going to the bathroom downstairs. Lately I have been panicking alot about death and coping with the fact that one day we all take the eternal sleep but I'm not ready for that I want to live a life that is more than just staring at a screen.

228,"I’m really well with babies so my cousin and I have always had a good bond since he was born. He likes getting his back rubbed so he’ll lay on me or sometimes I hold him. I don’t see anything wrong by this as I’m just comforting him but today when he layed beside me infront of my Tia she told him to get off of me. I could tell he obviously didn’t understand what he was doing wrong since there isn’t anything wrong about it. My heart cracked when she spanked him twice my eyes were burning since all I could do was watch her. She told me that he’s doing it in a sexual way or like he might have a crush cause he doesn’t do that with anyone else.

231,"Just a little bit of background info. My mom is super protective and doesn't want me to get side tracked with a relationship etc. Because I'm a student, I dont have a lot of money atm and so I still live at home with her which means I have to follow her rules.

So this girl and I made plans to have lunch at a restaurant near our university. Because of how my mom is, I had to ask for permission and keep her in the loop of things.

Long story short, we did everything I said we were going to do, let her know where I was, and we had a great time. However according to my mom, I was in trouble because of how long I stayed out (we hung out in the restaurant from 12-5pm).

I get home and she's obviously pissed so I ask her whats wrong and she's says this..... 1) I'm not allowed to date unless I get out of her house 2) I can't hang out at the girls house 3) she can make my life much harder and doesn't understand how I've turned out this way. She has calmed down somewhat but also said not to speak to her about the girl again.

Obviously I still have to live under her ""rules"" for now but the problem is that I really like the girl and want to hang out with her. 

How should I handle this situation? And how do I even go about bringing up wanting to go out again, lord forbid it's something more exciting than a restaurant?

232,"So about a week ago I (15M) was playing videogames in my room when I got up to go to the bathroom, while in there I saw my brother (10M) phone on the counter.

 He doesn't usually bring his phone to the bathroom, so I checked his app history and saw Youtube opened with a limp biscuit video open. 

I checked the volume and it was muted, and he had it paused on a picture of a girls breasts.

When I got out of the bathroom I asked him about it, here's how the conversation went.

Me ""Why was your phone in the bathroom""

Him ""Idk""

Me ""Tell the truth, I saw the video you had opened""

His face turned red ""I was listening to it"" 

Me ""muted?""

I could tell he was upset and finally got the truth, he'd been masturbating up to 4 times a day, every day, for the past year.

I talked to him about it and he said he'd stop, fast forward to yesterday and I walk into the bathroom and smell cum. 

I haven't said anything about it to him or our parents, because if the role was reversed I would be extremely uncomfortable and scared.

But I need to get him to stop because he's only 10 and he's doing it 4 times a day.

I'd be more ok with it if he were older, but this could become (or already is) an addiction before he's even a teen.",10Nov2020,1
233,"Hi there, Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a strange one for you today. I'm going to be somewhat vague on the details for anonymity sake, if you have questions I'll provide clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a somewhat remote place outside of the united states in a vacation destination (think Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, etc). I have a wife and a young (less than five years old) son. We've been isolating since the start of the pandemic and have chosen not to get the virus for a variety of reasons, since I work from home there's no reason for any exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the pandemic my wife and son were out and about in our town every day going to children events and socializing, now we're all trapped inside. The local population is completely fucking retarded and no one wears masks. I bought a nice big house that did a good job of giving us enough space, but this thing has really started to take a toll on everyone. My son's behavior regressed as soon as we stopped socializing and he started throwing tantrums (which continue). Despite our best efforts at virtual socialization, showing him videos with real kids, and trying to be that play-partner that he needs we just can't be enough for him. On top of this my wife is struggling as well, she confided in me that she's cried every day for the past two months. It's just too much, they're social butterflies and they are hurting.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, enter the weirdness. My wife's best friend has a son the exact same age as ours. She's had a rough past few years and is a single mother. Also, worth noting, this girl is absolutely stunning, she's so gorgeous that it hurts you to look at her. One of those people with a smile that makes you smile. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My wife wants her friend to quit her shitty job, take her son and move up here with us. Rather than just asking me to support them for a while (which I probably would) my wife wants to have this chick basically join our family as a second wife throughout at least the course of the pandemic. The reasoning for this is somewhat complex; the area we live in is notably distant from the rest of the US and there are few opportunities which would make it worth it for her to move here permanently outside of this scenario. She also doesn't want a roommate, we had a friend stay with us for a few months and it was uncomfortable and not something we want to do again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We'd move her up here with the expressed intent, give her a room and appropriate space, and if things ""clicked"" then she'd start sleeping in our bed. If they didn't click then she gets a nice long vacation in one of the most beautiful places in the world, a summer on the beach focusing on her art, and basically some time to recoup from life before returning. We'd pay to move her and would give her a bank account with enough money to make it easy for her to decide it isn't working and leave if she wanted to. We'd give her boy an equal life to our own and for as long as he's with us I'll raise him as I would my own, teach him how to hunt and fish, and provide a positive male roll model.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously the relationship wouldn't be transparent to the kids, but they'd get the opportunity to socialize and be each other's company for the rest of the pandemic. If it didn't work out then they'd see it as an extended vacation (which is basically how it'll be presented). I'd get crazy threesome sex with an enormously attractive woman. We'd get the company of a second wife and she'd get to experience all the wild shit we do \*with us\*; I've got an airplane and we have a pretty enjoyable life living on the beach.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of the obvious risk of ruining my marriage, what are your thoughts, Reddit? I understand this type of behavior has been somewhat normalized in today's society so maybe you won't think I'm as crazy as I feel. I don't think the marriage will be damaged, it was my wife's idea and she seems fairly transparent in her motives. The risk that she's a lesbian and will eventually replace me with her friend or try to kill me is also low in my opinion, it seems like she genuinely just wants to share her life with her friend. We'd be normal to the kids so there's really just a net-positive for both of them, although if it lasted past the pandemic there would eventually be questions. My wife would have extra help around the house and with the children's schooling (we're gonna home school through this thing). I'd get basically a second awesome wife and crazy threesome sex with two beautiful women. I'd have a fishing/hunting partner every day in the summer/fall and another person to show how awesome life can be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe still that she was my true compatible match but either the time wasn’t right or I messed it all up, I’m a pretty sensitive guy and very emotionally expressive which she was not. There’s a really high chance I’m just being dramatic as usual but my denial is so intense that I can’t accept that, and that’s my real problem I’d say.

I'm writing this late at night, so I might miss some things. Mb
I can elaborate if I haven't explained something fully enough

I am quite introverted, and pretty much spend my time on my computer, sometimes in calls with my close friends. I'm terrible at talking to people that I dont talk to on a daily basis, if that makes sense. My family is the opposite, having no trouble talking to strangers and such. As a vietnamese household, we (my parents) tend to socialize with other vietnamese people alot, in vietnamese.

I'm terrible with conversations already if I'm not talking about something I'm interested in, and I can't even speak vietnamese for more than 10 minutes (I start losing my words and start stuttering a bunch). I usually stay in my room when there are guests over, but I'm expected to socialize with them. What do I do?",10Nov2020,1

252,"Idk how to really start this but here I go
Recently I’ve been feeling extremely pathetic these past couple of weeks and the feeling just continues to grow. It started brewing in me since everyone around me is employed except for me. I recently applied and been interviewed for a store inside the mall but they have yet to call me back so it’s making me think that they aren’t gonna hire me. Besides that I know I can just apply someplace else especially since the holiday season is approaching but with the feeling of being pathetic it just makes me very unmotivated to do anything and I just feel like I’m stuck in a rut where all I do is just eat and sleep and feel unmotivated and uninterested in everything, besides food lol. But that’s not what really made me feel pathetic to the point where I write this. Last week my partner and I had planned a night out however I ruined things before they can start. In doing so I said things to my partner that I don’t mean and I regret but in the moment they were said. Instead of talking things out we ended up getting into separate cars and taking separate drives around the city we live in. After a couple hours of not talking she ends up FaceTime me and we end up meeting back at our place. I end up seeing what she did to herself after we reconciled and it still makes me feel more pathetic than just being denied employment. How can I call myself a good partner knowing that my other half needed me when she was feeling lost and numb. How could’ve I been so stupid and not listen to my partner and instead run from the problem when clearly she was hurting. Why didn’t I check up on her so she wouldn’t have hurt herself. I sit here and keep blaming myself because I feel like I’m supposed to make her happy and smile but instead I run from her. It makes me feel like I failed her as a partner and idk all I keep thinking is how much of a failure I am to her. I wish I could’ve done something different idk I just feel like a sorry excuse of a person where I can’t even do the one job that requires the most of my attention, being there for my partner. I would just like to say to her that I’m sorry that I haven’t been there for you and I’m sorry I failed you as a partner. Idk I just don’t know how else to feel knowing that your partner hurt themself and you just ran from it.",10Nov2020,1

254,"       So I have a friend who makes questionable decisions when it comes to choosing men to date. In the past she chose guys with good looks, somewhat aggressive and obsessive personalities, short tempers and a bit of being mean to her. In the beginning of these relationships things seem pretty much fine and run of the mill of new couple but then gradually things start to get worse. I've met one of them and seeing him tighten his grip on her arm ignoring her pleas of let go and you're scaring me. At another point this guy was going to take her in the woods and possibly rape her.  Sometimes I would have to meet up with her and drive her places because she felt like it wasn't safe. Eventually I helped her get away from him and we never heard from him again. She swore from there on to be more careful and look out for signs.The man she was married to is aloof and is somewhat of a jerk from what I heard on the phone.
        In addition to that each of them had major insecurity issues that they could not handle well. One of these guys tried the whole tough guy shtick with me on Facebook and ended up dumping her the next day. Another one literally had a camera in the place they were living at to monitor her behaviour. She is romantically interested in a new guy who might have the same personality quirks as the other boyfriends minus putting her on a pedestal and ""worshipping"" her. There's been a lot of UPS and Downs in their relationship and I'm genuinely concerned. I was given the chance to meet the guy in person but things didn't work out and I couldn't meet up with him Which greatly upseted her. Something about meeting up with and crashing at his place rubbed me the wrong way though. I don't want to sound like a paranoid jerk but she defends this guy fiercely after knowing him less than a year. She had also done this with the previous guy before he hurt her literally in front of me.
          Long story short, I don't know if she is potentially in trouble again. I want to warn and help her but I don't want her to think that I'm just nagging or I'm jealous because I have literally seen the track record. I will admit i have strong feelings for her but I don't think im her type... I am just really worried because I'm not there in person to bail her out if she gets into trouble. Did you ever just get that vibe off of somebody and you haven't even met them yet or you didn't like the concept of meeting them? If so what would you do?",10Nov2020,1

Knowing she is an adult, we place a few small rules as this is our home and we can? We tell her specifically to not hang out with people we deemed a bad influence. So one of the bad influences decided to text me asking me why we said that to her. I was honest that I thought of him as a bad influence from stories she and my boyfriend have told me. He threatened to kick me and my boyfriends asses. As well as calling me some colorful names. I took it in stride but he said she will continue to see him.

260,"So I have two friends who I love very much, or at least I did, I'm really struggling right now. We are all pretty young and will not have children for several years (in college) but recently they just told me they plan to beat their children when they have them. One of them said he would ""beat a 5 year old with a belt."" This is absolutely horrifying to me. If either of them actually do this I don't think I could ever speak to or love them again. I can't imagine wanting to hurt a defenseless child for your own ego (they said it was so their children would 'respect' and 'fear' them). They were both hit by their parents which is probably why they have this view, but scientific studies show physical abuse and punishment are harmful. My father and his brothers were also beaten by their father. My dad now watches ISIS videos on loop and killed our sick cat (I no longer speak to him and even though he never beat us because my mom basically threatened him I am extremely afraid of him and the thought that someone would want their child to feel that way makes me feel sick). His brother is also a pedophile who abused my dad. 

I literally don't know how to deal with this at all. Everytime I think about it I can't feel any love for my friends at all and have no respect for them. I love them so much when I'm not thinking about it and before this happened. I just can't let it go because it something I am not okay with at all and the thought that their future children might get hurt is so scary to me I can't even describe it. I don't know what to do. They both used the ""I got beat and I'm fine"" argument and still like their parents. I try to see it from their side but I just can't, especially because I know that both of them regularly lie to their parents and drink/smoke (one of them).

I'm just thinking about not giving a damn anymore and letting myself get fired so its an easier transition for me to find a job but i also don't like the idea of getting fired because I also have a sense of respect and just quitting instead of trying to get myself into ""trouble"". Idk

Tl:dr I put good energy into work in a job that i don't like. Should i purposefully get fired to transition to a different job easier? And how? 

And please ask questions about anything that might help you answer. Ill happily answer anything I left out detail due to me being tired as all hell tonight",10Nov2020,1
283,"tldr; music (and art in general) is what I live for but feel like I have no chance at it now

I write poetry, play music, and draw. Grew up playing the flute for 8 years. Now I play guitar, ukulele, and piano and have played technically since high school (not professionally/with lessons or anything). I'd say I'm equal levels OK at just about all of them-- I know enough to write for my music, even if it's nothing all that complicated. I'll soon be having a few poems published, and though that's not for money, I'm really proud that something I wrote will be out there. And I love to draw/paint but it's also not a huge focus, but still as skill I want to improve upon and utilize in whatever job I have. But music was always what I wanted to do, and since I was a kid I have sung in choir, had solos, that kind of thing. 

It seems really straight forward when it's clear music is what I cannot live without. But I feel like there's a lot of things that have gotten in the way of that, such as I was discouraged from pursuing the arts in general as I got older. I also endured a lot of trauma growing up well in to high school which not only kind of fucked my grades but also made it difficult to practice music consistently. So of course when I got to college I did not keep up with practicing instruments as much. My first two college years sucked and my mental health got worse before I transferred to a different college. Basically now I will be graduating with a major I finally don't hate and enjoy, but is still new/niche to the world and I'm already worried about jobs. The past my 3 years of college, I've been playing instruments pretty consistently. Luckily I love to sing, so at least I've got tons of songs out of it and am slowly beginning to record and self-publish. 

But I guess I'm just frustrated because I wish that I had never even gone to college and spent all that time and energy practicing music. I think there's a lot of things that have kind of fucked with me since I started college, but I digress lol. I feel as a musician, I would be 3x as better now. And my skills would finally match the tunes I have in my head for my music, and honestly nothing feels more shitty than being able to """"kind-of"""" make the music I want to make but simply not be good enough for the two to line up, if that makes sense. I don't want to be crazy famous, make a ton of money, don't care for clout. I just want to sing and create the stuff I want. Being 23 and soon to graduate without really a clue to figure out what kind of job would suit me best without it being related to the arts in general (not that this is a bad thing, but in these times it's not really in demand). I know it's unrealistic to drop everything and just be a musician 24/7, at least not with capitalism lol.

And I know this is really cliche, but sometimes I get really discouraged when I know there are 1000's of musicians who are better, more unique, more original, etc. And maybe this is a ridiculous concern because I don't want anything out of my music, but I do want it to be... enjoyable lol? And if I'm honestly not good and can't offer anything interesting or unique then I'd feel kind of shitty about it... But idk, y'all can be the judge of [my music](https://soundcloud.com/kingfisherdays) if you like lol

Maybe I'd feel a little better if I was in a band (maybe I'll consider it whenever COVID ends). Am I overreacting? Do a lot of artists feel this way? What are some good strategies to not think about all this and just make as much time for music as possible?",10Nov2020,1
284,"I'm one of those unfortunate covid grads that's been looking for a full time job for about 6/7 months now and I just never seem to get past that first interview with HR. 

I'm looking for a job as a front end or mobile developer and I have a very specific BS degree dedicated to this stuff. I have internships from 2 largish companies and projects from classes, hackathons and group orgs. I try my best to work on this skills now and learn new languages, tho it gets more and more difficult to motivate learning and working on projects with the pandemic. But despite this I almost never make it to the next round of interviews.

The first chat with the HR people always seems to go well, I do my research, ask questions, even get told I'm a good fit but rarely make it to even the second round to talk to someone on the tech team. What are people looking for when they're considering that first group of people and deciding who should move in?

for whatever reason, making a phone call gives me terrible anxiety. my heart starts to race, i start to sweat, my brain goes all foggy and usually i end up being so awkward on the phone or forget what i was even going to say. it could be any phone call... even just calling to book an appointment or to ask if a store has something in stock. 

it’s gotten to the point where i’m procrastinating on things i need to be doing (car appointment, doctors appointment) all because i don’t want to make the initial phone call. sometimes i even write out notes about what i want to say or a “script” for if i have to leave a message and i feel totally pathetic lol.",10Nov2020,1
286," If any graduate or undergraduate students can weigh in, I would appreciate it greatly.

 I will try to make this as short as possible.

So basically I am a community college student who will be finishing up this summer/fall (I will finish this summer but idk what semester would be best for me to apply... I will get into that later). Simply put I was a shit student in HS, I was never interested in class and always tried to find ways to make a class amusing (distract others) and I became the class ""clown"". I believe my gpa in hs was a 2.8. After graduating I went to my 4 year university, a popular school in my state (US). This is where after about 2 months I was suspended, all of my classes (4) were put down as W. I was given the option of coming back the next semester as long as I completed a program where I spoke to the dean every few weeks about how I was bettering myself. Eventually I was able to get the suspension completely cleared from my transcript. I completed the program and was told to reapply, but I learned that I can't reapply until I pay all of my student debt off (charged for full year even though I was there for 2 months... I am still paying today, will finish paying in a few months). So I ended up for the next semester going to another community college, not the one I am at now, and I took a few courses. For the next two semesters I was kinda in and out of it. I got an B+, C+ and an F, along with 2 W's (I am trying to fight this F, because I asked the professor prior to final being assigned to take the exam a day later because I was traveling. The class wouldn't meet again after final exam. A few days before the final I asked him again to confirm a time for when I come back, the class had 3 exams total, two of which I got a B+ for. He ended up never responding to me the second time or third or fourth or fifth. I knew if I didn't take the exam I would fail and he did fail me without ever responding back to me. I didn't know what to do in the moment and all faculty were on summer break... Fast forward to the Fall and I try again at school, and ended up withdrawing from those classes as well (I was honestly going though a lot of personal stuff). So far you can say my school career is a complete shit show. My GPA at that community college was 1.86. Spring 2020 I realized how much I already fucked up and I knew I had very very little chance of going anywhere in life. So I decided to attend a different community college where I could get financial aid again. This is where I really got my shit together, cut out all distractions, friends, late nights, It has just been school and work. Since my time here (spring, summer, fall) I have maintained a 4.0. I am the president of a successful club, in an honors society, I tutor students part time, I also work two other jobs (full time at pharmacy and part time admin assistant). I retook the SAT and scored a 1530. I am the secretary in my student government. And I will be applying for scholarships and awards through my honors society. I am also involved with 2 other clubs on campus (not an officer).

\*I apologize for typing so much, I just didn't want to leave anything out.

I am considering staying another semester, instead of graduating this summer, I would wait till spring. This would give me the chance to beef up my activities and involvement. Given that time I know I can become president of both my schools student government and honors society as well as achieve some awards and even maybe give the graduation commencement speech (I have really strong relation with faculty here). With 9 withdraws total I feel like I am in the complete shitter in terms of others students placement. For the essays I plan on hiring someone to help me, you can probably tell by now my grammar isn't the best. The more I think about how much I fucked up in the past the more depressed I get. Its something I can never change but at the same time it is something that needed to happen for me to get where I am today. So to finally ask, I would like to know what you think my chances of getting into a target or Ivy school are. I think if I can tell my story in a true, whole and compelling way I think I have a slim shot. What do you guys think? And any advice would be helpful..

I know 2 semesters and a summer won't change the past. Just understand guys that I am leaving out personal details and giving you guys just the facts. I was going through some stuff that I had to work through.",10Nov2020,1

I try to be positive when they put themself down, but Im kind of growing irritable about the entire situation because it’s making me anxious to not know if what I say to them is going to be taken as an insult.

Important and keeps you feeling sexy about each other. I’ve talked to her about this multiple times and she always tells me she just doesn’t really have a sex drive anymore and doesn’t feel good about herself. Well 1) she watches porn regularly so how doesn’t she have a sex drive? And 2) I’m always offering to bring her to the gym with me. I go everyday and everyday she says no thanks. There’s not much more I can do. I try to remind her all the time she’s good looking to me and try to support her in everything. After about a year of dating we just stopped having sex regularly. For the first year we had it like 2-3 times a week. But now it’s nothing. I’ve never cheated on her and I never would.

292,"Please help me decide if my job is worth it or a bad deal, as I am meeting my new manager tomorrow and may just resign.

Background: I moved to a new city this year with my s/o for their job (MD). We live in a large building with about 400 other units. Our rent is approx. $1700/month. I am full time student with 100% online classes (even before covid).

The ""job"" is for the property management company, which I was recommended for by our leasing agent. 

The quotes are because I am not technically an employee of any kind. I work every other week for a rent discount around $700. This sounded like a good deal since I'm home all the time anyway, and it allows me to contribute towards the monthly expenses, as my student loans really only cover my classes.

What is the ""job""?

Good question. My initial understanding was that I'm here to help out my neighbors when the maintenance and office staff goes home at 5p and on weekends. I'll list out the actual responsibilities:

**Emergency on-call:** from 5p to 10a during the week, and 24hrs Saturday and Sunday, I am on call. Residents call an after-hours number that connects to me. Mostly I get noise complaints, clogged sinks, and broken air-conditioner calls. I have had to deal with a few actual emergencies as well including a fire that meant evacuating the whole building. I could go a whole night with 1 or 2 calls, or my phone could ring all weekend long. 

**Garbage:** This is the biggest part of the job. Every night I have to collect garbage from the common areas, including the offices, bathrooms, gym, pool area, and clubhouse. I have developed huge respect for waste management workers (and disrespect for the general population)! This building has one trash compactor for all 400 units, and it is my job to monitor it constantly as people leave their trash next to it, or it gets jammed up and people pile up their trash which I then have to clear. If I don't check on it for a few hours I could come back to a massive pile of nasty trash. I also have to change out bags on the dog-poop stations weekly, which amounts to a LOT of dog poop!

**Pool:** On the weekends I have to clean and open the pool, this involves skimming it and vacuuming the bottom, testing and adjusting the chemicals, etc.. before 9 am. I also have to periodically check the pool and make sure there aren't people that don't live here aren't using it (due to covid). In the evenings I have to kick everyone out and lock up.

**Grounds:** I have to walk the grounds and hallways twice daily to pick up garbage and look for violations. The building is 4 floors, and the property is similar in size to a large grocery store (looking at google maps for reference). This involves taking a bucket and grabber around the parking lots to pick up debris and dog poop. I also lock up and activate the security system each night.

**Notices:** Once a week I get a stack of notices for people who didn't pay their bills, and have to put it on their doors. Once or twice a month they have me put flyers for various things like events or promotions on every door. This may sound trivial but is one of the most tedious things to do 400 times at midnight. I have to do this right after I post this! 

There's a few other things but that pretty much covers it. I could add more details but this is already way longer than I meant, and I'm curious about your thoughts with just the perspective of my general situation and the duties of the job. Every company has its issues/drama/less than great employees, so I won't factor that in.

If you read this far THANK YOU! I'll be back in a few hours after I distribute these flyers.",10Nov2020,1

296,"Okay so, obligatory long explanation post.

Jeremy and I dated for a year on off again and it was not the healthiest relationship now that I think about it.

We have the same group of friends, some left and others came, so they did not know that Jeremy and I dated unless looking at his Instagram photos. We all had hung out as a group and Jeremy and I had decided to try being cordial, and work our way to being friends to not make things feel fake or weird in the friend group. However, it was really me putting in the effort while Jeremy didn't do anything to try. It made me upset because I did not want to waste my time. 

There was also some thing going on with my now former best friend Harriet and him. I could tell there was, but they claimed there wasn't and because I kept seeing things that show there was something happening, they eventually became upset with me and Harriet said she would be distancing from the entire group because of ""misunderstandings"". The only people who knew was myself and our friend George. I later found Harriet and Jeremy again together, even though she told both George and I she stopped talking to everyone in the group. Jeremy told one of our friends he did not want to be friends anymore because I was crazy and kept saying lies about him and Harriet. I cut both Harriet and Jeremy off, but still saw him at friend events.

For awhile I did believe and felt guilty and many people in our friend group sided with Jeremy that I was just the crazy ex, because they only saw me being angry and emotional and he was chill. 

One of my friends, Fiona, who let it slip that Harriet and Jeremy were dating because Jeremy told her. Jeremy was telling Fiona everything between him and Harriet (while, unbeknownst to Fiona that I know, that Jeremy was also attempting to flirt with her from another friend) and she kept telling him to tell me because that was my best friend. After they became official, Fiona said to Jeremy that he either tells me about him and Harriet or she would. She ended up telling me.

Now the entire group knows and pretty much all distanced from Jeremy, who still continues to lie about him and Harriet and calls me crazy. Now the group wants to confront him, for the following reasons;

1. Our friend group is getting smaller because some are leaving and they still want to be friends with both me and Jeremy.
2. They feel jeremy should apologize to me for his mistreatment, calling me crazy and problematic and for lying about what was going on between him and my best friend. 
3. They feel Jeremy should apologize to the entire group for the gaslighting and manipulation
4. They believe that maybe if this confrontation happen, Jeremy will try to fix himself.

I honestly don't know what to do. We can't force him to talk, but because he still talks to some friend groups and wants the drama to be over, he is willing to talk it out. How do we go about this?",10Nov2020,1

306,"I have worked for my dads company for 16 years. I've been the manager for 7 years. 3 years ago, I found out I was pregnant and told him I would be leaving the business within 5 years. 2 years ago, he started a 2nd business and outsourced the office work to the 1st company, effectively making me the manager of both. Shortly after that, I started training my replacement. He had reservations about her replacing me, but at this point, I didn't care and I did it anyway. Everything was on track for me to leave, and he knew that was the plan regardless of his feelings about my replacement. In case it's relevant, he felt that she would be in a position to use the knowledge to start a competitor company because of a personal relationship of hers, I trusted that she had no malicious intentions.

My replacement unexpectedly got pregnant, took maternity leave, and upon her return I intended to stay a couple months, then be available once a week for support and additional training, and gradually reduce that. Well, her baby had some health concerns and she didn't come back after leave.

At this point, due to the job stress as well as personal stress, I had a complete mental meltdown. I was having 3-4 panic attacks daily, I was taking hours of unpaid breaks to deal with that, wiping my face down, and doing it again. I got treatment, and reduced my schedule to something manageable.

The past couple of weeks, it's getting bad again. I woke up this morning, realized I have to go to work, and almost vomited from stress and anxiety just thinking about it.

Now, I respect my dad for doing the best he can, but honestly, he's an idiot. He doesn't run the business well, he wastes a ridiculous amount of time and money on unnecessary shit that's supposedly going to improve efficiency, then gets annoyed when it doesn't work immediately and scraps it to move on to the next thing. He puts a massively excessive amount of procedures in place that are counter productive. It just feels like almost everything he does makes my job 10x more difficult.

And I could leave regardless if not for my mom, who has no part in any of this, because if I leave, the company will go under.

Shes says she and her family are scared of her getting on a plane with the ammount of people that don't care about masks and her getting the virus and potentially giving it to her mom or grandma. Both are some what at risk people. She also says the way Texas has handled the corna isn't too good either. 

I understand her point of view. The issue is part of me feels like she isn't trying hard enough? Like I've suggested multiple ways for her and I to see each other. For example her comming down for a little bit of time and then I go back up and quarantine with her for a little while. Or other ideas for us to see each other. My parents have even offered to pay for her plane tickets. So its not like I'm trying to just put it all on her. Im trying to take some of the responsibility and initiative here too. I guess I feel like if she really wanted to come see me she would be trying harder for her mom to let her go. 

The issue is like I said her mom and grandma are at risk. And her family might not let her come back home for a while if she came down. Her mom feels that its silly to risk getting sick just for my girlfriend and I to see each other. I understand her perspective. I don't know maybe I'm just being dumb. I also have a different perspective on Corona since both my grandparents and my sister got it and have ended up ok. And my grandparents are very at risk people. So part of me feels like her mom is blowing things out of the water. I'm not trying to say Corona isn't bad or deadly. But when you see everyone around you living life as normal and you're the only one that can't do the normal things it kind of gets on my nerves. Like do what you can to prevent the spread but you can't let it rule your life. Like I said I'm probably just being dumb and selfish. I just I don't know what to do.",10Nov2020,1
311,"Hi. I’ll make my story as short as possible.
I am 19 years old and up until now my life included a 3.5 years of boycott in school and a self abusive father my mom divorced from and as a result I was also abused by him (don’t worry, only emotional stuff).
I treated myself like crap through the years. I never cut myself but I tried hard, I brought myself down for years and I got into therapy in 5th grade.
I never got to finish a therapy process because of financial difficulties. But luckily I still managed to love myself through some tough stuff and now I am happy to say that I have friends that are like family to me and I have a very loving girlfriend who supports me even if its very tough.

Now for the thing I need advice about:
I recently entered a program in my country that lets you volunteer for a year while moving out of your parents house to a different city with people who also chose this program.

I am living with 20 and we were all sorted into teams. Each with a different “mission” (or volunteer work simply). One of the girls in my team doesn’t like me. Which I am ok with but she acts very negatively to me and every time we talk i end up getting hurt. My girlfriend always tells me i need to do something even though i tried to talk to her and make things good between us twice and got ignored twice.

What should i do? How do i stand up for myself and how do i explain to my girlfriend she doesn’t need to go out of her way just so i won’t get overwhelmed?",10Nov2020,1

314,"So recently, there has been a trend in my country where you call out your sexual assaulters. It would be a positive movement if their were no attention seeking girls posting. 

So there was this girl he rejected who had a crush on him for years before that.My friend recently sent me her instagram story, she accused him of raping her. I have spent everyday for the past 3 years with my friend and I doubt he would do anything like this. A lot of people are saying I stop being friends with a sexual assaulter and I think this might ruin his life and damage mine a bit for being his friend.

Since her ex, all of the guys she’s seen are guys from my social media accounts. She’s also constantly posting selfies everyday now, dresses super provocatively etc (not that i have a problem with it; just a stark contrast from the down to earth girl she used to be). She’s also become really really selfish??? I am doing my finals this year while she still has one year to spare, and she’s been constantly calling me out to go drinking n getting upset when i say no, calling me the night before my exams to talk about her petty boy problems??? It just makes me think she doesn’t give a fuck. My boyfriend has also said he feels like she is always trying to one up me, because she would constantly post pictures that i said i wanted deleted because i wasnt ready, or post pictures that she obviously looks 10x better than me in. I didn’t really see it either until my boyfriend mentioned it. she’s also constantly talking crap about my boyfriend and complains to our other friends that i spend all my time with him instead of her, which is definitely not the case because i always makes sure to allocate my time well. Generally, i’ve grown to hate her personality. She’s one of those who act like she has depression when she really doesn’t and even tried to “take her own life” last year,,,,, whilst sending us selfies from the hospital,,,,,,, What????????????

317,"I (21F) am feeling isolated because of my brother. He makes it difficult for me and my siblings to live in my parents house. Hes obnoxious, he screams at my parents. Purposely causes loud sounds. He fancies himself to be a boxer. He made this stupid thing which is apparently meant to teach him head movement. But he's going to end up injured. He doesnt have a trainer either. So he doesnt actually know what hes doing. The only reason he wanted to start doing this is because his colleague is a amateur mma fighter. The house we live in is so old, when if you jump or drop something the whole house can hear it and feel it. My dads a pensioner and he said these noises do something to his heart. Yet my brother still ""practices"" his boxing. Also my parents dont tell him off ever (which is the main reason why I feel isolated) when i complain, apparently I'm jealous. I'm so sick of him and I cant stand that my parents are only nice to him because he's a boy. If me and my sisters do something for them - they want to give him the credit. 

So anyway, my main problem is the above and how unhygienic he is. He leaves the bathroom in such a disgusting way. I dont eat properly because I know I dont want to go to the bathroom. My mental and physical health was already bad now its even worse. My little sister purposely moved out so she didnt have to speak to my brother. Shes the only one out of the three of us that still speaks to him. The reason she doesnt like him, is because he tries to make her feel like crap about everything. He tried to do the same thing to me. But now that I've stopped speaking to him. He cant do that anymore. He ruined my life in so many ways and as I was trying to get it fixed he would make fun of me. My parents would do nothing when I would tell them to say something- because if I said something to him then instantly I was causing trouble.

My best friend (20F) knew about it, but last week she fooled around with him anyway. She told me and apologised about it, she said that I had every right to be mad at her and that she felt really bad about it. Truth is I would never let something like that come between our friendship, and I expected it to happen, because I know she is very impulsive when it comes to such stuff, and I had figured that the crush was into her. The problem is that it kinda shattered my self esteem. It seems like everyone I am interested in, prefers her.

322,"So a little backstory on this, I recently started university, and a couple of days after orientation I started crushing on this guy from my batch. He's really cute although he's very hard to talk to. Nevertheless, I managed to make friends with him, three weeks into talking I tell him that I like him, I never really get a straight answer, and looking back on it now, I started to grow desperate I suppose, messaging instantly even though he'd take whole days to reply, I talked to my best friend about this and she said that the way he was acting towards me after I told him that I liked him was emotional abuse. I'm not sure if that was the case, but he did certainly manage to make me feel extremely bad for joking around with him. He kept popping in and out after my confession, I do not exactly know why, but him doing that only made me want him more.

So two weeks ago, my exams started, I had an extremely demanding workload and on top of that I had my sister's wedding to organize and see to, it was a week-long event, right in the middle of my exams. It was extremely stressful and left me feeling drained, surprisingly, however, last weekend, he(my crush) started talking actively to me again, replying on time, keeping up the flow of the conversation and all, and then on Sunday night, we made a spontaneous plan to meet for breakfast the next day. Coincidentally my sister's wedding was also the same day, and because of that, I slept at 4 in the night. After that my alarm failed to wake me up and I ended up waking up at 9:30, I had an online class to attend that I absolutely could not miss, so it took me an hour to take that. I informed him, apologizing that I might run late and that we will go out when I reach university. He, however, did not like that. He gaslighted me in a couple of messages and then ghosted me, not even replying to my messages or refusing to talk when I eventually reached university. Granted it was my fault, but we never even decided a time and we could still go, but he kept being obstinate until I eventually gave up. In the evening I pull him aside to try and apologize and see if I can make it up to him, and he was very impassive and didn't care for what I had to say, I gave up eventually and headed home, feeling like absolute shit. I couldn't sleep last night, because I whiffed my one chance that I landed after yearning for it so long, and it is still actively making me sad as I type this out. I know it is my fault, but I would like to know how can I make it up to him? I don't like making people angry or hurting because of me, and I always go out of my way to do good, but I slipped up this time and got punished for it. Any tips on how can I go about this make-up thing?  I thought of getting him a breakfast that he likes alongside an apology note, which I will tomorrow, but that seems a bit superficial.

324,"We need some advice. I feel like we’ve been reasonable throughout this entire saga and we have no idea how to handle these two girls anymore. I’m floored that any of this is even an issue.

**The context:**

Three other girls and I got an apartment in our college town, as we're all friends and have lived together before. An agreement was made before moving in between the other 3 girls that we wouldn’t have kickbacks anymore (which was fine with me, although I was not part of the actual conversation). Our University ended up being fully online this year. One roommate stayed in her home state and we found a subleaser (under the table) who is not a student at our school. State directives mandate that gatherings of any size between people who do not live together are not permitted. Our University made it clear that any students living within the county lines of the school caught not adhering to state directives are subject to suspension or expulsion.

**The Cast:**

OG-A (In agreement with me)

OG-B (subleasing, also in agreement)

OG-C (does not agree with us)

Subleaser (does not agree with us)

Me

OGA and I asked OGC and Subleaser if we could limit the number of people that come over to our apartment during the school year, due to COVID risks and Academic risks (we initially asked to uphold state directives fully by not having anyone over). They were not happy with this, as they’d been having get-togethers of 8-10 people all summer while we were at home with our families and did not want to change that. We then asked if we could limit it to a couple of people over at a time to minimize risk of COVID and noise complaints that could then get us in trouble with our University. They were not happy with this either.

**The conversation:**

*OGC and Subleaser:*

1). We have more than two friends

2). It’s not fair for you to ask us to change how we’ve been living while you were gone this summer. We shouldn’t have to flip our lives around.

3). If you’re worried, you shouldn’t come back to the apartment this semester.

4). Nobody else is taking it seriously, you two are in the minority. Bars are open and the freshman will be moving into town and partying.

5). It’s highly unlikely we’d ever get a noise complaint

6). The University probably won’t suspend or expel anybody

7). There’s no difference between going out to see our friends, having 2 people over at a time, or 10 people over at a time

8). We accept the risk of getting COVID or suspended (only OGC goes to our university, not Subleaser)

9). We pay rent here

10). We’d be fine with limiting parties to weekends.

*Me and OGA*

1). You can still see your friends whenever you want, in whatever quantity you want, just outside of the apartment

2). Living together requires compromise. We’ve compromised twice now while you have not compromised at all.

3). We should be able to live in the apartment we pay the majority rent for without worrying if we’re going to get COVID or expelled. (Long story, but I’m near the end of a several year process to change majors, so this could also affect major transfer even if they don’t expel anyone).

4). “Everybody else” isn’t living in our apartment and our position is supported by state directives, our university, and our landlord, even if your friends don’t agree. And we even bent the directives a bit for your benefit.

5). We’re not willing to risk everything we’ve worked for because “it’s unlikely we’ll get caught”

6). Again, it’s not your risk to take for us.

7). There’s a big difference between having two people in a small space and 10 people in a small space. Harder to socially distance, the higher chance of infection, the higher chance of noise complaint.

8). We don’t accept the risk of getting COVID or suspension, and that does not make us any less entitled to the space we pay for.

9). We pay rent here, too, and have already compromised.

10). (Didn’t say this aloud though) limiting parties to weekends should be the bare minimum standard of roommate courtesy even if COVID never existed.

At the onset of this conversation, the Subleaser said that she felt unwanted by us because she has more than two friends to invite over. But in the same breath of conversation, told us we shouldn’t come back to the apartment? Talk about unwanted. OGA and I compromised again and conceded to them having whoever they want on the patio. Which was a terrible compromise because that just exacerbates the chance that we’d get caught hosting gatherings, which completely ignores any academic consequences. The patio is also right outside my sliding doors, so there’s the expectation that weekends will be loud while I’m sleeping. It actually wasn’t a compromise at all, now that I think about it. OGC texted the group chat to say “I think we made a good compromise. We see things differently and that’s not going to change.” And then something about COVID sucking in general and hating conflict. It shouldn’t have been a conflict to begin with though if they had been willing to compromise on some level.

OGA and I both felt like we were run out of our apartment. Neither of us has returned since September, with the exception of 1-2 weeks for OGA and 1 night for me. The one night that I was there, the Subleaser turned up to the apartment loudly at 1:40 AM with two dudes I don’t know who sounded drunk. They were super loud. Granted it was a Friday, but I feel 1:40 AM is an unreasonable time to be loud even on a Friday. She went to bed very shortly after getting back and left them with free range of our apartment. I asked them to keep it down, they did for about 30 seconds before they went back to loudly talking and cooking in our kitchen. It was 3 AM before they started to die down. I pay majority rent, have funded a significant portion of their party pad, left them to do whatever they want with no interruption from me, and the one night I told them I’d be there, the Subleaser couldn’t be courteous? When OGA one was staying at the apartment for that 1-2 week period, I got quite a few snapchats around 11 PM (and sometimes later) of her trying to sleep during the week with the downstairs TV playing loudly in the background - her room is on the second floor, way too loud for a TV.

**The Electric bill:**

They’ve used an exorbitant amount of energy. One month, for just the two of them, the bill was $190 AFTER a $90 COVID discount. The electric company let us know that our unit usage was too high, too consistently and that we’d be bumped into a higher paying bracket if it didn’t stop. OGA let’s the other two girls know. They don’t care and say they’re happy to pay the higher fees. The Subleaser was supposed to leave in January, so why do they find it reasonable to move into a higher paying bracket, when that will only affect the rest of us for the remainder of the year and not the Subleaser? When the four of us living together last year, our bill was never higher than $17 a person on a bad month. If I had $5 for every time OGA or I found the kitchen light on in the limited time we stayed there, it feels like I’d have enough to pay a month’s rent.

**The Water bill:**

The water bill is apportioned through the entire building, so our unit gets charged for 4 occupants, no matter what. OGA and I started paying towards the water bill in September, despite the fact we weren’t there so the other two girls wouldn’t have to pay for four people. OGC then texts us this month saying we should be paying into the water bill since it’s not fair for them to pay for four people — which we’d already been doing? And to be honest, they asked us not to come back so it feels fiscally abusive to ask us not to return this semester, even though we’re still paying more than half the rent, and then tell us it’s not fair we’re not paying for water we don’t even have the opportunity to use. Us paying for water was a kindness, in our opinion.

**The noise complaint:**

OGC received a noise complaint. We got an email from our landlord and our unit has been placed on a no-warnings list with our local police department. Our university confers with the local PD daily to see who is in violation of state directives. Next noise violation, we’ll be written up, receive a hefty fine, and who knows how the university will react. I was not there for this so I likely won’t be affected, but I’m including it because this is the exact situation I wanted to avoid and the exact reason OGA and I never returned to the apartment. OGC posted about the situation on Twitter not seeming to understand that she was in the wrong, blaming the local PD for being unreasonable and implying that, because bars are in operation, tenants should be able to have gatherings? Still no self-awareness.

**The lease transfer:**

The original plan was for the Subleaser to leave by January, and then OGA, OGB, and I would all return for the spring semester with OGC, despite school continuing to be online. OGC texts the three of us a few weeks ago asking us if we want to transfer our lease over to her, the Subleaser, and another friend of hers since she “feels badly” that we’re paying rent while we’re not there. Interesting because she didn’t seem to care in September that we’d be paying rent when she told us not to return. Seems more like she saw this as an opportunity to live with people who also like to party for the rest of the year - but that’s speculation on my part so take that claim with a grain of salt. We agreed to transfer the lease. The lease transfer fee is $500. We assumed that we’d be splitting that fee 6 ways. Between OGA, OGB, myself, and the 3 new tenants. OGC says “I’m sorry but that fee is not our responsibility since you guys are the ones who want to change the lease.” I feel so beyond taken advantage of by this girl. She has not considered us once throughout this entire process. We’re changing the lease because we’ve been paying every month for her and her friends to do whatever they want. Her friends want to take over our leases. So why are we stuck holding the bag, *again*? We’re afraid of rocking the boat because we don’t want OGC to make the lease transfer difficult. Also, with her being the only one of the lease-holders who is currently at the apartment, we have no way to control any damage that is or isn’t done to the unit between now and the walkthrough with our landlord. Our parents are incredibly upset by the situation and are ready to reach out to the other girls’ parents because we can’t imagine they’re aware of their daughters’ positions in this situation.

We don’t know what to do. OGC is our friend and was, at one point, one of OGA's best friends. We are in a very small major, so we'll have to continue to see each other. We're just at a total loss and all of this came out of a left field. How do we get her to understand that her actions have been self-centered? Is there a way to save our relationship with her?

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this mammoth post. Any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR our roommates do not want to cooperate with state directives, want to continue having large gatherings in our space, and wanted me and our other roommate to stay away if we didn't approve (which we have the last 5 months), while still paying rent. She also does not want the new tenants (her friends) to help cover the lease transfer fee, despite them suggesting the lease transfer. Overall, she and the subleaser have been inconsiderate and we want advice on how to proceed.",10Nov2020,1

328,"     Hi there! I'm not up to date with how to post on Reddit, so please forgive me if it's wonky.

     For some background info, my brother (13)M and I (18)F, have started playing videogames together again recently. We've had our fights and hospital visits but since we've gotten older we've grown extremely close. Our divorced parents consist of an unmedicated bipolar mother and a recovering alcoholic, narcissist father; Both have neglected us quite a bit over the years. Lots of emotional trauma and whatnot. Currently, he's living with my mom because he feels the need to protect her and I'm with my dad to build a better relationship.

     Anywho, tonight I was in a party with my brother and his friends. I usually don't engage with them unless they ask me a question or my brother is trying to get my attention. My brother got off to go to bed and I stayed on to finish my game. His friends started asking me questions like why my brother was so feminine, if he's a transgender, acted as if he didn't have a father figure and said he looked like a girl. Although I got frustrated with them bashing him as soon as he got off, I simply told them that he lives with his mom and got off. The boys normally hit on me, call my brother annoying, and ask why he is simping for me. I can ignore them but what they said about my brother tonight struck a chord. 
     
     I'm planning to tell my brother I'm only going to be in a party with him because his friends irritate the shit out of me. I have a lot of fun playing and cherish the time I have with him. I don't know if I should say anything to him about what his friends say behind his back. I didn't expect them to flip on him like they did especially because he's wickedly good at playing and doesn't lower to their level. 

     So, what should I do? Tell him about what his friends said or leave it be? Thank you for reading!  :)",10Nov2020,1
329,"So I am kind of driving myself crazy. Let me give some context about myself. I am 17, a senior in high school, a school which is private and small. I’m short, fairly skinny, and I don’t consider myself to be very attractive. But, most notably, I am ridiculously terrible at social interaction. My friends have even noted how awkward I seem the few times I do talk to someone. I don’t go out of my way to talk to people, because I assume they will immediately dislike me because of my personality or appearance. No one really talks to me either. I am naturally quiet around groups of people, but I am just unable to make friends and be a normal person. I can’t seem to just do what everyone else does and interact with people. I am borderline scared to be in public around other people I don’t know. Whether this is because I am extremely self conscious about every aspect of myself, or I am actually just not meant to make friends and talk to people, or some combination, I constantly feel like shit about it. I mean, I’m a senior in high school, and I’ve never been to a party. And while part of me is terrified of that idea (because it means other people are there) I still feel like I’m missing out on something. A part of me really feels like I need to be doing this.

335,"Getting kicked out because if family issues. Whether my parents will go through with it or not is something i don't want to leave on the table till the last moment.

21m, 18k savings, own my totally paid car, live in a poor third world country.

I'm looking at holes in the wall that start at 150USD, and some shared accommodations on luxury places at 280-320USD

I just started a job and am getting paid 300USD (i am due for a raise in two months).

Also some very old looking places at an intermediate 230 USD, i really just want to have a kitchen separated from the bedroom and a washing machine, while also having a hospitable place to work from home.

My expenses range from Netflix (10.99USD), Spotify (8.99USD), a yearly mag subscription (20USD) and a hefty unlimited phone bill (50USD), so i go over the red very fast on such a meager salary but it would be very comfy and i would be able to stay afloat for a very long time till i get a better job or the much needed raise.

What do though? Pick the hole in the wall place (my sofa bed won't even fit in most of them) or go for the comfy place? (furnished for better or worst, what would i do about my sofa, bed, tv and desks i own?)",10Nov2020,1
336,"I'm a 20years old guy.
The most average guy you could think of. 
I'm very lost when it comes to knowing who I am.
I've spent my entire life without a goal, doing things to please other people.
What I have noticed in my limited 20 years old of life, is that pretty much everyone has a ""thing"" going for them. It's either sports, studies, looks, or even a hobby. Something that they like doing, something that they do for themselves. I have always found that concept fascinating, like how can someone enjoy doing something ? Some go even as far as making their hobby as their career choice.
 I have wasted most of my ""growing"" years, and  am still wasting it on video games, but I do so because it's the closest thing I can feel to being passionate about something, even though at this point it's just pure addiction.
Don't get me wrong, it's not like I am an anti-social shut in, I'm in college, I have a part time job, I get average marks, good enough to get me through the next year.
What I lack in my life is the drive, I do everything just because I have to, I don't recall being passionate about something in my life. I day-dream about having a hobby, something that may seem normal to you, is something I would pay anything to have. Just something, I have tried many things, from music to politics to pretty much anything, but I still can't be passionate and have the drive to go in depth.
Once I get the basic understanding I just give up and don't commit.
I would like any type of advice, or even opinion on my situation, no need to hold back.
Thanks for reading, and excuse my english.

TL;DR : I'm an average guy who doesn't have passion about anthing in life, I lack drive and commitment. I don't know who I am and what to do.",10Nov2020,1

He even looked for me if I went to see my friends or get something. He didn’t even hang out with his. He did little things like tie my shoe which was cute. I really thought he was into me. At the end of the night though he started whispering to his friends and tried touching me and told me I could move his hand wherever. I asked if that’s all he wanted and I wasn’t going to let him touch me. He said he didn’t know what I wanted and his friends were giving him advice and wasn’t trying to pressure me. He told me he gets really no girls and is new to this but I don’t believe it he. After all he was good looking. Then afterwards he tried a bit again but then he stopped and we just cuddled for a bit and he told me to text me after. He actually texted me saying sorry he had a great night. I asked him what he wanted and he said idk I’m new to this stuff. He is a super dry texter though. He asked if I want to still hangout like I said earlier and I agreed it would be fun if we did. The next day I ask again and he says idk I suck at planning. I told him if he didn’t want to then just say no and he once again said idk. I told him I was confusing so he told me I was to and didn’t know what I wanted. Then I said I was just trying to get to know him and he said he didn’t want to go past my comfort zone. I asked once again if he was just trying to use me or actually into me because I asked before and he told me he would definitely tell me if that’s all he wanted and it wasn’t and he said he has never been so nervous ever. So I asked does that mean your into me and he said idk. Then I told him he was really confusing me and then the topic ended but me being petty I told him you know I feel like you weren’t actually into me and don’t want to hurt my feelings I’ll leave you alone now and all he said was you do you. I got no idea what he actually wanted still. Also I know I asked him to many questions and I’m worried I scared him away but I don’t want to worry about a guy that could have been using me.

Last week we had sex for the first time even though I wasn’t really ready.

He knows we don't get along well, but he doesn't know that she kicks, bites, punches, suffocates, strangles, and crushes me when he's not home. I am sooooo tempted to tell a teacher or the counselor since they *will* reach out to the authorities. However, my dad is completely innocent. He doesn't know whats going on and would never even dream of abusing me. It's my mother that's the problem. I *need* to get her out of my life or I *will* kill myself.

I need to get my mother out of my life, but I *can't* get my father out of my life without losing the only things that are keeping me sane (also he's innocent).

346,"
I first started talking to this guy with aspergers in the middle of 2018. He asked me out, but I said I wasn't ready for a relationship so I stopped talking to him. For the next 6 months, he proceeded to call me once a month every month (6 times total) despite me never picking up.

Finally, after 6 months, I answered his calls because I felt bad about it and we started talking. In these next four months (end of 2018/beginning of 2019) we talked every night up until 4 am. I started developing feelings strong feelings for him, and him for me, but I wasn't ready for a relationship (due to many personal issues which I won't discuss). So after these four months, I told him I couldn't speak to him anymore and he left it at that.

About a month later he got another girlfriend. I noticed that for the next several months (till August 2019) he kept tabs on all of my social media (i.e. watching all my instagram stories and even liking my first ever post on instagram). Around this time, he sent me another message and we started talking again. He kept asking me out, despite having a girlfriend.

It's now the end of 2020, and he is still waiting for me to go out with him. We did agree to be friends, and only act as friends, because he had a girlfriend. But to this day he insists that we go out.

This persistence though, has been something my friends have attributed to as some sort of obsession with me. What do you guys think, do you think he's actually in love with me, or is it something else? Is this normal aspergers behaviour?

tl;dr: guy has pursued me for 2.5 years and is still waiting",10Nov2020,1

I sited resources and all. I also informed them of how I got covid at the beginning of this academic year... I planned on putting in some of my medical records as well.

351,"Hey guys, I'm 18 and I'm about 6 days away from moving into a new apartment. This was a decision I made last month due to the fact my parents argue every other week and there's a constant threat of my dad leaving. My father is a piece of shit and has extreme jealously and trust issues. He wants control over what everyone does. Not only that but my father likes to play the inocent one anytime he accuses my mom of whatever his fucked up head comes up with. He talks about how godly he is when I know for a damn fact he's not. He cuts off my mother's insurance, refuses to help with the younger siblings, and take off with no information as to where he's going. With that said I was getting sick of this and have told my mother countless times to leave him but she never does. So I knew she was never going to leave even if this all did continue and I got an apartment. Now fast forward to six day before I have to move in and now my father says he's leaving and never coming back. He called his boss in front of my mother and said he was putting his two weeks in. This means there's no income to support living in the house hold and my mother plus two younger sisters have to move out. The problem with this is that fact that my mother barely makes any money. She works at a barber shop and only makes a couple hundred a week if she's lucky. Not only that but she's planning on going back to college to finish her nursing as well. So getting an apartment or housing unit would be way to expensive to handle on her own. Anyways I still have the opportunity to back out of the apartment (losing the money I invested into it) and help my mother with her financial struggle. That or I continue forward with what I have because I did warn her to leave him for a long period of time and that I would help her. And with whatever extra money I manage to make give to her.

354,"So last year I reported this kid for bullying because he was being racist (I'm biracial) and annoying to me (stealing my stationary, getting me in trouble for weird things) and because I couldn't be bothered to actual confront him I just told the school anonymously and he got a detention. 

But after that, he somehow found out it was me and now he holds this weird grudge against me, and particularly me? (mind you, three other kids reported him for similar situations and he was known to be an unenthusiastic and a bit of a bully, so it wasn't like I ruined his track record at our school). So this year, he decides to just up the ante and he's now pretty much trying everything he can do just so he can piss me off. He's done everything from stealing (and damaging) my uniform (e.g. pouring water and stomping on my school hat) and work for assignments/speeches to literally harassing my grandmother on social media (I reported him for it but he keeps on saying that I'm being too dramatic and that I'm the mean person). He also is constantly asking me for my grades in subjects and whenever I do better than him he just throws a fit and starts cussing at me(?)

I live with my parents and I'm prepare for the said professional course exam.My parents have always been extremely supportive and understanding of my studying but lately since they've both retired they usually work or just talk or gossip all day. My parents are extremely loud and my mother teaches music online as well and our place is a small flat with 2 rooms and voices are very distinct even if I turn the AC on or try to tune out the noise. Due to this I usually have to come out of my room and tell them to talk softly but they won't listen. Yesterday I overheard them talking about sending me to our other flat since they are irritated with me and can't stand being near me any longer. I asked them why can't they stay there and they said that they want to be able to do whatever they want in their house.
I have never lived alone, always had deeply sheltered upbringing never cooked or cleant or washed my clothes. Suddenly after being so close they want space. I am asthmatic and usually face a lot of allergies and wheezing and hence I don't like the thought of being alone with no help. Also, I'm already going through a rough time managing college and other exams and go through bouts of feeling extremely sad and crying.
So I have two options either I stay with parents and don't get any studying done hence I fail my exams and disturb my parents or I move out and spent the day alone with my thoughts which I feel will prevent me from being productive but I will get something done and it'll be what my parents want.

It's important to note that I'm financially dependent on them due to the culture that prevails in my country of parents being deeply involved and also due to the fact that I have zero time or qualification for getting a job or anything without my degree.

361,"During times like this, I don’t even know what I was thinking. I feel terrible even getting to the point. I want to apologize to everyone out there with high risk families too, because of people like me, covid is getting worse.

Yesterday, on the way home from school, my mom told me my grandma was exposed to covid, which makes us all exposed. I took it very lightly. I’ll admit, I’m stubborn and selfish at times. So I just acknowledged it. My dumb teen brain thought “well I really wanna see my boyfriend tonight, so I’m gonna go anyway. I saw him yesterday. Guess he’s already exposed. I’m barely near my family.” So I went. I knew his friends were gonna be there, but I didn’t know which ones. Apparently one of them was very high risk with a high risk family, but I only found that out hours later. Midway through us hanging out, I began to feel guilty and told my boyfriend that I was exposed. My mom told me not to tell anyone, but I just had to. He said it was unavoidable because he saw me yesterday, wasn’t really upset.

Truthfully, I wouldn’t have felt guilty up until this point. Me and my boyfriend were walking, (friend up ahead) and he seemed off, so I asked him what’s wrong. After some pushing, he told me that his friend and his dad were both very high risk. I didn’t know this. The reality of this situation came down on me and I had a panic attack, right in front of his friend too. Full on sobbing in some random driveway in a ball. Couldn’t breathe. Guilt just came rushing. His friend obviously being concerned asked what was up, but we told him once we got back to my boyfriends house. 

He told me the truth I needed to hear. He told me that there was no excuse for what I did, and that I shouldn’t sob about it and play the victim. There was nothing we could do about it now, so I should just apologize and move on. I accepted what he said and went home worrying about it, but I woke up just now (middle of the night) to read a long message about how this is something serious and that I handled the situation horribly. I’ve been in a terrible mental state lately and I’ve never done something so bad. I’m just at a loss of what to do. I’ve made my apologies and my grandma and mom are getting tested today.

364,"Hello redditors  
A little background to mt current situation. I am constantly job hunting currently and have applied to many jobs through Linkedin. Last week I came across this email:  
[https://imgur.com/gallery/ArFpUSJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ArFpUSJ)

Here is the rest of the email:  
[https://imgur.com/gallery/d6azhIo](https://imgur.com/gallery/d6azhIo)

Now I realize that many of you think that this is suspicious off the bat, I had no clue. Call me dumb I'll take it, but I thought getting a credit report for a interview wasn't too suspicious. In fact, to be honest, I really didn't know what credit reports were for.

Continuing on, this where is where the link took me:  
[https://imgur.com/gallery/aUOjhpV](https://imgur.com/gallery/aUOjhpV)

It took me to some identity security company called Identityiq and after a little research, I felt like the company was legit. Again, the site seemed completely fine and so I proceeded and made an account. It asked for pretty much everything in order for me to get an account to access my reports. Yes, everything from name, address, and ssn was needed for me to make an Identityiq account.

Once I made an account and printed out my credit report, it then hit me: did i just get phished? I realized that the sender of the email used a gmail, and that the email never specifically stated which company they were a part of. So to check, I asked them which company they were from, and to add to my paranoia, they never responded in the 48 hour time period that they said they would.

I called Identityiq's customer service department and said that my account is secure and there was nothing i should worry about. I also asked them to remove my account and its information from their system which they gladly helped. However, i can't quite get this bitter taste out of my mouth and this whole scenario is leaving me extremely paranoid right now.

So i need some help:

1. Has anyone heard of Identityiq? If so, should i be afraid right now?
2. I didn't specially send anything over through an email, so am I safe?
3. What happens if someone were to get a hold of my ssn through that sus Identityiq account? Again it had all my info.
4. Who should I inform about this information? It said that if my ssn was ever leaked to make sure to contact the ""government"" but thats pretty vague to me.

I know thats a lot, but thanks for anyone who helps!",10Nov2020,1
365,"Im not quite sure what to do. The guy im with is perfect on paper. He checks off every little thing I could ever want in a guy. We met online through a game we both play, I live in a different state than he does but im moving to his state (not to live with him but im already moving there for work in a few months). From day 1 it was different from any other relationship I've been in. I feel comfortable speaking my mind and we have so much in common. He gets along really well with my family that live near him and my brother and him play games quite often together. I went on a work trip to meet with some clients and decided to spend an extra couple days so he and I could hang out. The first day went pretty good until the end. Nothing exactly happened that made me upset or anything, I was just hit with this overwhelming urge to leave and so I told him i was tired and went back to my hotel for the night. We hung out two other days before I flew back home and both days I just didn't feel any connection and didn't really want to be there with him. He kept wanting to kiss and do more (which i completely understand and is okay with me) but I didn't really want to kiss him or even do more. Before this trip I really wanted to do everything with him and i couldn't see my life without him. I dont know what came over me that day because he hasn't changed at all. He really is very sweet and a really great guy, I don't know what changed for me. Hes always saying how im his world and his soulmate and I used to feel the same until that trip. I dont want to break his heart because he's really sensitive but I also don't think I should stay with him and give him any false hope if I end up not being able to stay with him. Im conflicted on whether to stay and try to make it work or to break it off. I feel like he would make a really great friend but I just don't see us working as a couple. I haven't told him any of this yet because I know it'll hurt him and I really don't want to do that to him. Im so conflicted on what to do. One day I think maybe we can make it work and the next I don't even want to talk to him when he calls. I still answer and usually we have a great time playing games over the phone. Is there something wrong with me? Any advice or guidance is much appreciated 🙏 please be kind, I already feel horrible about the whole situation 😭",10Nov2020,1

They live in another country, so I rarely ever see them now. I last saw him about three years ago when I went to visit my family, and it feels extremely strange knowing that he killed someone, and I don’t know of any details about how he killed his cousin except that he was angry at her for marrying someone their family didn’t approve of. For all I know, he could’ve hired someone to kill her (he’s a very well-off person). I honestly feel disgusted by this, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve went to his house several times as a kid for sleepovers and I always thought of him as a good person. It might be helpful to note that this murder was not recent, he killed his cousin several years ago before I saw him when I visited my family. I can’t tell my parents about this because they would 100% not believe me, and I also don’t know all the details. I can’t think about anything else after hearing about this, and it’s making it even harder knowing that I can’t tell anyone.

Even women who had never had a circumcised partner said they preferred the way a circumcised penis looks.

In another survey of 1,000 women, only 3 percent said they preferred the look of an uncircumcised penis.""

381,"After the three of us went to a concert together in March, my twin sister (21) has gotten much closer to one of her friends. I’m really happy that she has someone she can open up to, but their relationship has inadvertently made me very miserable. They talk.. A LOT. But never during normal hours and never really over text. Instead, it’s via 7-8 hour long FaceTime calls that can go until 4 or 5 in the morning. Our walls are very thin, so whenever they talk, I wake up frequently or can’t fall asleep. I struggle with sleep already (my sister is aware of this) because of recurring nightmares and problems with my neck. (I was in a car accident earlier this year)

At first, I tried to be polite and would knock gently on my wall or text her asking if she could speak quieter, to which she would always respond “sorry”, before continuing her conversation. We got into this pattern for about a month; I would knock or text, she would text back a “sorry” and then continue. But by month two, I started to feel really drowsy during the day so at night, I tried sleeping with a pillow over my head—which quickly evolved into headphones or earplugs, before, over the months, turning into trying to stuff towels and clothes under my door to muffle the sound of her and her friend talking,  turning on music, my TV, and multiple fans and humidifiers. 

I don’t get it. How is she so loud? No matter what I do, I can still hear her. It’s been months since this has been an issue, and I’ve tried to talk to her about it multiple times, trying to let her know that I’m happy she has someone to talk to, etc. but that I can’t sleep when they talk on the phone, and I’ve tried a lot of things before I even asked her to change her routine at all. I proposed that she try to call her friend earlier in the day or evening or move to another place in the house other than her bedroom so that way I can sleep. But so far, she’s never said anything much to be besides “Sorry” and has never moved rooms or even put headphones in. 

I’m really at my wits end, it feels like at this point she just doesn’t care about me at all. From what I can hear of their conversations, (I don’t mean to eavesdrop, they’re just very loud) they’re mostly discussions about tv shows they’re watching, celebrities, her friend’s job, and other stuff like that. I don’t know what to do at this point, I’m so tired!!! (Both figuratively and literally!)",10Nov2020,1
382,"“Broke up” in quotations because we were never officially dating, but very close to it. I (20sF) have always been able to cut people out of my life really easily if they’ve done something shitty. I’ve never dated anyone before probably because I tend to lose interest really quickly for this reason too, but over the past few months I met this one person (20sF) that I really liked who liked me back and things were going really well until she said something the other day and I lost all my feelings for her, like literally immediately on the spot. I was so scared it was gonna happen too, it was like “it’s only a matter of time” and it fucking sucks. 

We weren’t officially dating, but I figured I’d say something instead of leading her on, so I broke things off with her and this is really the first time this has happened where I’m feeling actual consequences from cutting someone off, like she’s super hurt about it. I’m doing ok since I had made up my mind but the fact that I hurt her more than I realized is tearing me up, I feel so awful. 

Is this a normal thing that other people go through? Are all my relationships just gonna go to shit because I lose interest real fast and don’t know how to deal with it? Should I give people second chances more even if there’s red flags?",10Nov2020,1
383,"I’m not depressed, I figured I’d get that out the way given the headline; nor am I suicidal in any way.

Now that that’s out the way, I need help. I am a 25 year old male, I am in my last semester of college (which thankfully is all online during this) and I went to the hospital for what the doctors chalked up to be an anxiety attack. That worst one, the one that sent me to the hospital, happened the day before my birthday so it’s easy to keep track of.

Now, whenever I go outside, get in a car, or even get too stressed out I have the feeling all over again. I was able to get an over-the-phone (telemed) appointment with a local doctor who has prescribed me two types of medicine. Unfortunately the medicine prescribed is reactionary and not preventative, such that it helps end the panic attacks (or whatever they are) whenever they start, but they do not prevent them. I was told that I would have to go in to the doctor to get any stronger preventative type medicine. 

I go to my state’s university, where I study law. Thankfully, my parents traveled from my home town and attempted to bring me to a doctor. This was fruitless, however, as the last time we attempted my panic attack was ferocious on the ride there (almost on par with the hospital visit) and when we finally got there COVID seemed to have caused a line to get in the door (yes even with an appointment) but who am I kidding, I could barely stand the car ride much less get out into public. So we turned the car around back to my house in my college town, the place I feel safest.

Luckily, COVID has made my final semester exclusively online. A girl from my past started talking to me again and we really hit it off, she understands what’s going on with me and helps me through it, and I am lucky to have her in my life. My grades are good, my roommates are two of my closest friends. I keep myself busy with an old 2007 MMORPG, youtube, and schoolwork. Cooking helps clear my head. I have consistently told my parents and friends alike “yes I’ll schedule a doctors appointment, I’m just busy with school right now”. Not entirely false, but my inability to take a car ride also stems there. It’s crazy, horror movies are my favorite; but this real life fear, the feeling of pure dread I experienced the night before my birthday and on the car ride to a doctor, scares the daylights out of me.

Now, it has been almost 3 months that I have not traveled more than a few yards from my front door. The lack of energy exertion throughout the day has also turned me into an insomniac. I need to figure this out. Prior to this occurring, I was Superman. Charismatic, bright, outgoing, very social; I’ve never been one to shy away from my colleges bar scene in exchange for a night in. As stated, the COVID pandemic is a catastrophe, but if this had to ever happen to me I’m glad it happened now. But I am about to graduate and have to make my way out into the “real world” soon. Christ, this girl wants to date me, and nothing was more sad than to tell her I wouldn’t be traveling back to our home town an hour away to meet her family on thanksgiving; simply because I can’t. Like I said, she does understand, though. And I am surrounded by great friends and a supportive family.

So, Reddit advice board, what can I do? Do doctors still make house calls? Do I ask a friend to see if a family member of theirs is a doctor? I am a firm believer in science, and however this started, I know I can begin to stop it by seeking further medical help. The first problem still stands: the get out the house.

And trust me, I’d like nothing more than to do just that.

NOTE: this is the first time I have used this board, I ask that if anyone feels it should be moved please inform me before deleting this post. As it took me quite some time to type it, and it a huge issue to me right now.

386,"My bf is 30 and I live with him in a small flat (2 rooms, bath and kitchen) for over 2 years now.

He works as a programmer from home and will start to work for a new company in spring (April/May 2021). 
I am still in education. I learn the job of a kindergardener and will finish in June 2021.

We already planned to move to a bigger flat (3-4 rooms, kitchen, 2 bathrooms) and already looked at 2 empty flats in the same house. (One with 2 balconies and one on the rooftop with a very large balcony around.)
Once he starts at the new company we want to move asap and adopt 2 cats. Then I will go to a new school for a higher education for 4 more years.
After all of this we wanna have a family. 

That's our plan so far, but I struggle really hard. The school I visit now is right in the city center with over 4000 students who all learn some different jobs. A lot of teachers are sick or got pregnant. We have very few lessons and I am so insecure about how this will go on.
I think about to ""speed up"" our plan a little. I think about not going to the new school for another 4 years... maybe we could move and build a family next year already?
I mean... I don't know... both ways kinda have a positive and a negative side. I have to apply for the new school until February. My boyfriend gives me total freedom. If I'd say I really don't wanna go there he wouldn't be mad or disappointed (ok maybe a little bit sad)

387,"Apologies for the nature of this post in the current climate, I know there are far worse problems to have. My situation is that a few months ago, I got a high pressure job (with a great company and lovely people). The boundaries of the role were slightly misrepresented, and the management structure is a mess, but the norm here is just to go all out. However, as I have been so caught up in that, and I have enjoyed most of it and found some of the work really interesting, I have neglected my health to a point where I’ve now been signed off sick due to troubles sleeping/eating. The impact of COVID on the role definitely made this worse, in terms of the additional pressure of covering for sick colleagues. I also study part time, and have a lot going on outside work. In hindsight, it’s not surprising I’ve ended up here.

However, now I have to take stock and decide whether to ask my workplace to reduce my hours (which would be complicated), or find something which better suits where I am in life. My boss has been incredibly supportive and wants to keep me on, which I really appreciate. But I don’t know whether it is sustainable. I am fortunate to be in a field which is in demand during this time, so could find something closer/less time consuming, but that might not be as interesting.

392,"My question might sound wierd af, but just hear me out before you downvote me into hell, ok? 😅

I got my first proper TV for a discounted price (around 40-50% off) during the holiday sales about 5 years ago. It was a 55” Samsung 4K LED TV from their ”mid budget” range, so I thought it was dirt cheap to buy it for that discount. Please mind that this was before
OLED or QLED started to blow up.

I guess I only have 2 reasons to why I want to sabotage my own electronic devices:

1 - Age is taking it’s toll. For starters, it has had a very noticable bleed (particulary in the lower right corner) since I bought it, and as you might understand it’s not getting any better. 

I feel that the image quality isn’t that amazing, you can’t see for shit whats on the TV because of reflections and poor display lighting on sunny days, and the UI and startup of the TV is starting to get a little bit slower and unresponsive.

2 - I really, really, REALLY can’t be arsed to bring up the discussion with my partner! Me and my partner live together and ofcourse we almost always discuss what we need to buy and what not... except for that one time I bought a Dyson vacuum, which she first tought was unnecessary because of that we already had a really crappy vacuum cleaner, but changed her mind pretty quickly after seeing how simple the Dyson was to use and how great it was.

Economically, buying a newer QLED/OLED from my own pocket is not a problem at all for me, as we don’t really have a shared economy in a traditional sense. But motivating to buy a new TV is not going to be easy at all. She’s stubborn and have a proper ”if it’s not broken, don’t fix it”-mentality.

I’m 16 and adopted (just turned 16 in may) and recently decided I wanted to contact my birth parents.  It was an open adoption so pretty much knew both my birth parents names. Around the beginning of October I went onto Facebook and Instagram and found my BM. I messaged her on Facebook. I pretty much just said “hello, I’m your birth son you put up for adoption” she responded rather quick freaking out but happy and told me to send a pic... so I did. And honestly we’ve been texting ever since, we were talking about how much we looked alike and it was awesome. She gave my my birth dad number and birth brother and they apparently already knew about me. They are all very cool so now it’s time for me to tell my adoptive parents.

After I told my adoptive parents about the idea of messaging them (lol I beat around the bush) they freaked out and said “NO, NOT UNTIL YOUR 18” and I was just like why, and they yelled at me about how I would be super annoying  and that she apparently wanted to hear from when I was 18 (which is definitely a valid reason.

I'll try to keep it short and simple

SO I'LL COME UP STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.

recently my college announced the final exam schedule which will be next month and my dad... I don't know from WHERE came to me one day and said -
                   FROM NOW YOU'LL DO NOTHING BUT STUDY FOR ATLEAST 15 HOURS EVERYDAY! and then threatens me by saying something like he'll take my phone if I didn't do it and like that. 

I won't say much.... But I'm trying to put 100% of me and I am exploring things too -- I believe there's much more to life and getting downs in life is normal! But when my dad yells at me for even smaller things it becomes really hard for me to cope -- I've started to feel really depressed and get bad thoughts in mind I feel like I should go somewhere and live alone... I've said the exact same thing very clearly to my parents but rather to understand me they either try to act that there's no big deal

So when I was like 7 or 8, my parents told me I was adopted at birth, my adoptive parents always said it was okay if you wanted to meet them one day. 

Now I’m 16,  (just turned 16 in may) and recently decided I wanted to contact my birth parents.  It was an open adoption so pretty much knew both my birth parents names. Around the beginning of October I went onto Facebook and Instagram and found my BM. I messaged her on Facebook. I pretty much just said “hello, I’m your birth son you put up for adoption” she responded rather quick freaking out but happy and told me to send a pic... so I did. we started talking about how much we looked alike and it was awesome. I also asked the usual questions an adoptee questions.... anyways She gave me my birth dad number and birth brother and they apparently already knew about me. They are all very cool so now it’s time for me to tell my adoptive parents.

After I told my adoptive parents about the idea of messaging them (I wasn’t sure how they would react so I just beat around the bush) they freaked out and said “NO, NOT UNTIL YOU’RE 18” and I asked them why and they yelled at me about how they don’t want me to be annoying that she apparently wanted to hear from when I was 18 (which I guess is a valid reason). At this point I’ve been in contact with them for days, one of the first thing they asked me was if my parents knew, I just said 

Now I’ve been messaging my birth family for days, while my family apparently really does not want me to do it. I’m not sure how to them them without them freaking the hell out. I don’t want to ghost my bio family either because that would obviously be wrong",10Nov2020,1

We often drink when we hang out (sometimes to the point of him not remembering the next day) but I feel like we can get a little flirty, like teasing each other and getting touchy. The problem is he has a new girlfriend. The flirtiness never really crossed a line (and told myself maybe I even just imagined it), but the other night we were drunk and he was sleepy and out of it and touched me in a way I definitely would have been upset by if I were his girlfriend (like stroking my back, under my shirt, on my skin. For a while). I wasn’t that I was uncomfortable with it, but I was very guilty thinking of the girlfriend because I didn’t do anything to stop it. I ended up sleeping over his place that night (not in his bed). When I saw him again we didn’t talk about it. I’m not sure he remembers. I feel like this was very unfair to his girlfriend and, whether he knows it or not, unfair to me as well because I actually have feelings for him and I feel like I’m being played with.

i apologise in advance about my spelling and writing im terrible.

I'm in year 10 and have a close female friend that likes to look through people's school emails and accounts as our passwords are just our birthdays, my close friend group consists of 5 really close friends (3 girls 2 guys) one being the one that goes through people emails and accounts and another that is more of a tom boy if anything. Anyway, in short, the close female that looks through people's accounts had found that the tomboy had a watt pad account. And in that Wattpad account she wrote about the female who looks through peoples accounts really sexually.  In short its the worst pornography i have ever heard and that's not even mentioning that she wrote about others as well including teachers and i think you can work out where this is getting. So we didn't know she was a lesbian and we often say stuff about lesbians that we feel bad about now and since we found out in a really bad way we are unsure what to do. this was a big suprise to us that this person would do this and now were in a weird situation and are tossing up weather to confrount her or ignor it but it has made us feel really uncomfortable that she would think about us that way and publish it.

418,"I’ll get right to it - So my boyfriend said my grandmother had the same characteristic as his grandmother - which was that she was being overdramatic. He mentioned it as a nonchalant comment, after my grandfathers passing a few days ago. I’m sure he’s just trying to make some form of...comforting conversation; As untactful as it was. Am I too sensitive to the comment? 

Let me explain. 

My boyfriend said that my grandma was being overdramatic, because since my grandfather died, I found out she’s been suicidal, blaming my grandfather for not leaving the world together, bawling, arms flailing, denying her dialysis. She’s in her 90s, and now will have to live alone with a caretaker. To clarify why I thought I am, (or maybe am not?) being overtly sensitive, is because I had been reading articles about women being “overdramatic.” Idk, is this some form of gaslighting? Many had said that acting as such (or in general) is not considered being overdramatic if you’re feeling an emotion intensely. Or that calling someone overdramatic is just belittling what they’re are feeling; aka telling them they shouldn’t feel a certain way, even though they have the right to and those feelings should be acknowledge; that they should be felt through till they’re settled or at least at some form of palpable understanding for the one who’s feeling it. 

I can understand why my grandmother would want to end it all. She never liked change, and my grandfather was her unchanging, steady and solid rock. They were together for over 60 years. That’s a long *ss time. Additionally, due to COVID - sh*ts changing real fast and not everyone can keep up. 

I’m just trying to understand it all whilst coping with the grief. Is it because of the recent events, I’m just overly sensitive about my family in general? (Which has always been the case regardless - I’m extremely protective of them and will mow the MF down if you threaten or belittle them...[although trash talk during gaming I couldn’t give a flying f*ck] ) 

Was his comment insensitive? Or am I just ruminating way too much in the A.M.?",10Nov2020,1
419,"Before I get to the question her is some back ground info:
So I knew this girl, for this post I'll just call her Laila. When she first moved to my school, Laila and I talked a lot I honestly think I was her only friend there for a while. Laila and I started hanging out outside of school and I started to like her (more than a friend) when I finally got the confidence I told her how I felt and she said she felt the same way. However, we never dated she kept saying things like ""you deserve someone better"" or ""I don't trust myself"" I will admit as I got to know her she was for the streets, but I didn't care I for some reason thought I could bring her good side out more than the other. I kept talking to Laila for an entire year and i was fine with not dating and in the short time that I knew her she made me feel happier than I had ever been before. Yeah Laila and I had arguments here and there but I honestly became so close to her that I stopped thinking of her as someone I wanted to date (which at that point I started thinking I didn't want to date her for a while) and started thinking of her as family because that's how close I felt like we got I even introduced her to my family and they loved her and she loved them. Also I should say she is not a very emotional person like anything that isn't positive like laughing or even dark humor she does not do.

One day she moved back to her hometown which was in another state and I kept in contact with her through texting and calling and even playing games online with her, everything felt like it was going great, until one day she stops responding to my texts, I kept sending her something every couple of days to see if she would respond. After a while she finally responds and says ""you are really annoying""  I knew shebwas going to say something like that ot wasn't very out of character or anything, but in that same conversation she says she never really thought of me as her friend just a guy who gave her gifts, good food, and good times in her words ""someone I could call to do stuff whenever I wanted"" while Laila and I are having this conversation im close to tearing up and she felt bad for me because she knew I was going to be like that but other than that she felt nothing else from the entire thing, she said me she was going to tell me all this before she left, but she didn't want to tell me so she hoped I stopped talking to her as much or not at all once she moved away. After a few days when I was more calm I talked to Laila again just to understand why she never told me all that and at the end she told me we can still keep in contact, I told her ""no I've annoyed you so much it best that I stop being in contact"" her response was ""Just shut up now, we can keep in contact, just not on a regular basis"" she confuses me so much she doesn't like me in fact she's pretty annoyed with me and yet she wants to keep in contact. With all this said and done I still care for her and think what if we become friends later.

Finally here's the question:
What do I even do I've tried dropping her and I can't do that and why do I even still care about her she betrayed my trust and told me everything I thought I knew was a lie and yet I can't get her out of my head.",10Nov2020,1

So 6 years ago I finished my degree as a dental assistant and had an internship with the local dentist in our town. He is kind but also quite arrogant. I always felt much below him which is obvious as he’s the dentist. Now I left that field and I’m studying something else which I haven’t finished nor know if I ever finish due to many personal reasons. So naturally I don’t have a job in that field. I left town and have another dentist but have some wisdoms teeth that has to be operated out. My old dentist has a surgeon who comes 1 time in a month for such procedures. I contacted my old dentist as he’s a bit cheaper than those my new dentist advice me to go to. 

On Thursday there’s an available time at my old dentist so I can take som x-rays! What I’m afraid of is he’ll ask me how it’s going. What I do now etc. I’ve kinda isolated myself from everyone as I need to work on myself and want to be something before I meet people. So I’m kinda ashamed of what to say.

424,"I hope this kind of post is allowed in this sub. I don't know where to talk about it.

I don't really know how this started. For as long as I remember I try to make all decisions using dice and essentially randomizing them. It probably started as a way to cope with paralysis of choice.

The thing is, this is really limiting. For example when I'm making music, my dice will choose the next synthesizer I use, the settings I use for it, the chords to play...

Ofcourse life is full of choices and is really complex. Because I've done this for years my head is full of rules and systems to be able to make decisions about everything. I have systems to decide what to do, what to eat, what game to play, what to do in that game...

Sometimes I feel like it helps me, because I can just do things without thinking to much about them. But especially on a creative level, I feel like it limits the way I make music or the way I write a lot and I can't seem to step away from the dice. When I roll them, I can't ignore the outcome and when I try to not use them I'm just paralysed for a whole day.

I can't explain this to anyone. When I try to, they don't understand. Often they see it as a funny quirk, but I feel like sometimes I'm really suffering from this. When I try to not touch a dice for a day, I often get so much anxiety I get sick.

I can't find anything about this on the internet. It seems like I'm the only person in het world that developed this coping mechanism and I don't know how I can unlearn this or find a healthier way for using it.

It’s just that I am quite an emotional person when it Comes to any relationship and I think it is damaging for me. 
I say this because she will talk to my friends behind my back and she’s extremely intolerant of me and finds me boring and it’s almost as if she hates me.

When I’m at my dads I usually see her that weekend since my dad and his partner still live separately. Thing is she wants to have sex with me but she’s 15 so I’m just gonna wait till she’s legal but I sort of feel this pressure to do it due to the fact that she’s treating me like shit. Like she will say she wants to come to my house and then when she leaves she’ll tell my friends she’s “finally” left and it was tiring and then will talk to them about stuff and will ignore me. If I’m playing an online card game with a friend, she will privately message the other so that they win and I will have to lose.
It sort of like she’s hitting on my friends are then pretending she wants to spend time with me. Also randomly telling me about Thai dude she fucked and then another guy she fucked and so on.

Maybe I am being too sensitive or overthinking.

I guess what I'm asking is, why do I feel so isolated and unhappy when surrounded by people I like? Is it as simple as thinking differently? Is it focusing on self worth? Instead of prep for the worst, prep for the best? Who or when should I reach out to? 

Thank you for reading this, even if there's no responses, I feel like I just had to let this out instead of keeping it bottled inside.",10Nov2020,1
437,"Ok so, recently I (M21) started ""seeing"" this girl (F19).

I put seeing in quotes because all we did is walk our dogs (like 1-2 hours walks) and hangout to have a smoke and talk.

For context, she was the one to propose we hang out.

But, me being the idiot that I am, I can't understand if I have to consider those hangout sessions as a sort of date or if we are just being friends.

So what i wanted to ask was:

should I ask her directly what we are doing (in a subtle way of course), or should I just, go with the flow, and wait and see what happens ?",10Nov2020,1
438,"I definitely have had a catalog of mental issues.. depression, anxiety and depersonalization.

In my head I have zero personality, when I text people and even sometimes when I talk to people it shows.

 I have a faint vision of myself, being cool or relaxed, which I usually am. I like who I am. I just want my perception of myself to catch up.

So my question is, how do you become more like yourself, mentally or even better coexist.",10Nov2020,1
439,"He's messaging me that he will pick me up in less than 15 minutes. I'm shitting myself in nerves.

I did my undergrad internship at this fairly smallish school and today was my last day. There's a major language barrier between myself and most of the senior teachers, so we never really socialised much beyond the normal formalities.. But today, one of my students came up to me and said 'Mr. Adam is asking for your number.' I thought maybe it's for my evaluation, maybe the headmaster is asking the teachers if they have my contact info, etc, so I gave it. 

Within one hour of getting my number, 'Adam' asked if I'm free tonight then said let's go eat. I'm already afraid I'm overthinking too much, but the only question he sent was 'are you free tonight?' and the rest sounded more like imperatives. I froze up and didn't even say yes but just said I have class until 6, and he replies 'ok ill pick you up at 6.30'

I hope it's just my crippling anxiety, but frankly I hadn't even met this dude before. I vaguely recall seeing him pass the classroom where I did my classes, but never spoke to him or anything. I don't know what to expect.

I don't want to seem rude in case it's a celebratory meal out with the other teachers (which would be weird given the timing because it's not even the end of their semester yet).

440,"Hi, basically the situation is that I have to take care by my own of a terribly irascible men that happens to be my almost 83 years old dad, he is 59 years older than me what doesn't make things easier cuz we don't have much in common... 

He's always been a difficult guy to handle,since I have memory I've always had to tread carefully to not anger him, things got pretty bad when I was a teen and I started to be more and more individualistic he didn't took well that I started to have my own opinions and that I was able to win arguments (that really drives him crazy...) I'm much better prepared to handle him now I'm 24 and not in a constant rollercoaster of hormones (thanks God) but the older he gets the more childish his anger management becomes, you know that kid with a tantrum that looks impossible to calm down that's him in a daily basis and going worse... 

I'm gonna try and give some context. 

Let's say there are fly's in the kitchen, anybody would take a fly swatter and get rid of them, well that's what I did and while I was doing that he asked me to stop I said ""give me 5 minutes pls so I can get rid of them"" the answer? him screaming and insulting me cuz apparently I'm a sadic who wants to kill his nerves, great XD. 

Another example :

Let's say I woke up and hes thinking about getting out of the house to buy the groceries(he just finished his quarantine cuz he got infected by covid which made his temper even better) what I said was ""if I were you I wouldn't go, your still feeble""
His answer? screaming and insulting this time I am a natzi militar police who wants to control averything and doesn't let him life I also destroyed his last romantic relationship (I was freaking 8 and I didn't destroyed shit btw...) 

And I could go on, screams and insults when I called the doctor cuz apparently I wanted him to get in a hospital to die...  

More screams and insults if I tell him to be patient and endure the best he can... 


Well yeah I think is pretty clear. 


So long story short, is there around here someone with a good advice? I know I'm not gonna get the final advice that's gonna make my dad become a sweet angel (when he's not on his nuts state he's pretty good btw the problem is how easily he gets nuts...) But idk guys anything that might help would be great, this is  gonna sound like im boosting but growing up whit a guy like this made me become patient as fuck is really hard to make me mad...

I had the intention of breaking up with her. Not because it's what I want but because I felt it was the right thing to do for her sake.

He says that he wants a family, to put a baby in me, that I’d be the “best mum” and that’s all he wants. He also confesses his love to me all night (he is skeptical about saying I love you when he’s sober because we are pretty new,) and that he wants to marry me. He says that I’m his everything and he loves me so much, regardless of his reluctance to express himself when he’s sober. 

When he sobers up he says that we shouldn’t have a kid right now and basically takes it all back. 

I’ve wanted a baby for a few years now, and wouldn’t be upset at all if I got pregnant. I also care about him deeply and wouldn’t be opposed to having a baby with him lol. I can see a future with him 100% and honestly would be happy if we got pregnant. 

Why does he doooooo this lol. I think personally that deep down he wants what he says and does while drunk and then gets in his head about it sober and takes it all back because he feels vulnerable ???

i can laugh and smile and have a good time but .. at night, when i lay in bed, i often am left feeling.. a little bit unsatisfied? i don’t think that’s the best word for it .. like somethings missing, maybe. some days are harder than others. 

but i don’t know if this is depression... when i read stories of people talking about how they felt at their low points, sometimes it’s incredibly relatable. but other times, i feel they struggle 100x harder than i ever have. 

i have had suicidal and self harm thoughts, but i don’t think i could ever act on them. it’s never been that strong of an urge. 

it’s hard for me to put it all into words. but if somebody else understands or relates with me, please please comment saying so. i really need that.

Our father just passed away and we only have our mom left. 

He’s been pressing me out lately and getting upset at me about why I never call him or text him. But every time he calls it’s to talk about himself or he’s mad at something. 

The last time we spoke, he got mad at me because I don’t call him enough and he started to guilt me by saying that Im his only family (aside from my mom) and I don’t even call him. He called me petty and childish. He then started talking about how he’s so sad and depressed. 

I get that he’s my brother, but he’s just a really shitty person and I honestly do not want that energy in my life. My mom’s been there for him since day one and he threatened to put her in a nursing home because they got into an argument over why she doesn’t want to pay for his phone bill anymore.

467,"I know a lot of people won't read through this, this isn't a depression post, I am new to reddit and I don't really enjoy online interactions so I'm trying to limit what services I'm using, I don't have social networks accounts.

TL;DR (for anyone who doesn't want to read through this and I understand that) : I have become a slow learner, I need to lose weight and get in shape, and I need to help my parents a lot more to thank them for raising me and loving me with all their heart. They don't deserve what I have been inflicting to them for so many years. How do I get the necessary motivation, how do I convince myself that it will work out if I keep at it and play video games less (or any sort of useless time sink) ? Also, if there's any programmer out there, how did you learn to program and understand the logic of programming ? I'm stuck in a tutorial/course loop where I can barely do anything without taking courses or tutorials. Thanks. Really. 

I \[20M\] am currently lost in my life. Covid 19 made me go back to staying in my room all day on my computer and on the internet even though I finally managed to fit in a class alright with really nice people. 2 Years ago I had no idea what I wanted to do in life and I finally decided to try myself at a programming class located in my old highschool. The problem is I am way behind everyone in this class, they've been doing this for 5 or more years for a lot of them and after 1 year and half I haven't done a single fully finished simple project and a lot of the courses we have in class (especially databases) really annoy/bore me. I prefer programming in C# or other OOP programming languages, and I like using Unity as a hobby. Though, I still learn those way too slow. I am currently having really bad marks on this second year (last year I barely got a 9/20 which was still enough to let me pass to second year) around 4/20 (sorry this is not a joke even if I'd prefer laughing right now) in programming, databases and servers. I should be able to maintain marks over 10/20 in general subjects such as english, french, math and economics.

As of now, with those results I am heading to retrying next year in the same class.

Even though I'm 20 years old, I still live with my parents and my younger brother. They've worked hard their whole life to make ours easier. My father has worked abroad for more than 40 years and during the past 20 years I have only been able to see him every 4-6 weeks for only several days, except during special vacations. My mother still works as a physics teacher in a highschool located really close to mine, in the same city. My grand-parents are just like my parents, they've always been kind, loving and always wanted the best for us, always took care of my brother and I. When I was 6 to 12, this has never been an issue. I was good in school, learned things fast, learned piano and love playing it, always brought good marks home, always played outside whenever I could, had friends, and was polite and respectful towards my parents and brother. When I was 13, at the end of the school year, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and even though it might sound like nothing to a lot of people, it ruined me for a good portion of the summer. I have, ever since, felt, not pain but close to it, but a weird sensation that I can't explain and that my endocrinologist (or even anyone else other than me) knows about. I have recently balanced my diabetes so my health on that part is now good. I lost a lot of weight at that time and also grew really fast and became taller than almost anyone in all the classes I was in. I started gaining weight again when my behavior started going downhill when I was around 15 years old. My marks were bad, I was one of the worst in my classes and I started becoming quite vulgar in my way of speak, I wouldn't spare a single french insult you can find in the dictionnary because I felt angry most of the time. As of today, I can still get pissed about small things, though I am not and never have been physically violent, I only looked angry from my words and from the outside. I understand that, to people and specifically my parents and family, this must have been weird because I would get angry for the smallest things.

I have always been really sensitive and I can cry really easily when in awkward social situations such as when I have to talk to teachers about my bad results or when someone in my family starts crying or is really sick. I also have close to zero self control over a lot of things. I procrastinate a lot, I am currently following online lessons on C# and unity because what we're taught in class, not only doesn't relate to any of those, but also doesn't teach me or barely teaches me anything. Yet they still ask a lot out of me during exams. And of course, I may lie to people about this, but I don't lie to myself, I know it is the lack of work and studying that has been an issue for the past 5-6 years. When I was 14 I started playing video games too much because my marks were still alright with bare minimum work and I was still the 4th in my class. I am now the opposite of what I used to be, I am now a really slow learner, I still play one video game but I am now trying to restrict myself as much as I can. 

I used to swim 4 hours a week, my weight was alright, 3 years ago it started becoming worse and Covid didn't miss me. yesterday I tried myself at running for a few kilometers and after 10-20 seconds of running, I am exhausted and out of breath. I weight around 95-100 kilos for 187 cm which is really bad since none of those kilos are muscles. Gathering the necessary motivation is horrendously hard for me, be it for learning, working in programming, or losing weight/exercising. 

I have difficulties in a lot of things that normal human beings do everyday. I have difficulty keeping up a conversation with people, I usually make things awkward or simply don't talk, I don't like talking that much but I constantly talk to myself aloud when I'm sure nobody's hearing. I am actually a fun person inside, I have a lot of different tastes in different domains such as music, games, movies, books etc... yet I am not able to completely translate those in conversations or social behaviors.

There was a point where I would cry a lot for all the reasons above, because I was ridiculous, because I was a shame of a person. There was a point where I wanted to end it and saw a psychologist but it didn't work. Though it did make me rethink about all this and now (not sure if it is better or worse) I just constantly sigh about everything and everything feels bland.

I am trying to learn programming, 3D modeling as well, game development also. I want to exercise more, but I am just learning so slowly. I want this to be my career but sometimes it feels horrible and boring. It is frustrating how much I am able to NOT learn because of my lack of focus on lessons. I forget a lot of things easily and it makes me look like an asshole to my parents or family. I sometimes forget birthday dates. I forget things I was supposed to do for a certain date, I forget things I said I would do, but I also do that a lot out of boredom/laziness.

It makes me sad that I lie a lot about this to my parents when confronting me, yet I do not agree with the ""do not lie to yourself"". I know about all this, I know it is all a mess, yet I don't want them to get that idea.

How do you get out of this and do what normal young adults do everyday, responsible adults. How do you acquire that motivation or at least what can I try to trick myself into thinking this way.

Thank you.",10Nov2020,1

I recently went through my second break up this year. While that's another story, this time it's left me living by myself for the first time. 

I'm really worried about loneliness. I haven't really been by myself fully ever in my life. Its day 3 and I already feel loneliness setting in. What do people do when they are alone? What kinds of things should I start doing to keep myself occupied? Normally I would join a group or get into a social hobby but with COVID this has proven difficult. Luckily I am back to school this year after 10 years and that occupies a lot of my time, but im still not interacting with others like I want to be. 

Any advice would be awesome.",10Nov2020,1
471,"To give some background information, both of us are 16, and frankly students in my country get pretty stressed out over academics including her. I've heard that cults reach out to stressed or lonely people, especially teens, and I think my friend unfortunately crossed paths with them. Now there was controversy over this particular organisation, with former members calling it a scam and others saying it was useful in some areas, such as all the ""motivational speeches"" and - given that I've done a google search - help in academic work. But basically members seem to get fucked up in the mind after joining. 
This friend and I aren't heart-to-heart close, but we have our moments and she helped me get through some dark times. I'm not sure if she's fully brainwashed or just interested and having a look around, and usually I would've just asked her things. But given how serious the situation seems to be, do you think I should directly ask her, or hint around during small talk? 
And if it happens that she's fully a member, should I just shrug and walk away? 
Apologies if this seems like an overreaction...my family didn't really think it was a big deal, but the prospect of a friend joining an actual cult is pretty unbelievable and I still can't believe people close to me would get affected too. It just seems unreal, up till this point in my life I've only ever heard about cults in movies.",10Nov2020,1
474,"Hello there. First time poster here so I apologize for any misunderstandings.

I'm just writing to ask some advise on what to do. Basically, I just have this severe tendency of looking at setbacks as the reflection of literally my entire existence. To give a little background, I'm a seventeen 17 yr old female who's really very competitive in school. I'm currently aiming for one of the highest honors in academics since it's my senior year and I want the feeling of having accomplished something and being one that actually matters. 

Anyway, this may seem trivial to you all but I'm really upset that I was not
chosen by a (not-so-close) friend for a position at his student council cabinet. It literally feels like I'm still seen by him as a person who's still incompetent and unable to do any real work. I've spent the last 2 years improving myself, which includes joining various school committees as a lowly member. It's just that I feel like I'm still the same weak, fragile and lazy person I was before taking any leadership positions. Organization elections are coming up and now, I'm really anxious because if i can't even be appointed for a position by a friend, how much more can I get a vote of confidence from my peers who don't even even know me yet? I've prepared really well and it just feels like every failure that I have will eventually spill into other areas of my life. In that same organization last year, I did not get enough votes to be elected as president (so I was not in any ranking position at all) but I continued to devote myself for its development with competence, which resulted to everyone treating me equally as our president and me having a great influence in decision-making. 

If I fail to have any leadership positions, there's simply no chance for me to qualify for any awards this year as extracurricular activities are also considered for it besides our grades. I'm not the smartest student (I rank like 4th or 5th) so I'm hoping that my extracurriculars would lift me up. This would've been the year that I would devote myself entirely for college admission exams and disregard whatever failures I'll have but all were cancelled because of the pandemic. I'm so sick of not having any official designations and acting as a person working from behind the scenes only, like I can execute my role the same or even better as the people in charge e but I'm stuck as a lowly member. 

Just writing this jumbled up version of my thoughts made me feel a bit better but does anyone have any advice how to cope in these situations?  Thanks.",10Nov2020,1
475,"Since a few months now I have been in a online relationship with my girlfriend from Ireland.

She’s struggling with severe depression which is making her cut herself and suicidal. I know the core cause of this, it’s because her sister bullies her constantly making her feel unsafe in her house, I’ve looked up the definition of emotional abuse and it fits perfectly.

Her parents don’t do anything about it, they tried to help before and sent her sister to therapy but that all didn’t help and they kinda just gave up. So that also is indirect emotional abuse.

I’ve thought about calling the Child Protective Services, but she really doesn’t want me to and tells me that chances are big it’s not gonna help (I think it might, but I’m too scared to take the risk and hurt her in the process).

She wants to run away but is scared of the consequences it might have. She can go to me and with a little bit of luck I can get her in my school. Though this might seem like it’s a bit too much and will be too difficult. I think that if I don’t, I can’t say for sure that she’ll make it to 18.

Her depression, self-hate etc. Keeps getting worse because of the fights with her sister and her parents not doing anything about it and I think that in an impulsive mood she might actually do it.

It’s all very difficult and complicated, does anyone have advice? It will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",10Nov2020,1
476,"This fight occurred exactly 1 year ago but I still can‘t seem to let it go, so I need opinions and advice from people who don’t know me. \*All names have been changed for obvious reasons\*

I had been friends with my best friend, Julie, since 4th grade; so she was like a sister to me. She started dating her boyfriend, Max, when we were all in middle school. So we all basically grew up together. It is also important to note that around that same time I also became very close with Julie’s sister, Savannah. All throughout high school Julie, Savannah, and I were the best of friends. Julie and Max dated on and off throughout high school and well past college. I was an extremely late bloomer so I never had a boyfriend in high school or college, so I was always the third wheel with Julie and Max. I didn’t really mind it because I considered them to be my family and we had some damn good times. 

Anyways, flash forward to 1 year ago; I had not seen and had barely spoken to Julie for about a year. One day I suddenly got a text from Max. At that time, I had somewhat of an inkling that him and Julie may have broken up but I wasn’t completely sure since she had not told me and I had not bothered to look into it. I only had noticed that she hadn’t posted much of him on her social media. Anyways, I was at work when he texted me, asking how I was and if I wanted to go to a concert with him that night. I hadn’t seen him for about a year and so I got excited to hear from my old friend. I told him that I didn’t think I would be able to go with him (I was still considering whether or not I wanted to go out to the bar with my friends that night), but he basically started begging me to go with him and said that he didn’t have anyone else to go with blah blah blah so I gave in (truth be told I really wanted to go to that concert too and knew a few of my friends who were going as well). So I end up going to the concert with him and I got to meet up with my other friends there and we had a great time and I posted videos of the concert on my snapchat etc. The next day I got a Snapchat message from Julie asking who I had gone to the concert with so I told her that Max didn’t have anyone else to go with so I went with him and all she messaged me back was “lol”. 

The following night was the night that me and my friends had decided to go out for Halloween. Max had mentioned that he wanted to do something for Halloween prior to that night so I had mentioned that I was going to be at a certain bar that night. Well, Max ended up coming to that same bar that night and hung out with me and my friends. We all ended up going to some house party after the bar, keep in mind that Max was also friends with the people that I was hanging out with and who were at the house party. We have a great night and I ended up sleeping over at my friend Trixie’s house. 

The next morning, at 8am, I wake up to someone blowing up my phone. Both Julie and Savannah were texting me in a group chat. They were calling me out for being a fake bitch and saying some truly horrendous things (that I wont repeat). It turns out that Savannah had seen the instagram posts from the night before and there were a couple pictures that included both me and Max and she had shown them to Julie and Julie just assumed that me and Max were sleeping together. So she basically called be a bunch of names and also threatened me and said that she was the reason that I had met Max to begin with And that he was just using me to make her mad. It also turns out that the night I went to the concert with Max was Julie’s birthday ( I honestly had forgotten that it was her birthday even though I had wished her a happy birthday that morning, I’m such an Idiot lol). I apologized to her and said that me and Max were only friends and I tried to explain the situation, but of course she didn’t believe me and said that my apology was fake, and Savannah told me where I could shove my apology. At that point I stopped texting them back because I know how they are and there was no way that they were going to listen to me and if I kept texting back I knew it would escalate things, which I didn’t want to happen. Savannah was just texting insults at me the whole time, which I was ignoring because the situation had nothing to do with her. Julie also said that I would tell Max about her texting me and I assured her I wouldnt (as if I would want to start any more drama). She also said something along the lines of “you know all the stuff that he’s done to me, why would you do this”, and honestly she never really spoke to me about any of the things he had done. All throughout our friendship she never really told me anything, as if she didn’t trust me but I don’t think I ever gave her a reason not to trust me; this is always something that I found odd. It is also funny to note that I barely even hung out with Max at the Halloween party, he was mostly dancing with my friend Trixie lol. 

In conclusion, I feel like I was definitely in the wrong. Before hanging out with Max I should have asked her if she was okay with me hanging out with him but at that point I hadn’t seen her for a whole year, I barely even considered her a friend anymore and maybe that’s why I didn’t stop and consider how she would feel about the situation. In the texts she also said something along the lines of my true colors showing; these texts really hurt me because she just automatically assumed that I had slept with her ex-boyfriend as if she hadn’t known me for 15+ years. This again circles back to, why for some reason, she never trusted me. What is your opinion about this situation? Do you have any advice about how I can move on? I just can’t seem to move past it. Please be brutally honest.

**For people who would like to have some background info on me and Julie’s friendship and why we hadn’t seen each other for a year:**

In hindsight**,** while I was ugly crying in Trixie’s room the night after the Halloween party, I realized that Julie was not the nicest friend to me. There were some situations that occurred while growing up that at the time I considered funny things that friends would do to each other but now I realize I would never do to someone whom I considered to be a friend. For example, in middle school someone threw a stink bomb in the hallway, I didn’t even know that this had happened but apparently Julie had started a rumor that I had done it; for which I got called to the principles office and was only let off the hook after they had checked the security cameras. All throughout high school and college she would continuously ditch me anytime she got a new boyfriend or anytime that she made a new friend. I cant count the amount of times that I would ask her to hang out only for her to ditch me and then I’d see her post pictures of her hanging out with someone else while I sat at home on the couch. Although I cant completely blame her for this, I could have told her how I felt or my loser ass could have just gotten some friends. 

After high school, I ended up going to a four year college that was approx 30 minutes away from my house, I still lived at home and drove to class, therefore, I wasn’t really able to make friends in college. So even during that time Julie was really my only friend, my other really good friend, Tina, had gone away to college, which was approx 2 hours away. Julie went to community college for a while but then dropped out. I think college was the darkest time for me because Julie was really my only friend and during that time she had started getting really close to Max’s sister and they had become best friends. So she would basically hang out with Max’s sister all the time and didn’t ever invite me. Many times throughout our friendship I heard, from Savannah, about things that Julie would say behind my back. I even caught her rolling her eye and giving a glance to another one of her friends after I had said something. But I always ignored these things because I thought to myself that she was like my sister and that it was okay.

**Why we hadn’t seen each other for a year:**

From what I remember there were two events that really made me not want to hang out with Julie again. The first one was when she invited me to go out with her, her friend, and Max’s sister. Long story short, we ended up getting kicked out of the bar that night because Max’s sister got into a big fight with someone (shocker), her and Julie would frequently get into fights with people when they went out and they were known to get kicked out of bars (and were for some reason proud of that). The fighting was one reason why I started not wanting to hang out with her but an even bigger reason was the way that she was standing up for Max’s sister. I had never seen her stand up for me like that. Not when boys would call me ugly, not when people would call me “gay” for not having a boyfriend; in fact, during those situations she would laugh at me with them. 

The second night was when we again went out, this time it was just her friends and Max’s sister wasn’t there so I decided to go. At that time she was living in an apartment with Max (which did I mention that she never told me she moved into until about a few months later when I saw her mom at the mall and she told me?). Anyways, Max was out of town for work (a dangerous job but I don’t want to specify what it is). The whole night Julie was texting some other guy, and said that she really wanted to hook up with him. She wanted to invite him over that night but said that she wasn’t going to because ”I know how you are”, implying that I would tell Max about her having some guy over at their apartment. Again implying that she can’t trust me. I told her that it wasn’t my business and that I wouldn’t tell Max but also that I didn’t support it. She ended up inviting the guy over, I was supposed to stay over at her house that night and I was very drunk so unfortunately I couldn’t drive myself home. Basically she made me sleep out on the couch while she was in her room with the guy, I am not sure if they did anything. That was really the last straw for me. 

Our  friendship really ended when I realized that if I wasn’t the one to initiate a conversation or  the one to plan for us to hang out then she wouldn’t either. So I stopped being the one to hit her up all the time and she never messaged me and it fizzled out until 1 year ago when we had the fight, after which she unfollowed me on all social media and I have not spoken to her since.

\*\*\* I realize that these are mostly my experiences and I am really not trying to say that Julie is a bad person. There have been times where she was a great friend to me and we had the best of times. But now it is hard for me to remember those times, I need advice on how to get past it. I still feel very guilty for hanging out with Max, as I probably should. I also just wrote all of this at 6 am because I couldn’t sleep thinking about it so I apologize if some parts don’t make sense.  It was somewhat therapeutic to write it all down, although there is so much more that I didn’t even talk about.",10Nov2020,1
477,"I'm a dreamer who's never satisfied with anything.

I grew up in a small, very poor suburban town in America. I decided pretty early on, like when I was 14 or something, that I wanted to leave this shit town, get a prominent, well-paying job in a large city, and then run for high public office in hopes of improving the conditions of places like where I grew up.

I did leave right after high school. The next decade of my life was school and early professional struggles but mostly in some amazing large cities. I was perennially broke but enjoying my life.

This year, I found that prominent, well-paying job, but in another small town and not that far from the place I grew up. The raise was 40 percent, so I had to take it. Financially, it's been a game changer: I've paid off my credit card debt, savings have skyrocketed, and I'm renting a big comfortable house. The new job also made sense if I want to enter public life. Now that I'm older, I realize that being a big fish in a small pond is a really smart way to go. I'm meeting the right people and all that jazz, but I'm hating small town life. Of course, it's made worse by COVID, but I know this place and know I'm not going to like it long term.

Recently, a friend said he could get me a job in Toronto. It would be a huge pay cut, Toronto is notoriously expensive, and entering politics as a foreigner is difficult. Nevertheless I'm tempted.

My choice is between chasing a big professional dream and living where I want. It's also between financial abundance and just getting by.

478,"I don't really know what else to do so I guess I'll post here. Apologies if it's kind of all over the place.

My  mom and dad have been together for 35+ years and I found out last night  that my dad has suffered mental health issues his whole life, I thought  it was more recent but this has been ongoing since before I was born.  My grandfather was abusive toward him as a kid and a teenager, I don't  know the extent of how he treated him but it caused him to attempt  suicide about three years before I was born. He tried to kill himself  with a car exhaust and a passing policeman was walking by and found that  the engine was running and saved him. After this, my mom took a year to  essentially be his full time carer and help him speak, walk and eat  again due to the carbon monoxide poisoning.

His  second suicide attempt which I did know about was about two years ago.  My mom found him on the floor and he only survived because he vomited up  the pills he took. This was when she alluded to issues in the  relationship and he had done it because he thought the relationship was  over. Basically the long and short of it is my mom has looked after my  dad in some capacity or another the entire time they have been together.  My dad even had an affair when I was younger and she forgave him. But  the past few years he will have times where he just shuts off for days,  goes to sleep or lies in his bed not talking to anybody. Basically my  mom is at the end of her rope and can't take this anymore. Which is  understandable and I want her to be happy and have good emotional health  because she has been through a lot. I don't begrudge her wanting to  leave at all.

The main issue of  concern is my dad. He won't talk to anybody about his mental health. He  was seeing a therapist and got proscribed medication after the second  attempt but I don't think the latter is working and he won't go to  therapy anymore. I tried calling him today and told him if he needs to  speak to somebody or to me he can. I told him he's not alone and that I love him a lot but all I get in response is ""I'm fine."" ""I'm okay.""  ""Alright."" and he hurries to end the conversation. I don't know what to do and I am very scared that if my mom leaves he will not be able to handle it and there won't be anybody there to find him and pull him out  of it if he attempts again. But I can't make him go to therapy and I can't make him open up. How can I get through to him?",10Nov2020,1

482,"Hey there.

I want to learn how to stop being so shy, especially around people who are being kind to me. I'm used to being treated poorly, so whenever someone tries to treat me that way, I'll just bounce back with another rude comment. I know it's not what I should do, and I'm working on not being so snarky. Even still, as a small positive from that, I'm not shy in replying to those who I know dislike me. However, whenever somebody is nice to me, I completely freeze. I'm so used to slinging back an insult (again, sorry. It's something I'm working on) so whenever it's not that I don't know what to do.

My voice becomes only slightly louder than a whisper, and my head goes blank, or on 'autopilot'. If someone were to ask me how my day was I'd just reply 'fine' without thinking to get the conversation over. I really don't know why people bother being kind to me, and I don't know why I become so shy when they are. I'll be afraid to ask anything remotely personal in a conversation with them, because nobody would want me knowing about them, or I'll apologize for things like touching their stuff, even if they let me.

If somebody has voluntarily invited me to something I can't go; I feel patronized whenever people are kind to me and that I should just sit there in silence and awkwardly laugh when addressed. Of course they'd patronise the small, quiet 'weird' one, they probably don't think I even understand what's going on. I really wish I could just think before my brain goes to 'autopilot', be able to have the same level as confidence that I have when dealing with bullies and to be able to 'stand equal' and not feel looked down upon all the time, even if they really are patronizing me.",10Nov2020,1

He’s a very nice guy with many kinds of talents. He’s also a special needs person but I don’t know what he has, either way, he has a big heart and he was a well loved guy in middle school. 

Lately, G would text me hello as usual and I’m a busy person and won’t text back after a while. He will understand that but these days, G would just double text if I didn’t text him back within five minutes and then just yesterday, I didn’t text him back and he immediately unsent a message since I got a notification that said “G unsent a message.” G told me that he feels like a burden to everyone and I noticed he would take things super personally if I didn’t message him back in a certain time frame. If I asked him how he’s doing, he would say “I’m fine if you care”. Last week he has even told me that he texted his mom explaining that he’s a burden to her and then told me that he thinks his mom finds him a burden, which I don’t think it’s true since he talks about how him and his mom spend so much time together. 


G would take things personally if I don’t message back and would say he won’t text me if I find him to be annoying, which I don’t at all and I have even told him that he was never annoying. It’s just that I’m a busy woman and sometimes, it’s just hard for me to text back everyone. How do I tell him not to take things personally if I don’t text back?

Long story short, I work in a small company, where it’s just my boss and a few other employees. My boss and I have had a lot of altercations in the past, which slowly developed into an extremely manipulative and toxic working relationship. 

Around 4 months ago, I threatened with leaving the company due to his behaviour and he had since changed his attitude completely. I laid out my boundaries and we came to an agreement on how we should appropriately conduct our discussions and avoid any forms of bullying or putting down. He has been friendly, approachable and a great boss ever since. Or at least, up until the last week or so..

For reasons unknown to me, his sense of trust in me has dwindled. He constantly questions my time sheets, has no faith in my decision making, and is extremely rude and critiquing, and masks it all under the guise of “constructive feedback”. This shift in attitude completely goes against my terms for staying with the company. 

Every time I get a notification from him my heart reactively sinks knowing that it will spoil my mood for the next few hours, and it’s seemingly out of my control. I provide detailed explanations behind all of my actions, and offer 100% transparency and honesty at all times, and yet he still berates me constantly. 

We’ve scheduled a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss my role in detail (all my processes, what I can offload to other employees etc). However, I have a strong inclination that the discussion will be more along the lines of him putting me down and making me feel small. When I talk to him, he cuts me off constantly, which implies that he doesn’t care what I have to say.

My question is, does anyone have any advice on dealing with scenarios such as this? I dread going into work every day in the fear that my boss will snap and treat me how he used to. Given that he’s already slipping back into old habits, I’m sure it’s not too far away before he reverts.",10Nov2020,1
490,"I've been suffering a lot mentally between the social isolation we are all feeling. I've  been living in my hometown  with less than 1000 people, when my college city had 100,000, for the last 8 months.

493,"I (F20) need to break up with my boyfriend (M20), but can’t leave him homeless.

I’m not too worried about the breakup itself as I hope we’ll still be friends, but I’m worried about how it would affect his living situation. He was in foster care when he was a child, and his mom who adopted him kicked him out for reasons beyond his control when he was sixteen. She kept all of his important documents including his birth certificate, social security card, and adoption papers. She changed his legal name when she first adopted him, but never had it changed through the social security office as well which causes a lot of problems trying to receive a paycheck as his names are different whenever his SSN is search up. All of this makes finding a job for him or even a place to live extremely difficult, and we’ve had to secretly have him in the house we’re at because we couldn’t find a way to put his name on the lease.

He has zero family to turn to for help if he ever needs it which worries me. He tries to contact his mom, but she’s ignored every single one of his calls and texts ever since she kicked him out. I’m more than willing to help him be it financially, emotionally, whatever he needs. The only thing is that, to be honest, he doesn’t NEED help financially because he’s a very hard worker. It’s more so that anything that ever happens to him with jobs going wrong, not being able to receive a paycheck, or not being able to put his name on the lease, is out of his control. I’m just trying to make sure he’ll have a roof over his head, and make sure he’ll be okay mentally by himself despite all of these obstacles. Foster care alone is traumatizing not to mention the abuse he suffered through the system, and getting kicked out for reasons beyond his control by the woman who’s supposed to take care of him has hurt him a lot. 

I’ve never broken up with anyone before as this is my first serious relationship. What’s the best way I can offer my support to him despite breaking up with him? Should I stay with him until we have enough money saved up so it’ll be easier for him to support himself? I wouldn’t mind still living with him even after we’ve broken up as I feel that would be the easiest until we’re able to figure out the best living situation for him, but I know he won’t want to do that with someone who just broke up with him (understandably so.) It wouldn’t be a dangerous situation for me either way before anyone gets any ideas. As for now I’ve been bottling everything in because I want to make sure he’ll be okay before I break up with him, but it’s very difficult pretending everything’s okay with him when it isn’t. It’s not fair to him for me to pretend like this for much longer which is why I’m now here asking for advice on how to help him best.",10Nov2020,1

I'm a senior in high school rn. Quarantine has given me a lot of time to really mull over things, and one thing that has been on my mind was this kid last year who was pretty mean to me. He basically took an embarrassing picture of me, and said mean things to me here and there, and touched my property without my permission once. Weirdly enough, it never bothered me much throughout the year, but it has been something that I slowly picked up on during quarantine. When I confronted him about why he said/did those things, he either says that it's a joke, or that he never remembered saying those things and that I'm an awful person for trying to ""gaslight"" him. He's full of shit, because I know for the fact that he said those things, but confronting him about it has proven to be useless because I've hit a brick wall with him. Some of his friends are like that towards me too. It's weird how I never really noticed or pick up on these things when they happen.

Is it normal to have past experiences like that, and in general run into assholes who disrespect your feelings and property?

Or do some people go through life never encountering scenarios where their property was never disrespected and they were never treated like garbage?",10Nov2020,1

496,"To start off I’m 20, male and my gf is 20 as well. We have a long distance relationship for 3 years now and have met in person several times. It’s very difficult for me to know where to start. I don’t want to have to write a autobiography starting day one of our relationship. 

*The problems with her and our dynamic*

I still have feels for her but they just aren’t as strong and I feel like I’m drifting away from her. I don’t know if I want to be in this relationship anymore she is too much for me. But if I leave I will hurt her, badly. She’s had a few ex’s who treated her like waste. She’s bipolar and hasn’t seen treatment in years (due to financial struggles and a lack of motivation which I try to give on deaf ears). She has an obsession with blaming herself for everything. She’s told me she has had suicidal tendencies. She has a very inconsistent and unreliable support system due to a parental divorce. She’s clinging onto me like I’m the last peace of driftwood in an barren ocean. At first I didn’t mind but now that I feel like I’m drifting I’m too scared to leave. She’s told me that she’ll kill herself if I leave a few times. It’s really stressing me out. I don’t know what to do. I want to help, I don’t want to hurt her, but the way she is is just, I can’t handle it on my own. A notable event I have to mention is I caught her flirting with some people over the internet. Not playful, it was sexually charged flirting ie: “Eheh~ don’t worry about it bubba❤️” this is an exact quote from her in response to someone liking their little roleplay hug or whatever. This almost ended our relationship but at the time I was still madly in love with her and not only was I too chicken shit to leave but that was when she threatened suicide. 

*The me problem*

Another problem I have is that over the course of this year I slowly realized that I’m a furry. Before you decide it’s hunting season and bring out your Remington let me explain. There is no sexual reason why I’m in the fandom. I simply enjoy the whole cartoony fantastical thing about it. And some of the Furries I’ve talked to are genuinely cool people and I feel like people are actually my friends for once. The problem comes into play with the fact my gf hates Furries. One of her ex’s was one and was a piece of shit to her. I think hiding this secret of mines can also jeopardize our relationship which I really do not want to do as the above stated indicates. The worst I’ve done behind her back was take a flirtatious compliment and left it at that ie: someone said I had a sexy voice in a public chat; I was talking normally. I don’t know how I can come forward with this. I know she won’t like the news. 

*wrap up*

If magically all her mental problems vanished I’d be significantly more inclined to stay. But it’s getting to the point where I just need an escape. I have my own issues to deal with, trying to juggle hers with it, fuck, you get the point. 

*my “ph test” going forward*

In order for me to get a true idea of how I feel about her I will be visiting her for 3 months starting in December. After that she’ll go to the military and I’ll be working on school. I’ve been feeling this way for a month or two FYI. What road I take will heavily depend on how I feel after those 3 months. I’m open for ideas about staying with her and also leaving her. Thank you all for reading this hectic shit and I look forward to your suggestions.",10Nov2020,1

499,"Over three months ago, I was in a tiny car accident. It wasn’t my fault and no one was hurt. It wasn’t very serious at all – me and the other driver can’t have been going more than 10mph at the time as it was in a car park. My car was written off, although it wasn’t badly damaged. The angle of the accident meant that we would’ve had to replace the entire door so it worked out more cost effective to buy a new car. 

The problem here is that I can’t drive the new car. I’m a very new driver, I only passed my test a year ago so I’m really not a confident driver as it is. People keep telling me it takes time to adapt to new cars but I’m too terrified to even get on the road to practice. I can’t find the biting point and the few times I have driven it, I’ve stalled at junctions which has just made me panic even more. I think I’ve realised that even if I drive perfectly, I’m still at risk because I can’t trust other drivers. Even as a passenger, I’m finding that I flinch when passing junctions. 

I haven’t even tried to drive the car in over a month and I find myself looking for excuses to walk or take public transport. I’m working from home at the moment so I don’t really need to drive, which is just giving me more of a reason to ignore the situation. But I don’t want to be scared anymore

I know very little about how to use photoshop, it is still very confusing to me.
Adobe animate is completely new to me, we didn't learn much on it, there were only tutorials that the instructor provided but since they weren't assignments so I didn't do them, only watched one of them. So I am panicking and very upset with myself for not knowing how to use these programs.

I currently work in BI. I’m pretty young in a team where my coworkers and everyone in the department is 15+ years older than me so I feel like the potential on this team is pretty high. 

But the thing is, I’ve always felt like I could do more. I don’t watch any medical shows bc i feel like “that could’ve been me.” I had much higher aspirations for myself. I’ve contacted nursing schools on and off since June of last year bc it’s a decision that frequently on my mind.

TW mental health, suicidal thoughts  


Last year I moved to another country to study. I got involved in a society, found great friends, and developed a life here. Earlier this year I got into a relationship with a person I love. I thought we'd spend our lives together but both our mental health was kinda going down and they broke up with me. This sent me down a self destructive spiral. I became suicidal, and could not do anything except cry and have panic attacks (this is still happening). At first, I had only fucked up with them, we still wanted to remain friends and it had the potential of working out and both of us being happy. But then things changed and I fucked it up for myself with everyone I know here.  


We were both on the society committee together, and this obviously complicated things a little bit. The other person was dealing okay, but I wasn't. My personality disorder made me a horrible ex, I was upset a lot and would sometimes message them even though we were broken up. One night I sent some messages to my ex partner. They were desperate and overall not an okay thing to send. I had planned to take my life after sending so I sent them without caring what would happen afterwards, but my cat basically saved my life so now I have to live with the consequences. As you can expect, this did not go down well. My ex partner quit the committee, and I was approached by the auditor and basically pushed to resign as well, being accused of harassment. All of my friends are in that society and I am certain that most of them dislike me now, because of how I have been (not) dealing with the loss of the relationship. I feel lost and lonely, and I have no idea how to get back from this. I have now lost all friends I have in this country and basically fucked up what I had going for me.   


What do I do? This friend group has friends all across campus and the city which I live in, so it will be very hard for me to find people that won't hear about how I fucked up sooner or later. I also don't think I am strong enough to stay here because I am bound to see all of them, including my ex, and left feeling even more lonely and isolated than I do now. I could move to a different county and study the same thing there, but it is pretty rural and I am scared that I could be discriminated against because I am queer. Technically, I could also go back home but then I'd have to give up my education, and that seems silly.   


I had found a home here in this country, but now I feel like I've lost it and I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any ideas or maybe just words of support?",10Nov2020,1

513,"A bit of backstory, I applied to several universities and got waitlisted for the one I wanted to go to. While waiting to see if I got accepted, I decided to put my energy into one of the other universities. I was pretty happy with this school and the community was a perfect fit for me. I instantly clicked, but this wasn't the university I had dreamed of going to. I got into the university  I was waitlisted for and decided to go there despite finding my place at another university. I dropped everything for my dream school.

I'm well into the first quarter of the academic year and I am unhappy with everything. I don't click with my peers and I don't feel a connection to this university. It might be because I am home and not on campus but with Covid19 it's not like I can go out there and mingle or meet up with people in clubs. I deeply regret choosing to go to this university over the other. I told myself to suck it up and see if the next academic year is different (hopefully no virus and maybe i'll get opportunities to meet people) but I don't know if I can wait that long. I constantly think of what it would be like to be a part of the other university. I have friends there, classes are smaller and that's what I'm used to, and it's also closer to home. I'm afraid I'll feel the same way even if I transfer. I don't want my feelings on and experience with Covid19 to influence my decision.

514,"I'm going to preface this with that I live in Europe, in a country that has had moderate to good control of covid.

I work in the restaurant industry, which leaves me being exposed to hundreds of people every day. I happen to live with my boyfriend, who works in an office and his exposure is a lot less. He is also high risk. Because of this I have chosen to wear a mask at work. The country I live in has not taken up wearing masks, it is moving towards being mandatory but I hope to paint the picture that no one wears masks. All of my coworkers ask why I choose to wear, all coming from a point of curiosity. All but one that is. One of the chefs asked me rather rudely why I would be wearing it and if I was sick and I responded that my boyfriend is high risk. I thought that was the end but about 5 minutes later he came back and started on about how it doesn't actually help me that it helps those around me from getting sick. As I was trying to explain that it still helps me a bit he leaned over and blew into my face and erupted into laughter. I half yelled half told him that it wasn't funny and to get away from me. I asked to speak privately to my manager about it and totally broke down crying, while my manager was helpful in the moment I don't know how seriously he took it. He later had the chef come in and apologize to me which truthfully I wasn't ready to be around the guy again. The apology basically came out to ""Sometimes I make very funny jokes and sometimes I make very bad jokes and this was a bad one"". He then tried to fist bump me. This was totally suitable for my manager as well. Where as I am of the opinion that if you blow in someone's face during a bloody pandemic, you can't gone back from that shit. I plan on quitting this job anyways but am waiting to see if the restaurants close down in a few weeks like we anticipate.

He’s friendly with my landlord (who acknowledges this guy is difficult) and texted him about my dog, who maybe barks once a week if I get a knock on the door (I’m talking one yelp). He also confronted me in the lift in a very rude way. 

Last week, he left me a 3 paragraph note about how me leaving my welly boots in the hall ruins the look of the floor and makes the hallway dirty. I clean the hall if I do spread dirt. Maybe not always immediately but the building also has a cleaner. I’ve not moved my boots. 

In the spirit of killing with kindness but also being a dick, I was considering leaving him a bottle of Vueve (because I’m classy) and a note that simply says: “I wish you joy in these trying times”.

This man is not working and leads a sad life if he’s worried about this shit. That should be enough but would love to push back because he clearly thinks he can tell me what to do.

I have no friends here but I had friends in the city so I'm quite lonely, despite having a great relationship with my family. My relationship of 2 years has been pretty awful for the last 5 months and I stress about it most days for at least an hour or 2. I used to sleep from 1am to 9am in college. Now at home, I can't sleep till 2 or 2.30am and my family wake me up at like 8.30am and I have no energy. I get really sleepy from 12-2 in the afternoon or for like an hour after eating dinner which never happened before.

We started talking in January. Ok, so here's where things get bad... I really love him. He has rules in place like no being around guys unless he's with me, I can't go out without him, No drugs (that's reasonable), No alcohol, I'm not allowed with anyone alone. So, we're really close and we had plans to have kids. Recently I was diagnosed with something so I'm getting surgery on my kidneys. Then I found out I may not be able to get pregnant. As if that's not stressful enough....... Last night he thought I was drinking so he texted me ""we're done"" this made my world shatter. I explained to him what really happened then he said he takes it back and he still wants to be with me and that he loves me. Then he was talking to my friend on MY phone so I saw the messages and he says ""Fine I'll stay with her cuz then I'll kill myself if I'm lonely"" and he has the AUDACITY to tell her I've cheated on him MULTIPLE times (I haven't but he has quite a few times) I really love him, but I like someone else too.

The upcoming semester is scaring the hell out of me, however. I have to complete Principles if Macroeconomics, and Business Calculus. I FUCKING SUCK AT MATH. I don’t know if can do it. I attempted the economics course this semester (online anytime, taking the class on my own), realized I had no clue what I was doing, and had to drop the course. I had planned on taking it in the spring semester, planning to visit class in person (assuming they would offer face to face courses with social distancing measures practiced, or attend a class in which the lecture was given online via zoom, so I could see what the professor is doing. To my dismay, neither of these methods of learning are offered for the upcoming semester. Imll have to take the courses online by myself again. How the fuck do I teach myself business calculus and macroeconomics??? I am hoping. They offer tutoring, but I don’t even know if we are going to be able to physically go to the school. I am so afraid that I will not be able to complete these courses and will forever be miserable in the blue collar life. I have considered switching degree plans to something that isn’t so mathematical, but I don’t know what other degree path would have the potential for a career position that CIS offers. I also don’t know what else I’d want to do, as working with software seems interesting and, dare I say, fun. So please, if anyone has any suggestions, please help.

532,"About 3 weeks ago, I started a new job as a Marketing Coordinator a mid-sized law firm. At the interview, they told me I’d be managing their social media, event planning, writing newsletters, running digital ad campaigns, and more. I was enthused about this because that’s exactly what I wanted to be doing and my background is in legal marketing. 

Come to find out AFTER I was hired, they have a marketing company they use to outsource all of that work- leaving me with essentially nothing to do. I’ve asked my boss if she needs help with anything and told her I’d do any work she needs, but she gives me vague responses and I’ve been assigned absolutely nothing. I’ve made some work for myself to do (reviewing their website for errors, brainstorming marketing ideas, etc.) but there’s only so much I can do without a little bit of direction. I’ve already requested a face to face meeting with her and she brushed off my concerns and said we’d “figure it out”. I’m currently sitting at my desk watching Netflix for 9 hours a day because I have no work to do whatsoever. I’m a hard worker and love being productive so this is driving me crazy. 

Any advice about what to do? Should I get a new job? Talk to my boss again?",10Nov2020,1
533,"Sorry for formatting, grammar and punctuation issues, I struggle to function as a human being. I’m also on mobile. And I’ve never actually made a post on here before other than a couple of pictures. 

Today I’m a flaily potato, I have spent the last four days moving everything around in my home, I switched rooms with my mother as it was myself, my partner and my 7month old in the small room, so we changed to the big room until we move house which we’re struggling to do due to the pandemic, after working for four days straight just on the bedrooms my mum informed me today that she wants to change back as she doesn’t have enough space.. My mum is a hoarder. We cannot fit three people into the small room as it’s only designed for ONE person. And even when it was just me by myself it was a tight fit. I’m tired and I’m stressed and I don’t know how to handle it, this is my mum’s house and I don’t want to be like “we’re NOT changing back, deal with it” because that just makes everything difficult.. How do I help my mum to understand that we need the larger room? Without her feeling attacked. We are on the housing list to move into a three bedroom place but it’s taking a while, so it would only be temporary anyway. I really don’t want to move everything back to the smaller room.. My back is hurting badly enough as it is. 

I feel bad because it is mum’s house and she should have the main room, there’s just no way I’ll be able to fit a full sized cot-bed in the small room, and my little one won’t fit in his Next-to-me forever.  

It took six hours to move my mum’s stuff from the big room to the garage, a further hour and a half to switch her bed into the little room and my bed into the larger room. It took the next three days putting clothes, my little one’s things and my PC in the larger room(mum no longer wanted it in the living room). I finally finished LAST night. And my mum told me this morning she’s probably going to want to swap back at the end of the month. I’m not angry, I understand it, I’m frustrated because she’s thinking more about what she wants than what her grandson needs? I don’t know if that makes sense..

When it was three of us in the small room, I had to climb over my partner to get out of bed because the bed had to be against the wall, it was a struggle to put my little one in his bed, and get him out again. We couldn’t get to the clothes because his bed was in the way. Now we have enough space to get him out of his bed, I can get out of my own side without waking my partner. We are making the most out of the space. When my mum had the room, she couldn’t move because she had so much stuff, she piled everything everywhere, including on her bed. She won’t be able to do that in the smaller room. I do feel it’s better for her to have to downsize on all the pointless things that she has, even if she just keeps it in the garage for now? 

I hope I’ve given enough information and I hope I don’t seem entitled for not wanting to change back to the other room. 

Thank you in advance for the help and advice.",10Nov2020,1
534,"Hi I’m a m22 and my gf is barely 21 we been together for almost 7 years we started dating in high school jr year so like 2014, well our relationship in high school wasn’t anything pretty or how people would call it teenage love, will since we dated until we graduated up to 2016 they’re was a lot of insecurity I had to deal with cause she was the first girl I ever had sex with so I always had this though that I wasn’t the only one because we started as friends with benefits but after 3 months or so of messing around but not having sex! We made it official, so I wasn’t really talking to anyone else but her (my first mistake cause I caught feelings) but she was taking to a few guys so respectfully at first I would tell her to stop talking to them of course she tell me no problem and boom problem solved right well no. Since we’ve been out of high school for almost 4 years now I still have those thoughts and I use to be the one always checking her phone and finding little things nothing crazy’s like I know she hooked up with someone but it’s just how nice she is that really freaks me out to completely trust her, I know I’m dragging but bare with me please I seriously and lost and don’t know what to do cause Today I had those “I can’t sleep” and I was on my phone when I heard her phone buzz but it was just a dumb app Notification but then that voice was telling me “go through it, go through it, go through it!” And like a idiot I did but this time I didn’t check Snapchat or Instagram cause she’s giving me all her passwords to show she wasn’t “bidding anything” look I’ll admit I was a player too so I know how the game works so I never truly believed what I saw on the phone cause you can always delete or edit or something to make it disappear but today I went on Facebook and I know she hasn’t been on the on forever I went to messages and went all the way down and boom messages from 2014 a lot of guys has always been talking to her :/ and I went through a few and wow did that fuckimg hurt there’s this on messages that hit me the most she was talking to one of her ex’s and I guess she was calling him “bae” which lead to him asking “don’t you have a bf?” and she responds with I do but “I’m just a little flirt” and that she’s flirting with one other guy. Besides that been a lie cause she was actually talking to at least 5......idk what to do man I gave her everything I moved out for a hole year to be with her and show her I loved her and even then there was a problem with a coworker of hers. It’s just like craaap man I’m completely losing  control of my life right now cause she was my life not I don’t know what I really have without her cause since high school it’s always been about her making her happy cause she was depressed in highscool and I guess that’s my second mistake for trying to fix someone that was broken now I’m left alone to fix mine which is better since I see the aftermath of helping people. I just need a point to the right direction and direction idc just need to hear something I need a plan of some short.

535,"Don't get me wrong this is all completely my fault and I know everything im doing wrong but it in no way means I know what to do right. 

I guess it starts with the passing of my uncle the poor guy was a good man who suffered and taught me a lot. Its a been a few months since then but I think while it may have started my snowball its no longer the engine behind my own suffering.

I'm pretty sure as idiotic as it sounds I may have a very real addiction to video games. The W.H.O. does consider it a mental health issue but only when it stops you from eating, sleeping, or interferes with school and work.

...Its not uncommon for me to show up to school staying up through the midnight hours.

I eat very little I've been doing good eating a tiny bit more and getting some sleep but its no where near the root of my problem, only what's stemmed from it.

It also doesn't help I have the attention span of a goldfish and very severe ADHD. Guys it takes me probably 2 hours to get a 10 minute assignment done.

I think I may have very Chronic Depression.

Adderall was probably going to be my vice of choice but then i started experiencing horrible mood swings that highlighted my depression.

I hate to even write it much less say it, because then it becomes real. I just may have realized I've been struggling for a long time and not really known much else. 

To help you understand how bad it is I live in the u.s. and if you know anything about how their grading system is well... I have straight F's. 

Please I think this is a good first step but it still takes a strong person to ask for help, and while I'm not entirely there yet I guess i can do it anonymously. 

No one in my life knows anything about it my own parents don't even know about my grades not because they're bad parents but because I betrayed their trust that I would at least be somewhat decent enough to carry my own weight

So I'm here to asking if you know of any ways of discreetly getting help and if your kind enough to arm me with the wisdom to fight my inner demons...",10Nov2020,1
536,"Well, it has always been. When I was little I lived with her and my grandparents. She behaved like a child always fighting with them. I remember thinking of her as my sister, not my mother. She taught me to hate my family, to see them as my enemies and always promised me that one day we will move out from that house. When I was 11 she got a nice job and we did move out so things got more peaceful for me but I felt really alone and frustrated because I felt like her mother, always listening to her complaining about her coworkers and money or asking for advice. I understood that she was tired because of work so I didn't say anything and just tried to be a good kid, getting good grades, being nice and shit. At 14 years old things started to get uglier. I got really depressed, stopping going to school, stopped eating and oversleeping. I noticed that I wasn't going to get better by my own so asked my mother to take me to a psychiatrist. She did, but then said that she was wasting money, that I just need to get closer to God. I got worse.

A year later we moved out again, I finally started a steady psychological treatment and changed to a school that I went for like a month then started missing again. I was really messed up at the time, I selfharmed and tried to kill myself a couple of times. I was constantly trying to get her to support me, to make her make me feel a little better. I used to go to her room when feeling really anxious and talk to her about how I was feeling. But her responses were always sympathetic, like ""When I was your age I went through worse"" ""Have you watched porn?, the internet bad spirits can posses you"" ""Pray to god, he will help you"" She was making me feel worse so I marked my distance and I have to admit I treated her badly. I resented her and separated from her the more I could. I do not regret this, it was the best for me at that moment. A lot happened to me those years, went through a lot of therapy, pills, struggles, emotions. I fought to get better, to decide to live and have goals.Â

On February I started seeing a guy, he helped me a lot to have some direction. However, I didn't know I wasn't prepared for a relationship. I felt a lot of toxic emotions but I didnt let them influence my behavior. I wrote down all those feelings on a diary. On June my mother reads that diary and opens the doors to hell. The things that were written there would scare any mother. Even more a religious and conservative one. It was mostly sexual and hormone induced thoughts of a teenager. She sued the man I was seeing and other guy for rape and sexual assault even though I told her it wasn't the case. She also forbade me from talking to the guy. I asked her If she had read my diary and she denied it. The guy was aware of all this situation but decided to keep in touch. By this time my relationship with him had changed a lot, it was healthy and we were more like supportive friends. My hormones had had cooled down haha. It was really nice, we were focused on growing together, we made some dreamy and childish plans for the future and we took Russian lesson together.

On August she found out and my relationship with her got even shittier. There were huge discussions. She called me slut, demon, stupid, insane. Took my phone, insulted the guy, went through my photos, read my private conversations with him and my friends, sent my psychiatrical records to the jury to stop me from denying that I was abused by him. Hell, she even put my whole family on the mix and they together threatened to kill him. I felt so sorry for him, he absolutely didn't deserve all that. I decided to help him by recording my family talking about how they would murder him and sent the video to him so he can sue them back. I regretted it. What would happen if they found out of my betrayal on the trial? I still depend on that family. I asked the guy no tot to sue them and he, even frustrated from all this shit, understood my petition and didn't sue. He told me to go live with him, but I refused. It didn't matter how hellish the situation was, I know that moving out with him wasn't a wise decision. Anyway I told my mother what I did. She took it rather well at first, but then brought it up on future discussions.Â

The situation escalated. I stopped talking to the guy and was forced to left my Russian lessons. The fights that we had by this time were mostly about how she is determined to change my liberal mind. (Im a atheist, bisexual and feminist)Â

she says that she has made a lot of mistakes as a mother, she regrets leaving me alone and not paying a nanny to stick with me when she went out to work. However, she says God has now opened her eyes and that she knows that I must be disciplined and punished. My cellphone is now monitored by a police friend she has (she is a lawyer). I must give her my phone and laptop everyday at 1:00 am. I can't leave my house, just for going grocery shopping. I can't communicate to anyone that she doesn't know. My instagram art accounts are closed because she considers my art pornographic and satanica.

Two months ago I planned to teach English. She researched my student, discovered that was a man older than me and accused him of being a p that masturbates while watching me throgh the camera. I tried to get some sense into her, I got her to accept a day of trial with the session recorded to see if he was actually a dangerous person. I made the class, my student payed and all. A minute before the session was supposed to start, my uncle comes into my room telling me that I must not. She had told him to do so. Ugh!!!!! I got so mad. Al least they payed me that class.

A month ago we started seeing a therapist. I don't feel like it has helped.

A week ago I was going to a dermatologist and asked her to not be present on the appointment. I was called a slut. The day after I pretended to be asleep so I could keep reading a really nice book on my phone, at 1 am she was at my bedroom asking for it, I didn't move nor say anything, so she looked for it even under the pillow where I was laying my head. I called her sick and I was called the devil itself. Jesus, its all just too toxic.

Yesterday his police friend called her, notifying her that I had published a photo of me on my bra on my social media. She accused me of prostitution and called me an attention seeker.

Today she accused me of talking to the guy, took my laptop and slapped me.

Shit, there are more horrible things. Sometimes she throws holy water at me, says that I don't feel like her daughter anymore, that I must leave the house, that I must change, that I must beg for forgiveness to god in order to get rid of the demons that I have summoned( when she took my diary she read some Charles Baudeliere poems that mentioned Satan, so now she is convinced that I am a satanist). I have heard her talking about me to her friends. Saying that i don't love myself, that I sleep with any man. She says that my friends are bitches and forbade me from seeing my gay friend.

but, somedays she tells me she does everything she does because she loves me. That she would die for me. I don't believe that kind of love is healthy for me.

I have tried to fix my relationship with her. I can't!! I reallycant! I give up! I have tried to be mature, to not let her make me mad, to understand her. And I do!! I understand that for her it can be difficult to have a daughter like me. She comes from an absurdly conservative family and can't comprehend my actions. But some things just cross the limit. I feel chained to her, like a dog. God! she has even told me to be obedient and submissive because I am an extension of her, to stop being a wild wolf. Well, this have just helped me to reassure myself, so its not that bad.

I could go to my grandparents, but if I go, she will go with me. My uncle is another option, but im not sure. Another problem are my studies. I don't want to depend on her, I don't trust her.

Please, these days I have just cried. She stopped paying the psychologist that helped me get better when I was depressed and can't talk to my friends without her listening and judging. now I am all alone. With her, I can't even show a little of vulnerability otherwise I will be treated as incapable and crazy. I don't know what to do. Im lost and exhausted.

any advice is very much appreciated. thank you in advance",10Nov2020,1

I also had a group project, good. the first week I checked my notifications everyday but I didn't hear anything. Then suddenly they made a chat which I now saw 2 days later. I thought it wasn't too bad cause we still have time till next week. But, they've sent a mail to the teacher (because I didn't answer) which was yesterday evening. I apologized and said I just can't check my sm everyday but now they think I'm mad + they said they finished the story already. I feel like it's such a dumb excuse now to say this to the teacher. They will probably think I'm to lazy or something. Now I'm just overthinking everything about what i should do next, say next etc ..

544,"Hello everyone, I’ll try to keep it short. My sister in law works for a retirement home and is subject to strict COVID screening. Every time she had a test she was required to tell everyone it’s pending. After several months of her being negative we took the notifications a little lighter as it progressed, but the severity was still there.

She came over Saturday night for a couple hours to catch up with my wife and discuss holiday plans. Everything went as normal. Sunday afternoon she texts us and says she’s positive for COVID-19 and that we need to quarantine.

I called my boss and explained what happened. When I said I need to quarantine he asked if I had symptoms, which I replied with a No. He said he expects me at work Monday.

I worked yesterday and today, albeit with a mask and in an area where I’m not near anyone. (Just him and I usually throughout the day, but there are technicians I see for 30m every morning too) Reading up on all our guidelines IN THE OFFICE, if you’ve been exposed to the virus you are directed to not come into work.

If I leave and quarantine I’ll probably get fired. If I don’t I run the risk of spreading it. I haven’t been tested yet so I don’t know if I’m a carrier.

What do I do? Is there anything about if an employer directs you to work after exposure?",10Nov2020,1
545,"I am working on Chinese-inspired art. I am Chinese American myself, but I don't want to reveal my identity. Instead of giving you the usual BS about keeping the art separate from the artist, I will just say that I am mostly concerned about privacy. Anyways, this insistence on pseudonymity may cause some to believe that I am a white ""colonizer"" engaging in cultural appropriation, and I wanted to know how to deflect such accusations without showing a photo of my face or my DNA test results.

Here are some possible routes:

- Fight back by insulting the accusers and telling them to F off. It might get them off my backs the most easily, but bears the side effect of my work being associated with the right wing, and alienating liberals. The liberals that I alienate may include potential collaborators. I want my art not to take a side, and appeal to as many as possible.

- Fight back more softly by arguing why it's not cultural appropriation, why the concept of appropriation is groundless, etc. I am not sure how much it would help, in particular if the accusers have a vested interest in taking me down.

- Ignore completely. Pretend none of the controversy is taking place, refrain from responding to complaining posts on social media and silently delete them after a while, etc. I could see this work in a small scale, but if I make it big and start to work with collaborators, then it may be more of an issue that I can't ignore away. For this strategy, I may have to stick to Instagram and Facebook and forgo Twitter.

- Apologize but continue to make art as if the controversy did not happen. This may have a similar effect to ignoring completely, or it might put me into a deeper hole by giving the mob more power.

Any other ideas?",10Nov2020,1

551,"I started working at a company around a month ago and it was great. I was on the path to building my career and working my dream job.
Everything was well and good until two weeks into my internship.

Maybe it was impeccable timing or maybe our boss saw potential in me, perhaps both, but I was given a job (probation with pay) at a new department that the company started up.  I moved in with my current team members into a new office, plus because I am the one who reports directly to the boss, whenever I or my team are in need of anything (like resources and the like) we don't have to wait for the long process of obtaining it.

That's when things got messy. While not everyone is problematic, the majority are. There are individuals from other departments who rats on me  to our boss for the silliest things while  they do the same things 
themselves. Like for example snacking at your desk. I feel like I'm being micro managed by seniors.  Once I was shouted at for double checking something for a project. It was humiliating. There are people scrutinising my every move waiting for me to do something wrong. 

It was bearable at first as my team mates and I get along really well until recently. Because I report directly to our boss any mishaps are my responsibility. I try my best to always be polite and professional yet there was one urgent incident where I had to push to make sure the job gets done well.  It was for an important client of ours and my team mate didn't like it that I told her (respectfully) to try out my method of solving the problem we had. 

My team mates are giving me the cold shoulder ever since. There have been times whereby I've heard stuff said about me when they thought I wasn't around. 

I self reflected for days trying to figure out if I've done any thing wrong or rubbed someone the wrong way but I came up short. I always make an effort to be considerate, polite and helpful to people. I work overtime unpayed to make sure our team always have no problems. 

I try my best to not take anything personally but its gotten to a point where I feel extremely isolated and I fear my job will be jeopardised. What do I do?",10Nov2020,1

He has always been controlling and aggressive. Everyone knew/knows this. When she broke up with her bf, it's like I met her for the first time. She seemed so happy and confident and was an inspiration for me. I didn't handle my break up nearly as well.



The last time I saw her, she looked depressed again. The hangout was with me, my bf, her and her bf and some friends. Her bf seemed like he was doing better, except at one point during the night he went absolutely berserker because he dropped a bottle of beer and started punching shit.



A friend of ours is visiting now. He says that yesterday, he passed on regards from a mutual gay friend of me and the girl, and her bf went nuts and strangled her (he hates gays).


Other people have been booted from her life again. Friends that expressed concerns when she started posting stuff on FB that didn't sound like she wrote them. I suspect that I have a bit more leverage here because my bf and her bf are friends. Still, he dowsn't allow her to hang out with me alone because he believes that his friends' girlfriends are ""his people"" and that she shpuldn't be ""sneaking around"" with them.


I have no idea what I can do. Her and I talked extensively for hours about her relaionship and how free she felt after the break up. I feel sick to my stomach about this situation. I dare not approach her because I worry that if I ask her if she's okay, he qill freak out on her again.

I’ve been completely avoiding the sun to make sure it doesn’t get darker and I always use filters/edits to make my skin much paler when I take pictures/selfies.

The racist comments always linger in my mind and keep making me feel disgusted about myself. Sometimes I’m just sitting there and looking at my dark hands and I feel horrible. I keep wishing to be even paler.

564,"Hello, I am asking for others opinions/advice on my situation. 
I am 21 and set to graduate college spring 2022. So far but so close. Through college I have worked at a minimum wage job and I live at home with the parents while driving a 2006 Altima. However, I do have another source of income and that is through Reselling/Flipping.

To break it down, I use programs to buy these shoes. 
Programs:16.5k current after market value.
 (4 programs)

Non appreciating shoes: 4k
Valuable shoes: 2.5k

So if I flipped a switch and “retired from shoes reselling with bots.” The 20k range isn’t too far off. 
Blessed to not have to pay for college. And live with my parents.  No debt. 


Posting this because last shoe release was the biggest but also the worst release of the year. Makes me think of selling everything. 

I don’t know what to do. If anything. I didn’t have a thought to sell my stuff just yet, mainly due to no need for the money. I realize that sounds bad but it’s true. The thought of  owning my dream car crossed my mine which would be half my yearly income (once I get a job with my degree) but not till 2022 best case scenario. The car would be paid off. No note. I never had a goal with this whole resell thing till the summer. Jokingly buy a 2015 Infinity q50 I thought. Yes i am aware that vehicles are what keep people broke due to payments that chain them down. I honestly feel guilty about it all. It’s not like I worked hours and hours saving up. It’s kind of dumb luck with some of it. 

Parents are aware and are pretty supportive. Shoes average $200 and they can see 10+ boxes in my room. 

 the programs are volatile and can drop or rise depending on how they preform. Shoes won’t move downward.

I recently saw him out with his friend, and I was so shaken. Seeing him made me realise I still had feelings for him. I didn’t realise he was back in town, and he didn’t even let me know, which kinda sucked. I decided to message him the next day saying that I missed talking to him, and I asked how he was.

He said he’d been super busy, and talked about uni - but he didn’t say he missed me too, or tell me he was in town. I’m just feeling like things aren’t the same, am I overthinking this?

566,"I need help. I’ll try and be as brief as possible. I am a sophomore in college and I’m doing super bad in school, like in two of my five classes I’m getting a D in. All of my classes are online and I can hardly find any motivation or have the attention span to work on my classes. I keep missing deadline after deadline and just overall never understand what is going on. The help labs are closed due to the pandemic, I have ADHD, and I also can’t seem to keep a calendar. I am so frustrated with myself that I have been gaining weight, missing my periods, losing hair, feeling not well and such for the past couple of months.

The university offers a counseling service and I see a therapist once every week, well apparently we can only have 7 appointments a year and I am on my last one. My therapist helps me a lot, I love having someone unbiased to my life to vent to. However, this last appointment he really upset me by cutting me off and saying something kind of rude and laughing at me. So that made me very upset as he is one of the only people I feel I am close enough to talk to in my life right now.

I also am always having an issue with my parents, they are paying for the first two years of my school and are not nice about it. I understand how amazing it is to have them do that and I am so thankful, but they always tell me how I’m not and how I need to be better constantly and compare me to other people and it really hurts. They also feel as if they own me, like I have to do things for them, tell them what I’m doing, they won’t let me get a job, super strict, etc. they are really hard to deal with and make me cry most times I talk to them on the phone. I asked if I could take some time off from school until it was in person because it honestly helps me so much to see a teacher and have to physically go somewhere.

I am so tired of feeling this way, I feel like there is no way out. I have a boyfriend and he is honestly the best thing in my life he’s really supportive and always there for me b it i an elk sometimes he gets annoyed with how I’m upset all the time. I stress a lot about him being annoyed with me and I feel bad because I’m not always a sad stressed person I used to be so carefree and down to earth and happy. Now I’m just stressed and disappointing my parents. I also have very few friends and I am not even very close with them at all. Even when I hang out with them I just feel sad because it’s not fun anymore and I just want to sleep or know I have something to do for school. I just want all of this to be over.

Some background information, my parents are business owners of a restaurant, I have been 'working' at the restaurant since I was 11. At 14 years old I was told to find a part-time job so that I'll be useful to the family. (Even with the part-time job, I am still expected to work at their restaurant whenever they told me to). At 16 I was handling their business accounts. So I have been juggling school, a $7/h part-time job and also my 'job' at my parents' place since I was 14.

I have been paying for my expenses since I was 14. All my parents have to pay for is the house, utilities and my heavily subsidised school fees which they always 'forgot' to pay for despite multiple reminders causing me to be almost kicked out from school a few times.

I have come to realise that they would always guilt-trip and manipulate me to feel bad about everything, from my body, grades, face and especially when I can't work for them due to other commitments may it be my paying job or school. They always said that I have to repay them for raising me and bringing me into this world.

Right now I am the one that has classes, 2 jobs, cooks food and cleans the house and buy the weekly groceries using my savings just for two 50 year old to complain why I did not buy the expensive butter that they like to eat. Whereas they can choose whether or not they feel like working today.

When I told my mother that I wanted to enter a program related to arts the performing arts strand in high school, she disagreed with me and told me to enter the science-centric academic strand. I'm from one of  those countries where accountants, engineers, and doctors are the only respectable profession in your parent's eyes type. So I understood and I gave up everything and focused on my studies.

I didn't start rebelling until senior years, If you can call it that HA. The most daring shit I did was coming  home at 9 in the evening. 

Now I'm in 1st year college, I have a crippling addiction to reading books(probably a side effect of isolation and escapism, I only had books as companions for most of my childhood life, I wasn't really allowed outside without supervision), so I wanted to be either a librarian or a psychologist. But my mom wanted me to be an accountant but didn't allow me to take accountancy-business related strand because the school was too far away so right now I'm taking these shitty classes that's making me miserable.

At first I was ok with it, but I can't take it anymore. It's not helping that the teacher assumes we all had background on the topic. Everyone is running and I'm barely scraping by crawling through the shitty education, prof's not even doing class proper and only checks the activities being given. I tried studying, not that it helped.

I have never really been bent on becoming a civilian pilot but over Covid quarantine I've looked into many different career paths and something that looks really cool is being a military pilot, whether it's fighter jets or boeing's I don't care because what's more fun then flying a plane right? 


But obviously the path to get there is extremely difficult and I would have to do ROTC and college at the same time since it seems to be the optimal path to take. Although I don't know if I really am dedicated to it or I just like the idea because I wouldn't be sitting in an office all day. 


My other option would to probably work for the UN or do something where I can travel, related to business somewhat since that's what I'm interested in. There have been some careers that stick out to me but it's not like I have a burning desire to dedicate 30 years of my life to some company. And not to mention my military career can hit a sudden stop if I have a medical condition that DQ's me even if it is the slightest thing. 


My train of thought has been to do the military route because the civilian world will still be there when I get out also I don't want to regret chosing the safe 9-5 job ten years down the road when it's too late and I hate my job.

After my interview, Jake asked how it went and he said Mark approached him again to see if Jake is interested, just the day before my interview. 

Just to give background, Jake works in completely different department and don't have the experience &amp;  knowledge that our dept requires. I happen to have.

This year, I’ve given them both money to buy a computer, a controller, a cpu for both , a gpu for both, two monitors for each brother, a second computer for each brother, a elgato card for both brothers and money for donations. I’ve given one money for another monitor and multiple controllers because he breaks his. I’ve had to buy second gpu and graphic cards for their second gaming computers. I feel bad because I’ve told them I’m low on money and the older brother,  when he breaks things he sends me a picture of himself crying and sad on Snapchat. In total I’ve probably send them over 17,000 dollars combined. 

My friend hurt me because he sent me picture again being sad that he needs a gaming chair because his neck and back hurt. I asked him how much is it, and he said 400. I told him I’m low on money before because I am. I gave him the 400 because I didn’t want my friend to be in pain and sad. Today his little brother tells me his second monitor broke. I sent his little brother 300 dollars for a new monitor. Today the older brother tells me he bought his little brother a new monitor but not to tell him because it is a surprise. I’m not mad. I’m just really hurt. I’m hurt because I gave him money for one thing and it was because I thought he was hurt. I don’t know what to do. The younger brother doesn’t know that his older brother bought him a monitor, nor that I gave his older brother money for a chair. And the other brother doesn’t know I gave the younger brother money for a monitor earlier in the day. There isn’t a way that I can get a refund btw.",10Nov2020,1

580,"I’ve had this friend for about a year. Long story short her parents are separated, mums a drug addict and dads an alcoholic. There’s always been conflict and abuse in her home and she finally got out. Now she’s staying with me. I’ve told her to stay as long as she needs, given her her own space (it’s my office but it works). She’s got a bit of clothing and a toothbrush with her. 

I’m asking for any advice you guys may have for making her feel comfortable and safe here. I’d also like to make her a care package of comfort things so what would you include in that?

TLDR: how do I make my traumatised guest feel safe/comfortable in my home?

581,"Today i had a delivery of some items from amazon with my name and address on. The items are A bike helmet, A video shooting pen, A waterproof digital camera, and a box of teeth whitening stuff. I asked my brother, my girlfriend, my parents know nothing about it, i don't really have many friends and even the ones i do i know wouldn't do this kind of thing. The weird thing is i recently got my bike fixed, and have used it without a helmet and recently got into photography (already have a camera and lenses). I know i have no way of tracking where they came from as its all through amazon and the only information is the sellers, not the person who ordered them. Any help would be greatly appreciated, i'm extremely confused by this.

582,"Hello everyone. Yes I know there is a pandemic going on. I'm 20,  live in Italy and my boyfriend, 23, in the UK. Let me just start by saying, he is my person. He understand me, he listens and he is there for me. We are the same, but yet different.  I'm not going through the best of times mentally... I don't know how to say this, but my house isn't the most healthiest of places for me and neither is Italy tbh. I don't get abused physically, but mentally. I told my boyfriend how I have been having suicidal thoughts and he suggested me going to visit him and obviously my anxiety told me it's not a good idea, but the more I think about it.. it would help me so much. I've always had a fear of the unknown and I think doing this ( dropping everything and just going an adventure has always been on my bucket list) would bring me out of my comfort zone, which I think would be a major positive for me, also I really want to be with the person I love. I have online lessons, so I can still study while I'm over there. I'm planning to leave a letter so they don't think I got kidnapped or w/e. I don't want pity, I just want advice. I'm scared but I know its going to be worth it. Oh and its a 2 1/2 week trip, I'm not moving over.",10Nov2020,1

586,"So yesterday I woke up to find this girl who loves attention seeking posting about a false accusation. It seemed fishy to me because  she had had a crush on him for a long time and had been rejected a ton of times. Now that a trend of posting about the four letter word has started, she suddenly posts about it.This types of posts get a ton of likes . I remained neutral since I had notl solid evidence. 

On her first post she claimed that it was in 2013, but my friend was 10 at the time.Then she made the year 2015 , he was in boarding school for his final exam. She changed it to 2018 and a lot of people believe her. I think I have some solid evidence that it is not him. I checked the date she mentioned and I checked discord and we were messaging each other all day.I also scrolled through his achievements in a game we normally play and found that he was playing the game all day to get those achievements.

This combined with their history , his character and the evidence that we were on a call all day playing games makes me feel think she is a liar. I asked my friends if we should all post this exposing her for lying.Some say we should but others say we should get it from her admitting she is lying. They are thinking of looking at some legal documents and drafting one from a made up law firm suing for defamation of character unless she admits publicly that she is lying. 

The thing is this might backfire if she is smart enough to search up the law firm and this might be used against our friend. All this is likely to die down anyway. I am wondering if I would be the asshole for exposing her because her mom died and  if this comes out he will probably loose his job because he supported his daughter and they both falsely accused my friend. If he loses his job he will not be able to support his other kids. If this comes out the likelihood of her getting into college in our country is low. I am also worried that this will horribly backfire and hurt my friends and I. I am just wondering if I would be in the right if I exposed the girl. She probably just wants attention she is not given at home and I do not want to ruin her life.Please help.",10Nov2020,1
587,"Take this as a hypothetical situation. 
You're engaged to someone you truly believe to be the love of your life. It hasn't been that long since you guys got together officially, but when you know you know right? You can be yourselves with one another and you get along like you've never gotten along with someone before. You like a lot of the same things, but you can agree to disagree on certain topics.
You guys have even gone and gotten your marriage license as well to go get it officiated, you're just looking for someone to do it. Your kids are excited, they like him and they can't wait to finally ""have a daddy"" and be adopted. Not to mention you guys are constantly getting down like rabbits, and you aren't necessarily not trying to get pregnant. 
Well, you end up getting pregnant. Everything seems great. You guys are happy about the pregnancy and making plans for the future with the baby and more kids. This is the first pregnancy you're actually able to be excited for since your first was so traumatic and full of drama. Some people chime in and ask if this is really what we want, and we're like of course, we have no doubts, we love each other. 
He starts talking to his ex more often, claims it's to talk about God, the kids, and advice about pets. They were really good friends even before and after breaking up, they just lost touch.. You sit there feeling fine with it at first, exes can be friends right? He starts going to visit the kids on Saturdays. 
Its just for the kids. It's not for her. You understand the kind of impact it can have on children of having someone around for a while and then having it ripped away from you all of a sudden, you think about it in instances with your children, and think nothing of it. In fact you respect it, there's at least one person you wish would have stayed involved with your kids even after everything, and they didn't. 
A few weeks go by and things are starting to get really weird, your gut is telling you to be uncomfortable with him talking to his ex, so you bring up things he could do to help you feel better about it, like meeting her, and he comes up with an excuse about it. Stops holding you in bed as much. Doesn't talk to you as much, even in person. Struggles to spend any quality time with you without huffing and puffing. He just seems annoyed by you, you ask him if he's mad and he says no, but the affection begins to dwindle. He mentions holding off on getting married, internally you're freaking out, but he swears it's just so you can reap the benefits of not having too much income for WIC and medical insurance and such. You count it on your anxiety and believe him. 
He ends up spending the night at his exes house, claiming it's for the kids, and refuses to text you back and your calls won't go through. You figured that was something you guys would talk about since you communicate about everything, and you figure he has respect for you to do that, and considering how everything had been you figure he would come home instead. Even if service was low, the phone would ring a couple times to try and find the phone... his phone was on DND or it was off. You panic, and freak out you tell him you need to talk. He freaks out on you in the morning saying he's not a child and doesn't need to ask for permission to do things, and claims the service is bad and goes away with a blow of the wind. Says you really think because of how things are going that he's going to do something stupid? Says he didn't even get your call, shows you his call log. But you see her name in his call log multiple times. 
He starts ""foreshadowing"" what would happen if you guys broke up, that you didn't know each other that long and you're jumping in too soon, starts saying your arguing with him all the time when you're just trying to communicate because you always could before, he starts telling you you're just being negative when you're struggling with your mental health as opposed to being supportive and understanding like he use to be, keeps trying to tell you you need to tell him what he can do to help so he can fix it but when you do it falls on deaf ears. All of these topics he foreshadows with are things friends have brought up before and he mentioned he was happy and had no doubts. 
He starts being more mean to you, you think it's just stress, he's got a lot on his mind and a lot of things going on in his life with his family. You try to give him some space and be understanding. You have to start asking for kisses before bed and before he leaves for work. He becomes distant and you catch him almost obsessively checking his phone to see if he's gotten a text message from someone. He stops calling you babe. He changes his password on his phone and when you bring it up he claims he ""needed a change."" You've never gone through his phone once, you trusted him and didn't feel you needed to... You have to start asking for his touch. To be held. He's reluctant to say I love you. Abundance of sex, turns to less sex because he's ""not in the mood,"" and then no sex. You guys have a date night and watch a few movies together. Once the movies over, he says goodnight and turns over. You again have to ask for a kiss... he reluctantly does. 
The next day you go to the urgent care for a sore throat and get told you're contagious with strep throat, he claims you need to stay away from him so he doesn't get sick because of work. Refuses to kiss you. Refuses to hold you in bed at night and insists on sleeping on the couch. He's going somewhere for work and won't be back until Tuesday, so you just figure maybe that time away will help things, and Tuesday you guys can snuggle up and talk. Monday you drive home to see family and stay the night. Monday all day he barely talks to you, doesn't really text you back and when you try and talk to him on the phone he's barely there. He won't say love you. He won't even say goodnight. 
Tuesday morning at 5am you get a text message that he doesn't know how else to say this, but he doesn't think he's ready for a relationship right now, he has things he needs to work on, claims there's no one else, claims he doesn't hate you and that he still wants to be here for you, but he just can't do a relationship... You're hurt and trying to reason with him but he refuses to take it. 
You drive home for work and try to take a nap. You put your engagement ring away and stare at the marriage license. You curl up in bed and just want to disappear. You go to work and can hardly do your job. You come home from work at 12:30.... and he isn't even there. You know where he is. You go to bed and cry yourself to sleep. 
You go to work the next day, and come home and he still isn't there... you know exactly where he is. You go to bed and cry yourself to sleep again. Most interaction you have in this time is maybe a few phone calls. 
He comes home Thursday afternoon because his paycheck comes in the mail still. But he didn't even work that day. He was at her house the whole day, while the kids are in school. You see him for 5 minutes because you're working, and he brings you Gatorade and food at work. You get home, he's home sleeping for work... you go to bed... he goes to work the next day and doesn't even come home. He's gone all weekend, and then again basically all week except for Thursday. If he's not working he's over at the exes house. He claims it's because you keep pissing him off. You reach out to his friends for advice,  and he gets pissed off because it's ""none of their business."" He's gone again all weekend. You beg him to go to the trailer and take care of your cats during the week so you can get out of the trailer. He agrees. You get a text one day when you're out of town ""Can I call you babe?"" You know that text message isn't for you, but you're like uh, yeah, you can call me. He clearly panics,  and quickly excuses it at autocorrect and his phone being laggy. Thing is, autocorrect and predictive text work together. He hasn't called you babe in months so if nothing was going on with anyone else, babe wouldn't have been an option his phone thought of. And you guys also aren't on a basis where he would have to ask to call you. You stay home with family as long as you can to give him space and also provide some space for yourself.
He still swears nothing is going on. Still says he still wants to be here for you, because you remind him that out here you have no one but him and he reiterates he'll be there for you. But he has left you abandoned, treats you even worse than he did before he left, especially when he's at her house, and constantly sits there and makes you feel like you're doing something wrong when you know you're not. You figure since you're pregnant he would still be there for at least that, but can't even count on him to be there. The one night he accidentally locked you out of his trailer and when you got a hold of him he told you to crawl through the window. You almost drive two hours home just to find some place warm to sleep. It's freezing and snowing. You had to jam the window open to be able to fit because the pins were on to keep it from opening a certain amount. You get in and unlock the door. He texts you saying he was on his way and didn't know why the pins were out on the window because he kept it open in case he needed to crawl through because he locked himself out. Texted him and tried to call him to not bother coming, to go back to bed. You would have messaged him on Facebook because you know he has wifi but he blocked you because you ""pissed him off"". He said he didn't get your texts. Comes back home and covers you with a fifth blanket to keep you warm in his uninsulated and unheated trailer. The electric isn't on because he ran the heat so much the year prior he ran the bill up over $2000. Not to mention the place didn't have any facilities, you had to drive to the gas station to use the restroom or Dollar General, and you had to drive at least 20 minutes to a truck stop for a shower. 
He says he wants to maintain a friendship for the baby, but can't even treat you like a friend. Says ""we're not together, so I don't owe you anything"" when you ask him to at least treat you like a human being. Sarcastically says ""you want me to say I'm with her even though I'm not?"" And ""didn't you know? I'm living with her."" Has been keeping all of the baby stuff he purchases at her place. Panics about the possibility of HPV after you get a papsmear result back showing abnormal cells and get told you need a colposcopy which is a procedure to check for HPV, cancer cells, and pre-cancerous cells. Claims he's only worried about the HPV because it's an STD, you ask him even if it was that, wouldn't it just be the two of you and he says yes. His tone is off... you don't believe him. He asks if you're still on about something going on with the ex, you tell him you have no idea what he's doing. Texts you out of the blue one day saying hey, I know we're living together but I just wanted to say that I don't want to have mixed signals or give you false hope about us getting back together so i want you to know I don't want to have sex with you, because that's not what I'm focused on right now. Just trying to focus on stuff for the baby. Starts wearing a men's ring on his left hand that he claims is his mother's. Actually tells you to ask, so you try, but she's just moved and is known to be difficult to get a hold of.
Tells you he might get a house closer to the ex even though when you had said you were looking for a place in that area he said it would be too far to drive to work. Claims he wants to be closer to the ex-fiances kids (notice how it's not closer to his actual blood related kids). Starts going to church with them after saying it was a family thing, says the kids and even her are family after always saying before he never went over there for her. 
At this point he has no time left in his itinerary for you. He's too busy spending time with kids that aren't his and people that aren't even blood, or carrying his baby, to even realize that how he's making you feel is stressing you out, which in turn stresses out the baby. You once again feel like you're going through this pregnancy alone like you did the first time 7 years ago. You're once again feeling abandoned like you did the first time 7 years ago. You once again feel you have no support from the one person you feel you should be able to receive support from, just like you did the first time 7 years ago.  You tell him you feel abandoned and replaced by the ex and her kids and he tells you that you've been in his life a lot shorter of a time than they had been. 
You can tell he's being manipulated, but don't know how to bring it up because you know he won't listen. Your thought is to just leave on one of the days he's working and leave him a note. You want so badly to be there for him, but you really can't do this alone anymore. You slowly realize just how in love he is with the idea of being back with his ex-fiance, you realize you just need to let go. You need support and love, not aggression and spite. You need somewhere you don't feel abandoned. Replaced at the sign of a warmer home for winter.
What would you do? Is he lying or do you have to trust he's telling the truth? Leave him a note and go no contact unless it's about the baby?",10Nov2020,1
588,"hi! i (15f) refused to go to school the other day because i am being bullied by my ‘best friend’. i explained everything to my mom and dad and they have spoken to the school about it and i had a meeting today. the school want me to go back and have said about putting different things in place so i feel safer there but i do not want to go back at all. i suggested moving schools but they have said it’s a big thing and that i should try what they have put in place for me. 

i don’t want to go back and try as i know it just will not work. they said i could come in later and leave 5 minutes early every lesson but i will still see the girl who is bullying me as it’s not as simple as they say. i don’t even want to try it because i don’t ever want to feel the way i did again when i was at school normally. i just wish i could be a normal teen and have a normal life but everything is just going bad for me right now. please don’t suggest going back and trying at i really don’t want to. is there anything else i could do as i dont want to ruin my education but they won’t let me change schools unless i try what they have put in place but i am so anxious and i know that it won’t work. can anyone help me please?",10Nov2020,1
589,"A few weeks ago, I started getting into Facebook dating (not so much to find a partner, mostly to get to know new people while I'm in quarantine). Long story short, I kind of hit it off with a guy there and we've been getting along well. We are somewhat attracted to each other, but we do kind of want to take things slow and we're not planning to rush into anything. For now, we really do enjoy each other's friendship. 

My parents found out about him because I told them honestly that I wanted to meet him in person at some point. They got angry, saying that I'm meeting someone who's way beneath me (I'm studying medicine and he's doing photography, but it's not an idea I get behind). I promised that I wouldn't meet him and I thought things would've settled. I still kept in contact with him through messaging. However, my mum found out that I'm still keeping in contact with him and she's still angry about it despite me promising I'm not going to meet him. She basically said our relationship won't be as close as before if I continue messaging him. 

I don't know what to do. I've been true to my word and transparent about my intentions to my parents. I've never done anything to break that trust either, yet I feel that I'm being punished for being transparent about my intentions. 

Just some background about me which may provide additional context: I'm waiting for graduation, but for now I'm still living under my parents' roof (I'm Asian so generally we tend to still live with our parents until we settle down and get married). I'd just like to know: am I being the bad person here? Or is my mum basically guilt tripping me into giving up a friendship because she doesn't feel comfortable with it?",10Nov2020,1
590,"TLDR; my best friend, who I’m about to move in with, is possibly the one giving information on my whereabouts to my abusive ex. And I need definitive proof. 

Backstory: 

I left an abusive relationship a few months ago. I’ve had zero contact with him since then. He’s been driving by my house on a semi-regular basis, which freaks me out but I let it go. When I left, I moved back in with family but recently decided to get an apartment with my best friend of 8 years. We’ve already signed the lease and paid the deposit. I’ve only told my immediate family that I’m moving and my friend says she’s only told a couple people. 

Yesterday, a mutual friend of mine and my ex’s told me that my ex 1. Admitted to driving by my house to keep tabs on me, 2. He knows my work schedule, which recently changed 3. That he knows I’m planning on moving, and 4. He’s saying it was my best friend that told him all of this. 

While keeping in mind that he’s a professional liar, I’ve been wracking my brain trying to figure out how he could have found out I’m moving. Out of the people my friend and I have told, there are only 2 people who would even have a way of telling him. Those 2 people being my friend, and her cousin. Unfortunately, I have to consider the possibility that it was my friend. 

I brought this up with her in person last night. I know her well enough to know that something was off. I could see it in her body language, her refusal to make eye contact with me, and the way she kept trying to discourage me from looking into this. That’s not like her at all. I also spoke with her sister about it, who’s also a good friend of mine. Her sister was pretty tight-lipped about it, which isn’t like her at all. 

Am I reading too much into this? Maybe. But I might be locked into a year lease with someone who is putting me in harms way by telling my ex things about me. So I need to know. 

My question is, what do I do? I thought about giving her a piece of false information and seeing if it ends up getting back to my ex. I’m just not sure what information to give her. It would have to be something big enough to be worth telling him, but not something that would make him angry enough to lash out. 

I’m open to other ideas too. That was just my first thought. 

Thanks in advance!",10Nov2020,1
591,"I'm [F23] currently studying towards jobs in a field that is (at least where I live) very heavily male-dominated. Of course I always knew this and I went into it with the attitude ""hey why not, I like the subject"" and ""I'll be a badass woman making a change"". 

To a certain extent I still feel this way, but since working a few jobs and starting an internship I've noticed I feel way more comfortable in an atmosphere where there's more women around. Of course this is a pretty general statement, and most guys I work with are friendly people. It's just the feeling of going on a lunch walk with 10 ish (mostly older) men bantering that I don't quite feel like I'm in the right place. 

Has anyone else considered this before? Do I focus my (future) job search on people who work there? Is this something I'll get used to in a year anyway? Should I just chill out of my comfortzone to maybe make it easier for others to do the same?",10Nov2020,1
592,"I lost my parent this year &amp; am in deep grief which everyone who knows me knows. I don’t have much immediate family. 

After my initial raw grieving I tried to go back to talking in my friends chat group, especially in these hard times of lockdowns &amp; restrictions, as if I don’t talk in there I’ll be even more cut off from any human contact. I’ve struggled to stay in it though as it’s mainly a place to have a laugh &amp; sometimes I have to put up a front to join in. 

It gets too hard to put up a front constantly though &amp; when I’m really low I disappear from there. It’s not a place where I can talk about feelings or get really heavy, but obviously I am still alive if I don’t talk in the group, I am still able to read messages or answer calls on my phone. I don’t cease to exist just because I stop joking around on a fun chat group. 

However none of my friends ever get in touch to see how I am, not even one lousy “How are you?” text all year. They have no idea about anything about me when I disappear for weeks or months &amp; what I’m going through. The last couple of times I’ve eventually given in myself &amp; started talking in the group as normal again as it seemed like it was almost a stand off of “See who breaks first” &amp; they weren’t going to budge at all in contacting me in any way &amp; I needed the human contact eventually. So I go back to having light hearted banter in the group. My grief &amp; disappearance completely unacknowledged.

Eventually recently I couldn’t take it anymore &amp; wrote in the group about how much I’m struggling &amp; what I go through everyday (things like leaving shops crying as a song came on) &amp; that if I talk in the group for awhile it’s often only a front. I got very brief sympathetic replies initially &amp; then was basically told they’re there if I need them as a way to tie up the topic. I ended up more or less telling them that the times I’m struggling it feels odd that the responsibility is put upon me to approach them &amp; that’s so hard &amp; overwhelming for me. Awhile later I sent a pointed message saying I feel so distant from people. 

I got one reply saying something along the lines of “Don’t feel distant. Hmm I don’t know maybe we’re doing it all wrong..” &amp; no reply from the rest &amp; then eventually they all went back to talking as normal.

I haven’t talked in the group since &amp; nobody’s made any contact with me at all &amp; this time I have no intention of going back to the group. 

These are my life long extremely close friends who I thought were my everything &amp; I have strengthened &amp; worked on these bonds over everyone else for years.

593,"Hello, first time posting to reddit, usually I'm more of a quiet reader trying to learn from other people's situations, but I'd figured I'd try to give this a go. I apologize in advance this might be rather long and contains mental health issues.

I was born into a very dysfunctional family and was subjected to extreme amounts of emotional as well as physical abuse growing up (both of my parents have bipolar disorder as well as me). I tried to reach out to my other family members and even my therapist for help while this was occurring but everyone just looked the other way or told me that I was lying because my parents are so great. I think eventually I just realized that nobody would help me so I started to think that no matter how hard I tried, nothing would ever get better. I started having suicidal thoughts at 8 years old and by age 21 (currently) I have attempted suicide twice and been hospitalized once. I would always tell myself that I would move far away and leave everything behind and that's what helped me cope growing up, but I realize that I'll never be able to escape myself. I have severe PTSD from my childhood and from a previous dysfunctional relationship and when I was 20 I was having a panic attack I attempted to reach out to my mom for support and she stood over me screaming ""This is all your fault, this is all because of you"" while I was crying in a fetal position on the floor.

My family moved towns right before I started high school. While being subjected to all manners of abuse I was now completely alone with no support system. I excelled in school to try to gain my parents affection, and I went onto college afterwards but dropped 1.5 years in because I couldn't handle all of the stress in a degree that I was pressured to go into. Afterwards I decided to go onto community college for a biotechnology degree. Everything was going great until covid shut down the school. Online classes were very difficult and I was increasingly becoming more socially isolated. I managed to get a laboratory job that pays 19/hr just to do something outside my house and have been doing that the past 2 months but I had to withdraw from school because my work (as well as everything else) makes me so depressed and stressed out I couldn't handle it. I only have two more classes left but I realized that I don't even want this degree anymore.

I currently still live with my mother and my sister in the same home because apartment rent near me is far too high and I'm worried that I'm too mentally ill to be able to support myself and will end up homeless. Even though we still live together, none of them talk to me and I try my best to completely emotionally detach myself from them as much as it hurts because I have wanted a relationship with them all my life but every chance I gave them to be there for me they fucked me over. And then they act as if I'm the one who has been being mean to them. They all act as one happy family and I've always been excluded and targeted. 

I have little to no close friends, my friendships are fleeting and I have a hard time connecting with or trusting anyone. I always feel like I'll just annoy everyone and I'm terrified of people leaving me. I had a boyfriend for 5 years but my mental health issues severely impacted our relationship until he finally left me. By the end of our relationship he also became sexually abusive but I feel like if I had been better to him he wouldn't have gotten that way. We were planning to get married and now I don't think I'll ever be capable of love or having another relationship. I would say I'm very depressed but no medications have helped. I have very little hope for my future. 

My question is I'm not sure what the next step I should take is. I want to move out and I also want to move far away out west, maybe to Colorado. I do not like my job but I am grateful that I at least have one, but it's making me absolutely miserable and I've been taking less and less care of myself, but I would feel terrible to quit after 2 months. Should I move out now in this area and try to finish this degree while going to work ? Part of me just wants to pack all my shit up and move, but I don't know where I would go or what I would do. I don't see a point if I will always be miserable and lonely. I'm really just lost.",10Nov2020,1
594,"I live in an isolated area and any city is a few hours away. With this covid-19, we can't get an appointment at the vet because there's a waiting list. So I have a male tabby kitten who's about 2-3 months. It's winter here, too. 

I know he will start spraying. I read that male cats can get territorial and start spraying stinky pee everywhere in the house. I just know it's gonna cause some problems and we won't know what to do with him. 

I'm so stressed because I really love this cat, I've been really lonely and he comforts me. Is there some way I can avoid him peeing everywhere? Train him or something? Sigh",10Nov2020,1
595,"Hi all, 

Long story short, I was falsely accused of sexual assault my first year of college. It ended up being investigated by the university, and they found me not guilty. After that, I struggle with mental health and image issues to this day. My degree program is small, so I was forced to sit in discussion classes with friends of the person who accused me, while they treated me poorly and rudely. I let everything drip off my back, as to not bring more attention to it. 

I am in my last year of university now, and I need to open up to some of my mentors about this. I'd like to have my scholarship extended another semester if possible for me to finish my degree, as some coursework fell short during the time where I was focused on the legality of the whole issue, rather than my studies. I didn't feel comfortable opening up about it before but I need to face it and seek help if I am to move forward. 

The university offered me nothing after the case, aside from offering free counseling opened to all students that ended up being a horrible expirence. I was told to ""man up"" and ""just move on."" Obviously they had no sympathy for me and it hurt. Walking down the halls knowing and thinking that everyone has a different image than you really does a number on you. Thankfully I still remained successful in my field, but the image of myself that I have haunts me every day. 

My question is, I need to open up and explain my situation to my close mentors and advisors at the university, but I fear ridicule given the context. Any advice on how to bring up the situation, and perhaps words of encouragement might help too. 

Thank you all.",10Nov2020,1
596,"So I’m (F) in college right now, and I currently stay in a medium-sized dorm room with this other girl. She’s cool and all and I don’t want to call her dumb, but the stuff she does is just...idk. I already don’t like having a roommate, and I’ve made the necessary decisions for next semester so I won’t have one. 

But, let’s start off with I get NO sleep. Like, I’ve been taking 2-hour naps during the day for the past week and a half and I couldn’t understand why, but now i do. My roommate doesn’t have a job, and she leaves everyday to go to her boyfriend’s dorm and stay with him literally all day and then when she finally comes back to the room at 9 or 10 pm, she gets on the phone with her family and friends all night telling them that she has “so much work to do” and doesn’t go to sleep till after 1:30 in the morning. Wtf do you do all day? 

I’m a light sleeper so literally anything will wake me up, so if I try to go to sleep early she’ll be up moving shit around and finding everything to do. So i try to sleep at the same time she does or after. BUT when I’m forced to go to sleep late, she wakes up early as fuck doing the same damn things she did the night before forcing me to wake up early too. On average, i get about 6 hours of sleep and I never feel rested. I’ve said something about it before, but I guess she forgot. That’s not the only thing she does but if I carry on this post would be so long. I just need help with approaching the situation without sound like a bitch. It’s come to the point where I wake up in a terrible mood.",10Nov2020,1

598,"I'm currently a junior in college. My freshman year I joined the rotc program at my university, as I had gotten a scholarship through the program. Right off the bat I noticed my personality type did not quite fit in, but I pushed through it since it's paying for college. As time has progressed, my relations with other cadets at large have not improved. Most cadets in my class make rude remarks to me or generally ignore me because I'm not ""high speed"" enough. I try to ignore it, but it has taken a hit at my self esteem over time. I've found myself paranoid that others dislike me despite having quite pleasant friendships outside of the program. How do I get past these self defeating feelings that everyone hates me or will end up hating me? Should I quit before I'm in too deep and stuck in an organization where I don't fit in? If not, any tips on how to deal with it?

599,"TW SUICIDE

Throw away account due to the sensitive subject matter. 

My boyfriend has been in some legal trouble since we first got together. It's a long complicated story that is not really relevant to the situation, aside from saying it is the state pressing charges so there is no way for them to be dropped. 

A little background on him... He has Central Sensitization Dissorder, Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Dissorder, Fibromyalgia and PTSD-C from childhood abuse and trauma. All moderately well controlled with prescription medication and cognitive behavioral training. 
He spend two nights in jail when the incident that lead to this case took place and was mishandled by the facility. They placed him in a holding unit after removing another inmate that was coughing up a lung and did not sanitize before hand. They also did not provide him with his proper medication causing him to have severe withdrawals from the benzos he had been prescribed for his fibro. 

Now the present situation. His court date is in a few days and he has decided that he cannot go to jail, he strongly believes that if he ends up in jail he will be raped, beatten, murdered, and that his medical needs (such as meds and COVID-19 protocols) will be neglected. His lawyer has said that with the charges he is facing, he is almost guaranteed 30 days in jail (though no more than 90 days) Because of this he has decided that if he should be sentanced to jail he will take his own life, either in his home or suicide by cop in the court room (should he have to appear in person) he has told his doctor and his lawyer of these intentions and no one has really said or done anything at all. 

He is content with options like house arrest, strict probation, or being held in a medical facility, but is stone cold serious about taking his life if jail/prison is the only option. 

He spent hours sobbing into my arms saying he was sorry and that he didn't want to die. But he feels  so spiteful towards the DA and the legal/jail system and feels this is the best way to get his point across about the injustices the system has inflicted on him and others. He also says he will not endure the ""torture"" of not being properly cared for while imprisoned. 

I am at a complete loss as to what I can say or do to help him. The inpatient mental health facilities where I live are horrendous, and though there is a decent one about an hour away I don't know what would happen if he was in there over his court date and missed his appearance or what he would do if the police showed up to incarcerate him and he hadn't had time to get his affairs in order. 

I cannot see this man die. I don't want advice to get another boyfriend, or anyone demeaning his character because of his dissorders or legal status. Everyone makes mistakes, and I understand that everyone must make retribution for those mistakes. But right now a life is on the line... And any advice would be very very welcome. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend will commit suicide if he is sentanced to jail/prison. How can I help him.",10Nov2020,1

DADS RESPONSE 


“Get you facts right, I’m getting a tad bored with this.  If that’s how you feel, then bring it out on the open and tell everyone in the family what’s going on.  

Yet it’s you who doesn’t want the family to know.  

 Bring it out in the open so we don’t have to hide things anymore.  

Make your mind up as to what you want to say.  You don’t want the family to push marriage onto you.  So whilst we are trying to protect your relationship, you are always taking it the wrong way.  

Get your story sorted and so we can say it as it is.  Stop throwing all these accusations our way when ‘you’ don’t want the family to know about him yourself.  

Tell us what you want us to say when the neighbours or the family ask who he is? Put this thing to rest. 

 Get it all out in the open so we don’t have to lie about this anymore.”

622,"So I’m a newly graduated (last year) software developer, but I’m also a bit of a late bloomer (29 and just getting me first dev job). Im currently working at a startup. It’s not an environment I ever really wanted to work in, but with COVID etc I pretty much accepted the first job I was offered because I felt lucky to find anything at all.

I’m currently experiencing a bit of a miss-match in attitudes between myself and my coworkers. Being a startup the company is still finding its feet and is not exactly flourishing financially (but it is owned and run by a very wealthy family).
I recently found out that I’m actually being paid 25% below the market related salary for someone in my position.
This is where the miss-match comes in. I feel that I should be properly compensated for the work that I’m doing, while my coworkers feel a sense of loyalty and responsibility to the company. They feel that they need to add value wherever they can. They believer in the company and feel like they’re part of a “family”. There are often talks by senior management about how well the company is going to do and how wealthy were all going to be, however being a bit older than the others, and having a healthy sense of skepticism; I find this all to be mostly bullshit. Not the fact that the company could make money, but the fact that we, as junior developers, would see any of it.
There is nothing I have seen from the behavior of management that would indicate that we would receive any sort of financial reward if the company where to take off, as I said it’s owned and run by a very wealthy family, and we are paid below the market related salaries.
Additionally the company is often highly disorganized. To the point where getting a payslip is a lengthy task. They also go through administrative staff at an alarming rate. I’ve been working there for 6 months and they’ve had 3 different financial officers.
I also can’t help but feel a bit of resentment from my coworkers, Who I feel think that I’m not a team player and am entities. I have mentioned the salary disparities and it doesn’t seem to bother them. To the point where they’ve actually told me that I have the wrong attitude.

So my question and request for advice is this: Is this a normal atmosphere for a startup business? Do I need to just stick with it and enjoy the ride and experience. Am I just and entitled millennial only looking out for myself?
Or is this a less than ideal scenario and I need to start looking for a new job.

I talked to her once before dating her. And i was like ight ill roll with that. But when we got together she found out how dry i was at texting and how i wasnt as outgoing as i portray myself to be. I dont think i portray myself as outgoing... i have spikes of energy, whereby ill be super friendly during a specific period of time. These spikes are due to an interesting event that amused me temporarily. Other than that im usually v blurr and lost? These r what my close friends describe me as. Idw to mislead anyone but then again if they insist to “try for fun” ill agree cuz i want something to kill boredom. Is that wrong? Im too young for this shit.


I wld ask my friends for help. But i think theyll just ask me to date for fun. I dont want to go thru the whole breakup thing again. Its so tedious to be nice about it(great thing)N i dont want to ghost the person(terrible thing). Is there anyway i can be kinda okay and not be a terrible or great person.",10Nov2020,1
625,"My dad hated me from birth, so he gave me a name with a bad meaning (crushed, exiled, lowly)... I'm going to legally change it to something else. My mom says Mila is a good name so that's what we're thinking of currently. But I'd like to read your suggestions too.

I'm half georgian from father side even though I don't like them, and half Bulgarian half Greek from mother side, I'd like my name to be associated with these cultures but I also want it to be usable in Canada with easy pronounciation.

If it helps here's my description: 
Personality-wise I'm not a very feminine person, I don't have strong feelings about gender so it can be a unisex name. I have a baby face, tall build, brunette with white skin, so I look simple.
My personality is respectful, friendly, family-oriented, loyal, open-minded, smart,curious, and I hate unjustice.

626,"For a while, I thought hitch was a all- time movie that helped give guys like me a chance, I studied this movie to the point where it was some type of holy text. And when acting on what I studied I failed badly. I tried everything. The dates, the assertiveness, the sensitive side. The 90-10 rule. And still I haven’t gotten a text back from the 3 women. is there a problem. Am I the problem ?",10Nov2020,1
627,"A little bit of context. 
We met in college 3 years ago, many things happened meanwhile. We decided to move up north the country to continue studying once our degree was finished. I didn’t finish and decided to switch major to Psychology but we still moved in together since we’re in the same place. 

Today we had an argument over many things, many of which make me feel insecure and really depressed. 
We were playing some game and i decided to just quit, i didn’t feel like playing and we were getting wrecked, so I left and they lost the game. I reckoned it wasn’t even a smart move and i regret it. 
Argument kept going and he said something like “that shows in real life, and why no one “attaches” to you”. 

Now, I don’t have MANY friends but i do know a big number of people, and actually consider myself sociable. Work is going great, and all that. I do have some long term friends who i love but don’t see very often (I moved from my hometown, as have many of them aswell). 

This made me feel really weak, and resentful, because it is not true. Although i didn’t have the “time” to tell him all this, I think about it all the time. Lately, I do have been feeling resentful and sad, and i don’t know what to do about it. I feel like i’m responsible for his well being and it’s making me go crazy. If i’m in my room, he’ll feel alone and want my company, while i’m just chillin watching some movie or whatever.
I think i know what makes me upset, but don’t know what to do about it!

He also mentioned my selfishness and how i only think in myself and don’t care about other people. Aftually, I do a lot of things for myself that i think i deserve, and WORK towards it. I don’t ask anyone for anything extraordinary, i just fight for it and do it by myself. Is there anything wrong with it ?

I honestly just wanted to rant and seek some strangers opinions on the internet, if you know what i’m feeling please leave your comment",10Nov2020,1
628,"(Background info: I (16M) was in a relationship with a girl (17F) for about a year, I’ve made a lot of posts about this, but basically it was really unhealthy and toxic. I had abusive tendencies during the relationship which ultimately made her leave. Most of the abuse was emotional, and there were only two occasions where I hit her, but immediately regretted it afterwards. Since then, I’ve been getting help with a licensed therapist, reading books on abuse, listening to stories from victims, etc.. I realize my behaviour was super wrong and messed up, so I’m working to fix that ASAP.)

Anyways, we used to have sex a lot, because our self-esteems were always super low and we craved emotional validation from each other. Hell, our relationship started with a hookup. However, there were a couple times where I didn’t want to have sex, but she kinda forced herself on me anyways? I never told her I wanted it, but I also never told her I DIDN’T want it. I didn’t say anything at all. There’s one specific scenario I remember vividly. It was back in March, on our one year anniversary, and we were waiting for a ride to bring us to our dinner reservation. We were just chilling, watching Netflix, when she suddenly got very horny. She proceeded to start taking off her clothes, grinding on me, and kissing my neck (which she knows gets me horny), but I didn’t push her off. I guess that’s because she would always get super upset if I said no, saying stuff like “this is all my fault” and “I shouldn’t have done anything” and I never wanted her to hate herself like that. I tried to give her hints, distracting her with the show and what not, but she kept going. By this point I was very uncomfortable, I never said I was okay with it. She tried to palm me through my pants, the sensation getting me a little excited, but not voluntarily. Eventually our ride came before it progressed further (thank god) and she got a little frustrated. This has happened a few times, where I’d go over to her house to hang out, and she’d ALWAYS wanna have sex. I mean yeah, some times I’d be into it, but other times when I’d say no, she’d get upset in some way. It’d make me feel super bad, like i was letting her down, so I’d always end up giving in and having sex anyways. I’ve felt guilty quite a few times afterwards, even crying in the bathroom once, but I always excused that as just me hating my body (which i did hate tremendously). I also used to be a really kinky person while in the relationship, so I don’t know if she took that as a signal that I’d ALWAYS be down for it. I don’t know, this has been weighing on my mind a lot recently (I’m a HUGE over-thinker). My biggest fear is people seeing this as an attempt to “erase my past actions” and “make her seem like the bad guy”. For the record, this is absolutely not my intention. I did a lot of shitty things to her that she did not deserve at all. But I’m kind of wondering if she also did some not-so-good things to me. If it is considered sexual assault, I know that if i pressed charges, she’d just press charges back for emotional abuse. Justice for me would be to never EVER see or hear from her again, which she’s making extremely difficult right now (made other posts on that). The more I review the relationship with a mediator (my therapist), the more mutually toxic behaviour I’m beginning to see. Any advice would be appreciated, even if it’s just telling me to stop overthinking so much lol. If you made it this far, thanks for reading this, it means a lot to be heard :)",10Nov2020,1

631,"Hi. I'm a 14 year old girl and I only have one friend. I've only had 1 sleepover with someone else when I was 10. So I am homeschooled and I met this girl at a gathering thing and she asked me if I have snapchat (I don't have any social media), I said no, so we ended up exchanging numbers. I was really excited because I haven't had anyone to talk to besides my family. So after a couple months of just texting, I asked her if she wanted to skate at a skating rink with me. She said yeah, but she was going to bring like 3 other friends. She asked me if I was going to bring any friends, but I said no, since she is my only friend. I ended up putting it off because I'm a really awkward person and I would feel so bad if I had no one to talk to. I was afraid that I would be left out while she skates with all of her friends. It sounds weird, but I have been in that situation before and it just feels so awful. So that's basically the background of everything.

 All of our text messages go, ""Hey"", ""Hey"" ""wyd"" ""Nm wbu"" ""nm"". Occasionally we will send pictures of clothing we got that day or something. Last week I sent her a message saying ""Hey"" and yesterday I sent her a message saying ""hey watcha been up to?"" She never replied to either. It just makes me kind of sad, because she'll sometimes say she's staying at her friends house this weekend or something, and the way she texts just seems like she doesn't want to talk to me because I'm boring. Should I keep texting her or is there even a point?",10Nov2020,1
632,"A girl (who we will call ""Sara"") has been bullying me for some time. I am male, and gay, but not ready to come out. We are both 13.

Sara has always picked on me. She usually bullies me when nobody is watching, so as to not harm her own reputation. It always upset me, but there was one incident that really got me angry.

We were in a group of friends and she asked me if I was gay. I said no. She then tried to force me to prove it.

She pulled up a third friend (we will call her ""Anna"") and said if I'm straight, I have to lick her vagina. I obviously refused, and she says if I refuse, then I must be gay. Not wanting to let others know the truth, I agreed and got it over with.

I didn't even process what was happening before, but the day after, I was filled with anger. I was angry at myself, for letting myself do that, but more angry at her for being the one who pushed her. She never even apologized. I was sexually abused, and pressing charges was unlikely to be successful, as females are rarely convicted. She still kept being her smug, entitled self. She continued to be a bully.

I snapped at her and told her to go kill herself.

I'm not sure if I should apologize or not. What to do?",10Nov2020,1

I’m 28 now, and I’ve had intermittent debilitating anxiety episodes more than once a year, every year since my first panic attack. It resulted in me having to temporarily drop out of my university, returning to finish my Bachelor’s when I was 23. It delayed the acquisition of my Masters for an extra year. It’s causing problems at work now. It feels like every stage of my adult life so far has been a limping struggle because I’m drudging forward with anxiety clawing at me.

638,"For background: My wife works as an accountant, and has a Masters Degree in Accounting with quite a lot of student debt.

We live in Indiana, and one of the sad realities of finding a lucrative career in this state is the absolutely INSULTING job offers professionals receive, even Pre-COVID. 

I luckily got to keep my IT job during COVID, however, she was laid off from a very lucrative job, and has since been working as an Accountant for a small company that pays less than half of what she was making before. We've looked high and low, and sadly with COVID cases spiking, and unemployment in my state being relatively high, finding something else has been very difficult to say the least. 

She is understandably frustrated.

Recently, my younger brother in law (21M) told her about his new factory job, where he's making $24 an hour working an assembly line. While it isn't what she was making before, it's considerably more than she is making now. He's put in a good word for her with his supervisor, and she has an interview on Thursday.

Obviously, as her Husband I support any decision she ultimately makes but in this case I'm unsure. I think leaving a job in Accounting simply to make a quick buck would hurt her career in the future. In my field (IT Security) leaving the field is a death sentence, and usually you have to restart the clock at the Help Desk or low level Admin crap to make up for lost time.

We make more than enough to cover our bills and make ends meet, but she still seems down on herself for ""being a poor provider"" which is completely untrue.

She ultimately wants to become a CPA and go into business for herself, but that requires a ton of experience, and essentially an apprenticeship under a current CPA before she can take the exam. If she's working in another field, that experience essentially goes down the drain.

What do you think?

644,"Hi everyone, 

I am a soon to be 22 year old male.

I have had problems with drug addiction on and off since I turned 18, but what always kept me on the right road was physical exercise and sports. It's been the only way for me to deal with the anxiety and negative thoughts and lately I have been doing very well because I have been sober and very active.

However, some days ago I was playing football (or soccer) and I hurt my knee very badly. I went to the hospital and they told me that it's either the ACL or the meniscus (or both), but I will find out only on Friday because the knee was too swollen.  Needless to say that the recovery is gonna take a very long time, probably around one year.

Right now I live in the Netherlands, far from my family, and I feel completely hopeless. Sports and exercise are what I identify myself with, and it's what makes me able to sleep at night.

Also the lockdown is not helping at all, I can barely hang out with real people.

Long story short, I developed feelings for her after she left for school and things were going well, although admittedly it was one-sided on my end, but I didn't mind since she was really busy with school. Fast-forward to a few weeks ago I confessed. She didn't feel the same way but still wanted to be friends and explained her reasoning, which I respected. She also added that she only went on Hinge in the first place because she was at a low point, and wasn't intending on starting anything until I came along (this might be important for later). In response, I told her that most of the things I did with her was mostly out of friendship and not solely because of my feelings for her. I also said that I valued her a lot and what we have, so I'd hate it if our friendship were to grow distant because of this. Basically I was hoping that we would still be really close after this, but she never responded back to me.

Surprisingly my feelings for her passed really quickly and I was feeling good again, but the uncertainty of where our friendship stood was upsetting me at times. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed that she needed space since this might be new to her. Recently though, I found out that she removed me as a follower on her personal Instagram and her public page, and she also left the Discord server I made. However, she was still following me and also kept me added as a friend on Facebook and Discord. I didn't know what to make of it but I reached out to several people and they said that she's retroactively giving me space, trying to get a reaction out of me, or keeping tabs on me. I ended up just deactivating everything and now I'm currently trying to move on from the fact that maybe she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

I was wondering if I could get some insight as to why she did this. Or if maybe I'm overreacting and this is all in my head. Considering the fact that we can both relate to the pain of losing a friend with the lack of closure, it seems uncharacteristic of her to do something like this.

My mom just wants her gone, I told her to let the poor dog roam around the house because she’s old and just wants to lay on the living room floor. I know this because when i house sat for my mom I let my beagle have some time outside of the crate and she went and laid on a dog bed in the living room that was meant for the girl puppy. She just sprawled out and napped. Didn’t try to jump on the couch like my mom said, didn’t try to “roam around” and dig in peoples stuff. To which my mom says but she smells bad. SO WHAT. You don’t put a dog down because she’s old and smells?? There’s nothing wrong with my dog, ya she’s slow, ya she stinks. 

I told my mom put her on cbd oil for joint pain, put her on wet food because her teeth hurt her when she eats, and let her sit in the living room. And she’s like no, she’s just old and needs to be put down. How tf do I tell my mom she doesn’t need put down? I know the beagles problems can easily be solved by taking care of her, my mom just wont do it.",10Nov2020,1

My friend is 15, he’s been my friend for years. We pretty much grew up together. Recently, he was telling us about his girlfriend which was nice, I was happy for him. But it was that cliché ‘she doesn’t go to this school!’. Didn’t think much of it until I met her. When I met her the first thing I noticed was damn she looks going. In fairness, we don’t look our age all the time, but she really didn’t look our age.

I asked, and she said she was 13, but she faltered a little bit I didn’t really think much of it. It was sweet enough. He poke about her a LOT. It was somewhat gross after a while. I personally couldn’t ever date someone 13, but it wasn’t that big of a deal.

That was until I got a recommendation on instagram. It was her page. So I go and look. And I am absolutely floored. She looks so young because she IS so young. She’s not 13 at all. She’s 11. I figured maybe he didn’t know. But he follows her so he HAS to know.

I feel like maybe he told her to say she was 13. Which would mean that he knows all too well what he’s doing is wrong.

I don’t know what to do about it anymore. I’m worried and don’t know what to do. I don’t know enough about her to know how to help.",10Nov2020,1
665,"TL;DR Mom has many valid political beliefs, genuine concern for country, and smart in many ways. However her views have been greatly influenced by far-right media. This election she is even burning bridges on social media and looking into far-right/conspiracy sites. Can I help her against social media addiction or disinformation? If not, how can I prevent this from interfering with our relationship besides not talking about my political beliefs?

———————————————

My mom is signing up for social media sites and news apps like OAN, Parler and MeWe. I looked up what they were, and they all are linked to far-right and conspiracy groups usually shunned on regular social media sites.

She has always had conservative views. Even when I disagree, I respect her beliefs in limited government, belief that lower taxes cause economic growth, and that anyone can achieve success from working class backgrounds like she did.

However, it seems like she started to consume more media, starting with conservative Facebook groups and Fox News growing around 2018. Sometimes I would overhear her watching videos of a doctor claiming hydroxychloroquine is a “CURE” for Covid. Even though I don’t think she believes them, she’s giving these and QAnon-style videos a listen. She thinks autism is linked to vaccines, so she is predisposed to these kind of videos.

With the election season, many days she shows or reads me anti-Biden or anti-Democrat memes, or tells me about a Facebook argument. 

When a Facebook poster can delete any comment for any reason, even her innocuous pro-R/anti-Dem comments are deleted because the poster disagrees with her. People are blocking her on social media after she makes certain comments. Now she sees social media companies’ removal of disinformation as censorship of valid news, equating them to the posters that simply disagree with her. Now she’s telling me how people on Facebook are suggesting she move to the above sites. 

She spends most of her free time on social media and most conversations she starts are about politics. I only tell her a bit of my views or look up the claims of her post to counter/clarify what she’s reading. However, this doesn’t seem to change anything. 

I can tell she is genuinely concerned for this country, and not just spiteful. However, the sites she reads demonizes anything and everything Democrat and glorifies everything Republican. I feel like if the same situation happened but it was a Republican, she wouldn’t see the issue. While she takes COVID seriously with masks and sanitizer, if anything else important became politicized she would probably believe whatever these sites say. I’m afraid to tell her what I believe or how I voted because she’d probably act like I betrayed her and went off the deep end.

This seems like the growth of something unhealthy now that she is moving to these sites. What do I do? I don’t think I can counter whatever she’s reading, and I’m afraid this media rabbit hole will make her bitter and reject anything counter to the media she reads. If I can’t help her kick a social media addiction, at least how do I keep our relationship okay?",10Nov2020,1

678,"(I will clarify by saying that i did not cheat) 

So every week we have to take notes and answer questions from a textbook in an AP class i am in. The questions themselves are part of the notes, so once we finish them, we can use them to help during our quiz for the chapter. 

Well today, while we were taking the quiz for the chapter we had to read, my teacher called me over and asked me if i was in her tutorials (she does the notes along with students there), and i said no.  

She then asked why i had her notes if i wasn’t in her tutorials. Now, i am very bad at taking any sort of confrontation or conflict even if what they acuse me for is something i did not do. As a result i panicked, started shaking, turning red, and i didn’t think rationally about my response, causing me to tell her a friend helped me with it. 

No one helped me with them. The notes took me 3 days to complete since i wanted them to be VERY specific. She asked who had helped me again, and i said a friend. She asked 2 more times and i kept replying with “a friend” so she finally asked WHO (as in to give her a name) helped me. I said XYZ, so not only did i put myself in bigger trouble, i put someone else who has helped me here and there in danger. She responded by saying that that wasn’t allowed. 

I went back to me seat and tried to make sense of what had just happened, realizing that what i said was terrible. For the rest of class, i was thinking of an explanation that could work out with what i said. 

When the bell rang I told her through stutters that there had been a misunderstanding, and that XYZ had helped me in the question portion, but only leading me to answers in the text book, not outright giving them to me. I then told her that the rest of the notes I had done on my own, and that they took me 3 days. She said she would look into it. 

Of course i told XYZ what happened, and we both kinda freaked out, thinking about the fact that they HAD given me vocabulary sentences (teacher never grades them) and helped me with other chapter notes, but not this one. We just started thinking about the fact that we COULD GET KICKED OUT, about how bad that would look to colleges, how it would get us kicked out of our other AP classes, basically ruining us, etc.

So now i’m wondering what to do when she eventually calls us to talk about it? What do i even say, since i basically lied twice. Chances are that I will get in trouble because they HAVE helped me out before.

679,"I (18F) graduated high school a few months ago and am now planning on continuing my studies at uni...my parents want and are imposing that I study in my home state but I want to study in The Netherlands. 

If I would study in The Netherlands, it would be cheaper (about 20 000 $ cheaper) than in the US and also my boyfriend lives there.

My parents are very stubborn and whenever I ask anything, even the smallest things, they directly say no and get pissed at me for even daring to ask. Throughout the years, this has caused that I have a huge problem with communicating with my parents, even with the smallest things.

There would be so many benefits of me being able to study in The Netherlands..the money, the type of life and I would be happier because 1.- I was an exchange student there a few years ago  + my host families want to see me and 2.- I would finally be able to see my boyfriend after almost a year of not seeing him (I wouldn't live with him though)

680,"I’m so tired of going to my 8-5 job every day. I work as a mechanic which is a career path that I originally decided to get into because I really enjoyed working on my own vehicles. I soon found out that I don’t find the same enjoyment when doing this as a day to day job even though I’ve gotten kind of good at it (my employers always tell me that I’m the best employee they’ve ever had). The amount of money that I make does not offset the extreme cost of required tools nor the wear and tear I’m putting on my body. I don’t have health insurance or any benefits. I feel extremely underpaid for the amount of work that I have to do. I have also only been working Monday - Thursday since March (previously Monday - Friday) which my employers say is due to “COVID-19” but the actual reason is that they enjoy having the extra day off to work on their side business that is slowly becoming their main source of income.

I’ve thought many times of quitting but with my reduced hours I don’t have much money in my savings to cover the cost of living while I’m finding another job. People have suggested that I find a job at another repair shop but I’m not ASE certified which means that I would have to start at the bottom again earning even less money than I am now and I don’t want to stay in this field anyway. 

I’ve recently started doing very small freelancing jobs on Upwork to try to make some additional income but it’s usually not much at all and more of just something to do to make my free time more productive.

I don’t really know where to go after I finish the course (should finish late December). I’m not really sure what courses to take after that or what direction to take.

However, he has some really bad depression, and due to that he has some problems whenever we hang out, especially at parties. About midway through, he’ll almost always get extremely depressed and break down in front of everyone, with no way to cheer him up. This includes getting angry at people and insulting them for no reason, stoping talking to people, leaving the room for hours at a time, and napping in the same room as everyone else. His mental health is extremely important to me and I know I shouldn’t treat it as some sort of burden because I don’t know how much control he has over it, but most of the time it turns what would’ve been a fun night into managing him to make sure he’s ok, ending the night early to take him home, a group session to comfort him, ect.

Last night, I was hanging out with my friend who is a really nice guy, but sometimes he makes me uncomfortable, like the fact he has cameras all over his house, is a very intense person, or very particular about things. He also owns a gun. Despite those things, he has never done anything to me. He is a very anxious person and he is always asking me if he did something wrong or if I was upset anytime I’m just being normal or just sitting there doing nothing. It makes no sense to me and no matter how many times I tell him to stop asking me, he keeps doing it. It’s annoying but I understand people struggle with insecurities. I struggle with it too. I should mention that one time him and his family stole like $60k from someone who passed away because the person was my friend’s mom’s ex-husband from decades ago, but he never took her name out of the account... so, she took the money and didn’t give it back to the guy’s family. My friend agreed it was “the right thing to do” and that he didn’t care about that guy’s family, that the money is theirs because his mom’s name was on it and the guy was dumb enough to leave her name on there.

Anyway, last night, I forgot for what reason but I mentioned that I had watched one of the ISIS beheading videos when they came out because I was really curious but it was easily one of the most horrible things I’ve seen in my life. I said I only watched it because of curiosity, not for pleasure. This is when he went and said “well, if we’re being honest, I like watching bloody and gory videos of people getting buried or killed on this website that I frequently visit. I enjoy watching them often. I’m curious too.” At that point I was freaking the fuck out in my head. He clearly had misunderstood what I had said and thought I was l like him. I tried not to show my panic, because my fight or flight response had kicked in. I even asked him, “you go to that website regularly?” And he said “yeah, every now and then.” I acted normal for the rest of the night and left. I didn’t want to trigger him or set him off or, ironically, dig my own grave. He acted as if he had not said anything bad. He even smiled while he was telling me these things. I was so confused.

What should I do?! My brain is telling me to block this person and never talk to them again. Part of me is legitimately scared for my life. Am I being stupid or reasonable?

692," 

Hi everyone. I really don't know where to start and I hate to overshare...but, here goes.

Due to some rather unpleasant circumstances, I haven't seen my Son in over a year. He lives with his father in another state. My heart aches, because I miss him so dang much. He was supposed to come stay with me over the summer, but then the pandemic happened and we didn't feel comfortable having him fly during the summer when so much was still unknown. Now, my ex husband had agreed to fly him to me for Christmas. But, he just called me a couple days ago saying that he wont be able to afford it because my son would be flying as an unaccompanied minor and there will have to be a layover and the extra fees associated with accompanying a minor put the price of the flight to high for my ex husband to be able to afford. I realize most people would say for me to pitch in, but, I just am not able to. I am recovering from being homeless and just getting my life back on track, living paycheck to paycheck.

I have thought of things like renting a car to go get him, train (researching), greyhound (I don't want to put my 13 year old on a greyhound by himself), me flying there (I have a dog and wouldn't be able to kennel him or have anyone dog sit for me because I literally don't know anyone here).

693,"My girlfriend has been struggling at work lately. She’s a part timer that keeps getting scheduled 2 hours shy away from what a full timer usually works, and most people dump their workload on her, so she’s the only only doing stuff while they’re just watching. She’s been really frustrated and has been cried the most I’ve seen yesterday after a rough day, so I made fixed up a new resume for her and drafted a resignation letter last night.

Today, her dad contacted me telling me to do whatever I can to convince her not to quit, as they were the ones who helped her get that job and it was really hard to do so. The other plus is that this job also helps pay for her tuition so she can get her associates degree. Her family always tell her to just grow up and say there’s worse jobs out there, but I think her anxiety makes it hard for her to cope with these situations too.

I want my girlfriend to be happy. I wish there wasn’t those connections because I could just tell her to quit. But now I’m tied down with that, I’m not sure what to do.",10Nov2020,1

Help PLEASE, I don’t know if she’s pregnant

I know this isn’t the right place to ask this but I’m having a panic of my life right now.

So my girlfriend and I were getting frisky on oct. 15 I had some precum that I had wiped away with my thumb and shirt and while it was only 15-30 seconds after the wipe I went down on her and used my thumb (in the heat of the moment) to spread her vagina. My thumb only touched the labia majora. After that like 1 minute or so I fingered her with my other hand the clean one. Her ovulation came on oct. 18-19 and now it’s November 9 without her period. I’m fucking panicking can someone tell me if she’s pregnant or not? Also we did not have sex only oral and fingering. Any opinions to ease the mind?

Also after her ovulation, she has been stressing ALOT but that’s only after her ovulation so Idk if that affected anything

Note my thumb was not wet at all with precum, maybe it was only a little moist because it had been only 15-30 seconds of touching my precum.",10Nov2020,1

698,"Well...this is going to be a silly post but, I have no where else to ask this. A while back we had the apartment exterminator come spray for a tiny bug issue we had upon move in, well....she saw my private collection of personal items. (Toys) She came late and we didn't know when we would be expecting her to come by. Well it flew right over my head by the time I realized that I had left out my collection of BD stuff. The next time she showed up and acted weird, not sure how to describe it but, it just made me super insecure and feeling bad about having these items out.

 Though she didn't say anything, you could tell based on the expression and nervousness that she was uncomfortable. Well fast forward and we are paying for pest control services, but when we call her she NEVER comes by. Every single time we call and ask her to come out, she never does and it leaves us frustrated when we have issues involving something and the fact that we are paying for a service we are not getting. I called the apartment manager and mentioned her not coming out and getting the feeling of avoidance and hinted ""Maybe she saw something and that could be the reason, idk.."" He laughed and you could tell that he knew exactly what I meant, but he said that should be no reason for her not coming out and that he will contact her and ask what is up with no coming by, but that she will absolutely come out to spray.

I am curious how I should handle this? I feel like an idiot for leaving my BD collection out and her seeing them. I am incredibly embarrassed and not sure what to do if she keeps avoiding our apartment after countless requests to spray. Mind you we are paying for this service, so when she doesn't come out, we still have to pay.",10Nov2020,1

700,"Hey everyone,
Background: my mom and I have been caring for my cousin who is ungrateful and whom doesn't contribute to the house in any single way. Doesn't clean anything, doesn't cook, wastes food etc... She lives with us because her mom is a dead beat and on drugs. 

So the mom got a brand new house, paid for by the state, really nice , and were sure she will move in with her mom because she is an opportunist.

Which I'm not against, I fully believe she should be in the care of her mother instead of just using her for money and gifts that the mom earns by doing shady things...

So I just bought my cousin bedroom furniture and painted her room for her amongst other things. 

But when she moves out I don't want her taking the furniture that I paid for and is in my name. I feel like she doesn't deserve it and god forbid something happen and I needed that furniture. To me I view it as money down the drain. 

My entire family is pissed off at me for wanting to keep my furniture. 

I feel like her mom should be a mom for once and buy her bedroom furniture. 

I'm not her mom and it was my money...

In our roommate contract we agreed to “take care of things as they need to be done” things meaning vacuuming and trash. Now I realize we should’ve made a more specific plan, but this is my first roommate, and I didn’t expect her to not follow through on taking care of things.

I noticed I had done all the vacuuming, and the majority of the trash changing. After a few days of building courage to mention it (she’s very sweet, I’m just not good with confrontation) I told her we need to figure out a routine for these chores. Every Sunday we take turns vacuuming, and we agreed to take turns doing the trash (which goes in a chute just down the hall). We decided if the recycling is full when you take the trash out, you take the recycling with you. She said this all works &amp; this sounded good to me.

Yesterday I was at class and I returned and the garbage was changed but not the recycling. She asked me again how to do the recycling. I explained it for the 4th time. Now it’s 3 days later and she still hasn’t taken it out. 

The trash is almost full again, and it’ll be my turn to change it. I know I should just mention it but again not good with confrontation. Should I just leave the recycling there and only change the trash? I’ve changed the recycling every time.

One of the neighbors was close to my mom, and she helped a lot on the night my mom passed. She offered to help with the yard around the house as my mom had let the bushes get overgrown. I thanked her profusely with a lot of food and a gift basket.

I noticed that she was a little nosy about certain topics but I put it down to her personality. However, recently, she's been ""checking"" up on me with regular visits and calls. While she mostly talks about things that are pedestrian, she also keeps enquiring about certain things in the house. ""Oh, and what are you going to do with xyz? I figured if you were throwing it away, I'd love to have it"". I told her that I was planning on selling things, and left it at that. I figured this was ""repayment"" for her helping out with the yard, bit she explicitly told me that the food and gifts were payment enough.

719,"I’ve lived with these people for many years now. They are in their 80s, and 70s. One is diagnosed with dementia, but doesn’t seek treatment. The other is completely violent,paranoid,rude,etc. CPS and dhhs have been in and out for years. Still, I haven’t been put into a new home. I’d rather not get rehomed, because at my age nobody will take me. I know how it works.

 However, I keep getting threatened to be kicked out (for no reason, again, they are mentally ill). Where I live, it’s illegal to kick a minor out without placing them into state custody first, but they refuse. I try and tell them, and I can not stress this enough, but every time I try and have a discussion, they always ALWAYS yell shut up to me. Every day. Numerous times a day. They even tell me to shut up when simple things happen. 

For instance, one of them ran over a traffic cone today and dragged it for 10 minutes. Every time I told her to stop the car, she got violent and verbally aggressive. Again with the “shut up”. And yes it did end up breaking her car. She also usually drives on the wrong side of the road, in the middle, or on the sidewalks. She just recently harassed a couple outside our house driving slowly. Her paranoia made her think they were “stealing our WiFi”, so she went out there and screamed at them. I know this all sounds ridiculous, but I’m trying to give an idea of how mentally delusional and damaged they are. And again, this leads to me begging for them to get help. One of them hallucinates and when she hallucinates me, she thinks it’s real and blames me for what the hallucination does. Usually just hallucinates me staring at her or waking her up. She then usually wakes me up yelling at me to leave her alone. 

How do I get these people help if they desperately believe they are fine and refuse help? I am also a minor and can’t force them to do anything. I don’t want to get personal, but they have threatened to kill me, have been known by police, CPS, and dhhs, for child abuse, and many people have witnessed it in public. Should I just leave them be and try and stay sane until I am ready to leave? Should I leave now? How can I make them get help? What do I do? I am very lost. This has been bothering me for years.

So like I stated, when I was 16 I had a friend who I'll call Baby(she was into ddlg and was 17). Now baby and I were best friends, and one day during a sleepover, she introduces me to her ""daddy""(21) over a video call and thats where it started. He asked for my snapchat after that. A couple days after we started talking he started intruducing me to ddlg which makes me super uncomfortable in the first place but because I'm into bondage he started with just talk of that and then once I got close to him he started pushing for more ""baby"" like things. Baby even got me a pacifire because he wanted to see me sucking on one and me being a stupid teen who thinks this guy actually loves me, i sent pictures of me with it. 
One day when Baby and I were hanging out she starts crying about how ever since I started talking to him hes been talking about nothing but me. That was where I lost all grip on reality and actually thought he would be caring. 
One day after i got off school, he texted me saying he was going to pick me up to hang out with Baby and him. I end up telling my mom im staying after school to hang out with some friends...
As he and I are on our way to babys house he tells me that her mom got home from work and now we cant pick her up. (Babys mom has already caught baby and him together and does not allow him in her house anymore) we still drive to her apartment complex and he parks. I think we're waiting for my friend to meet us but he starts talking about how beautiful I am and starts bringing up texts. Now the texts hes talking about are ones he forced me to send because he would constantly want attention and nudes and would stop at nothing to get them. If i ignored him he would spam call me or spam text me until I responded and me being a stupid teen, i thought this was what true love was like.
Before i can even process whats going on, im sitting in the back seat holding up my skirt. From what baby told me, he hates the feel of condoms and never uses them, and that alone made me freak out. But when i really realized something was wrong was when I ended up throwing up because of how nervous and scared I was and he said ""that was kinda hot"" and proceeded to continue without making sure I was okay. He ended up tearing something and even when it hurt he wouldn't slow down. Sadly that wasn't the last time.
The next time it happend was when baby him and I went swimming together. The whole time i was so scared someone was going to see us and I just wanted to swim and have fun but he was too worried about swapping between pussies. And the worst part was when I tried to pull away because he tore something again and I was really hurting, Baby would grab me and drag me over.

I cant talk with my friends or anyone yet as we're still in an early stage of the pregnancy and im flipping. tomorrow I am supposed to do the second and final round of interview  for the job and im about to cancel and just make peace with staying in my shit job with a slightly above average salary and zero career development opportunities. Any advice? Cheers to everyone who will reply",10Nov2020,1
727,"So, I live with my in laws. Me and my husband moved in with them to help them with a farm they had recently purchased and to save up to build a house of our own nearby. We completely remodeled the huge basement that they had and live down there currently. It’s a little embarrassing to admit but it’s not so bad.

Anyway, my father in law had gotten sick with COVID last week. We didn’t get the test results back until Thursday, but they confirmed it was COVID. My mother and brother in law then started getting symptoms as well not long after. For the most part I’ve stayed away from my in laws by just staying down in the basement and only going up to do some laundry. Same with my husband and neither of us have gotten sick yet. We even got tested Sunday and both our results came back negative. 

Whenever my father in law got the results back I immediately told my boss and HR who just said that as long as we’re not showing symptoms, tests come back negative and the health department hasn’t called then we can still work. Well, flash forward to today my father in law gets the call from the health department BUT he leaves out me and my husbands names so we don’t have to get quarantined with them.

Me, my husband and his father all work in the same place and everyone pretty much knows our living situations at work. HR even knows. What happens if we do wind up getting it? Start the quarantine all over again? Get more people sick? I was baffled. HR hasn’t contacted me yet and I don’t even know if they will. 

Not sure if we should keep doing what we’re doing since we’re not sick or just tell someone and get ourselves quarantined with them. What in the world do I do? Sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but I don’t want people around me to get sick.",10Nov2020,1
728,"I'm 14 years old. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm torn between telling my best friend the complete truth about me: my parents' divorce, my depression, my anxiety, my suicidal thoughts, and attempts. How even my teachers pity me because they know everything. How I randomly start crying even if there's nothing to cry about. How most of the time I literally fall asleep crying because of everything going on in my fucked up life. How I'm scared I'll lose the other friends that I have, even if they are crackheads who make fun of me, they still are fun to hang out with. I rarely open up to people. This whole year has been rough for me with all of my issues. I wasn't myself for months and nobody noticed. My normal self-personality is a mix between a teen who makes poor decisions, a 62-year-old woman who's tired and needs a nap, and an anxious mom who's always paranoid. That's how I am around my brother's and my close family. When I'm around my other family like cousins or grandparents, I act like everything is fine. No one noticed that all my life I've been faking being this bubbly, awkward, funny, kid who jokes around about being confident. I had always comforted myself by listening to music and being by myself because I always worried that if I told my family or friends what I was going through and how it made me feel, they wouldn't understand, they wouldn't try to help, or they worry that they are doing something while trying to help.

Long story short, I got the tip of my finger crushed and went straight to the ER to get it stitched.

I’m an introvert and I’m really bad at social situation. I keep a low profile at work but with this, upper management and my colleagues are going to keep asking me if I’m feeling alright, and I can’t exactly hide the splint when I go back to work. I know they’re just concerned about my well-being but I’ve already become a robot at the daily greetings “how are you today?” “I’m fine, thankyou and how about you?” And I don’t know how to otherwise respond... 

How should I actually reply when they ask me how I’m feeling?

Im not dumb. I do have that white girl voice and i do think acting stupid around people im comfortable with is super funny, but i graduated with a 3.5 gpa, im going to college for 6 years. My intelligence is more emotional than practical.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to be respected more. It's really degrading on my mental health to be treated like I'm dumb.

I dont have any disorders other than anxiety. I am introverted and i prefer to keep to myself, i dont talk a lot and social situations tire me out, which you think would make me seem more intelligent.

731,"
To start off it’s not a simple as me locking my door because her room is in the redone attic which requires her to go through my room in order for her to get to hers, there is no door on the entrance into her room because it got taken down a years ago in order to get a little extra space in my room.

I’ve told her COUNTLESS times not to take my things without asking and the rare times she does ask and I say no she will either find a way to get to whatever it is she wants without me knowing or she’ll continue to pester me. Despite the fact my room is relatively messy I like having my stuff exactly where I put it and if something is missing or out of place because of my sister taking I get so frustrated that I start crying because I can’t do anything to stop it.

I’ve told my parents but they end up getting more mad at me yelling at her rather than reprimanding her for taking my things. This problem has been going on for so long and I hate it, honestly the only solution that might possibly work is physically hitting her or something but even then I’ll get yelled at. 

I’m so fed up with having zero privacy and my parents doing nothing about it and I honestly don’t know what to do. My room is already pretty messy right now because I’ve been to busy with school to clean it so that alone has me stressed out but her continuously doing this is only making my stress worse, I legit stayed up till midnight last night bc my sister was taking a late shower and I knew she wanted my cleanser so I was making sure she didn’t steal it, somehow though she stole my moisturizer instead while I wasn’t looking and when I yelled at her for it I got yelled at because I was waking everyone up, in the midst of me pestering her for my moisturizer though she threw her fake tan lotion at me so I took it and she kept saying “give me back my stuff” as if she doesn’t constantly take mine. 

I don’t know what to do because I live in a small house and my sister obviously won’t respect my privacy unless my parents do something more than just telling her to give it to me.",10Nov2020,1

733,"Normally, I drift away from being deep into thought at night time. This usually doesn't take long at all, like 10-20 minutes. Past few days have been awful though, I haven't been able to sleep in a reasonable amount of time, I'll lie in bed eyes closed with no distractions and I won't be able to fall asleep for hours. One day it was so bad, I took 12mg of melatonin and still managed to stay awake for another hour + I was already tired.

What happened for it to be like this: It was just a normal night, and I got jolted awake when drifting a away by a family member, this caused me to be pissed off but I tried again, instead of falling asleep, I was just constantly angry that I wasn't asleep. This would continue until either A. I have to goto the washroom or B. I need to drink water.

Now after that, it's just been a constant cycle

Get into bed --&gt; Drink water --&gt; Close my eyes --&gt; Think about how I'm not falling asleep --&gt; Get pissed off --&gt; Realize I have to take a piss/drink water --&gt; Open my eyes --&gt; Try again.

This continues on for 2 hours minimum, and no matter what I try i.e meditation (focusing on my breath), podcasts, music, reading a book, trying to distract myself with thoughts. Everything get's overridden by a mild amount of frustration, and that keeps me awake.

I don't think it's insomnia, but it's definitely getting to that point, so I need some help or guidance on my issue.",10Nov2020,1

I happen to be taking among other courses, Intro to French. Problem is, about a month ago, my Zoom meetings for my assigned TA lab haven't been happening. I found out not too long ago, that my lab was cancelled, and we (the students) meant to switch to another zoom schedule. I was not aware of this. So, i attempted yet again, this time with the new zoom meeting, to try and attend my classes. Then my computer kept crashing, the cursor freezing, forcing me to close my laptop and restart it over and over. I got frustrated, and emailed the TA, where i said 

""This has been every lab  (includes photo of zoom meting) for so long know I can't even say. Do we even have labs in this class? I thought I saw a guys face before my computer fucked me, AGAIN. Now I'm trying to rejoin Whateverthefuck, and I get this. (blank zoom page) I'm not trying to be belligerent, I'm just stressed and want to know what the fuck?"" 

Today, I receive an email from my prof saying that i broke terms of agreement, and will be banned from all zoom meetings (seminar + labs) I of course when itno ass kissing mode, explaining my technical issues along with this being a month long struggle, and i was worried about my grade in the class (not attending a lab for a month is a problem).

735,"I'm 22 and held off going to school in order to save myself a nice goose egg of money as a sort of ""safety net"" for when I did decide to go to college. This has been the biggest life altering event in my life so far, and I feel like I've just wasted the past 2 years of my life saving money when I could've just went to college right away...

I'll keep what happened brief. I was contacted by my father on Facebook messenger asking if I could help him do some money transfers for him. Now it should be known, that I only ever talk to my dad on Facebook messenger and quite occasionally on the phone as he lives far away from me. I should also mention that a couple weeks prior to receiving this message, we talked on the phone and he mentioned that he was laid off from his job he worked for 9 years due to COVID-19, so I genuinely was very concerned for him and thought he was having financial troubles.

Unfortunately, I found out too late that somebody had actually managed to hack into my father's Facebook account and pretended to be my dad asking for help. I found this out when I was called by my dad trying to warn me, but it was too late. He mimicked the way my dad texts perfectly, and made it believable that this was dad I was speaking to. I was manipulated into divulging personal information and one thing leads to another and I now no longer have any money in my accounts and he attempted to take out loans and lines of credit in my name. 

Obviously there's much more to the story, but this is a short summary of what I've gone through.  

Besides being mentally and emotionally drained right now, I'm now very paranoid and I've had to change passwords for everything, file police reports, contact credit bureaus and change everything over to new accounts through my bank and I've so stressed out that I can't even begin to think what I'm going to do after I've secured everything and absolved the debts created.

Honestly, I'm extremely embarrassed about this situation I've been put in and my self esteem is at an all time low and I don't even know if I can make the right decision making anymore. I guess that's why I've come here for advice.

It was like my hand suddenly forgot how the feeling of weight of the pencil was suppose to be, and I couldn't direct my hand to do anything right. I thought it was due to me being rusty from the lack of practice but now my wrist (on the right), is beginning to really hurt? My fingers on my right hand feel all weak and wobbly too.

737,"I'm a 32 year old guy, married to my wife (29) of 6 years with our 5 month old son. We've had a few ups and downs, but for the most part, have been happily together for several years and I wouldn't give it up for anything.

Recently, my parents have wanted to become more involved in our lives since we now have our son. Before, they had remained distant, letting us ""do our own thing"" in their words. I've never wanted to force a relationship and have done my own thing with my wife. Since this development, though, I've had these conflicting thoughts arise where I wouldn't mind their involvement to some degree. My wife is, understandably, against it and would rather they not be involved since they've done me wrong in the past, giving my troublesome younger brother attention to try and keep him out of trouble while I was left to my own devices.

I've told her I wanted our son to know both sides of our family. I want him to be able to see all of his family and make his own decisions. The problem arises because I also agree with her and am conflicted. 

Basically, the good in me wants to move on and give them that chance. The logical side of me says to leave them high and dry and, if they really want to be involved, let them come to us rather than conforming to them. It's caused some tension between my wife and I that I'd rather not have. She's told me that it was my decision, but it's obviously tearing her up, too.

So how should I go about moving on with this? Am I a dumbass for allowing my parents to have this kind of hold on me, or is it justified to want to give them a chance, even if they haven't been the best to me in the past? If clarification is needed, I am willing to discuss the details. Thank you all for any advice given.",10Nov2020,1

739,"This isn't about legal advice. I have NO legal options other than to just deal with it so... how do I deal with this?

Okay, where do I start? The first thing to mention; I (14M) live with my parents, 2 cats and a rabbit. Neither of my parents work paying jobs, so we just live off of the benefits given to us by the council. Here's the thing; both my parents vape... a lot. My mother also smokes. Mother smoking is an issue I've tried to sort out for years but it hasn't worked. My parents spend a lot of the benefits that we are supposed to live off of, on their own luxuries. Such as vaping, cigarettes, power tools, clothes, the list goes on.

This selfishness is so extensive, to the point where we struggle to get food in the house. Not just for us, but also the pets. And now, my parents have dug themselves into a hole. They've spent so much, that they're now having to pay back a lot of money. My mother informed me that we can't buy food for like 2-3 more weeks, so we just have to make do with what we have currently. Which we really don't have a lot of. Our food situation is already bad. It was bad, and now it's worse. Because not only do they have to pay back a lot of money to the bank, but they also have to keep up with the bills at the same time.

My parents are nice(?) people. Kinda. They blame me for ""eating everything"" when they're the reason for the lack of food in the first place. They don't physically abuse me, thankfully. My dad can say some nasty stuff sometimes which... honestly sometimes really hurts me. And mother... well, I don't have much to say about her. She's a big part of the reason for the lack of food, etc. but she is kind. Sort of. I mean, they both just... dismiss all my thoughts and opinions. I can't open up to any of them. My dad ridicules me, my mother tells me to stop bothering her... yet when there are times I wind up in the hospital on a psych hold, they tell me I can speak to them about anything I want, anytime.

I must admit, I'm scared for my future. Everything is going downhill. I can't get a job myself for a few reasons. First of all, currently, there's a mandatory lockdown going on where I live, so I doubt I can get one for a while. I'm also 14. Most jobs here, you have to be 16 for. Not to mention; my crippling anxiety. That'd be incredibly difficult to deal with. I also can't get a debit card to start saving. As I've said, there's a mandatory lockdown. And also, as I've said, mother dismisses my thoughts and opinions completely. I've asked her to come and help me like a kjhillion times. Every time, I've been yelled at to stop bothering her, or ""just wait"". This is over a long period of time. I also can't just up and leave. Again, I'm 14.

My options are... slim to none. I can report this to the council, sure. But is my situation even bad enough? And even if it was... what then? All my other relatives are out of town and have their own families anyway, with no space for me. No one wants to take in a 14-year-old with crippling mental health issues. Even if they did, my said mental health will get 10x worse, I just wouldn't be able to cope.",10Nov2020,1
740,"here is some backstory: my brother (m17) and his girlfriend (f16) have been dating for about eight months. my brother has always been a douchebag. period. their relationship has always been toxic from the beginning. his girlfriend’s mom is in prison and her father is an addict, so she lives with her grandmother. because of her circumstances, she is very vulnerable and easy to manipulate, which my brother has taken advantage of. 

anyways, i asked one of my friends today if she still talked to an old friend of ours. (keep in mind that we are still in high school). let’s call her sarah. my friend told me that sarah’s parents had put her on lockdown because she had gotten in trouble. my friend’s mom and sarah’s mom are best friends, so sarah’s mom told her what happened. my friend’s mom then told her, but apparently she was not supposed to tell her anything. 

sarah’s parents were upset that she was sexting with someone over snapchat and sending him nudes. apparently, that someone happened to be my brother. 

there are a few conflicts here. 

1. my friend was not supposed to know, so i am not supposed to know. i do not want to tangle my friend into this and potentially ruin her and sarah’s moms friendship.

2. i am not close with my brother’s girlfriend at all. i dont even know her last name tbh. so i wouldn’t know how to contact her without causing suspicion. 

3. because these texts between sarah and my brother were over snapchat, there is a potential that there is no concrete evidence in my brother’s phone. i don’t want to tell his girlfriend to look through his phone and not find anything and make myself look like an asshole.

I was just notified this morning of a 2nd outbreak at my new warehouse job. I started just this week, and there have already been 2 outbreaks. I am actually terrified to go to work now because I don't want to get sick, nor do i want to infect the people I live with.

I emailed HR and asked them what my options are. They basically said that each employee only gets 4 days of unpaid, unexcused leave per year, and if I exceed that, then I will likely be terminated from the job. And unless, I am actually diagnosed with COVID, they don't give any paid time off. So apparently, being worried you'll contract COVID isn't a viable excuse to take unpaid time off work.

I only asked if I could take 2-3 weeks off to assess the ongoing situation at the warehouse to see if it gets better, then to resume employment when it does get better.

Now, this wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that his brother, 6, is the absolute worst child I've ever had to put up with. I'll call him Jack. Now, Jack often comes into my boyfriend's room when I get there and will stay in there until I go home. He is very hyper as most kids are, which while sort of annoying, I can get past. But he also just constantly causes all sorts of trouble to the point where I can't even enjoy my time with my boyfriend. If we're watching a movie, Jack will turn it off. If we're cuddling, Jack will insert himself between me and my bf or jump on me until I move. If we're taking a nap together, Jack will consistently try to wake us up, whether that be by hitting us or by just being loud and yelling at us to wake up. It doesn't matter what we're doing, Jack wants to get in the way. Just the other day he hit me in the eye with a Playstation controller because I told him I didn't want to play with him. Not only that, Jack is kind of gross as well. He spits on me and my belongings, farts on me and my belongings, licks me, slobbers on me and my things, picks his nose and wipes it on me/my things, etc etc. Jack really likes me and the rare times my bf does kick him out, which is only when he is VERY bad, he throws a huge tantrum which is even more awkward, so his parents and my bf usually just let him stay in with us to avoid his meltdowns. He'll kick and scream and hit me/my bf/his parents. I hate going to see my boyfriend because of this. I'd go as far as to say I dread going to my boyfriends.

760," 

So the title doesn't really speak for the question. This is really open ended, I think even just other people's experiences would help.

I hope I'm asking in the right reddit. as for info: im 16 y/o female turning 17 really soon, and all people mentioned in this post are about the same

Pt.1

There's this guy (call him Potato) that ive been friends with online for almost a year now. We talk all the time, I have his number, I hang out with his friends, we've talked about meeting in person several times after the COVID-19 situation, and I might be going to college there. I'm really inexperienced when it comes to relationships, and I think I like him. But, I keep asking myself if I really do. I know that isn't really a question anyone else can answer for me, but I'm just confused. We talk a lot about our personal problems, and ""Potato"" and I are super close, but sometimes I feel like maybe I don't necessarily like him, I'm just gravitating towards him because he has shown me such kindness and understanding of my mental. 

I thought for a while that the crush was mutual, but now I'm not so sure. I also have been thinking lately that perhaps it's that I like him, but I don't think it will work. I'm not sure what to do about my feelings. I'm worried that meeting all my friends would make my closer relationship with him as friend dissipate, but I'm simultaneously worried about letting it grow. My current idea is that I just wait until I meet him in person till I do anything about the feelings if I do anything in the first place.

Pt.2

Okay there's another guy. Call him ""Carrot"". I met him a few days ago also online. I don't necessarily like him, the vibe he gives me is kind of strange and I'm not sure what to think but he seems like a perfectly good kid so I hang out with him sometimes. He asked me for my snapchat and my Instagram, both of which I gave him because I just didn't mind i guess? I made sure to hide my stories from him and other such privacy measures just in case. Thing is, the first thing I did when he asked for Instagram was go archive a bunch of my posts. I'm just insecure, I didn't want him to see anything I disliked about myself. But it's so dumb, because like, I don't even like the guy, what am I so afraid of? I'm not really sure where ""Carrot"" fits in, but I thought I'd throw him in this post because my interaction with him is what sparked all of this thinking in the first place.

Pt.3

Thank you if you've read this far lol. I don't really know what my question is, maybe I'm just looking for advice via a discussion? I think I'm frustrated with myself for my insecurities and for my lack of decisiveness in recognizing how I feel. There's not a whole lot anyone can do about it, but I thought talking to someone about it might help me understand better. I would usually talk to ""Potato"" about this but obviously I can't since he's involved. 

Other stuff:

I actually met Potato after I met his friends. Everyone in the group and me included are pretty close, and me going to visit or them coming here includes all of us. It's not ""Potato"" specific. 

I think what I'm starting to find is that I have very lofty goals for the future that I am afraid may not work well with these friends of mine (Potato's group). I want to go to a good university in California when I graduate (which is in January, so I'm applying for Fall 2021 term), and that's where they live. But I'm starting to feel like maybe I was viewing living in CA and meeting these people in person as synonymous, when they aren't. They are two different things-- meeting them should be a perk of living there.

I'm really sorry there's a whole lot of stuff in this post I don't really know what I'm doing. Any thoughts at all are welcome, backstories, responses, anything at all. Thanks for reading this random post about random things :"")",10Nov2020,1
761,"My(21f) friends(19-20f) have all been friends since high school. We started to grow apart during college. One of my friends left the country two years ago to continue his college education closed to family. Unfortunately, we had a fight and I haven’t talked to him since. He’s unblocked me on Snapchat but I just have no idea how to reach out and apologize tbh, we’re both at fault for the situation and I know I wasn’t mature enough at the time to deal with the situation properly. 

My other friends started to get different political views from me. They’re becoming more and more left wing, which is ok but we can’t even play cards against humanity anymore cuz they find it offensive. I’m pretty much left wing with right wing views. 

The election drove us apart completely I think. They are hardcore Democrats and think that it’s dumb that I “pick and choose” things to believe in. They make me feel like I’m a centrist who doesn’t know where I stand politically but I do. For example, I support gay rights, denounce racism, etc. But I also think that people shouldn’t be hypocrites about it and say offensive things about white people or say that all white people should die. My friends hate that viewpoint of mine(they’re also white btw). 

One of my friends was dating an Asian girl one for a bit and she told us to our face that she thinks white people should die. And my friend agreed with her girlfriend!!  It rubbed me the wrong way...people keep telling me it’s not a big deal but racism is racism. Is it that hard to be friendly to each other?

So back to the election. I didn’t like Trump or Biden. I voted third party. My friends thought it was dumb that I wasn’t a fan of Biden. I don’t wanna get into it too much cuz I know it’s a touchy subject right now but I just didn’t like our choices this election. 

I said something to my friends along the lines of “we gotta make sure Biden doesn’t get away with some of the shifty things politicians always do. Just because he’s better than Trump doesnt mean he can get away with normal politician things.”

They responded with “Biden wouldn’t do that. He’s not a republican” 

I called them naive and we ended up debating/arguing about it before we just stopped responding to the group chat. 

Then my friend sent a video of people celebrating Biden’s win in a giant crowd. I said “isn’t that kinda dangerous with the pandemic getting worse?” 

And they said “No it’s not too bad. They’re all wearing masks and celebrating so it’s ok”

All I could do was say “wat”

There were people with masks clearly pulled down. And just because it’s a celebration means that the pandemic just stopped?? I didn’t understand it and they basically told me that I’m just acting like that cuz I hate Biden(I said I didn’t trust him fully, as you should with any political leader in today’s climate). Cue another argument and now none of us are talking to each other. 

I’m at my wits end tbh. My friends seem to be illogical right now and it’s driving me crazy. I know they’re at that stage in life where they are figuring out who they are and whatnot but some of this is just crazy. I don’t know if our friendship can survive. I don’t know how to deal with losing all of my friends. I still have my girlfriend but it’s sad to think that I am now friendless.",10Nov2020,1
762,"I (13M) moved to Cumberland County PA from Sonoma County CA for a number of issues. Fires, drought, blah blah blah. I consider myself rather introverted and the only way I kept socializing in Cali was through the friends I made in K-2nd grade and the friends I made vicariously through them. When I got to middle school, the first few months (all online classes) I knew nobody and nothing about anyone. I kept my mic and camera off the entire class and nobody knew I existed. Now, I’m gonna be starting fresh and I’m so scared. I don’t know how different it’s gonna be compared to California. I have hybrid learning and my first day is going to be in-person. Pennsylvania is so wierd. I live in a red county, all my neighbors are trump supporters, and a ton of other things that are unheard of in California. How am I gonna fit in? What do I do?

I don’t know how should I say or type this.

Or even start off.

-Backstory-

Yesterday, my sisters, niece and nephew went to go get Popeyes from out of town. I was with my mom and a family friend to get black walnuts. Once we got back, we ate and watched tv. My sisters came back with food and walked to the room. Before, one of my sisters asked if I could put her clothes in the dryer. She’ll give me $3 if I do so. Knowing that I need money for Christmas, I did it. I know that $3 isn’t enough, I even asked why but she said that I’m just washing clothes, nothing else

Once I finished, I went to the couch next to my mom and messed around on my phone. A few minutes later, my sister texted me asking if I dried her clothes. I said I did and she told me to go to her room to get the fries. I happily did and once I walked to the living room, I offered some fries to my mom and the family friend, but they declined the offer.

I ate them, feeling slightly bad since I’m eating food that my sister bought and two people aren’t. As I went to lay down in my room, my mom came in and asked me why I took the fries. I told her that my sister told me to go put her clothes to dry. My mom ended up scolding me about it and told me that I’ll be grounded if I accept anything else from her. A couple minutes later, my older sister came in the room and gave me the money.

Now to present time, my mom called my little sister and scolded her about going to my older sister’s house. They argued for quite a bit and my mom started crying as she explained the situation with the fries. She felt bad for me because she thought that my older sister would give me food if I dried her clothes. I wanted to cry as well because my mom was crying for me but I realized that I failed to mention that my older sister would give me money if I dried her clothes.

Am I being an a—hole to my mom for making her cry? Should I tell her what really happened and what I was suppose to get?",10Nov2020,1

768,"Hey guys. Wondering what you guys think. I used to be a heavy smoker (pack and a half everyday for 6 years) then decided I needed to change and cut down, so then I started a pack a day, 15 cigs, 12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 to where I now only smoke 2-4 cigs a week when I start getting a craving or when I’m having a beer; yay me I guess :)

But someone told me I should start vaping and recommended juule, or stigs (I tried no nicotine/ low vape but it was gross and felt like air and made me crave more, also I hate that the devices would sometimes leak into my mouth and the whole thing with coils was just a hassle) However, my only concern with juule and stigs for example is the insane amount of nicotine. One pod is like smoking 20 cigs worth of nicotine, and I have seen people smoke through em in a day or two.

While I’ve heard that vape at least doesn’t have many of those filthy chemicals in cigs, I’m worried the insane amount of nicotine would make me more addicted and smoke more (vaping can be like a pacifier and I experienced that) and actually take me away from my goal of minimal-no dependence to nicotine. Also, I’ve been hearing more stories about the dangers of vaping and that we are learning it isn’t completely safe as people thought it was. So what do you guys think? Continue down my road? Or buy stigs.

775,"So I (26F) asked a man (20M) for his number at the gym and he gave me his snapchat instead.  I took this as him not being interested so I never messaged him.  Three days later he sent me a snap going 'Heyyy?' and we've been talking on and off for about a month now.  Apparently, people around his age actually exchange snapchat names more commonly than numbers? 

I had no idea he was 20 until after I got his snapchat, but he told me he didn't mind the age difference and I still think he's pretty good looking and wouldn't mind getting to know him more. He is an adult, but he's young and I don't want to make him feel obligated to do anything because of the age difference.

Let me also say that I am more used to men asking for my numbers/leading the conversation, so I have NO IDEA how to lead the conversation and that's where my confidence is kind of failing me.

That's where I am not sure if he is into me or not.  He will snapchat me back and we will have occasional conversations once in a while, but when I asked him if he wanted to hang out, he pulled a rain check on me the day of.  He has continued to snap chat me since, but at the gym, he avoided my gaze when I tried to give him a brief wave. One of my closest friends who is 21 said that he may feel intimidated, but I am not sure. I figured I would ask him out one more time, and if he says no/rain check again, I thought I'd send him a message like this:

""I think you're really good looking and I was interested in getting to know you more in person and possibly hooking up if that was something you'd be into.  I just want to know where we stand and if you are interested or not because I don't want to waste our time.""

I don't want to make it sound like I'm assuming/jumping to conclusions, but if he cancels one more time, I think I'd like to know what he wants. I wouldn't want him snapchatting me just because we both go to the same gym and he's worried about making things awkward, because they won't be. I'm an adult and, if he turns me down, I am totally fine with that, in fact, it would be a relief because I would know my answer!

Now, the situation is that there is a lot of corona cases that has been going on in the city where I work.

The first grader isn't gaining in literacy even though reading is part of our daily regimen for all of our kids. We have dozens of books for every reading level. She's just not getting it. I have a 2nd grader in a special class and The special ed teacher wants me to come to the every single week to get materials and that school is way out of my way. He has to attend due to his difficulties but during the week I have no transportation since my husband is working and needs our vehicle. The materials I have from her I can't find even though I had it organized because I don't have the resources to keep it all contained
I tried keeping most of the materials in closets, drawers and an old crib but it gets messed up by mid week. The teachers make a thousand demands of my time a day. I am constantly chasing after materials and crying and in distress because I'm not getting enough sleep at night because I'm fighting a twelve year old who has sleep psychologist and sleep meds and still doesn't sleep at night
And my first grader sometimes for some god awful reason wakes up at 4 am to play with her siblings then by the time sign in comes up she is tired. I don't know what to do this year.

I used zipper bags to keep crayons together but my child broke all the goddamned crayons.

One time when I was 10 years old I saw a kid  playing Minecraft on the school computer. I asked him how he was able to do that and he offers to show me. He goes on my computer and downloads Minecraft unblocked and starts the game. So here I am playing Minecraft thinking “Hey this can’t be legal can it? Minecraft is supposed to cost money and this kid downloaded for free.” When I get home I look it up and realize “Yes, yes obviously it’s illegal you stupid fucking child.” I was terrified that I would get caught, my parents would be fined, I would be thrown into jail, and my entire life would be ruined because some kid accidentally pirated Minecraft on the school laptop. I would get anxious for weeks every time I thought about it until I forgot about it.

Now I’m still a stupid kid, just a bit less stupid so I have a few questions:

1. Is there any way that this could affect me now or in the future? That happened 5 years ago when I was 10 and I didn’t even know it was anything bad until I got home and looked it up.

2. How do I stop feeling guilty about this? I was 10 and didn’t know what the kid was doing, the other kid probably learned it from someone else and didn’t realize what he was doing, but every time I think about it, it feels like there’s a pit in my stomach. I forgot about this for 5 years and now I suddenly remember it and I can’t stop thinking about the one time I accidentally played a pirated Minecraft. I wasn’t even the one who downloaded it or created it but I still feel extremely guilty.",10Nov2020,1
791,"I've been trying to get a corrected copy of my social security card for over a year. The problem I have run into is that in order to obtain that, I need a state issued ID or driver's license, which I don't have and cannot get because of the lack of a social security card. This issue is completely cyclic and it's baffling that this sort of problem was never taken into consideration when penning the standards by which you get an ID or SS card. 

The reason I have been running into this issue is because I got the name change over 2 years ago, and the reason I didn't get this handled sooner rather than later is due to some unexpected personal factors out of my control I won't bother getting into here. In order to correct the SS card since it was done over 2 years ago, I need some form of identification.

They would not accept my birth certificate, which has my old name on it anyway. My insurance card only has my current name and no DOB. I have no way to get any of this figured out, but I need an ID for countless important reasons. I've been running in circles for ages, been on hold with many different customer support lines, etc, but it's all reached a dead end.

797,"Strap in, this is a long one. Not adding a TL;DR because I can't feasibly condense this all into a few sentences.

I've always lived as a purely analytical, logical person that is more realistic and acts on rational thoughts and ideas. I've rarely entertained thoughts and things I find stupid or useless, and I've lived comfortably knowing that. If I stayed like this the rest of my life, I likely would want to pursue some sort of job in computer science or game development, maybe start a business and then settle down either by myself or with an SO if I find one. I'm content with that idea. Sounds normal enough.   


I've also always been supportive of the people around me, and rarely care what/who you identify as or are attracted to, because that doesn't concern me at all. It's not my issue, so I don't need to get involved. I tend to stay out of messy situations in terms of emotion/relationships and other things like that because it isn't something I'm particularly good at, especially if I'm involved in it. If I'm an onlooker it's a different story, but that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

Recently I was writing a paper for my literature class about my experiences and who I was as a person, and I started looking at all the things I liked/connected with, and somehow came around to videogame characters, I assume because I spend most of my time playing games and talking about them with my friends. Two of my favorite characters came to mind almost immediately, and I'm not going to reveal who they are because that's not important. What's important is that they both struggled with identity, anxiety, who they were, and by the end of each game come to a realization about themselves; both characters happen to be trans. 

Backstory finished. Over a few days I was thinking about who I want to be versus who I am now. I'm happy as myself for a portion of the time. I figured out that many days I'm content with who I am and what I want to do. However there are some days where I feel out of place, lazy, boring, and an overall slob: not my normal self. These days most often come after I'm feeling adventurous: like I want to do something, but then I never do it. I feel like I cheated myself out of a good experience, and so I spiral down into sadness. However when I do give in to the urge to do something new and exciting, I feel like I'm doing something wrong or I'm not who I was meant to be. 

So while thinking about it, I've defined two sides of myself. The first being what I've always been: the rational, logical thinking guy who has a set plan for himself and his future, and the second self: the whimsical, spontaneous, free-spirited person that does stuff on the fly and just goes places and doesn't care much about how we get there. These sides can't seem to coexist, at least not in the same body/mind, because of how much stress/self loathing that both cause me when they clash. It's always either ""You're not being productive or useful"" or ""You're being too strict, loosen up"".

So when I was thinking about these two different identities or personalities or whatever they're called, I was thinking about physical embodiments of them to see if I could differentiate them and kind of separate who they are. The first is who I've always been, like I said earlier: the logical, hard-working guy. The second one took me a bit of time. This is where it starts to get even more icky: I've always wondered what it's like to be a girl, as I'm sure many guys have. I started out thinking that my other side is just another guy and he's just looser but it never stuck with me, I could never picture another form of me as a guy. Whenever I think of me as a guy, I think of ***me***. So when I entertained the thought that maybe this other side of me is a girl, I was able to kind of rewrite myself and who I was. The more I thought about this other side being a girl, the more it fit. So now we're down to two battling identities over one body: The rational, hard-working guy who wants success and validation versus the free-spirited, spontaneous girl that just wants to experience something *exciting*. 

I've always been the guy. No matter what I've experienced, where I've been, or who I've been with. But there's always been an itch that comes out every now and then just telling me to explore that other side that's always been in the back of my mind. 

And so we get to the advice part. I'm torn. Some part of me is telling me that I've literally made all of this up just to get out of the stale and bland existence that I live in, while the other is telling me that this isn't a phase, and it's something that I might stick with the rest of my life. 

I've always been overpowered by my rational side. I'm leaning towards this just being a phase and me making stuff up, but there's still an inkling of doubt just sitting there in the back of my mind: it's why I've made this post. 

I'm lost on what to do next or whether I'm actually feeling this way or if I've made it up. I need another source of input. What do you think?",10Nov2020,1
798,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this. I just don’t know where else to post it. 

When I’m in a social setting I feel better about life. I’m able to put my worries aside and function well when I’m interacting with people like when I’m at work, with friends, etc. But when I’m by myself, I often let my worries start to cloud my mind. I really don’t have control over it. I know that it’s bad for me to fall into a spiral of overthinking, but the harder I try not to, the worse it gets. There have been multiple times where my entire day has been ruined by this. Shit, even in the worst cases my whole week has been ruined by it. I’d fall into these sort of “overthinking episodes”, as I like to call them, and I wouldn’t even be able to respond to texts or return phone calls. Then once I felt better I’d try to pick things back up, return people’s calls and lie to them telling them I was just busy with something. When in reality I was worrying so much that I literally could not function. 

This has had a negative effect on my life in the past. But as time goes on, my constant worrying/ concern about everything going on in the present, and my future, is ironically doing way more harm than good. I feel like I’m holding myself back from living a fulfilling life, or at least as fulfilling as it could be, but I don’t mean to do this to myself. I just don’t know how to stop this pattern of behavior. 

I feel like I’m going on a tangent so I’ll end it here. I guess I’m just trying to find any advice that I can on how to get over this. If anyone on here is dealing with the same thing, or something similar, just know that I feel for you and know how hard it is. Thank you.",10Nov2020,1
799," Hello!

I am a 19-year-old woman who really struggles to find meaning in life outside of my relationships.

If I don't have a friend group, family member, or romantic partner I consistently see, I really can't find happiness.

I love painting, writing, and exercising, but I find without socializing, I quickly lose my will to do any of those things.

I have been struggling for months to keep going, every day I get up and force myself to get dressed even though I'm not going anywhere, paint and draw, even though no one will see it, and work out even though my body will not be used to communicate with anyone. I have gotten a therapist and started meditation as well. I have also taken up online communities but it really isn't the same.

I just don't feel happy if I can't share my life with others.

Is this just human nature?

Is it abnormal to not feel happy if I don't have social interaction?

TL;DR Is it normal to need social interactions to feel joy, even if I have an otherwise balanced life of hobbies, exercise, and therapy?",10Nov2020,1
800,"I didn’t know where else to go that wouldn’t be disrespectful to my mom by bringing it up to people she knows, but I have to talk about this with someone. I’m 26/F, happily engaged and getting married in two years. My dad isn’t in the picture, so my mom is (or at least was supposed to be) walking me down the aisle. Over the weekend, I went to a David’s Bridal for the first time with my best friend and her mom for her own wedding. I was there to get fitted for my very own hideous purple bridesmaid dress, which I say with love. She’s obsessed with the color purple, which I truly find endearing and I’m happy to wear whatever she wants. While we were looking at mother-of-the-bride dresses for my friend’s mom, I brought up the fact that my mom already has planned what she will be wearing in my wedding party, did not ever run it past me, and it’s a dress that doesn’t match the colors of my wedding. It’s also a short dress, which I find odd considering we’re getting married outside upstate at the end of October. I am also autistic, so weird things like matching colors and uniformity are important to me. I’m a very low-maintenance person normally, but I never went to prom or balls or anything growing up, I never had a sweet 16 or any major parties, so this day really means a lot to me. I think a long dress on my mom would make more sense and look more elegant standing next to me when she presents me, and I would be happy to pay for it when the time comes if money was a problem. We all agreed that I should bring it up to her sooner rather than later since it was bothering me.

So that’s what I said to my mom verbatim, and she freaked out on me. She was furious that I would ask this of her because she apparently already “bought accessories for the dress she’s wearing” (again, my wedding is not for two more years. I don’t even have my own dress picked out yet.) Then she told me I was being influenced by my friend and her mom into wanting a fancier wedding (which makes no sense, because I’m the one who brought it up to them) basically telling me I have no thought process of my own. I told her I was disappointed in her, that this would mean a lot to me and my happiness, and when I told her that, she told me that I should find someone else to walk me down the aisle. 

So that’s the last thing we’ve really said to each other. It’s been 4 days. She hasn’t tried to apologize. I never would’ve thought that reaction would come out of her mouth, honestly. It was bizarre. She’s been controlling about other things with the wedding, like wanting to invite people I don’t know (it will be a wedding of 50 people, so strangers will stick out, and them being there is also giving me anxiety, again, autism) but she is paying for the venue and food so I don’t really know how much say I have, which sucks because it’s my wedding. It’s stressing me out. And now we’re not even talking. I don’t feel like I’m wrong, because if it were me and my daughter, I’d wear a banana suit while walking her down the aisle if it pleased her. 

But this is my mom, and this is where I’m at. So I’m just looking for advice on how to handle this. She’s had childish moments like this in the past, but I don’t think my mom has ever apologized to me in her life. She’s a typical boomer, and still has the mentality that I’m her child and she’s the parent and what she says goes and children shouldn’t disrespect their parents. I’m on the closer end of 30 for fuck’s sake. 

I’m at the point where I want to tell her I don’t want her to pay for it anymore so I don’t have to be under her thumb, but I feel like that would somehow make her more furious. It’s a childish situation that goes beyond a dress at this point, and is more about the way she reacted to it, and that she thought it was okay and somehow in her eyes I am the bad guy of this situation. Maybe I am. I’m not really sure, which is why I need advice. It hurts me to even type this, but I had to get it off my chest somewhere.",10Nov2020,1
801,"This is something I never thought I'd be asking, but over the last few years things at home have snowballed into a borderline unlivable situation.

I (16F), live with my mom (45F) and my two younger sisters (10F &amp; 2F). Mom is still married to our dad but he's lived states away for 5 years now, so he's barely in the picture.

He lost his job during the summer which acted as a catalyst to the already declining situation. My mom picked up a lot more work to make up for what he used to send us and its added so much strain to our home life. Things were already bad, but now they're much worse.

My mom pointblank refuses to do ANYTHING around the house anymore, and basically nothing to with parenting either. I wake up, wash, bathe, dress, feed, and walk our youngest sister over to our grandma's so I can go to school. When I get off school we go straight to grandma's again, where my mom cooks dinner almost every night to pay her back for watching my sister. But she always wants to stay late so she can avoid going home. So we usually don't get to our own place til 10 at night or later. And I'm also the one to put my baby sister to sleep because my mom couldn't be bothered, since she has to work in the morning. She won't even go to my parent/teacher conferences anymore. She isn't interested in being involved in either me or middle sister's school lives. Which is ridiculous consider my middle sister is homeschooled.

The house is absolutely disgusting. She blames it all on us, but what does she expect when she has 3 children, ton of animals, and never does ANY housework??? Its honestly hurt my mental health, especially during the summer when I'm kept home all the time and basically meant to be a stay home mom. I've worked hard to clean the entire house many times but it always falls back into disaster because no one will help with the up keep. Its so depressing and discouraging.

But on top of mom working more, since dad lost his job, we don't have any medical insurance. So mom has been avoiding taking us to the doctor at all cost. I have cavities and an infection, My 10yo sister needs her glasses replaced terribly, and the youngest is due for her 2.5 year checkup too. A few months ago, I took my eyes off my babysitter for just a second and she got into a bottle of Tylenol. It was terrifying. My mom still  didn't want to go to the doctor and made me try to force the baby to throw up. It was terrible, but it also didn't work. I made her call poison control and the operator finally convinced my mom to go to the doctor, because in large doses, Tylenol can be toxic. It was an awful experience, but thank the Lord it was all ok. Our bill was covered by a charity, but a nurse also gave us a pamphlet on a program our state offers. It's basically great medical insurance for lower income minors. 

 I begged my mom for weeks to sign up so that we could have insurance, at the very least for us kids. Eventually she snapped and told me she wouldn't sign up because more than likely get a state assigned doctor, who would force her to vaccinate us or take us away. She's very against vaccination, and me and the 10yo have only been vaccinated for a few things like polio or tetanus. The baby is entirely unvaccinated. She's absolutely paranoid about this and will not budge. Its all fairly mild issues right now, but I can't help but be afraid that something worse or unexpected might happen, like an accident or a serious disease. I tried to express that to her, and she basically told me to be quiet and put more trust in God.

There was also another time, I was severely depressed after staying home all summer. I couldn't get it out of my head that I was worthless and a disappointment for not keeping the house and kids in check, among a lot of other things. I was wrestling with self-harm and even suicidal thoughts. I begged my mom to send me to therapy ( i was afraid and I admit I left out a lot of details). She blew up at me, screaming and shouting. She said if I went to a therapist and told her how I was stressed about the house, CPS would be called.. and essentially I would be responsible for destroying my family and my sisters' futures. It was very traumatic to me, but now she denies this ever happened. My middle sister also suffers from mental health issues, especially anxiety, and I even caught her self harming earlier in the year. At 10 years old!! My mom talked it over with her, but also refused to take her to a therapist for similar reasons, along with not wanting her 'drugged up'.

I don't go to a normal school. I've gone to a religious school for many years, and after my dad lost his job I was offered a sponsorship to finish my schooling there. We don't have a normal counselor, but there is a youth pastor with really the best of intentions. She's already made it clear to my mom that she isn't calling anybody she just wants to support me. I thought we were all good, but apparently I overshared. My mom screamed at me for talking too much about our family life and that now she has to deal with this youth pastor judging her (all over one little text) and how if I continue to reach out to her, she will pull me from the school, my church, and my friends and I'll never speak to them again. I honestly don't know if this is for real or not, because she always throws horrible threats around to get me to do what she wants. Ex. The time she said she'd ship all us kids away to live with our dad (not the best guy) because we didn't keep the house clean enough.

She also 'jokes' about the most awful stuff. Like she told me this story of a parent who kept their daughter locked away in an attic for decades and the girl finally starved herself to death because she couldn't go on living. And wrapped it up with, ""So I could be worse!"" and laughed. Then later she kept joking about keeping me locked in the cellar so I couldn't go away to college. But recently she's brought my baby sister into the 'jokes' as well, which is just so much worse. She says things like, ""I know you'll miss her. That's why I had her so late in life, to punish you for going to college."" and after my baby sister went to go sit with someone else, ""She mad at you because you're talking about college again and abandoning her.""

I feel so confused and conflicted. I really, really love my mom but she really needs to step it up as a parent. I know right now she's overwhelmed with work but what she's doing isn't okay. I feel so isolated. I want to talk to my aunt about everything, but I'm afraid to even do that because if my mom found out she'd feel really betrayed. And I don't even know what she'd do if I called CPS. It would destroy our relationship, she could even disown me. I'm so, so afraid. But I can't go on living like this.",10Nov2020,1

I've hit a bit of dead end in life. I'm studying something I don't believe in and it's no field I'd want to get a job in later. My internship is coming up for either in February or September and so far I've not seen anything that sounds even remotely interesting to me. This is mainly the reason I want to get out now, but this issue has existed for much longer. 

I'm also kinda dealing with some mental health issues. I've been seeing a therapist since January so that's coming up to almost a year now. The thing is... It's left me knowing less and less about what's good for me. At this point I really couldn't name anything I can confidently say I want to be doing with my life. Not long-term, but also not short-term. I basically know nothing about myself anymore. I give very few fucks about fitting in society and things like a nice house, job security and a family mean very little to me. I want to experience life, but also not cause any harm whatsoever. I want to contribute to the world but I don't want there to be a shred of selfish reason behind that. I want to be part of society, but I don't want to propagate all that I think is bad about it.

I've got this long list of jobs or experiences I want to try out, just stuff that sounds interesting to me. I don't see many ways to get into most of them though. It's just really hard to try out any random thing without some qualification in it. And I feel like everything has already been done before. It pretty much feels like there just isn't anything for me to contribute to. 

I've got many diverse skills and more life experience than the average 22yo I'd say. I definitely have means to ""get out"". There is however a huge pile of counter arguments, telling me it's a bad idea. I don't have a whole lot of money and some 15k in student debt to boot. I lack confidence to do many things, especially when it comes to other people. I don't want to under-appreciate the privilege I enjoy by possible quitting college. I don't want to be a quitter. I don't want to cast myself out of average society on purpose when my biggest wish is wanting to belong somewhere. I don't want to end up without a degree in something.  And last but definitely not least, I don't want to take a risk...

But at the same time, I don't want to live this mundane life any more. I want to leave my city and country without knowing when or even if I'll ever be coming back. I want my days to be something new most of the time. I can't sit still for very long. I want to get away from my family who's holding me back like crazy. I may be 22 but it feels like I've barely reached adulthood... My life is pretty much the same as it was six years ago and I hate that. Even with all the things I've done in the meantime it feels like I haven't grown at all. 

I've really reached a dead end. I'm not happy with so many things in my life, but I haven't got a clue what else to do. I have no goal I can stand behind. There are very few things left that I still think are morally right for me to do, while also not going against my own principles. That makes the incentive to actually go out and change something very, very small...",10Nov2020,1
807,"Im White but I feel asian.

Hey guys and girls, I didnt know where to post this, so I did it here. 

Ive never read online about this topic but maybe someone can relate. So im a white male, i look like a norwegian guy, typical 6'4 blonde blue eyes. My dad is mixed, half indonesian half white. My mother is full white. So i guess im 1/4 asian but my looks certainly dont resemble that. My parents have brown and black hair with dark eyes. And im blonde blue eyes. 
And For some reason i feel like im asian deep down. Some sort of calling. I've always liked asian stuff, the culture, especially japanese culture. When I eat out it's always asian. I have a bunch of asian friends. I enjoy asian food a lot, at home my father makes indonesian food 4 times a week or so and if it was for me i'd have nothing else. I can't relate with the majority of people at school and work because it feels like they are a different species than I am. But because of my looks i find it kind of awkward to tell people i feel asian. I mostly tell it as a joke 'ha im 1/4 indo' ayy. But it's not a joke. Ive visited indonesia once for three weeks and they were the best three weeks of my life. Instantly a feeling of comfort. Im not sure why but traditional asian habits and people just make me sympathize with them. I know I sound very generalizing while I say all asians and stuff, I truly mean no offense. I also cant see myself with a white woman in the future. I catch feelings for asian women very fast. Not like a lot of stories ive read that say ""because they are an easy target or they are submissive like they are supposed to be"". I actually look up to them and respect them a lot. 

I just had to get this off my chest.

810,"Hi guys. So about 10 years ago I married my kids father. We had two kids total. I was pregnant with the first when we got married and two years later I had our second child. When she was 3 months old I found out he was cheating and we split up. He hasn't seen his kids since. There was always some excuse he couldnt. He sporadically sent me money for about a year and then that stopped. He blocked me on everything and moved away so I didn't even know where he was. He had his family sending me threatening messages telling my im a whore and they aren't even his kids. A couple months ago his mom got arrested for doing heroin in her car.

Well now he wants to come back into the picture. He didnt even send me a message his new girlfriend did. My fear is that he might be a good dad for a couple months and then abandon them again. I have full custody of the kids so I can tell him no and face no legal issues. I just dont want to open them up to being hurt again and that kind of environment.",10Nov2020,1
811,"My sisters husband is (what appears to be) a good guy, so I dont want to jump to assumptions here but I'm also young, naive and try to see the best in people. I'm 17f. 

So.. my sister and I both work at the local pub (I work in the kitchen, she runs bar). Last week she got a phone call from her husband saying that her son, my nephew (2yo) fell headfirst into the toy box and ""fucked his face up"". If you knew my nephew, you would know that this happens damn near constantly. Hes a wild little thing. He jumped from his bed into the toy box all the time. But this feels different...

So..... my nephew has broken blood vessels on both sides of his face. It's like around his eyes and underneath them but not on them, if that makes sense. He also has a small bruise underneath his right eye. Now.. I looked in that toy box and there isnt anything that would make those marks. It looks like he got his head stuck in something. So my sister and I are searching for the culprit toy that did this to my precious nephew and we couldnt find anything. There was no toy possible that could have caused those marks unless he fell into that toy box headfirst, multiple times and from different angles. 

What could cause broken blood vessels (nothing severe) on both sides of the face in such a short period of time? Taking the time into consideration as well.. when we left the house at 6am Christopher was fine. We got the phone call at 7am. What could have caused that kind of mark in an hour? Broken blood vessels AND small but noticeable bruising? 

I thought that bruises appeared over time, not immediately. And as for the broken blood vessels, what can cause that? My sister rushed him to the ER and my nephew is fine. No signs of concussion. Hes his normal little self. But I dont think he fell into that toy box.",10Nov2020,1

813,"When I was 14, I snooped through my mom’s Facebook messages like an idiot. I found out she was cheating on my dad. I confronted her, and she told me that my dad cheated on her first while he was on a trip a year before. She said she cheated afterwards because she felt unloved. It was a huge mess that I dragged myself into that caused me a LOT of trauma for many years. They fought for weeks and weeks and almost got a divorce. They miraculously made it though, and 7 years later, they are doing great and seem like they are very much in love with each other. It took me many years to believe in love again, but I’m okay now. 

I’m now 21, and I still live with them. Today, I went on the family computer to find some pictures, which were only on my mom’s account. I opened iMessage to text the pictures to myself (the computer is an iMac), and I saw a suspicious text on the left side among all the other text conversations. It was pretty high up, I did not scroll down looking for something to snoop around. It was from a number that is not my dad’s that said “let’s not talk about sex right now”. The iMessage app did not fully load yet so all of the phone numbers did not have names, so I couldn’t tell who the text was from/who she texted it to. I just know it wasn’t my dad’s number. I did not click on it because of what happened last time; I chose to ignore it. I know I’m probably overreacting. She is probably just talking to a friend or cousin about her sex life or something (I can see her doing that). However, I can’t get it out of my head now. Should I open the text and see if she is cheating again? I don’t really want to because I don’t want to even know if she is. If she is, I either just have to live my life knowing what she is doing, or I have to confront her, and endure everything all over again. What do I do? Do I check the messages or should I just ignore it and give her the benefit of the doubt? 

TL;DR saw a weird text in my mom’s iMessage by accident and I don’t know if I should check the rest of the messages to see if she’s cheating or not, as she has a history of cheating.",10Nov2020,1

815,"Some context i guess, but I'll keep it short. Diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder, and medicated for it. I don't plan for a future because I just don't see what it would even look like. 

After failing college classes and delaying my graduation for 2 years now, I failed more online classes over the summer and decided that online courses would never work, so I didn't sign up for more this Fall term. 

COVID has hit hard mentally, and terrifies me to work and expose to the danger. and the little savings I had have dwindled now to nothing paying utility bills. And my parents are ""sick of my laziness"" and ""using mental health as an excuse to do nothing all day everyday"", even when I try to improve my mental health by exercising, doing chores they write off as nothing, or chatting with friends so I don't isolate.

And now they say ""they're moving on with their lives, and I'm moving on with mine, whether I like it or not. Sink or swim style"" and they want me out by the end of the year. 

So. What am I supposed to do. What's the point. Not only am I hopeless and lost, but now with no money ill never pay to finish my college education, and with a full time job to pay for rent ill never have the time or energy to do courses online or on the side.

I graduated and got into a college, yet the more I thought about it during the summer, the more anxious I felt.

831,"Currently I'm on a complete virtual school schedule, on Edgenuity, provided by my school. The issue is that Edgenuity, although I am learning quite fine, is that the grading system it goes by is harming my grade significantly. 

Edgenuity penalizes my grade by a few percentages once a new day begins, exactly at 12 a.m. The result is that no matter how well I do on my assignments that are given to me for that day, the next day will essentially bring me back to what I had before. The explanation I was given to raise my grade, was to do work ahead of time, days. (Usually I am given about 3-5 assignments per class daily.) The result is that it creates a quantity over quality situation, in which I have to focus on doing as many assignments as possible rather than taking time to learn. 

I'm not sure if this is on part of my school or Edgenuity itself, but I really need to find an alternative that does not use a similar grading system. 

As of now I'm creating a log of my grades since 11/9/20, and onwards till the end of the year, or semester. Here is what I have currently.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Intro to Business|Chemistry|Economics|English|Geometry|Spanish|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|11/9/20 (after work)|95%|90.5%|89.5%|80.1%|79.4%|95.1%|
|11/10/20 (%  lowered)|\-1.4%|\-1.2%|\-1.8%|\-0%|\-2.3%|\-1.2%|
|11/10/20 (after work)|95.7%|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|95.2%|

The reason why English did not go down was because I did the work for both the 9th and the 10th on the same day as the 9th. (The N/A is because I haven't completed the work for those classes at the time of writing.)

Another con as to why I need to switch is that I intended to enter into AP Classes this year. The school sent an email notifying students that wanted to enter AP Classes, had to pay around **$250** per class. (I may or may not remember correctly either, but I think it also said per month &amp; per semester). It is far too expensive regardless. The only other option if I am unable to find an alternative Online program, is going to school in person. There is also a chance that I will be switching schools, and I will be asking them what type of online program they have to ensure that it will be an improvement.

The issue with going in person is that over the past years I've been developing terrible social anxiety that was beginning to intervene with my learning. Although, my grades on average were much better in person than it is on Edgenuity, usually made up of A's and high B's.

TLDR: Good alternative Online Education Program for Highschool student, other than Edgenuity.",10Nov2020,1

Around December we are getting calls and people come to the door from the government trying to protect senior citizens.  They were alarmed because of weird transactions that were happening. He also alarmed his financial advisers and Wells Fargo.  We let him know that we were contacted and worried about him.  He lied and said it was just some things that did not concern me.  A couple of weeks go by and the next investment bank threw up red flags.  We knew about this because we get all of his mail since he travels and lives out of his motorhome.  At this time I said I was worried about his mental state and that he had no-one to confide in to make good decisions.  He essentially told me to fuck off and that he was not born yesterday.  I stopped talking to him about it at this point since he is so stubborn.

We try to play cards with him once a week to catch up and hangout.  He started to act differently in the last 2 months and last night finally told me what was up.  He got caught in some gold scam where they tell you they need money to get the grandparents gold out of Germany.  He emptied his accounts of about 1.5 million dollars and gave it away.  He came up from poverty and worked very hard to be in the position he was in. He now has about $30k and his social security of $2600 a month.  He will now owe taxes on taking out that money.  

My question is do we notify the authorities.  I can't believe he hasn't but still believes he has a chance to recoup the money and still talks to this person.",10Nov2020,1

847,"Btw I'm not asking for hw help, so I don't think I'm breaking any rules, sorry if I am.

My entire school recently changed to full cyber for a few weeks just as the quarter ended. Because of this I forgot to/couldn't turn in two of my English assignments in time. I now have an 85% in that class for last quarter. My parents haven't discovered this yet but I know when they do I'll be yelled at until I cry and then some. I already emailed my teacher about if I can get any credit at all for them so that's not the biggest issue. 

I forgot to press the turn in button on two out of 3 of my online band assignments so I currently have an F (33%) in that class but it will be fixed soon as it's this quarter and my teacher said he would fix it soon. Also, due to switching to cyber I didn't realize that we had an assignment in my English class and after it was too late my teacher said he wouldn't let us make it up. Currently it's the only grade in the book so I have an F (0%) in that class. Also due to how the class is structured there is almost no way for me to get an A in that class now unless he gives us assignments that equal up to 135 points and I get 100% on all of them. 

My mom had to physically go to work today instead of working from home so she probably checked my grades today. I have no idea what I'm going to tell her when she asks me about it. I've NEVER had less than a temporary C or D before so I'm terrified. I can't tell her the truth (that it'll all be ok since the F is temporary and I'll get at least a high B) because a high B isn't enough for her. I can't even tell her a half truth (that it'll all be ok) because she'll press on about why I'm failing and pretty much indirectly saying she thinks I'm the stupidest kid ever.",10Nov2020,1

I found a woman on Instagram and was pretty confident going with her because I’ve seen her advertisements for over a year and I saw lots of good reviews on her Instagram page. 

We messaged and she was really quick to repaint to my messages. Then I decided to go ahead with it, paid the deposit (half of the total) of around $150. Several days later she sent me the first draft of my resume. My resume was already pretty good. I was hoping that she would write in some key words from ideal job descriptions, but it just seemed that she had copied all of the content from my original resume over to her “writing template”, changed about 6 words (the words were not key words from the job description) and sent me the copy. I was very disappointed. Most definitely not worth $120 just for a resume “rewrite”. 

I could look past it though because the most help I needed was on my key selection criteria. She said she would send me the draft the following day. I offered to send her some of my experiences to weave into the answers but she declined (to my surprise). Fast forward over 14 days and I’ve heard nothing more from her. I’ve emailed her twice since with no reply. Her turn-around is supposed to be 8 days. I paid the deposit almost 3 weeks ago. She continues to post on her Instagram page, including stories.

I took her for granted and wasn't motivated to do anything. I was severely depressed but everytime id let things out and explain to her, she would try to fix everything- I know she meant well but all I needed was for her to listen like she used to...
We both love eachother- or loved...
I love her still but I did so many things that hurt her when I didn't mean to.
I Hate myself for this, and I just want her back but I know I cant...
Im not a good friend and I'd only ruin it even more..

857,"So I'll start off with a bit of backstory regarding this topic. My sister (I'll call her L) loves cats. For a long time, she had two orange tabby cats that she loved with all her heart. However, due to a change in custody, our father decided that he didn't want to take care of those cats since L wasn't going to be there to take care of them anymore. Because L loved those cats so much, it was a big struggle for her. So our mom made the decision to get her another cat (Izzy). 

Everything started out just fine. L was happy to have a new cat, the cat was acting up a little but it was just little kitten things, and everything was going well. Then things started to change. Now, my mom already had a cat (Stella). And Stella is a very passive cat, so Izzy is constantly trying to dominate her. Izzy tries to eat Stella's food, use Stella's litterbox, scratch Stella's scratching post, sleep in Stella's bed, etc. This is very frustrating to my mom because it creates a very stressful situation for Stella.

Not only that, but Izzy also is VERY hyper and will get into things she's not supposed you, jump on walls, etc. And it's not like we don't have any toys or a cat tree for her. She has everything she needs, but she still acts up. Not to mention, L and I share a room, and at night Izzy is constantly getting into things and making a ton of noise which prevents me from sleeping. Izzy has to stay in the room otherwise she would get into everything around the house.

We've tried almost every solution. We've tried discipline tactics such as shaking a can with coins in it, spray bottles, etc. No matter what, she still acts up and still tries to dominate Stella. This has caused a big issue for the family and has put a wedge between my mom and L's relationship. 

My mom doesn't really want to keep the cat because she feels as though it doesn't fit in with the rest of the family and causes a lot of stress for everyone. L, however, sees Izzy as her ""support animal"" and absolutely does not want to rehome her. So, my mom keeps trying to find solutions to make it work.

There is another thing that goes into play here though. L doesn't really do her job as a cat owner. She is constantly having to be reminded to scoop the cat litter and feed Izzy. She gives my mom attitude whenever she has to do extra work for Izzy. L refuses to talk to anyone about the issues she has and just gets mad at everyone when they try to talk to her. 

So does she really want the responsibility of the cat? Or is she just using the cat as a way to cope with past hurt? Anyways, I'm not sure what to suggest as a solution in this situation. Any advice?",10Nov2020,1
858,"Backstory:  My middle sister (38F) has two children, 17M and 12M. She is married to the father (40M) of the 12M. I am a family nurse practitioner and although I am concerned about my 12M nephew, I'm not sure if talking with my sister would be over-stepping. 

My sister and brother-in-law are amazing parents. My family overall (including my sister) has a very holistic approach to medicine. They prefer to treat ailments with herbs/home remedies instead of medication, rarely visit their primary care doctor, are somewhat anti-vax. 

My nephew's behavior (12M) has become concerning and I'm worried for him academically and socially. He has difficulty with socialization (poor eye contact, uncomfortable in conversations, sound sensitivity, prefers to be alone). He also demonstrates clear hyperactivity. For example, at any family gathering my sister hands my nephew her phone for entertainment, when the phone battery runs out he begs my sister to take him home. I've tried to engage him in board games, conversations, outdoor play (soccer/golf/etc), but after about 5 minutes he needs to move on to something else. I don't think it's me, because every time I see him he does give me a hug without prompting. I am also one of the only people he starts up conversations with. He is a lovely, funny, and kind child. 

I am worried that at this point if he isn't evaluated by a healthcare provider soon that a learning disability, ADHD, or autism may not be diagnosed and therefore he will not receive treatment (which may improve his quality of life). I have seen children with undiagnosed learning disabilities/ADHD/autism in adolescence and many have low self-esteem, poor grades, anxiety, and depression. 

I brought up an ADHD evaluation when he was 7 to my sister. She was receptive, but ended up trying some ADHD vitamins and aloe treatment instead of making an appointment with a doctor. 

I want to have a discussion with my sister again. Is it appropriate? I feel like if I don't, I'm doing my nephew who I absolutely love a disservice.",10Nov2020,1
859,"I [19F] have been talking about moving in with my boyfriend [20M] for a few months now. We’ve been together just over a year and have been hoping to live together starting this coming May. Recently, I think I may have changed my mind. 

My current roommate [20F] said she doesn’t want him to move in, and I don’t think I want to move in with him and his current messy room mate. I also currently live in such an affordable apartment in a great location, in great condition, with a good landlord. I feel like I would be a fool to leave my current living situation. If I left to live somewhere else with my boyfriend there would be a good chance of ending up somewhere more expensive and not nearly as nice as this (this place is a rare find in this neighbourhood). 

I’m sure some of this is also cold feet and fear of moving too fast since we’re so young. (What if there’s a horrible breakup and I need to leave? Where will I live? I don’t really have any friends in this city...)

My boyfriend is very sensitive and doesn’t have the highest self esteem at times. I’m looking for advice on how to frame this, and tell him it may be another year before we can live together, without him automatically assuming I’m heading down the path to break up with him soon (I’m not!). I really don’t know if this news would be a “no big deal, we’re in love, let’s do it next year” thing, or a “you just dropped a bomb on our entire relationship” thing...

864,"I am so sorry this is going to be a long read I som. 

I have known my best friend for about seven years. We met in high school; we had known each other from afar for about a  year until sophomore year when we had a class together and latched onto each other because we didn't know anyone else in the class. We would go to lunch together, but we wouldn't really hang out after school because her mom is very strict when it comes to stuff like that. Anyway, towards the end of sophomore year, she told me she was moving an hour away, which sucked, but we promised to stay in contact. Which we did, but at this point, I had decided to change schools, so a year later she moved back, but I was in a different school. For two years we kept in contact, we even went to each other graduation.

 At this point, I thought our relationship could withstand just about anything. She dated my cousin (that didn't work out); we hung out every Friday;  we texted every day. She would tell me about her problems (she has a lot of them) but then covid hit. We still did most of those things, but her life keeps getting in the way. She works none stop she has about six classes and she basically takes care of her mother.  Her boyfriend is even in the army. 

A couple of weeks ago we decided to go visit him on the army base, which is 12 hours from where I live.  It was planned last minute. The day before we went, she called me and I asked if I wanted to go. A part of me knew I shouldn't, but I also did want to go. My parents yelled at me for going, so it put me a terrible mood the whole three days. We went with her sister who I barely know, and it was the worst three days ever. There's was nothing fun to do since it was a military town everything was far away and it freezing. The only time we had fun was on our way back. 

The whole entire time I was there, this thought kept coming to me. ""Why am I friends with her?"" we have absolutely nothing in common. And even after seven years, there's this feeling that I still don't know her. I think it's because she has never had time to figure that out herself. Because of this sometimes I feel that I can't count on her.  I tell her everything, but I know she leaves big details out. About a week after she came back, she got the news that one of her family members a stroke. Her mom took it really hard. I didn't know whether to call because we really don't do that, but I kept telling her ""if you need anything I'm here."" But recently I'm lucky if i get two messages from her in a day because she's so busy all the time. I don't feel comfortable texting her too much because I know she'll answer hours later or the next day. 

I have fought for this friendship before and a part of me doesn't want to anymore. She basically the only friend I have. After high school, I dropped everyone except her. I know there's a lot of things she can't control, but if I were in her position, I'd try to make time. What I hate the most is the feeling of not really knowing her. I hate how differently we think. Negativity just follows her and in turn, it makes me feel like shit. I don't know what to do anymore. I know I can't stop being friends with her now because she is going through a tough time, but I keep thinking when she gets better that I'll leave. That makes me feel like such a terrible person. I feel guilty for just feeling this way. 

I know this a really long read so I do apologize, but I need some advice. I'm going crazy this keeps me up at night.",10Nov2020,1

867,"Pre-COVID madness, my sisters booked flights to come visit me in December. The plan was for them to fly out and then we would all drive back home to our parents’ for Christmas (I live in New England). I don’t know why we didn’t seek refunds when things started to look bad; hindsight is 20:20 but the smoke from this dumpster fire year blurred our vision, I guess.

Now, cases are rising rapidly again. My four sisters are in college in states that have been hit particularly hard. Airports are going to be a mess. Quite frankly, New England is a disaster right now, as well, and even though I am self-isolating, I don’t want to risk anything. I plan to break to my parents soon that I don’t want to come home for the holidays at all this year, but the biggest hurdle I have to cross first is this trip.

The problems are the flights, my sisters’ attitudes, and my parents. Refunds from American Airlines are out of the question since they changed their policies to almost always deny them if your travel got screwed over by COVID (it’s down to very particular verbiage about cancellations). The only thing my sisters would be eligible for is a travel credit to be used for a single rebooking, but I’m not about to suggest they rebook anything in the window American is offering. They got their flights reasonably cheap; the vouchers wouldn’t make enough of a dent in a regularly-priced ticket to risk COVID for, say, spring break. Still, I feel bad about them losing money since I know it’s tough to save up as a student.

Additionally, I’m worried about their reactions. Two have taken this very seriously all semester. They’ve self-isolated, they haven’t gone out except on essential errands, etc. The other two are very social—multiple parties a week, greek life events, etc. It caused some major disagreements when I first found out, and now I’m worried they will be pissed at me for (1) invalidating their choices and (2) cancelling on them when they’ve already paid for the trip. I have a very sad grad student salary but I’m MORE than willing to pay for the tickets myself. My parents “believe the science” but they’re also kind of old-fashioned liberals who think so long as we wash our hands we will be fine. (Okay.) I can hear them guilt-tripping and blaming me for being “just a little” unreasonable now—it happened over the summer when I said I didn’t plan on coming home over break and they got really upset.

So ... I don’t know how to go about bringing this up? My sisters have been talking all semester about how excited they are to see me after so long and how much they’re looking forward to doing something nice after such a shitty semester (which I get). I’m a fairly anxious human and I’m afraid to do anything that might make the situation more awkward/unpleasant (especially considering my two social sisters are pretty defensive about this sort of stuff) but I also want to be firm and strategic.

869,"The heading pretty much is a tldr but a little more backstory.

My partner and I moved into an basement suite a year ago in the city, it was perfect pricing for what we needed and it was in a good neighbour hood. We met the middle floor neighbours and they were nice, we both had issues with the top floor neighbours who are addicts but we both were able to convince our landlord to give her the boot. We were able to communicate and discuss noise issues and we worked our lives around theirs (tv low after 9, no laundry or slamming doors late ect) we even did a noise check on our tv for them so they never heard it. 

However they have not extended the same courtesy towards us for the entire year, they are extremely noisy and don’t seem to try to be quiet. They are loud and stomp around and let their kid do whatever and play with whatever at all times of night and day, we have talked to them multiple times and they say they will try to fix it but it maybe lasts for a day before things get bad, it’s so bad that my partner and I have started to become mentally sick because of it and it’s affected our relationship. At six in the morning they let their kid run the length of the hallway and it’s so loud my earplugs don’t block any of the noise. I was diagnosed with ADD and years later suffered a traumatic event that left me with ptsd, loud noises and sudden movements kick it in and I become a mess. I had a mental breakdown this morning because I went from a peaceful sleep to loud thumping and crashing, I slammed the top of the ceiling with a broom so loudly I think I would have put a hole in it if my partner didn’t stop me.

My landlord took forever to evict the upstairs neighbours who were addicts so I don’t see this noise issue being fixed and I want to move out, we are planning to and I’ve applied to get a second seasonal job so we can move out after Christmas, however I don’t know what to do during the time until we do leave. The upstairs neighbours know what it’s like as they lady above them would wear her heels at 12 at night and bought a small dog to bark late at night to wake their kid so I don’t know how they don’t understand what it’s like.

How do we deal with this until we move?",10Nov2020,1
870,So me and my brother both share a car together. We have to split the insurance each month and any repairs (it’s an old BMW so there’s something wrong with it like every four months) the only issue is that since July I have barely been able to drive the car as he started a job in a different city. I understand that he needs it but even when he isn’t working he uses it. In addition to this I now have to ask HIM for permission to use the car which makes no sense as he isn’t the owner. I have not driven it since before October yet I’ve paid my share of insurance for the past two months and half of the repairs for a new spark plug. I don’t think I should have to pay for repairs since I don’t even get to drive the car but when I last asked my parents if they could take me off the insurance they got mad and said that I needed to be on it to build up my credit score. I think it’s just really unfair because I’m a university student who has no income so I’ve been paying out of my savings for a car I don’t use. Any advice would be appreciated as I find that I don’t want to be around my family as every time I think of the car I get angry.,10Nov2020,1

I am able to afford to study abroad thanks to a scholarship from which I can save a bit of money each month if I watch my budget a little, so my parents usually pay for the plane tickets (prices go up and down constantly but I would say between 150 to 350 dollars both ways).

 For a few years now I've bought everybody in my family (Mom, Dad, Brother and Grandpa) one or two small things for Christmas (think a cute mug and a book, for example). Because my dad is the sole breadwinner of the family we've never been the type of family to spend hundreds on each person for Christmas anyway. 

Today I went shopping to look for gifts for them and I found a shirt that I thought my dad may like (price was about 20 dollars), so I sent a picture to my mom to get her opinion. Her response is what brings me to this subredit. She asked me why I was looking for shirts for my dad and when I replied I was looking for Christmas presents she said not to buy any gifts this year and to save the money. She said at most I should buy something small for the whole family and suggested a wall calendar. This immediately made me think that money might be extra tight this year and they may be scared I'll expect the same amount of gifts in return (which of course I don't). I also thought maybe they just want me to save money since my part time job is closed due to covid. I'm very unsure about what to do now. 

Should I listen to my mom and buy something small for the home? Should I buy something cheaper for everybody or will this put my parents in an uncomfortable position? Should I offer to help pay for my plane ticket with the money instead? Should I ask my mom what the reason for her reply is?",10Nov2020,1
873,"If I can to the hospital today I would. But I don’t know how or where to go. I can’t even think about the possibility. If I am being honest I am unable to think about most things. I want to go to the hospital but I just don’t know how? And I don’t know where to go?

But to back track a little. But I can’t make myself think. Like there are so many thoughts happening but i’m so removed from myself that they aren’t actually being “thought” and are instead just getting lost? Like there’s a huge chasm or hole in my mind that my thoughts can’t seem jump across. I just can’t seem to turn myself on. Hours are just gone, entire days are swallowed by fog.

I don’t know how to describe it, but now I can’t read sentences or brush my teeth. And when i do manage to do *something* it feels like there’s something screaming inside me and saying that everything is horribly wrong. Its been this way for about a year now. I am starting to not be able to work. I already find it extremely difficult to clean, bathe, or even watch tv. Cleaning and bathing is the hardest part of my day because its so complex. The fog is just too much.

But last night, it felt like there were so many thoughts backed up that they all just exploded. Like suddenly the brain fog lit on fire and I wanted it to stop so bad that I started screaming and I couldn’t stop. 

It felt like i could fall through the floor at any second. But usually when this happens I can bring myself back with a shock. So I pour hot or boiling water on myself. Its never that hot because it comes from an electric kettle but it’s enough to give me an outlet.

Anyway I can’t keep going like this. Meditation helps but I don’t think I need to meditate for an hour just to get my mind strong enough to walk. I want to go to a hospital but i really don’t know what they could do for me? It’s also really expensive. And i just don’t have the money. 

But i’m desperate and in willing to do whatever now. I want to go to the hospital but I genuinely don’t know if they can help? Would it even be worth it? What will they do? How do i even go? ER? Walk in? Who do i see?",10Nov2020,1

876,"For context I am 18, high school graduate, located in Maryland, United States.

What job I have is not important to me as long as I truly enjoy it and make enough money to be comfortable.
I am a musician. 
I need to move out of my small town and get to a major city, because all of my goals require lots of people around and connections (see below)

I've become very frustrated in the last few months. I originally had the idea to become an audio engineer, because I knew I'd get to work with other artists and I thought I'd enjoy that and itd help me get connections. I've now learned that to be a producer/engineer is more of a skill of it's own, just like creating music, and I have no passion for producing.
I would love to work a job in a studio, it seems like a fun work environment. But that isn't my passion and it seems like it sort of has to be in order to hustle hard enough to actually become a successful audio engineer. As for other jobs in that area like broadcasting and stuff, I have a grand total of 0 people who can give me any nudge in any direction.
I wish that I just had at least one person, just one, that I could say, ""hey, you work here as a broadcast engineer at _____ radio station or something, how did you get here?"". Do people go to college and get bachelors in that? Do I just move to a city and get an entry level job? What kinds of jobs are available? Who knows! All I can do is Google and get phone calls from people trying to sell me my own ""dreams"".

I am on track to become a certified personal trainer soon. This is good because I do have a passion for fitness. Nothing like music, but I do enjoy it. And I already know how you get a job in that field. Independent contracting, working at a gym, etc. 
I have half a mind to just move out somewhere and do that, given the confusing mess of the above section. 
I also attended a technical school in high school for video production, and am a lifeguard with all of my certifications up to date. 

I would be just as happy working as a guitar repair person in a shop in California, as I would be working in a studio. All it does for me is give me a job I enjoy and can use to make connections with people.

Part of me says to just take what I've got and run with it and get a job I enjoy either in a music store or a gym or somewhere and just start a new life somewhere else, but then another part of me says that going to school for audio would be 'safer'. But, if I decide on that, I have no clue where to go for what and for how long!

877,"So recently my ex girlfriend slid up on a couple of my snapchat stories and we’ve been talking since then (as friends). We broke up in 2018 because our relationship was complicated. I treated her very poorly and never took her mental/emotional feelings in account and always worried about my own. I had a lot on my plate from being bullied in school, almost failing senior year, and my dads death. 2018 was just so depressing for me. However, I realized all the problems I listed, she always tried to help but I was blind. She was always there for me and I ruined that.

Now since she’s back in my life, I did apologize... a lot because i really feel terrible on how I treated such a beautiful soul. I’ve helped her a few times with some problems she’s ran into recently because it’s literally the least I owe her. I want to hangout with her but she’s a busy person and I don’t really know how to go about it. I did invite her to come over tonight to make her food because i’ve always wanted to cook for her however she has class but could come after. 

I just want to show her that she means something to me. She’s treated me more like family than my own family. I really respect her as an individual and honestly look up to her. I just don’t know what to say to her fully, I don’t want to overstep a boundary and ruin a friendship i’m trying to repair.

879,"So I'll start off my saying this is a career option advise question and it's a long journey I've been on and I just dont know what to do anymore.

I've been working since I was 12 years old as a babysitter. I'm talking like a full time mon-friday 40 hours in the summer and weekend gigs until I was 15 years old.

At 15 I became a lifeguard.
16 I worked at McDonald's, and got a second job getting carts at a local grocery store.

16-18 I stayed at the grocery store, but went from cart getter, to cashier, to the customer service booth.

18 I started getting server jobs, first at red lobster, then at Dave and busters, where I also bartended a little, then at bjs brewhouse.

At 19 I said I didnt want to do that anymore, so my moms friend got me a job at a call center as customer service, I got moved to sales, then I was made a manager after 6 months and I HATED IT.

So at 20 I started in college while I worked at academy, first as customer service, then I moved to apparel because I developed anxiety and couldn't stand the angry customers. 

By 21, I stayed at academy, but got a second job at t-mobile, but they force you to become a pushy salesmen and I HATED how they literally make you annoy the customer for a sale. So I left.

At 22, my friend got me a job as an optometrist assistant, so I left academy for this full time position. I enjoyed it besides the idiotic manager that liked to demean women, so I quit when he got in my face one day.

At 22, I decided to get another server job at pappasitos cantina, It didn't last but a month or two and I remembered how much I hated kissing the butt of people for a dollar. 

So at 22-24, I got a job at specs liquor store. Was promoted to a key holder at 3 months and stayed for a couple of years until I got my Associates of applied science in Electronics Technology. 

At 24, I got a job working for the city as a sign technician,  after 3 months I was promoted to a signal technician, which is what I was working towards and a opening happened.

I stayed there until I was 26, which the on call schedule year round just didn't work with my lifestyle and family and friends, as they come first. I work to live, I don't live to work. More to the story, but I will leave it at that.

So I left and did Uber for a few months until I luckily found a job at 27 as a custodian, RIGHT before coronavirus hit, so I was lucky to have job security during this pandemic, but with my experience and degree, this was a low level for me and I recently became a teachers assistant for the same school I cleaned. 

At 28, I am now an ISS teacher(in school suspension for bad kids), and I am going back to school to get a bachelors to become a real teacher.

If you are still reading, I'm sorry for the long read, but this is true and my life has been good and bad throughout these decisions. I have been an EXCEPTIONAL employee everywhere I worked, never fired and I still use many as references today. I also quit like 70 percent of these jobs so no going back for most of my younger day jobs.

My issue is, I am currently HATING my job. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy substituting, which I do when I don't have bad kids, but subs don't get health benefits since that is only contract work so I can't do that full time. I keep saying, ""if I can deal with the bad kids during my time here, teaching will be a breeze."" But it is going to take me a LONG LONG LONG time to pay for my classes to get my bachelors, since I am paying out of my pocket, and I simply can't see myself dealing with the bad behavior kids for the next 5-10years.

I enjoy the front office people I work with and the principals are all really nice, but some of these kids get my anxiety riled up, or just simply DO NOT WANT to improve and they just cause me trouble the entire time they are in my class. It's frustrating. 

I'm deciding on taking my next step and move along already, but I dont think it is the right choice for me.

880,"Hi everyone,

I know this probably sounds lame but I’m a student trying to get medical leave from my university. I want to leave due to mental health reasons/ severe depression, but the school will only let me have my leave be deemed excusable and “medical” if it has to do with being immunocompromised and thus it’s unsafe for me to return to campus.  There are a lot of hoops to jump through and I’m super stressed out. 

Basically, I think I probably am actually immunocompromised in some form, but don’t know it due to the fact that this is the first time I’ve ever had decent healthcare.  I’ve struggled with bad anemia in the past, but I need to find a doctor and have tests run on anything and everything. I’m not sure if this is from the stress, or if it can be diagnosed, but I have lost a lot of weight recently, am losing a lot of my hair, have bad migraines almost every day, and am constantly exhausted.  

The whole world of healthcare and seeing dicta is really overwhelming.  I never had good healthcare before and grew up with immigrant parents so the going to the doctor was sort of a rare thing.

Does anyone know a place I might be able to start regarding testing and an eventual doctors note? Are there just some diseases that are super vague and easy to diagnose?  Are there any common ways to be deemed “immunocompromised”? 

Please help me, I am so anxious about this.  I know it won’t be good for me to return to university right now and I’m trying to do everything I can. 

Thank you so much, have a safe and lovely day.",10Nov2020,1

884,"My (23 F) dad (50 M) has been cheating on my mom (48 F) with an employee from his company for months. My mom walked in on them at a bar kissing last month and had an emotional breakdown. They have been together for 20 years and my dad has not treated her well throughout their marriage but she kept saying she loved him too much. She was devastated when she walked in and found them. She was acting out recklessly, drinking too much etc.

My dad has been throwing a pity party saying to her how he'll "" never be good enough for her"" and last week he told her he would go to marriage counseling. He claimed that he wasn't seeing the other woman since that night.

That was a lie. A friend of my sibling saw him another bar last Wednesday with the other woman, kissing her. He took a photo of them together. My sibling was upset and said he couldn't tell our mom because he doesn't want to hurt her anymore.

I think I have to tell her, but I'm just unsure of how to do it without her spiraling again. I'm so disgusted with my dad, not only cheating but sleeping with his employees, disgusting.

I had an edible, and once it hit, I was gone. Everyone else in the group was also high at the time and were all watching tv together and chilling. One person in the group started texting me, so I would text back. Now, I'm currently in a relationship (nearly 3 1/2 years) and this guy knew it. He is also currently in a relationship, but his GF isn't interested in getting sexual for right now, which has left him kinda antsy. He tells me how ""worked up"" he is, and we're lightly flirting. Once again, I am completely gone at this point, and I don't know whether he is or isn't. He keeps asking me to do *things* with him, and I keep rejecting him.

I realize immediately after what I had done and told my current boyfriend. He isn't mad at me but is pissed off at the other guy for pressuring me while I was intoxicated, even though the other guy was as well. What should I do?

Well, i (M20) matched with this girl (F18) through Tinder. She is someone i’ve went to HS with (she’s still in it). I have never spoken to her until we matched. She came with the opener and tons of questions, etc...

In general, seemed super interested. I though she was cute and even though i didn’t like the interview questions too much i thought why not just add each other on snap and probably meet up some day. So we did, both. It was a week Day we met and it was 5 pm and we actually spent 5 hours at This cafe. We completely forgot about time. I Think she had way more fun than i’d since i was the one to say “aight i think it’s time”. 

We live fairly close to each other so we followed the same Road for a long Way until we went our seperate ways. She texted me right when she went home she had a really nice evening, and i Said i had too. 

After that, mostly it have been is her saying “good morning❤️” stuff like that and just talk about a few things, but nothing to much. I asked her if she would like to meet again, and she Said absolutely. Great i thought. But she’s always busy. Always. 

So, i’m reallyyyy not the type of guy that push things to the limits, and if i feel like something is just slightly one-sided, i just stop. And in this encounter, just stop asking when to meet again. 

Now, we doesn’t text to much, and she haven’t asked about a new date or anything. So i just thought fuck it i’m not gonna ask anymore really since i’m the only one who have. 

Now everytime, everytime i’m sending snaps where i’m partying and stuff and there’s other girls, she take all these kind of kinky videos and selfies just randomly, and i absolutely don’t know what to do with it. I often see it when i’m drunk af and just Think haha and never reply. But what the hell, does she want attention, or...? I don’t chase girls like that and it seems so childish to me yet idk what she want.  

So i think the advice i need is: what should i do from now on... continue just not asking about a next date until she does? what does she even want at This point? It seems so obvious she want my attention yet i’m not gonna Seem interested just for her confidence boost if that’s what it is lmao",10Nov2020,1
887,"I have had a tremendously bad dating life. I'm a 22 year old male, and I have been hurt very badly by women in the past. Now let me be very clear I am NOT sexist.

I don't want to feel this way, and I would like to think that there are still good women left in this age bracket. When you've been hurt as much and as badly as I have, it's very hard to get out if this mindset sometimes. However, I will acknowledge that alot of this has to do with my piss poor decision making when it comes to dating in the past. I want a loving relationship with someone who respects and values me just as much as I do them, but the problem is that even though I know alot about what to look for, I'm constantly scared of getting hurt. I don't want to be hurt again and again, which is why I don't even try, because I don't feel lovable.

889,"Just to preface, i'm a guy and i'm gay. I met this straight guy online about 6 months ago from a mutual friend and we talk over discord...let's call him jake.  Of the 6 months knowing Jake, the things he's said/texted to me I've felt to be really weird and I don't know how to feel about it which resulted in me telling my friends who have also talked to him. They said that he likes me but that didn't really make sense because the guy is straight so?? **I also want to point out that he has a gay brother** but to start I'm going to tell you guys most of the things he's told me in the past in chronological order and i'll try to make it condensed.

The first month of mostly talking to him with just friends we were on a topic of selfies. My friend drew always casually turned on his cam to show us whatever and what not but you know I already knew what they looked like. My best friend adrian dropped a selfie because he was just showing himself on vacation. Adrian decided to ask Jake to drop a selfie but Jake told him no he won't drop a selfie unless I drop a selfie too. I told him that I didn't want to. (I didn't have a reason to want to see what Jake looked like because I didn't know him all that well. We were always in a group setting so I didn't necessarily feel like he was really a friend of mines because he was friends with drew. It wasn't until recently that my Adrian told me Jake messaged him asking for my last name after that all happened...also yes eventually he did see a selfie of me)

Second month I started to play video games with Jake and we start to become actual friends. Basically Jake texted me if drew was fine after what happened that night and I told him yes. That night we were texting and this is what happened, ill try shortening it.
&gt;me : go to sleep

&gt;him : no i can get two hours of sleep and function

&gt;me : that doesn't make it good now go to sleep before i drop kick you (i also sent a gif of an anime character being dropkicked)

&gt;him : honestly if you could do that I would be so impressed i wouldn't be mad tbh

&gt;me : youll have it coming your way if you don't sleep

&gt;him : so don't sleep?

&gt;me : u want me to kick you??? ill do it

&gt;him : i mean kinda and if ur on ur way here bring some jambalaya and some gumbo ok ok (i live in NOLA)

&gt;me : okay well since you asked for it whenever it happens dont question it

&gt;him : i will not so long as i get what i asked little 5'3"" man (he says that since im actually 5'4"" IRL)

&gt;me : i'm like 6'4"" 

*other texts happen*

&gt;him : it's fine size doesn't mean everything

&gt;him : except height

&gt;him : small boi

I found him calling me small boi extremely odd since no one has ever called me that and usually if they are talking about my height i get called midget. Within that same month it was me, him, and adrian and he was making a joke about how my height would make me a perfect girl and I was just so like ????. 

I want to make this short and not too long so here and some weird(?) instances between me and him. 

&gt;Having a convo with him in voice chat and he accidentally called me baby. He said he needed a moment after he said that but I was trying to continue the convo. he said he needed a moment.

&gt;He jokingly said he hates me and I told him ""same i hate me too"" as a joke because i normally self deprecate and he told me that I should love myself but I was still joking. I told him ""aren't you like 4'4"" and he responded saying ""aren't you like adorable and should love yourself dumbass?"" which isn't what I was expecting for him to say. 

&gt;Next day we were talking and his cat was near him wanting something. He said ""OP, my love"" and then right after was saying why does my name and his cat name have to be so simple and was saying how the other day he kept calling his friend by my name. 

I also want to throw in that he says my name a lot and I don't know why but I guess its just a thing he does? Even since now its just been the two of us playing basically every single day he says my name in every other sentence, anyways.

&gt;He texts me one day, ""hey i hurt my ankle but did you see that new boss in WoW?"". I text him if he's okay and yeah I did. He later comes in voice chat with me and two other people and he's talking about what he got for his pc. Eventually he leaves and he shows me a pic of the inside of his computer. I text him, ""if i could reach through the screen and fix ur cable management I would"" and he responds by saying, ""come fix my leg and my pc plz"" 

&gt;My power was off for a couple days due to hurricane zeta. Saturday it turns back on for like an hour and I tell him and we play a bit of games but then it shuts back off. I text him telling him that and he says ""I guess its back to another day without OP""

There are other kind of weird instances to me but I don't think for other people its deemed as weird so I won't include them. My friends have been telling me that yeah he likes me but Jake was telling me about how he thought him and this girl he was talking to was hitting it off but she stopped texting him so after he told me that I felt like, okay well then he doesn't like me then if he told me about a girl that stopped talking to him and he felt upset/sad about it. 

I don't really know how to feel and i'm really confused. I don't know if my friends have implanted the idea that he likes me or if he's just a really affectionate straight guy that he gets these things from his gay older brother or not.",10Nov2020,1
890,"I (17, transmale) have a younger sister (13). We live in an abusive household with our mum and dad, but they are filing for a divorce. Currently, my dad plans to take custody of both of us (mostly my sister because im 5 months from turning 18). The way my sister has treated me for the past 4 years, however, makes me not want to live with her. She's done a number of things that I don't think are normal for her age including:

Telling me to kill myself (multiple times, once because I came out as transgender)

Has gaslighted me about numerous traumatic events

mocked me for being raped

lied about me to my parents (including telling them I tried to molest and rape her. I'm openly gay and a rape victim, so why she even thought this was appropriate, I can't fathom)

chased or threatened me with a knife multiple times (once when I was high and she was aware I was high)

Neglected or abused her animals (She found a wild bird and starved it to death, neglected her guinea pigs, and then took my guinea pigs and starved them for 3-4 days before I took them back)

And there are many more things she does that are too small to mention specifically, but to put shortly she's an extremely lazy, narcissistic, and entitled person, even for her age. Her room has collected mold that I had to clean, and now she treats me like a house servant. She's constantly starting fights with me in between online classes, including getting mad at me for not taking care of her dogs when I was doing exams.

My dad says he's going to try to keep her away from our mum because our mum is mentally ill and narcissistic as well, but I don't think I can live in the same house as my sister anymore. I've confronted both of my parents over her behavior, and they give me essentially the same answer of ""If (opp parent) isn't gonna take action then I don't have too, so just get over it.""

Recently I got on anti depressants, and even though im in a sensitive transitional period where I'm not supposed to receive extra stress (which my sister had to do the same thing and I was extremely conscious of that) she's been trying trigger and gaslight me more than unusual (locking me out of the house on my smoke breaks and telling my parents im acting crazy because I asked for her phone)

Other friends I have tell me that my sister's behavior isn't normal and is, in fact, rather abusive, but my parents refuse to take action, and I'm at the end of my rope.

Should I confront my parents again more aggressively, should I confront my sister (more than i have)?

I want to move out asap, but because of my mental illnesses and disorders (I have BPD, PTSD, on spectrum, and extreme anxiety) it's harder for me to be independent and keep long-term connections with people who aren't family, so I likely won't be able to actually live on my own until I've finished college",10Nov2020,1

893,"Hi, I left my abusive household almost 11 months ago and I think I've ended up with other people that just dont care about me either. Long story short I ended up getting fired from multiple temp jobs and was going to become homeless in a week, so my ex boyfriend suggested that I should stay with him and his family until I get back on my feet. I was really hesistant about it but I eventually agreed.

I've been here only a month and I feel extremely uncomfortable. The first week I feel like I was being pressured, degraded and pushed around by his father. He seemed okay at first, but then he got mad at me because the rest of his family was ""late for bible study"" (hes a pastor). He started asking me if I was there as an attempt to get back with my ex boyfriend and that it seemed like I was a distraction to them when I just got there. 

The next day he asked me a trick question and asked me how much do I want to give him. I said whatever he wanted twice then he kept asking me and I said about $200 a month and then he asked me how much was I paying for the airbnb I was staying in before I got there and I said about $240 a week. His attitude changed so quickly and he said how I'm stingy and I dont like to give. He said why do I feel comfortable giving him $200 and he's driving me around and giving me food (which he was). Then he started bringing up information about my family that I think was uncalled for. 

I've been basically forced to act like a Christian. Now I'm being asked to pay $500 a month to live in the living room (I'm questioning on if that's fair or not) while my ex boyfriend pays $400 a month to stay downstairs and have his own room. Everything his father has said hasnt been horrible hes asked me if I'm okay and keeps calling me smart but I just feel used. He got me a job and eventually wants to give me driving instructions so I can get my license but I feel like I'm just being played. 

He's been doing really shady things, lying, and telling my business with his other family. Typing this out I'm starting to realize he seems like a dick, but I dont know if its the safest or smartest move for me to move out without having anyone. No I'm not going to a homeless shelter before anyone suggest that most homeless shelters are horrible. I've been thinking about just packing up my shit and leaving in the middle of the night but that would leave me with absolutely no one and I may risk homelessness again if I lose this current job and if I do leave I'm sure him and his family will follow me and harass me at work. Recently he told me again that he thought it was shady that I didnt tell him immediately when I got paid and that I told him hours after. I was listening but I was really confused. It just seems like he's nickpicking and being petty because he doesnt know me. It's just degrading to have to deal with it all of the time. 

I'm really not trying to be ungrateful. He took me in when I didnt have anything and I havent paid rent but I feel like I'm just being played to the fullest extent because I have no one in my corner. I know one of the reasons hes acting like this is because he told me people have used him in the past but I just feel like its being taken out on me. My heart just feels heavy all of the time. I think I'm going to tell my ex boyfriend in the morning that I really don't want to be friends with him anymore. We've been friends for a decade but the way he's just making excuses for them is turning me off. I'm starting not to like any of them. It's like no matter how much I try I just don't like them. 

I don't want to disclose my age but I would really appreciate someone with a lot of wisdom and experience answer this. I dont know if I'm just being selfish but this seems really off and even if it does turn out I'm living with a bunch of assholes I need to know what is the safest path to action without ending up in a homeless shelter or the streets.",10Nov2020,1
894,Ok so about 2 years ago I co-signed for a vehicle for my dad. He didn’t have any transportation and our family was struggling. He needed a way to work so he convinced me that this was the only way and how we would survive. I didn’t know the rules of co-signing or anything. I was 18 and dumb just listening to my dad. The car eventually got taken away as he made NO payments on the vehicle and now that shit hits my credit(499). When I signed I wrote I was unemployed and even told the company my dad was responsible for the payments. The debt is on my credit and my dad is no longer talking to me due to him and my mom divorcing. What can I do to get this off my credit?

So, for context, I'm heavily dyslexic and do 3 higher level languages (Irish, German &amp; English)

 I've been having a terrible month or so, between my father loosing his job, my therapy being put on hold, depression and suicidal thoughts, selfharm, Covid, school and a lot more. 

I was doing my Irish homework, a very easy (but long) comprehension with questions. It should've been extremely easy, but for some reason, I just couldn't understand anything. I got so stressed, I scratched my arm until it bled heavily. Eventually I took a break and then my Dad asked my to do a few bits around the house, and I forgot to finish the work. (It was due the next day) So when my teacher came and corrected the homework (individually) I explained myself. He looked and sounded so disappointed, and went on for 5-6 minutes about how he, ""expects better from you"" and ""how you're losing marks more often"" Yada-Yada, he'd a whole speal ready, and he did this infront of the entire class and I felt so humiliated. He threw jabs at me the whole class as well, so I'd my own 40 minutes of hell. My confidence was already suffering and that just completely broke the camel's back. I've been feeling terrible since. Especially since I'd come out to my parents 2 days before, when they'd found out about my selfharm, and their reactions were less then supporting. Also, to really rub salt in the wound, I smashed my phone screen the same day (I don't have the money to buy a new replacement screen) It's been like a week, and I still can't get it off my mind. I feel really, really bad, and don't know what to do.

My Nana is blind, her husband recently died and now she lives with us. Her mental and physical health has been slowly deteriorating. She keeps falling and now she's scared to basically do anything. What's so frustrating is having to struggle to understand her when she speaks, being called multiple times in a row, her not believing me when I tell her things and her overall fear. 

My mom has a medical condition that is affected by stress and my Nana is really taking a toll on her. It bothers me so much that my grandmother is causing my mom and everyone else to be so frustrated all the time. 

It feels like I don't have the time or freedom to be a kid and enjoy my last years of highschool. It feels like I'll always have to worry about something. My Nana falling. My mom getting sick. Not having the house cleaned how my mom wants it when she wants it. Grades. My social life. Love. My mental health. Being productive but also having time to rest. I'm just really overwhelmed. And angry. It feels like no ones helping me. It feels like everyone is counting on me to be ""the responsible one"" a role that I was forced into as a younger kid that I can't seem to escape. Its so fucking stressful... I want to throw tantrums. I want to scream. I want to fight. I want to run away. I just want to feel free to enjoy life without feeling selfish or having to worry about so much. 

Its stressful... 

My mom wont put my Nana in a nursing home even though her being here is stressing everyone out. 

The anger and irritability I've been feeling is crazy. Talk about intrusive thoughts 😤...

Idk I just want some time to relax to blow off some steam, to not feel the need to worry about anything for a bit. It feels like I've had to worry my whole life. It used to feel like love but now it feels like shackles. Imaginary shackles of my own design.. They weigh a lot on my mind...

923,"My husband has joint legal custody of his kid (6F). We will call her “Lea” for privacy. We do have a pending contempt court case, but it’s on hold indefinitely due to covid. 

For short backstory, Lea’s mother has a boyfriend who she and Lea have lived with for 3 years now. My husband lived with Lea and the mother until shortly before that, then they split. So this transition occurred at a very young age. They live several states away. 

Since she was 3, Lea has been taught to call my husband by his first name and that he is not her dad or family. Instead, boyfriend is her real dad who helped “make her”. The mother claims that Lea naturally started calling my husband by his first name at the age of 3, which our attorney refuses to believe and we especially don’t, since nobody ever mentioned his name around Lea back then. He picked her up for visitation one day and it was a new thing. Lea herself has told us several times over the years, that “mommy tells her” to call him that. The mother does not correct the issue, and instead seems to encourage it by saying Lea is allowed to call my husband whatever Lea feels is right, and that since her boyfriend is there all the time, it only makes sense that Lea calls him dad/daddy and my husband by his first name. I’m not here to debate any proof or legal topics because it’s impossible to type out 3 years worth of litigation. The judge we have in our pending case has acknowledged that it is a bad alienation case and has stated so during a teleconference with our attorney. 

During our last SEVERAL visitations, any time anyone in the family would say “go ask your dad” or something similar, Lea would explode in anger and scream “he’s NOT my dad!” and throw a fit. Even if extended family members would say “your dad”, not knowing beforehand the of the issue, it would cause a huge meltdown. There were several occasions where we talked to her about it, and she is convinced that my husband is not her family, that she “believes her mom”, and her “dad is back with mom”. The fits end in Lea being super attached to me and rejecting my husband for several hours. We have always told her that the man she lives with is her step-dad, just like I am her step-mom, but that my husband is her real dad. We have also told her that it’s ok to have to 2 dads, but she didn’t like that either. We have had to read and show her her own birth certificate and she still wasn’t convinced. 

We see her for several months out of the year (spread out) and my husband talks to her on the phone weekly. Things always seem normal until “dad” gets brought up. If there is any mention of who he is from anyone, Lea goes nuts. 

Do we just let her call my husband by his first name? Do we continue to correct her hoping it sticks?
What would be best for her emotionally? 

We are scared that if we let her continue how things are she will eventually 100% reject my husband. She deserves a good relationship with her dad and we don’t know how to give that to her with so much manipulation back home. She’s gotta be confused as hell to have extensive visitations with us (apparently) random people. Logically It makes no sense but she’s not at an age to think critically like that...

TLDR: step daughter believes that my husband is not her dad/family and to only call him by his first name. When we try to correct her she gets upset. Mother encourages the behavior. Need advice on how to handle this without sabotaging relationships or mental well-being.

I lived in this lie until I reached 19, from there it was a downwards spiral of loosing people. To some I let go, realising they were never my friends, some let me go becuase I was not a good friend to them and most were just lost to time. My best friend became just a girl that I barely see. 

I'm 20 now, nearly 21,  seeing everyone hang around with their friends and getting called to hang out all the time. I was never called out, I was always the one reaching out. I guess I was never a big part of anyone's life. This hurts and it hurts even more now that I realise I don't even know how to meet new people or make new friendships that matter. I don't know if this is something everyone goes through or if I'm just really that horrible that no one wants to be around me anymore.

I’ve been living for some months in another country after relocating due to my new job. This country has been in lockdown, with everything closed and literally zero opportunities to go out. I don’t have any friends here and I have been feeling incredibly depressed for the past month. I’ve spent so much time thinking how I could make things better, but nothing has worked. 

I booked my flight to go back home for Christmas at the beginning of December and now I’m debating if I should anticipate it a week. Home also the Covid situation is not looking good, but I have my mom and my friends and I really need to be close to someone that loves me right now. I’m just incredibly afraid of being stuck there, since I don’t get along with my mom once we are h24 together. On top of this the only “highlight” of the month is that I’ve started dating this guy I like, and I’m afraid he’s going to lose interest in me if I go away for such a long time (more than one month for sure, could be also two since my birthday is in Feb and I don’t want to spend it alone).

Among the other subjects, I chose maths, as I had been doing it since I started in my current school, I had considered myself to be quite skilled in the subject, and my dad was quite a fan of the subject and fully supported my endeavours in it. In hindsight, this was a mistake. Instantly, I little to no idea what the hell my teachers were talking about, and I found the work I was being set close to impossible (in all honesty, I haven't had a clear idea as to what the hell we've been doing since early October). On top of this, I never had the confidence to speak up, and constantly fell behind with homework, only further leaving me in the dust. Overall, the results I have been getting this far have been abysmal (I got 2% on one of the few homeworks I did hand in), and considering that so much as looking at one of the questions is enough to start stressing me out and send my heart racing, I don't see this as changing anytime soon. So I am fully considering dropping maths and switching to another subject, but I am very worried that my dad would get mad at me (for the record, he is largely unaware of my current progress).

950,"So, I work as a house inspector for a landlord who we will call Mr. Crowther (he doesn’t permit use of his first name irl. I even think that if you asked me what his real name was, I wouldn’t know the answer because it’s simply never used). Since I have 0 qualifications, it is a very good job for me. I don’t need any skills, all I do is go out to houses that Mr Crowther rents out with a little clipboard and pen and make sure everything is ship shape. It’s a decent-paying job. While it doesn’t pay regularly as most jobs do, each inspection pays an amount of money and with 2 inspections per month, it earns me about as much money as a minimum wage job and it’s easy work.

The hardest thing about the job is having to interact with the god-forsaken soul that is Mr Crowther himself. Mr Crowther isn’t what I would call immensely rich but he is, in comparison to the everyday man, very wealthy. He lives in a relatively large house but only seems to reside in 3 rooms of the house: his bedroom (which I have only seen once and is a nice room), his office, and his sitting room. I’ve seen him eat countless times before but I have never, in my many days, seen him retrieve from a kitchen or dispose in a bin of that food. Regardless, I’m waffling now. When one enters Mr Crowther’s home, he behaves as if you are, to some degree or another, a wasp or other pest which he is reluctantly allowing you in. Even though he asks you to personally go to his house to report back to him.
Furthermore, Mr Crowther seems to fester as a man. He seems to more exist in his home than live there. There is not a thing out of place there, as if the whole place is a sort of undisturbed monument to his wealth. When in his home, I am not permitted to lay a finger on anything lest I dirty it or try to steal it.

Crowther hates poor people, often making jokes of them (which nobody, not even him, laughs at) and making fun of his tenants for renting a house and not owning their own, even though they pay his money? 

Also, Mr Crowther is miserable. And I know what you’re imagining. A sad elderly man. Wipe that image clean out of your mind. Mr Crowther isn’t just miserable himself but seemingly endeavours to make everyone else just as miserable. I do not think he associates with a single human being outside of work (he has no living family to my knowledge nor does he seem to have friends). I have often wondered if it is loneliness that makes him miserable and have attempted to make friends with him to cheer him up a bit. But no. He seems to be perfectly fine with his misery.

Also, a few months back, we had to evict a woman and man from a house because they could not afford to pay. The woman was pregnant. I was involved in this and I will admit. I felt ashamed of myself. I just had to run over in my head “You’re doing this job for your family”. But Crowther? He seemed to actively take pleasure in the experience. It is one of very few times I have seen his stone face crack a smile.

My wife has suggested that I work somewhere else and I have been trying for the past 2 months but with no qualifications, it is hard to get a job as easy as this one. 

I need some advice. The job I do is very easy and, for a man with no qualifications, a blessing to hold. But, does anyone have any advice on how I can either associate less with the man or somehow make him less of an out and out d*ck.",10Nov2020,1

Eventually I got a food service job at a bagel shop, which I’ve worked for 3 months and managed to be recently promoted in. 

I’m not making good money, but I’m surviving (for now). But here’s where I need help.

I actually enjoy this job. I am terrified of the corporate world. But this job is safe, it’s fun, with good people, and I’m excelling at it.

For the last 5 or so years, I’ve always said I wanted to open a coffeeshop. Now that dream is starting to seem like something I could do down the line. And working this job right now has taught me a lot about the industry.

I’m also apart of a (failing) startup right now, but it’s pretty much nothing. Basically, I have business experience and know how to start one up.

I guess I’m asking for...reassurance? So many people talk down about minimum wage workers.

“Get another job.”
“Low pay for low skill.”
“For teenagers.”

But I’ve been trying to get other jobs, I am not low-skilled, and I’m not a teenager. And part of me feels okay with what I’m doing. Society tells me otherwise.

If I can save money, plan out my life a bit better, and keep at it, I hope that I can even just be the GM of a location for this restaurant. And then move on to opening my own spot.

I (13M) moved to Cumberland County PA from Sonoma County CA for a number of issues. Fires, drought, blah blah blah.

Now, I’m gonna be starting fresh and I’m so scared. I don’t know how different it’s gonna be compared to California. I have hybrid learning and my first day is going to be in-person.

Also sometimes one group or the other will joke and say “you’re sitting with us!” which I hate because I try to sit with both and I don’t want it to be a big deal. I’m just wondering if anyone’s been in this situation being in between 2 friendship groups? the 2 groups get along but don’t sit together. does anyone have advice?",10Nov2020,1
966,"My gf of 2 years dumped me and is now accusing me of manipulation and it’s messing with my head

These fights happened while ago and I thought they were wrapped up by you know clearly not. Context she was raped by her dad as a Child and abused until o encouraged her to leave to her moms when we first got together and was there with her through daily depressive episodes. ( is you have any questions put it in the comments) Ok this all started when me and her were talking about our future and the question of a break up came up. It was what would be the reason if it were to happen and I said “pretty much  nothing besides cheating and drug use” ( family members have suffered from substance abuse so I’m always uncomfortable when people who I care about lean towards that given I’ve lost family to it). She said “nothing but not trusting her and if we did break up she get on bumble and be a slut” This made me uncomfortable Bc she knows from my last relationship especially and other friendships I have trust issues and from my exes actions after, but we haven’t had any problems so I thought nothing of it. Then a month past and she was out with her sister ( who I don’t like due to threats and constantly pushing her sister to get drunk and do drugs; this is bad Bc she wanted my gf to use these as coping mechanisms Bc my gf was depressed to the point of self harm and had to drop out of school due to anxiety. And her sister always teased her for this) she went to a friends of her sisters friends house and got really tipsy. I said it was time for her to go home Bc I wanted to see her on the weekend and her mother would ground her and be extremly pissed if she wasn’t home when she was woke up for work at 6. She said ok and an hour later at around 3:30 she faked a picture of her being in the napping chair but at the time I didn’t know this. I went to sleep and woke up at around 6  to her mom calling me super worried wanting to know where her daughter was. I freaked out told her everything I knew and what she last told me and spammed call her to find out she fell asleep at her sisters friends apartment which is close to her own and her mom was pissed at her. In her moms and my own panic I explained what happened and what I knew so her mom pretty much knew everything her daughter did. My gf blamed me for her mom being mad at her and getting her sister kicked out. I thought she was kidnapped or something but she just lied to me and went to another guys house where she got sexually harassed ( she didn’t tell me that until after our fight)  and got  more drunk then she went to the other apartment and fell asleep. She got lectures by her mom and then her dad when he picked up her sister, then called me where she confessed to lying to my face. I was pissed and it lead to a half hour of me yelling and crying and tell her if she pulled this shit again I would break up with her. That was the part she called manipulative. And for context my reason for being pissed was she made me think she was kidnapped or some shit Bc she lied to me and that itself went against what we had already talked about.  The second time is when she was hanging out with her sisters and her friends and they were hot boxing the car, my gf hates weed and it’s smell so I told her not to smoke any and just go back inside.  She agreed and she did, so i tried  to face time her, so o could talk to her before my match the next day, and she picked up but it was her sisters friend and she was still in the car. After an hour when she went back inside I asked if she smokes any. She said no and i reminded her about how o feel about drug and not to lie to me. ( this was another time she claims I was manipulative). The 3rd time was I’m the middle of the pandemic In the summer she went out to see her sister, who claimed the Pandemic didn’t exist and COVID was just the fancy flu. I have 2 family members who are at risk so I was upset about this Bc to wait 2 weeks to see her now on top of the 2 months I hadn’t seen her, she knew this but didn’t care too much.  After this she went out again with new friends to a gathering stayed till 2 and for tipsy. At this point o was upset Bc ever since the last time she got drunk my feelings towards alcohol worsened, she knew this and didn’t care and said me getting upset was manipulative.  The next time was when she was out with her best friend and they were trying to sell clothes on I think it was offer up. Some guys asked her for nudes and she tried to scam them first, then actually considered it but said no. The her and her friend made an only fans account then deleted it ( they’re both underage at this point) when she told me this I was liek “ok what the fuck” then we argued. Ok here is where I ducked up she confesses to me and o got upset with her and I feel pretty shitty about it. Plus she never actually sent nudes or posted anything on the account.  The last thing happened 2 weeks before we went on a break for 1 1/2 months. At this point I hadn’t seen her on 3 months and this was my chance for her to come over. Her mom works at a place that has a lot of cases but at the time was working for home and her test cane back negative but she wanted me to show my parents an article about her work showing how many cases it has. So I told my parents about the cases and told them  about the cases 
And what her mom was doing and they were fine with it. So the day comes I’ve Cleaned the house  shores shaved mowed the lawn. Then her mom contacted my parents shows them the article again then o got screamed at by my parents. I was angry and upset Bc this was an hour before she was gonna show up. She called me out in being to angry this time. That’s it. Then we went on a break she said she wanted to get back Together then broke up with me again Monday. Over the break I put a lot of work into my therapy became less anxious and have little Anger  issues now Bc I was working on that even before the break Bc I was already in therapy. Given the situation I’m in now with the car crash and other things are be kinda regressed and idk why to do. She smoked weed on Sunday and told me about and it ducked with my head more and she was my only friend, my best and closest friends and I have social anxiety so I can’t reach out or get a connection with anyone anymore, I’ve lost all motivation, I can’t focus , I can’t keep food down and I have no appetite.

968,"I apologize if this is stupid or inconsequential, but it's a genuine thing that's been on my mind for a while, and I'm doubting my passions and enjoyment of certain things.

When I was younger, I was a very arrogant kid, and I typically partook in a lot of what people call ""cringe culture"", and I'd look down on things ""cringey"" people liked or things kids liked. I avoided a lot of popular and interesting things that I now really love, because they were ""cringe"". Some examples of things I now enjoy that I looked down upon as a teenager were things like Undertale, Homestuck, and Five Nights at Freddy's.

I've grown a lot since those times, and I'd like to think I'm a nice person and a contributing member of society. I have a great job that I truly enjoy and gives me a lot of opportunities to help people, but in my mind, I still doubt myself a lot because I worry that my passions and interests are seen as cringey or sad to others. I spend a lot of my free time writing fanfiction, analyzing narratives I enjoy, and playing video games.

Even now I tend to immerse myself in my writing and projects, and many people have judged my devotion to these things and asking if I have a life, or that I should go outside. I don't shove my interests down people's throats, and I rarely speak about them IRL. This is especially frustrating because I know that I wouldn't think this way of someone else in my position anymore - some of my friends do many of the same things I do, and I've never judged them for it, but I doubt myself for the same thing a lot.

I get terrible anxiety at the thought of people regarding me as a loser, but I don't think highly enough of myself to simply ignore when people think of me that way. My friends try to comfort me by saying that, if people judge me for things like this, then I shouldn't bother with them - but I've always been a fairly lonely person, and sometimes I feel like I just have to take when I get when it comes to personal relationships.

Is this a common feeling? Would it be best to move on and focus on more ""grown up"" interests? If not, what can I do to overcome these thoughts?",10Nov2020,1
969,"A little bit of additional context. I’ve smoked cigarettes for almost 25 years give or take 2 years (total) of no smoking and 4-5 years of vaping. I’ve also drank since I was 13 with heavy (5-7 days a week, 10+ drinks a day) for about 15 years. Daily chronic pot smoker since I was 18 with maybe 6 months pot-free. 

I’m attempting to quit cigarettes for the hundredth time today after finding out my uncle just had a bad stroke resulting from poor health habits. I’ve cut down drinking quite a bit with maybe 1-2 days where I drink with no more than 4 drinks (all socially). The pot smoking is still daily. 

My current girlfriend hates all of the above and would prefer the cigs were completely gone, pot was very limited (social occasions only) and alcohol be limited to 1-2 days a week. She has never indulged in any of the above. And she doesn’t want these addictions in the future father of her children. I agree. 

I don’t look like someone who’s abused those substances given the comments I get on my skin , hair and teeth but obviously that’s no reflection on the damage done internally. I am active and while I can get out breath while running or swimming, am overall in decent shape. Also eat pretty clean. Since I’m starting my healing journey again, I want to be very focused on healing and ridding myself of the addictive substances. I don’t want to have health issues when I’m older.

What are some lifestyle changes, diet or otherwise, I can implement to slow down or reverse the harm I’ve caused after years of abusing my body? Has anyone been successful in completely changing their lifestyle while maintaining one of moderation (pot and/or alcohol)?",10Nov2020,1
970,"Hello everyone, 

I'm 24 years old and live in a college town. I was in the store the other day was shopping for a shirt at the clearance rack when a dude about my age approached me and started a conversation with ""That's a good idea"" (browsing the clearance rack). We had quite a long and friendly conversation and in the end actually exchanged numbers. A few days later we hung out together at the bar. My  first thought was that his intentions were...romantic but thankfully that was not the case. He's got a girlfriend, works full time, seems like a typical guy. We drank beers and played pool and had a good time. 

During our conversation, I mentioned that I travel a lot, to which he responded that his mentor travels a lot as well. So I asked him about his mentor, and he told me that he basically gives him life advice, specifically financial advice, and that he (the mentor, who is quite older) is now able to travel each month and has retired early and able to escape the 9-5 grind. 

I asked him some more questions about it and he said he could get me in touch with the mentor if I would like. So I said sure, why not. 

Now he wants me to give a good time for a zoom meeting with the mentor. I asked him ""so, does this cost or...?"" and he said no it doesn't cost anything. 

Does this seem legit? Is there even much of a 'mentoring' industry? Is it prone to scams? 

I thought that I made a new friend (and maybe I have), which is great because I don't have any friends here because I just moved. 
But now a part of me is freaking out, thinking the friendliness is a cover to reel me into some pay-per-month-for-a-mentor scheme. 

Does anyone here have any insight they could provide with this? I've just never even heard of mentors before and I don't wanna get wrapped up in a scam or something...

I know it's an odd post , sorry for the length!

972,"\[cw for sexual abuse etc.\]

Last week I (17F) reported my mother for ""sexually abusing"" me as a very young child. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done but I decided to go through with it because she's currently working in a pre-school.

By sexually abusing me I mean she masturbated in my presence very regularly, often while holding me or talking to me - she was aware that I was awake and could see what was happening. She's also done some \~very\~ strange sexual things over the years, including going through my bins to find my used pads, being obsessed with my underwear and storing her own piss in tubs in her room.

There aren't enough hours in the day to go through everything my mother's done, but as well this she's verbally abusive, has occasionally been physically abusive, turns people I care about against me, neglected me when I was younger etc. My father is also a piece of work, he has anger issues and honestly I'm terrified of him - one time he dragged me down a stairs and left half my body bruised.

I was very worried about how my parents would react when I reported them, so I was hoping to be offered some kind of accommodation or foster care from the Irish equivalent of CPS, but I was told my case wasn't severe enough. I'm stuck in this house until I have enough money to move out. 

I reported through my school and met with a social worker the next day. When I told the story the first thing she said was that what happened to me may be extremely inappropriate but it's not considered sexual abuse and is not a crime. I was confused by this so I looked up the law on it afterwards and apparently it's only a crime if the perpetrator does it ""knowing or believing the child is aware, or intending that the child should be aware, that the person is engaging in sexual activity."" I got a voicemail today saying that the social workers are not worried about my mother working with kids and are closing our case. 

My parents are furious. My mother sees herself as the victim here and my father is enabling her. She has told our neighbours, her friends and our extended family that I've made false allegations against her. It hasn't happened yet but I'm terrified that they're going to hurt me physically again.

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand I'm obviously not happy with the conclusion the social workers came to - there's a paedophile working in a pre-school ffs - and I want to go back and try again. On the other hand doing so will put me in more danger, and it's not even likely that anything will come of it.

What could I even do? Ask to appeal my case? Talk to the police? Go directly to her employer? (to be clear I'm not asking for legal advice, I know this isn't the subreddit for that, I'm just throwing out ideas). The point I keep coming back to is that I wish someone would have spoken up about my mother before it was too late for me, and I could speak up before it's too late for someone else. Saying that I'll be of no use if I'm dead or grievously injured.

977,"There's probably a better place for this, but I figured I'd start here.  My mom (75y/o) comes over and watches my son (8y/o) while he's in remote/COVID school.  I've noticed over the past year or two that she's having more and more mood swings with increasing severity and losing recollection of past rants.  I know we're all getting a little testy in the COVID world but this is something different.  

She'll have an outburst over some trivial school related issue that will nearly bring my son to tears.   Then a half hour later she will claim to not know why he was crying and doesn't understand why he doesn't want to be around her.  She then turns into ""woe is me"" and ""My grandson doesn't want to spend time with me anymore.  I should probably just die and get it over with.""  

When she's not here, she never leaves her house.  All she does at home is sit in front of the TV and get angry at the news.  I've tried to invite her for a drive or any sort of outing, but she's convinced that's how the Corona's going to get her.  The one time I did get her out a few months ago, all she did was complain about the other drivers on the road.  Didn't even notice the drive or the scenery or appreciate the company.  

My grandparents all died when I was young so I don't have much recollection of their behavior in later years.  I'm trying to determine if this is just grumpy old person mannerisms, or if it's the beginning of dementia or something else.  I'd like to get her some help if possible, but she won't go to a therapist, and she'll only consider mood altering medication if her doctor says she absolutely needs it.  I'm at a loss because the rest of the family is at the point of not wanting to spend time with her knowing it's a matter of time before one of her anger rants and she ruins whatever gathering we're trying to enjoy.

979,"I know this is kind of a weird thing to be asking about, but I feel like this is one of the few times that it's reasonable to ask for help.

I don't like asking for advice, or even receiving it - to the point that I'll sometimes tell people to avoid giving me advice.

I like the feeling of being entirely independent - not needing assistance or support from anyone, and being able to solve all my issues on my own.

It also helps clear my conscience, knowing that I'm not burdening other people with issues that aren't theirs.

I also find talking to people difficult and somewhat stressful, so I'll usually shut up and not say anything while working on something, or just completely isolate myself and focus on solving the issues.

For the most part, it works out, and everything goes alright. But sometimes I find myself lost with no answers, and, being too stubborn to ask for help, some problems build up over time.

And nothing really causes it to be one or the other it really is random it feels like.

So is there anything I could do to stop that cycle, figure out what side of it is what I really think, or is it wrong of me to keep someone in a relationship were my mental state disallows me to care about them almost half the time.

989,"My dad is very controlling and a big perfectionist. His business constantly stresses him out, and he ends up taking it out on me (mentally, not physically). Every little mistake I make gets him mad at me, and a single hint of “attitude” gets me yelled at. He constantly makes me feel terrible about myself; calling me skinny, yelling at me for not talking a lot (even after I told him I was insecure of my voice), constantly insulting my intelligence, work ethic, makes me fee guilty about whatever he can, etc. He even called me braindead one time because I kept killing the car when he was teaching me manual. I HATE working with him (he owns a business), I hate constantly getting anxious when he comes home because I don’t know if he’ll be drunk or not (usually every other night). What sucks is that even if I get another job, he’ll still force me to work for him whenever he can. If I make a “big” mistake, such as accidentally breaking something or forgetting something, I have panic attacks because I know he’ll scream at me for it. Ever since I got my car, I have despised having to leave my moms to go to my dads (split custody). I often cry in the car because of how badly I do not want to come here. I genuinely haven’t been happy in years at my dad’s house. In fact, he manages to take away my happiness that I get from being at my mom’s house. Haven’t had a good mood here in soooo long. I have tried talking about it with him many times, and sometimes it gets better for a little, but he never changes. He is even physically abusive to my dog, and I feel so bad for her. When I’m at my moms, he never lets her out of her cage. She stays there at least 23.5 hours each day. It has been like this for years, and the thought of having to deal with this for another 1-2 years (until I go to college) has often made me think about suicide. The only reason I haven’t done anything yet is because I love my mom and my grandma, and the thought of destroying their lives because I couldn’t handle mine discourages me from doing anything. All I want is to just have a happy life with my mom.

Now I work for a Top 20 in a totally unrelated field and I’m more or less just a support role for a team of people who are higher up than me.  

Anyways, I feel like I’m not an expert in anything and it makes me really sad. I don’t remember much of my degree so I guess it wasn’t really my thing after all?

I started to learn super basic coding (html,CSS) but then I got confused and frustrated as things got more tedious. I tried makeup and while I’m decent enough, I could never become an expert like the girls who do contouring and can blend out their eyeshadow. I started learning how to cook, which I’m also okay at now, but I don’t have the skill to do anything advanced like baking or fancy knife cuts. There was also Yoga and general exercise, but I never get the form right can or can hold it long enough to build muscle. 

It just feels like I get to a “amateur” level of everything and can never surpass that. I really want to start becoming an expert at things, but everything just seems to be above my general skill level.

Sometimes I think I can just start reading up on things like astronomy, history, politics, but I forget most of what I’ve read a few days later so it seems pointless.

997,"I have a roommate who is also doing the same internship as me for a biomedical company. We work in the exact same room and I drive to work everyday with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew them a bit before the internship, but never really liked them. I got guilted into sharing an apartment with them for the purpose of ""saving money"" (rent is higher than it would be on my own lol). I have pretty bad social anxiety and when I don't like people I just ignore them, so that's what I have been doing this entire time, at work, in the car, at home. I don't know what it is about him that makes me dislike him so much, he smells, he is very extroverted while I am introverted, and his personality is everything that I hope not to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be a dick move to stop driving them to work everyday? So far I driven them to work everyday for 2.5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two different perspectives here. The first is that it is my car, he doesn't pay for gas, I don't owe him anything. The second is that if I was in their shoes forced to probably Uber or walk to work everyday, I would be pissed.

I don't really know, maybe it's just my social anxiety. I should value my happiness right? Sorry for rant. Probably my fault for entire situation.",10Nov2020,1
998,"So I am half european white, and half Okinawan(native japanese). My hair is thick, dark and there's a lot of it. 

My issue comes from it propensity to tangle. I can spend anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour brushing my hair, but it will re-tangle into a nest of nasty snarls the moment I mess with it. Which means if I do anything more than tie it back with a ponytail it gets REALLY angry. Which is a problem, because I desperately want to style my hair beyond a ponytail.

An example being when I try to braid my hair it will heavily clump together and re-tangle even if I conditioned my hair the other day. And I'm talking serious tangles that get worse if you try to undo them with your fingers.

Does anyone have hair similar to mine? Do you have tips or some sort of miracle solution that I just am not seeing? I want to be able to manage my hair, and have the choice to braid or stylize with relative accuracy.",10Nov2020,1

1002,"Hi, this might sound stupid, but I need to ask someone this. I’m 16 years old and last year my parents forced me to go to a doctor(which I kind off see as good thing now) and I was diagnosed with depression. I got medication and that helped a bit. But a lot of the time I still feel terrible. My parents are very busy lately and I don’t want to give them more stress and concern than they already have. So I tell them I’m much better, but I feel like I really need someone like a therapist or something. I actually asked my dad to make an appointment a few months ago, but I think he forgot about it and I feel weird asking that again. But the biggest reason I don’t ask for a therapist is that I’m very shy and i feel like I would just sit there and cry. And the therapist is not going to be able to help and it would be very embarrassing. So I was wondering if somebody maybe had some tips to be more comfortable with going to a therapist. Or maybe someone knows how to get rid of it on my own, because I have been trying so hard to be happy but nothing works. Thank you for reading this, I hope you have a good day.",10Nov2020,1

1004,"So i have a roomate that has lived in my house since august.  I’ve known my roomate for years, since we were 6 years old. Now we are 21. He is a boy &amp; ofc I am a girl, but we have never crossed boundaries, had sex, or even tried a romantic relationship. We have been friends all throughout high school and even have the same group of guys we always hangout, I’ve also never crossed the line with any of them &amp; I am the only girl. my relationship status is single, but i have had past relationships while being his friend. His on &amp; off ex of four years is completely toxic. They’re no good for each other, and she is out of control. We used to get along but for some reason, she just has the biggest issue with me &amp; especially him being my roomate even though we have nothing todo with each other than the living situation. She has cussed me out numerous times, apologized, did it again, and just has completely started so much shit i want to be completely done with both of them. I can tell when they are off because he is my friendly with me. I know she controls him &amp; makes sure it’s clear not to be my friend (even though we literally live together and have been friends even before her) When they were on speaking terms again, she came to our house unannounced beating on the door, causing a disruption in our neighborhood (which is a cookie cutter neighborhood, no loud shit) trying to fight me. Me being me I would have but instead I thought clearly and my neighbors called the cops on her. After that we had both agreed on her no allowed at the house. They were no longer speaking, and that’s the last of that. Well October 24th I checked our nest camera to find out he has been sneaking her in our house while I’m not there. I had a discussion with him how uncomfortable and disrespected I felt since it’s MY house he lives in. I brought the situation up as an adult to deal with it and he told me he has to be sneaky to have her around here &amp; that atleast she was here when I wasn’t. We agreed that if she apologized to me about the disruption it would make me feel better when she’s over. Well he had her over again and again without telling me to even apologizing. So at this point I’m mad, mad. I bring up the situation again and tell him exactly how I feel— disrespected and walked over especially when I pay majority of the bills. He agreed she owed me an apology, so she calls on FaceTime and apologizes with the NASTIEST attitude, being ghetto, talking about how she wants to still put her hands on me, she belittled me, cussed at me, and I have tried to be completely neutral and not let her have an effect on me since I am in no fault, but at this point I want her done. I am doing spells, anything I can do to get her to leave. My friend is being manipulated and walked all over, he doesn’t deserve this bad behavior, and also I am tired of dealing with this crazy bitch. What is some advice you can give me? Help me understand why she is so mad/jealous? I thought about getting a restraining order. I have text messages of her threatening me and shit talking me for no reason! I am so uncomfortable in my house and feel like i have no say, i do not want her here. HELP",10Nov2020,1

1006,"I had posted this in R/hair but nothing so i was wondering if y’all could help 

Hello all! So I need help with my hair really badly.  So since about mid 2018 i’ve grown my hair long, (just down to my eyebrows in the front) and just put it to the side and i had really healthy hair, however what I didn’t know is that I was lowkey ugly lmao.  Once i grew out of that stage, i realized i wanted a messy hair style, which now I do....but it isn’t natural...  

So to create that natural messy/curly hair style, i’ve been using “got2bglued” to kinda make it messy, then hairspray, then i think about 4 or 5 months back from this date, instead of using the glue, i’ve been using a half inch curling wand, every. single. day. and then once i get it to how i like it, i then hairspray it (quite a bit) so it stays like that. so then it’s like a curly messy hairstyle but stays like that. 

unfortunately i have to do it every day because naturally, my hair is straight, and just goes down to my eye brows and it looks super bad and never go out looking like that, and i’ve noticed i’ve been having really bad hair loss and burnt hair (i think?) in my hair, is there anything i can do? I perm+cut costs about $130 dollars, what can i do? I really badly need help.",10Nov2020,1
1007,"I thought I would be able to remain incognito until the summer, but it's reached the point where I'm going to have to come out to my roommates as a lesbian. Recently made a mistake while drunk and made a couple straight jokes and used ""partner"" to refer to an ex-fling. Our walls are paper thin so I heard them gossiping about it + questioning why I never mention boys and always seem to dodge questions about dating and sex. It's getting to the point where I know if I don't bring it up, they will.

I acknowledge it was unfair of me not to ask if they were comfortable rooming with a gay girl before signing the lease. I had to make a quick decision with less than a month before starting at a new school and had faith that I would be able to avoid them and keep acquaintanceship. The more they bring boys over and ask my opinions/history, however, the more obvious it becomes that I'm not straight. I don't want to lie to them but I also don't wanna be crimed/kicked out if they're uncomfortable.

For perspective, they've never said anything blatantly homophobic but sometimes get visibly uncomfortable when mentioning someone is gay or will say things like, ""they're...y'know,"" when implying someone is gay. I don't know how to read this.

I really just want to have a room to live in and be left alone. I don't want to bring harm to myself nor make them feel unsafe. If it really comes down to it I suppose I could find a subletter and move back in with my parents but explaining that move to my folks...would be a different advice post.

Anyone with experience: should I come out to my roommates? If yes, how can I do it with utmost consideration for their situation? If no, what would be a better way to dismiss their questions besides walking out of the room? I very much want to make sure I don't come off as predatory/a liar who tricked them into rooming so I could ogle them. I just want to live in peace but also be honest.",10Nov2020,1

My parents and family have always given him more attention and praise, while being more forgiving because he 'doesnt do well at school because he has a lot of energy' (that's probably true, but his IQ is under average too, but they seem to ignore that little detail) and the fact that he has been more helped and advised, has cleaned up a lot of his bad habits, and a lot of importamt decisions have been made for him, while with me, as I did well in school, they ignored my mental health issues and other stuff because ""he gets good grades and doesn't get in too much trouble"".

We were never exactly close and she has done a lot wrong.

I get so jittery in my seat like I can't sit still and don't know what to do with my hands except make a fist to keep them in place.

I know I have anxiety and even social anxiety so sometimes I think this is typical behavior for me except I'm not like this with my parents nor at school. My social anxiety with my sister is different from other situations. I know my sister isn't how she used to be but my body can't help to react the way it does.

My parents always sided with her and told me how wrong I was for ignoring her whenever my sister asked me to do something or having an attitude with her. The thing is, is how everyone would blame my actions for setting her off and justify whatever my sister did as a response against me. What I mean is if I were to ignore my sister then her response would be to hit me and my parents would say it was my fault for ignoring her cause she wouldn't have hit me if I just obeyed her.

1021,"

I’m 19M and my GF is 18F we’ve been dating for about 10 months though we didn’t tell her parents because they were against her dating recently she told them so they wanted to meet me 

Couple notes my GF grew up in a very religious family she herself believes in god and goes to church because she is forced to  while her parents are fanatic catholic fundamentalists who believe in every word of the Bible and love the Catholic Church as far as I know they don’t believe in evolution or vaccines and according to my gf have a tendency to push those opinions on to people (like my girlfriend got vaccinated secretly by her grandparents) 

While I am a slightly different denomination of Christianity and which they know but I’m not religious at all I’m not a fan of mass religious fanaticism like I would very rarely go to a service cause I am interested but the reason I’m not a fan bieng very into religion is because I have a family member entrenched in a cult and I see how it works and how damaging it is and yeah Catholicism isn’t a cult but same principles apply  

So I came over with my gf with us walking from a bus stop in the rain so I gave her my coat so she wouldn’t get wet so we showed up and I was absolutly soaked like to the point I had water dripping off me and every step I took made water run off me I apologized to her mom who greeted us but I could tell she was very annoyed 

So I was introduced to the whole family and then her mom told me to get changed at the entrance so I did then I was meant to have dinner with the family and that was really awkward where like they started asking me a lot of questions onto religiosity even though then knew I wasn’t too religious after which they asked what uni course I do and when I said medecine same as my gf they went on a rant how all doctors are servants of satan

But as the dinner progressed it got worse with her older sister asking me am I filling my gfs head with (satanic rituals like touching and kissing her ) the night continued with that sort of religious nonsense. I’ve learnt from the family member in the cult u don’t argue with fanatics but as the conversation progressed to other religions they went on a rant about how Muslim faith as all about violence and then asked me for “my satanic opinion” so I told them that I don’t quite agree it fully about violence though it does have some elements of it (with getting virgins for dieng in the name of god) as the meal progressed I was referred to satans minion/servant/slave this went on for about 2 hours 

Throughout the meal I could see my gf looked really upset and embarrassed and she was too mortified to even look at me like when it finished she went off to the bathroom and started crying in there so I went after her with the lie of I gotta use the toilet and left them there I tried to get it in but she had locked it and didn’t let me in and I could her sobbing 

So I just sat at the door waiting for her to come out but then her dad came up and said he wanted to talk to me so we went into his bedroom and he tried to intimidate me saying stuff like “if I defile his daughter he will make sure my funeral has a nice eulogy” but I don’t scare he easy he’s got a potbelly and is shorter than me plus I’ve got a black belt so I could see it annoyed him that I didn’t look scared by him I was polite though when talking to him 

Her parents also said that I would be sleeping on their couch but that I can’t have any blankets or beds sheets because they don’t support the devils influencers later on that night when her family went to bed she finally came out of the bathroom I tried to tell her I don’t care if they treat me like the spawns of satan but she was hysterical and spent the rest of the night crying that I deserve someone whose parents don’t insult me so I just hugged her. I’

How do make her realize that I still love her and don’t care what her parents think of me also how can I cheer her up cause she is till upset by this

1022,"Hi everyone!
I'm unsure what to do for my job. Several weeks ago, I started going back to my work (a small company) in person for a couple days a week to do the part of my job I can't do at home. I then discovered that my job was completely ignoring county health mandates. They were going on acting like nothing was happening (crowding together, no masks, no extra sanitizing, etc) and one guy even walked in coughing a lot then proceeded to get really close to me to talk. The temp checks were done way after I clocked in (an hour later), and the symptom questions were wildly inaccurate. I'm not even sure where they got that symptom list from to be honest. 

At the start of COVID, the company president announced he would not be taking any extra precautions as he didn't care if he caught it. My boss however, seemed serious about taking precautions but I never saw any get put in place. They pushed to stay open during the lockdown despite absolutely not being essential. I, however, was allowed to work from home because of some of the tasks I do for my job.

I was freaked out the entire day I was there. My family is high risk, so obviously this level of exposure was making me uncomfortable. We are currently one of the worst-off counties in the state in terms of infection rates too.

So I stayed the rest of the day (despite friends telling me I should have just left), and when I got home I sent my boss an email saying that I did not feel comfortable going to work when nobody was being safe about covid. I was very polite in my email. He did not respond (he usually replies very fast), so after several hours I sent him a text.

He responded with ""I can't comment on it right now. I'll get back to you on Monday. Stay home for now."" It was very terse and he seemed annoyed. I felt bad, because he's a nice person, and I do like my job....but this is changing my mind about the company.

So, Monday comes and he doesn't email me. I figure he's probably just busy, so I let it be for a couple days. Well, that couple days turned in to a week and he never responded to me. I was really just sad at this point so I left him alone and now a week has turned in to a month of not being told what he wants me to do. I am still working from home at the time and getting paid normally, but I have no idea what's going on and he's seemed to just cut off contact with me ever since I sent that email.  I haven't emailed him either because he has been very busy, and I felt like I was bothering him so I backed off. But he usually emails me at least once a week with projects. Yet, I am still employed.... Needless to say, I am very confused. 

What should I do in this weird situation? I'm scared of getting fired as it stands right now, but I feel like they could get in trouble if they fired me over this.",10Nov2020,1

Normally i can brush it off but today i snapped, i screamed full on, slammed doors etc. Ive never done this before and kve scared myself. Im 20 years old now and i need her to understand that im an adult and need some respect. Her favourite thing to do atm is call me a liar, which to me, is the worst thing someone can call me as its so far from who i am. Im afraid it will keep escalating. I cant afford to move out either as im a student and work part time. A quiet conversation isnt possible at all, she goes straight to yelling at me. My own grandmother and mum's friends have even spoken to her about it before as its affecting me badly. Im not an anvry person but when shes with me its instant stress and frustration. Any advice on how to deal with this appreciated. I feel lost. I feel like im the forgotton last child who she doesnt really care about, like im insignificant. Like im an inconvenience. And like im a pathetic piece of shit for getting upset of angry with her. I cant tell her how i feel as she says its just silly and dismisses it as if im just pathetic.

1034,"I (M20) have a close friend (M19) that is recently distancing/pulling away from me.

I noticed that he doesn't invite me out anymore and when i invite him out he either leaves me on read, makes an excuse or agrees to come but probably because he can gain something. I also suspect him of lying or talking behind my back.

It wasn't always like this. I feel like he doesn't value our frindship as much anymore and i can't stop thinking where did it all go wrong. I think that once he started to know me on a deeper level he started to lose interist and it all went downhill from there.

I can't blame him though. As an introvert socializing was never my strongest point, and him being an extrovert with popularity i can't even come close why would he need me around ?

But i still treasure our friendship because we had some of the most fun times together and i hope to get it back where it was.

Should i confront him ? Or pull away and give him space until it feels like the dust is settled ?",10Nov2020,1

1039,"I’m getting mixed messages from everyone I talk to but I figure it’s best to get as many opinions as possible. 

So basically I started working at a dairy farm milking cows. Last night was my first night shift there and in general. The first thing I noticed was a pretty big language barrier between me and everyone there, and I felt really out of place as everyone spoke Spanish and I couldn’t really talk to anyone. The job was incredibly labor intensive, which I should’ve expected, but I tend to idealize things too much and neglected to consider this. Everything hurt when I got home and I have large bruises on my arm from getting kicked by the cows. I also ended up working 45 minutes over but company policy says I don’t get overtime so I essentially worked an 11 hour shift and only got paid for 10. Moreover, I was told I’d get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. In reality I only got a 10 minute break and a 20 minute lunch. I was exhausted and overwhelmed by lunch and almost up and left at lunch. The person training me said people have often up and quit during their shift out of frustration. 

Now I’m conflicted. My main reason pulling me towards sticking it out is solely for my parents approval. Other than that, I don’t know if I want to work this job despite a higher pay than what I had before. Is that worth sacrificing my happiness for? I’d be happy to work a lower paying job temporarily while I establish residency in the state I’m in so I can go back and get my masters degree.

1042," 

This happened last year.

I was on my laptop in a classroom, and someone put his fingers on my keyboard, right in front of me, pulled up a video I was watching called ""How to get a girlfriend"", laughed at me, and then told some classmates in the same classroom.

Weirdly, despite this happening right in front of me, I never really bothered by it, and never even picked up on it as a mean thing.

It happened a year ago, but I'm only picking up on this now, and only now I'm getting angry.

I can also recall him saying mean stuff to me here and there.

When I confronted him about it, he's denying ever said those things and insisting that they're false. But I know for a fact that they're true.

Is he gaslighting? Why or why not?",10Nov2020,1
1043,"ive been going out with my boyfriend for about 9 months and we’re going through a rough patch. ive been constantly blaming myself for this but ive realised im not in the wrong. we started our relationship very passionately and were obsessed with eachother, we saw eachother every single day for months, we went to the same school and had most our classes together, we did everything with eachother. as of today the most ive seen of him was we took a bus together a few days ago for 10 minutes. around our 5 month mark we’d be fighting quite often and id be very depressed and need him for support, which hed try to give but eventually he stopped caring or knowing what to say. when we’d get into fights id tell my friends but id feel like id be talking shit about him and id get upset whenever theyd criticise them even if theyre right. around 6 or 7 months things were better and we’d still see eachother regularly. however at about 8 and half months he started being colder towards me, i understand he has alot of things on his plate at the moment and i shouldnt be his main priority but hed start to get irrational and impatient with me. he blocked me on every social media platform we had together over something really small and was annoyed that i was made upset by it. hed constantly call me stuff like stupid and annoying, hes made it clear many times that he cant stand me, id send him memes and hed tell me to shut up, we got into an argument and i apologised for what i said and tried to empathise with him and then he told me that i shouldve stayed in my place. he hints to making plans with me and then acts like im some sort of clingy obsessed baby because i got upset and mad he wouldnt follow up on it even though we haven’t seen eachother in a while. he acts like im a bitch because i talk shit but so does he, i try to work on whatever i do wrong but he doesnt, he apologised but doesnt show he wants to change, he barely interacts with me unless its to prove me wrong, he knows how i feel but he doesn’t care and he gets mad at me when im upset by his words or actions. he makes fun of my interests, my mental health, he excuses people when theyre unfairly mean to me, he tells me i make a big deal out of everything, hes condescending towards me even though im smarter than him, hes admitted he doesnt love me anymore for god knows what reason. i know i’m not perfect either, i can be confrontational but i honestly feel like hes causing the majority of the harm in the relationship. and i know that there’s probably no point in staying but i still feel this deep emotional connection towards him which he 100% does not return. i cant see myself not with him and i keep trying to keep the relationship going. what should i do",10Nov2020,1

1046,"Hello! Just an FYI I am writing this on a mobile. 

I’m about to graduate year 12 and torn between two uni courses. Please understand that I’m equally interested in science and medicine and art and design and as they’re polar opposites struggling to decide which path to take. However due to my family’s financial state (which isn’t the worst but definitely not the best) the financial capability of each course plays a major role in my choosing. 

I’ve been interested in medicine since I could talk forever telling people that I was going to be a doctor, and I still am. I know that I’d be super interested in the learning and understanding how the body works sort of thing, and that the work would be tough but rewarding but I just can’t shake the idea of studying interior design, or architecture or just something creative. I’m so interested in science and really enjoy learning all about it and I know I’d enjoy the job. 

I’ve always been creative and loved creating, and when a few months pass without doing something creative I just get this itch. I absolutely love the idea of creating something or designing a house or building and it’d be a dream to do that all day everyday, but I worry that I might exhaust my creativity if that makes sense? (Also it’s been suggested to me that I pair the course with property economics, which I have no knowledge on so I’ve just left that out) 

I’ve also grown up in not the best position money wise. We’re definitely not poor but we do struggle a lot and as a result I’ve grown up very money conscious, which has been playing a role in my choice of career. I know that I’d obviously be more job security and a higher pay (I think?) in nursing but I also worry about the mental and physical toll it may take. I know that money isn’t supposed to influence my choice but I can’t help it and really what I want most in life is to be better off than my family now. 

All in all I’m extremely confused and torn and have no idea who I should talk to. Do I choose the more job secure and better paying nursing? Or do I choose something I know that I’ll enjoy and get to exercise my creativity?",10Nov2020,1
1047,"So usually I’m the one giving advice, but I really need some of my own right now. I’ve been at my current residence for nearly a year with the same neighbors. My next door neighbor, however, has three kids (from two different fathers from the looks of it) and basically I’ve been hearing a lot of yelling and shouting outside in the recent months between her and her kids. I know one of them is a 11-12 f kid and that seems to be the one that gets yelled at the most. Just a couple of weeks ago or so she came to us at the door to ask to use a phone, but at the time I didn’t recognize her at first. I overheard her talking to her brother stating that she was locked out of the house. She wasn’t let back in until she was done with her phone call, but not without the mother saying I need to “mind my own damn business”. 

Just minutes ago I heard not only the mother, but some other person I don’t recognize yelling and screaming at her so loud that I could hear it through the walls of my house. They were basically threatening to take her phone away/not ever being able to have a phone again. Her phone getting taken away isn’t the part that bothers me. The parts I heard, like “I’ll hit/bust you upside the head” and other phrases were the thing that disturbed me, and it wasn’t even by the mom herself, but the mom was present and was TOTALLY ok with her saying this to her own kid. I don’t know if that makes it better or worst...

Anyways, I was wondering if this is grounds for contacting CSP. It most likely is, but I get anxiety from confrontation or threats if I do. But kids should never be treated like that... what should I do? Nothing? Or call?",10Nov2020,1
1048,"What do you do if you have a boss that loads your plate up so much that you’re working from 8-5 with no time to ever eat or stop then he complains that you aren’t doing certain job responsibilities you don’t have time for?

He has me so busy working on the current and new the old responsibilities are impossible to get to. He laid into me today for not getting around to 1 old responsibility.

I’m also working from home as a single parent to a toddler. So most days it’s #1 to get him fed and work done and I’ve lost 25lbs in just a couple months from not eating the entire day.

1049,"A couple of months ago, I changed many things in my life - in a good way. I changed my style and appearance to a state, where I like myself much more, started hitting the gym, left a very toxic friend behind, so I only have friends who support me, etc.. In addition to that, I even met a girl, had my first kiss and fell in love for the first in my life. Unfortunately we didn't had any type of a realtionship or a closer bonding between us, but it doesn't bother me that much, because this was 3 months ago and I'm not really into her anymore, after I got to know her better. So I was kind of emotionally attached to her, but like anything else didn't really fit.

So now to my problem: I'm now, mainly because of the experience I've had, so desperate to feel the same things again. I just want to have someone in my life I can give my whole love to. Thats maybe not so uncommon to feel, but in my case its so extreme, that whenever I see a girl at a store or wherever, and she is in the slightest way attractive for me, I have those weird thoughts, where I think of being in a relationship with her and stuff. I also search in Instagram and other social medias for girls I think are in the slightest way attractive and I think of them as they being my dream girl. It goes that far, it kind of feels like I would take anyone as a girlfriend, just to feel the same things again. And I hate being fixed on this girlfriend/love thoughts all the time. Its like I can only think of this one thing and it fucks me up. I hate it. I just want to live a life without thinking of this shit all the time. Before I had my first kiss, I didn't have any of this. I had a fullfilled life of just me, my friends, school and family. My mindset was: When theres a girl, who DMs me and stuff, so be it. I wouldn't take any actions by myself to find a girl to talk to. It was so much easier. Now I feel like I'm a guy, who NEEDS this kind of stuff, but I don't want to need it. Especially I need to fix myself and concentrate on me, because I still have a very low self esteem, but I feel like I can't fix this, when I'm ALWAYS thinking of being in a relationship. Maybe you say its because of puperty and hormones or some shit, but im 17, nearly 18. I feel like, I'm writing things a 12 year old feels/experiences.

So I need advice. How can I stop letting my thoughts of being with a girl, have control over my entire life? It really sucks and bothers me a lot. I Just want to get rid of them.
