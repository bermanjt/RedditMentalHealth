1,"So I’m 14 and I like a girl who’s 17. We kissed a few times.. but we were kind of drunk. So she might be into me, might not. We’re about the same height and I’m really into her. What should I do? (Plz don’t give me shit for this, I’m just looking for some advice)",25Sep2020,1
2,"TL;DR - I wish that people who liked me would show it consistently across the board, and I wish those that didn't wouldn't show any interest in me beyond necessary interactions. The inconsistent ways in which some people behave (such as mixing these two sets of behavior in any significant way) makes me uneasy and honestly makes it that much harder for me to trust that people actually like me.  


Okay, so over time I've seen that overall, I seem to be pretty well liked by most people. However, there are a couple of particular things that, while they may seem insignificant to others, cause a lot of cognitive dissonance and unease within me that has led to an ever-increasing series of trust issues.  


This is gonna sound kinda stupid to some (if not most) people, but here's the main source of a lot of this unease: As I mentioned before, with most people, at least in person, I seem to get along with them fairly well. However, in a noticeable number of cases, when I send them a request on social media, they end up rejecting it. This includes people that I've worked with for extended periods and even confided in about personal stuff, and while they seem to be glad to see me in person and we get along well, there's a reason behind why those people rejected those friend requests, and I can't help but think that it's because they secretly dislike or don't respect me but don't want to show it in their interactions with me.  


Now here's the thing: I fully understand and accept that not everyone is going to like me. Plus, I expect friend requests to be rejected by certain people (like those that I maybe didn't get along with the best but still thought it'd be worth a shot to send them one). However, when people seem to like me and then I end up getting rejected on social media by those same people, that's a HUGE behavior discrepancy on their part in my view, and it drives me nuts.   


Before anyone suggests I get off social media, I don't think that would help. It's not the rejected friend requests in and of themselves...it's more about the phenomenon they illustrate: people liking or seeming to like you in one scenario and flat out rejecting you in another. It just makes absolutely no sense and it honestly comes across as very two-faced and inconsistent. As much as I don't like being given the cold shoulder by anyone, I almost wish that people who didn't like me would just act like it all the time and not show any interest beyond necessary interactions. At least then I could know for sure who likes me and who doesn't.   


Again, I know this sounds like a lot to make of rejected friend requests, but again, the inconsistent and seemingly contradictory behavior here is extremely troubling to me, and I have a hard time really trusting that people like me because of it.",25Sep2020,1
3,"Me and my girlfriend broke up a few days back. I went from having someone to talk to all the time to having nobody to talk to. 

I don’t love having a whole bunch of people to talk to other than whoever I’m dating. It’s a lot of energy for me and I don’t ever meet anyone I especially like.

I want to have friends but frankly it’s difficult finding one person I like to date, let alone several other people that I also like. That’s like, almost not possible. How do other people do it?

How do they have like “squads” or whatever? I’ve gone through the last new months texting or voice chatting almost no one unless I was dating them. I worked at a huge company full of people before all this and I didn’t particularly like anyone that much. 

It’s also not like I’m meeting anyone during the pandemic. Even if I was, I’ve never understood like, friendship. You just exchange numbers and hang out or whatever? Nobody ever asks me, I never ask, we usually become like, work or school acquaintances, then we only talk there, which actually worked out very nicely for me because I got social time whether I liked it or not.

I wake up most days not wanting to talk to anyone, and I mean like, using my voice, texting is always easy, but like I’d say 6.5 out of 7 days I don’t wanna talk to anyone whether that be voice chat or in person. I play Destiny 2 where there are activities where you have to have 6 people all on a voice chat, and most days I can’t do them because I just can’t bring myself to get on voice chat with other humans.

Idk. I feel really shitty tonight. I’m sure I’ll be fine in the morning, but I probably won’t really talk to anyone tomorrow. I don’t think I’m gonna date anyone for a long time either. I don’t have any friends right now that like, I talk to a lot. Most of my friends (like maybe 3 people total) I text maybe once a week, see them maybe once every few months. I find myself wanting something else but never able to find it.
I look and I look. I meet guys, none of them I wanna be friends with. I meet girls, I usually get rejected or we date and it’s meh or we just don’t end up friends at all. Let me tell you, it is a less than once a year occurrence that a girl I like a lot likes me back.

It was like this before anyone even knew about coronavirus tbh. I was in college and it was not this amazing time where I’m meeting all sorts of people like everyone says. They were cool when we were in class and that was kinda it. I was told once that it was because I was at junior college and not my four year yet, but that doesn’t sit right with me. How are people just suddenly going to 180 at a 4 year? In their junior year (I transfer as a junior), when they’re busy getting a degree? If anything wouldn’t it get worse???

I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I have a hard time empathizing or seeing things through their point of view. Usually their points of view just don’t make any sense to me. I don’t think I’m a psychopath because I hate seeing people and ESPECIALLY animals hurt. I also have loved people in the past and I do love my family.

Even sex is hard, on the rare occasions that the opportunity arises. I never feel comfortable with anyone or safe. I am an extraordinarily horny person also, so it’s not like I don’t want sex, but when it comes down to it I’m just so nervous and worried I don’t like it at all. I’ve tried it three times now and it actually felt worse every time, especially after. It was like, day ruining. Like glassed over eyes and “what have I done?”

The furthest I can go without feeling shitty is making out, and even that can be hit or miss. Even I don’t get it. I’ll push myself to do more, cuz either I’m horny or wanting to prove to myself I can do it, but I always regret it or feel like I made the other person uncomfortable, even if the other person assured me they wanted it.

I try really hard to be normal for people, so they accept me. I fool them for long enough sometimes but I run out of energy and regress every time. I put the truth over accord so arguments break out and I don’t just let them go or concede to the other person I just dig in and then they don’t wanna talk to me. I project that on them sometimes but maybe I just haven’t found the right person? I don’t know, maybe there is no right person for me, maybe I’m just TOO difficult you know? I don’t know.",25Sep2020,1

10,"
My bf of nearly 2 years has been really affected by the quarantine, mentally. His father is absolutely crazy when it comes to leaving the house; he hasn’t left the house for over 6 months, not even to get groceries or any of that. Obviously it has taken a toll on him and he’s become a lot more distant than he used to, even though he insists he’s doing fine. He keeps himself occupied with uni work and working out but the repetitiveness of each passing day has caused him to become sort of numb. I’ve always told him to talk to me if there’s anything that’s bothering him, and I’ve provided support, but he insists that he’s fine and that there’s nothing that he can do about it.

This has been bothering me since the start of quarantine. We’ve spoken multiple times about it; and each and every time I’ve asked him to try to be a little more engaging, to try to introduce some more variability to the day so that we both don’t go crazy. He would do it for a few days but then eventually relapse into his little shell.

The past week I’ve been remembering how he used to be at the start of our relationship. How enthusiastic and affectionate he used to be. How excited he used to be towards everything. How he used to actually talk to me if we had a problem (nowadays whenever I confront him he just always apologizes). So I sort of pulled away and was distant and didn’t really talk to him much this week.

We had a talk about it last night and I broke down crying, telling him that’s he wasn’t the same boy that I was falling for. Telling him that he was too numb and that I wanted him to be more affectionate and open with me. I kept going on and on. He was quiet for a while then broke down crying for the first time in MONTHS. I felt my heart shatter into a million pieces and immediately felt terrible for pushing him to this extent. He said that it wasn’t my fault and that I was simply telling him my feelings about the situation, but still. I don’t know. I just feel awful. This morning he was a lot more active and affectionate. I apologized to him a dozen times but he keeps telling me that he’s the one at fault and not me.

14,"Years ago I had some rather life changing situations and gossip hit the internet about me. My trust was betrayed and it damaged mentally. Now I have this fear that I’m being recorded and I won’t go anywhere or do anything. The interactions I do have are usually reviewed after the fact and I sink into a depression wondering if I said the right things if I was being recorded and how much real and exaggerated info I mixed in. I’ve been trying to reach out to people but I feel like everything’s being recorded now so if I say anything I should plan on it being broadcasted to the world. This just gets worse because I’m a people magnet and people love talking with me. 

My friends have installed security cameras and I have security cameras as well but now all I think about is I wonder if they are turned on and recording and what to say. I keep falling into forgetting they are there and talking normally and remembering they are there and sounding fake or vague. Of course I’m the only one who sees this but I can’t be certain if they are on or if I’m being recorded so it’s causing me to just avoid all people. I wonder how people can even cope with this and how to proceed without asking every time if I’m being recorded. I don’t think this is paranoia because there is a reason why the fear exists.

17,"Hello, this is my first time posting in here.

I currently work in retail and have applied for another position within the company. It’s a smaller department with only one opening. We were told to register our interest by August 7th, which I did. I was told I’d be interviewed “soon”. A date was then set for 2nd of September. On that day (literally 30 minutes after my interview was meant to happen) my manager (who was organising and doing the interviews, alone) told me that she has to postpone it. Fine, whatever, it’s retail people get busy. My interview ended up being postponed another 2 times before I finally had it more than a week later. 

After I had my interview on the 10th of September I was told I’d hear back “at the start of next week”. The next week came and went with no mention whatsoever. On Monday 21st I asked if there was any update, to which I was told my manager would “try” and tell everyone who applied by the end of the week. Yesterday, Thursday 24th, I was told someone else has registered their interest and would now be interviewed, 7 weeks after the “final” date for registering interest. 

One of the people already in the department with the vacancy is working part time there and I know they had offered them the position before opening it up to everyone internally. My concern is that they’ve been stringing me and the other applicants along while trying to convince this person to go for it, and now they have so they’ll do an interview to tick that box and then give them the job. 

What I want to know is if there is anything I can do about this? Who would I report this sort of thing to? Is this behaviour even worth being reported or is this sort of terrible management just accepted? The general manager for the store is the kind of person who would listen to me, say how bad it is and do nothing about it. If my manager had come back to me and said “no sorry we don’t think you’re right for this” that would have been one thing, but the underhanded way of going about things is what annoys me.

19,"Getting up in the morning is hard for me. I wake up and my first thoughts are wanting to cry, give up, and die. Lately I feel worn out. Like all my life has been sucked out of me. And my interests and goals I don’t even bother with.
I’ve went through this before. But this time it was more unexpected and hit me harder. 
She’s only worried about my grades and my attendance rather than my mental health. 
I don’t think she understands that just going to school is taking a toll on me. I still go to school. But lately I’ve been staying off once or twice because I really need the break. 
It’s hard to go to school running on low fuel. Every morning I wake up and cry. Not because of school. But because of just getting up and having to go on with life makes me cry. 
Staying off helps me. Because I guess I can reflect on my emotions rather than ignoring them and being stuck in a class all day and not being able to cope at all..
She seems only worried about my grades and what I’m missing out on.
Everyday she gets frustrated with me saying how much I’m missing. and that I won’t be prepared for highschool. and that my grades will get bad.
as if I didn’t know these things. I mean I hope none of that happens. but she says these things in the midst of the fact I’m extremely depressed. and that’s adding even more stuff for me to worry about. if anything she thinks she’s motivating me by telling me this. but she’s not, it’s just adding more worry onto me. grades and schooling is stressing. and having me worry about it is not going to make my depression any better. 
I just feel like a failure. I mean it’s not my fault that I’m going through a hard time. I know my emotions don’t make up for who I am. but it still hurts knowing that I am disappointing my mom. and I feel like a failure for stepping back, and focusing on myself rather then school. 
I know school is important. And how I’ll need it. 
but I still can’t shake the feeling of being a failure. I feel horrible, for many reasons such as.....not going to school, not wanting to get up, not reaching my goals, missing out on life, missing school, my grades lowering, losing my friends because I lost motivation to even keep our friendships going.

25,"First of all, sorry for my English, it is not my mother tongue.  

It is a long story because the situation is quite difficult. I will leave a summary at the end of this post.

For several years, my mum has been with depression and has been going to a psychiatrist that works in the public health system in Spain. The only thing that the doctor does is give her pills and make an appointment per month.

The only brother my mum has died in December and my mum has not been okay since then even though they did not have a good sibling relation. Furthermore, my dad decides to leave one month ago because he is really tired of taking care of a person with depression for that long (approx 5 years).

He left in mid August and my mum could not understand why he had left so she insisted on my fahter coming back and he did. It was inevitable that he would leave again. The 12th September he prepares everything while my mum is in the cemetery for a special holiday in Spain. When she is back he tells her he is leaving again.

My mum that afternoon is alone at home and decides to kill herself.

I wasn’t at home because I am a student and started to live where my uni is. The moment I know what my mum did on Saturday I go home to help her because my dad has not returned and my sister (17 yo) is all alone with my mum.  

I have been one week and a half at home with my mum and I can’t help her on my own. I am only 22 yo taking care of a person with suicidal intentions. I really don’t know what to do.

My dad is trying to help by looking for some info about this and looking for a place or a person that could help my mum to be happy again, but nothing seems to actually work (I know this a really slow proccess). We decided to tell my mum that maybe she needs an intensive treatment with profesional attention 24/7 but she doesn’t want to go anywhere. Since we proposed her this idea she has been trying really hard to be okay but in the moment I told her that I need to go to start my studies she gets sad and depressive again. She has been with anxierty since then.

She is really afraid to be alone. My dad doesn’t want to come back because he is not happy either (even though he sais that he would come back home if it is neccesary for my mum’s sake), I need to go and start my studies and my sister is in her last year before uni and needs to get good marks so she can’t give my mum the attention she needs.

She doesn’t stop saying that she doesn’t want to live anymore and she can’t stand living in a world where everyone abandon her after being such a good person. I have to listen to this words every single day since I spend the whole day with her and I am afraid that she tries to do it again. I have tried to speak to her psychiatrist (she hasn’t helped me), I tried to speak to her psychologist (she hasn’t helped me), I tried calling to “número de la esperanza” (“Hope Number” in English) and no answer.

**Summary:**

My mum has been with depression for several years and this years has happened a lot to her that have lead her to take the decision of killing herself: the death of her brother and my father leaving my house. Now it is just my mum and my sister (17 yo) at home because I am studyig in another city.

I came back to take care of my mum and it has already been two weeks since my mum tried take her own life. My mum still thinks that she does not want to like so I decided to talk to her  psychiatrist, her psychologist and a Hope Number but got no answer. I told her that maybe she needs medical attention 24/7 but doesn’t want to.

This’ll sound a bit disgusting but there was a time when I wasn’t well, I hadn’t showered for a whole day and a half, I woke up all sweaty and gross (I’m a person that has to shower every single day so it was unusual for me) I also hadn’t applied my deodorant and antiperspirant for the same time period (I apply these both 2x a day - morning and night). I went and asked a trusted family member and they told me, I did smell a little (not surprising). They’d also gladly tell me my breath smelled of garlic after having a meal with it in it too. And also they’re the type of people that if they smelled a fart or anything like that, they’d let it be known, so any kind of smell gets announced. 

I would only smell the smells at certain times though. I’d smell them, and then all of a sudden all I’d be able to smell is my deodorant/antiperspirant or the perfume I’d been wearing, not BO. That’s what I found strange - the smell of BO wouldn’t  just go away and be replaced by the smell of deodorant right? And even then the BO smell would mix with the deodorant and would still smell bad - but all I smelled was my deodorant.  Also, when I apply perfume, everyone tells me it smells great,  but it doesn’t to me. They all ask where I got it and ask to put some on. But when I smell the same perfume, it smells like shit. Honestly it does. I was like “this perfume absolutely stinks, it smells so bad” and my friend asked me if there was something wrong with my nose because it apparently smelled awesome. 

Now that I’ve been told others don’t notice the smell, I haven’t smelt it since. There was a really hot day, I’d been out in the heat and I was sweating a lot, no one around me smelled anything, and neither did I.

Anyone else ever have this? The people I asked definitely weren’t lying as they said they would t let me go around if I stank without telling me to help me out. And also no one has ever said anything to me about it either - and I know some pretty cruel assholes that wouldn’t think twice to bring me down. I just don’t understand it",25Sep2020,1

31,"I (20F) guess I’ll just start with the fact that I have depression and anxiety. I’ve dealt with these two problems for as long as I can remember and it’s definitely had a negative impact. It doesn’t help that the job I have now makes me want to blow my brains out. The job itself isn’t really within my interest, it’s very demanding and reliant on other people’s ability to manage their time and complete their tasks. It pays just enough and I can’t afford to find something else (I live in a small town) with the experience I have. 

My inability to cope with this job has led my mental health to absolutely plummet. I feel miserable and everyone around me feels miserable too. My boyfriend has began to distance himself from me because I seem uninterested, quickly angered, or withdrawn. My mother and siblings have made many comments on how easily I am angered by something small. Even my boss expressed that my coworkers don’t really want to interact with me because I seem to have an attitude. 

I don’t know...I just feel like a god awful person. My biggest issues lie within my relationship though. My boyfriend says I don’t listen and I’m too withdrawn and I am angered too quickly when he expresses a worry or an insecurity he has. He says I have double standards and I don’t listen to him fully. I believe these things are true. I do go on angry rants and it’s something I am aware of and I hate that I do it. I try to work on these things but it’s like it never gets better.

I always ruin things with the way I react. I only commit errors and bring everyone down and confuse people. I’m in a rut and I can’t get out because I don’t know how. I’m trying to do good things. I’m trying to improve and I’m trying to make the people in my life happy. I don’t want everyone to leave me but I don’t know how to make them stay.

We work in different departments, we say hi to each other and that’s it, I kinda caught him looking at me couple of times, but idk, maybe he was at awe how ugly i am lol. I only know his name bc i’m resourceful, i’m pretty sure he doesn’t know mine. But IDK, I’m attracted to him anyway.

I wanted this to be like previously, without changing anything, both of us using the computers when we'd like randomly. So basically sharing it. But that didnt happen. I dont know why my dad buying a new computer change anything. But for some reason, my twin is occupying one of the computer for herself. One computer is a bit old, and the other is newer.

Also, she is a phone person, and Im a computer person. It isnt logical for me to 'own' the old computer if we are playing that owning game.

She shouldnt be selfish. I want us to use both computers without tension, without one of us owning it.  Like, she shouldnt act like she owns one of the computers. Nor should I. We should just share.

40,"Earlier this year in April I (19F) have made an impulsive decision to go to uni in the UK. I've made that decision in a split second based on two things:

1. I had a crush on a guy I met there in winter, we hang out for a week
2. I found out that a girl I don't like got accepted to a uni in UK and I was jealous

Other than that, I was in deep quarantine depression and at the time wanted to get away. Since then a lot on my life has changed. During the summertime I was involved in a lot of activism and such which was very fulfilling and I was no longer depressed. Other than that, I have met my bf that I love very much. When we were getting closer I started dreading the results, and which each Uni I picked offering me a place, I wanted to go less and less. Here we are, three months later and I have an important decision to make.  I need to choose between going to uni there or staying for uni here, in my home country (it's also a good uni but definitely not that good).

On one hand, I have this really good uni I got into, on the other I have my whole life here, a boyfriend I love, my friends and family and uni here is free, not like in the UK (so I would have to get a student fee loan which is 9250 pounds every year). I would have to start my whole life over which I don't really want to do. 

One side of my brain is telling me to go because it's a good uni and it's a good opportunity. But the other side doesn't want to go at all and I regret making the decision to even try getting there in the first place.

important details:

1. the course I got accepted into in the UK is English, here I would master in cultural studied
2. I have borderline personality disorder which makes me prone to making impulsive decisions (like waning to go to uni in UK)",25Sep2020,1

42,"Hi there,

I am getting separated from my ex, but we still have a joint chequing account together to pay for the mortgage, car payments, insurance, etc.

My ex continues to tell me we NEED to keep a single joint account until the house is sold because it's easier, and doesn't want to hear anything about splitting the account.

This is unfair because:

1. She is spending money without asking. She is going to the restauraunt, buying new clothes, visiting friends and buying them dinner, last night she just bought a new phone. In the last month she's easily wasted over 1000$.
2. I am making more money than her, so she's just profiting off me until we split the account.
3. At any point, she could easily go buy herself some new furniture for her new appartment, take it from our account and I wouldn't have anything to say. I am left vulnerable with the joint account.
4. She wants me out of the house on weekends, and this weekend, her plan is to go shopping for furniture for her new appartment.

So, I want to split this account ASAP. But because she doesn't want, I either have to continue trying to convince her, or just take my share out, and deal with her backlash. I've been trying to have a sensible conversation about how to split the account and it always ends up either in a fight, or ""it not being the right time"".

My problem is what is MY share? Do I take into account that I am making over a 600$ more per paycheck? Do I take into account all the stuff she is spending that I do not agree with?

I did the calculation quickly, and if I take both things into account, she is going to end up with much less money than me; less than 250$ total.

Another big problem is that we have about 15 automatic debits coming from the joint account, for house-related things; so we need to keep a certain amount in the joint account to pay for this.. and if I just take out my share, she could stop paying her share of the house and utilities.

This is such a delicate situation. I don't want to anger her, but this is UNFAIR, and I am left vulnerable.

Side note: I am being so nice in this separation. I am doing everything she wants, I am leaving the house when it's not ""my week"", but she's there 100% of the time, she's making me sleep in a single mattress because ""she wont sleep well"". I am basically taking all the punches these days just so that we can be on good terms and this separation can go well. I am getting really tired of being the nice guy, I want what is fair.

43,"Hello Reddit!

I currently have two dogs: Skyla a five year old German Shepherd who we got from a breeder, and Taryn a 3/4 year old Carpadian shepherd mixed with what we assume is pitbull or mastiff, who we rescued. (Info for pronunciation Tara + Eryn = Taryn) 

My main problem is Taryn's aggresion towards people outside our house, we live on a British council estate, and there's a foot path about 4 meters from our front door which isn't fenced off, (for those who are wondering the dogs do their business in the back garden (yard). 

Now Taryn has always been a nuciance for barking unprovoked at the slightest noises (like a car door) but in the past 2 months or so, she's been through a period and also a phantom pregnancy which isn't uncommon for her but she was too close to biting us in the house (which she's never done, outside of play fighting). now last night and today when there's been people at the door she's been insanely aggressive, almost ripping the blinds down, this has now cautioned my mum into the possibility of getting rid of her, which I'm terrified of because despite everything I've just mentioned she is an absolute sweetheart and love cuddles and scratches as much as any other dog, and me, my mum and my sister all love that side of her.

And my mums grounds for getting rid of her are justified, she's worried that she might escape and hurt someone.

So please Reddit, if you can give me any advice to help me calm her down in those moments please tell me what I/we can do

49,"So about a year ago, my aunt (74) passed away from a heart attack caused by what I think was kidney failure (I think it was a condition called hemolytic ureamic syndrome) and I cannot help but feel like I was responsible. I'll try my best to explain what happened. 

Now, owing to where we were living, my aunt would openly express some political views that if heard in public could get us attacked, or even killed. So when we were visiting her for two weeks, I was always scared that someone would hear her, especially since the windows were open to allow fresh air in I was scared that the neighbors might hear her. Plus her health was deteriorating and at one point it became quite bad that she was almost bedridden and was in pain. And one more thing (which I'm really ashamed of myself for) is that I thought that my aunt had found out that I masturbate and would tell my parents, who are super religious.

 At this point I started having intrusive thoughts that it would be a good thing if she passed away as it would end her suffering and we would no longer be at risk of getting attacked and my parents wouldnt know that I masturbate. I was scared of having these thoughts so I decided to not interfere in anything to do with her, for example if she told me to wash her bottle, I would ask my brother to wash it, in case if while washing it the rim of it touches the sink and picks up some bacteria, possibly giving her an infection etc

So one day her condition suddenly deteriorated and I decided to 100% sideline myself and not say/do anything unless I am absolutely sure that it would be in her benefit. This was because my dad is a medical professional (who works in another country (I live with him) but we were visiting our home country at the time) so he obviously knows more than me. Secondly my brother was also there so if my dad needs any physical assistance in lifting my aunt or something, my brother can help him. Now, a few things happened where I think I could have made a difference but I didn't do so intentionally. 

1) I felt that my dad was taking too long to take her to the car, so I thought I should tell him ""hurry up"", but I intentionally didn't. At the start I told myself that it wouldn't have made a difference as why would he be slow intentionally, but now I realize that If I had, he would have ""gone to the next step"" (we were discussing on how to take her, if I told him to hurry up, we would have decided then and there and started taking her to the car) 

2) I should have told him that ""her blood pressure is going low, we should rush her immediately to the hospital"" (which is what I thought was happening) but instead I said ""her blood pressure is going low"" and then let him decide what to do with this info (I think this was because I didn't want her to reach the hospital quickly so she would die. I hate myself for this) 

3) (this is the worst) I knew that my dad thought that the ambulance system is bad in our area (we are in a third world country) but I thought that they were better than what he thought. So while discussing about whether to go by ambulance or by car, I did not tell him that the ambulance services are better than what he thinks intentionally, so that its less likely he decides to go with an ambulance (which I thought is the better option). Then he said that ""what even is the ambulance number here"". I knew the ambulance number so knew that I could make a positive difference here, so I told it to him instantly. But then he said ""this is the public ambulance number, they'll take ages to come, we need a private ambulance number"". But if I had told them that the ambulances are good, and then told him why (my uncle said he had used them once, they were OK) he could have called my uncle up and 

A)  if public ambulances are good (which is what my uncle may have used) he would have told that to my dad, convincing him to use the public one

B)  if private ambulances are good, then he could have given my dad the private ambulance number, which he may have since he lives in the area. 

Now I don't think private ambulance services are good, as we took one to take my aunt from the hospital to the graveyard later, it took half an hour to come and had no paramedics or anything, was just a plain van. But private ambulances run by big hospitals might be better (I don't know) and as for public ambulances, I think the average response time is 20-25 minutes, whereas I think it took as half an hour (at max) to reach the ICU, of which 15 minutes was actually spent in the hospital trying to get her to the ICU. 

Finally the reason I think that all these small things could have made a difference is that when she was in the ICU and was brain dead, her arms and legs would shake and eyes open every few seconds (when I think the ventilator inhaled or exhaled) so, I'm not a medical professional or anything, but doesn't this mean that nerves are still alive in her body to cause all her arms and legs to move at the same time, so that means she had become brain dead just before reaching the ICU? 

Finally I'd like to know 2 things:

1) Am I responsible for what happened? 

2) If I am, how can I live with myself after doing something like this? Am I a murderer? What should I do know? 

Also, I have spoken to my parents about this, (not about the last part with the thing that she became brain dead just before reaching the ICU) and they are saying that I'm not responsible, but I can't help but feel that I could've made a difference",25Sep2020,1

54,"Tl;dr- Toxic friend acted over-friendly with my bf. Stayed over at his place and misbehaved, making him uncomfortable. Didn't even call or text me to tell say that she was staying over/stayed over. I cut her off but she wasn't even bothered to know why I did that. But I am still unable to let go.

I have this absolutely toxic friend who has repeatedly hurt me over and over, but I still made excuses for her shitty behaviour because she was a cancer survivor and I am too empathetic. But I very recently reached my boiling point with her.

I did a mistake of confiding in her and telling her that me and my 4 year old bf are planning on getting married (we're in our early 20s so it's still early for us). We are in a long distance relationship and we only get to see each other 3-4 times in an year. Anyway, she acted real supportive back then.

My ""friend"" is a journalist and she had to go to my bf's city to cover a story. He agreed to help her because he knew I really cared about her. She met him there and tried to act over-friendly by trying to give him a marriage scare, saying shit like ""you must be crazy to get married so early"". He usually keeps to himself so he didn't entertain her. But he told me and it made me furious, I still made excuses for her behaviour saying ""Oh she was probably just joking around. Don't worry.""

They met again the following day. She was out to late getting footage, so, she asked my bf if she could stay over for the night because it wasn't safe outside. He didn't tell me she was staying over because he was afraid it will affect our friendship (he told me the next day after she left). He lives in a small one room apartment and has only one bed so he was super uncomfortable. He invited another friend to feel less weirded out. I don't know what did she think but she too invited a male colleague to stay over at his place, when she could've easily gone over to his??? Anyway, after my bf and his friend pretended to sleep, she started making out with her colleague and making soft moans. I couldn't even believe that she's that gross. IT'S A SMALL ROOM! EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU! She didn't leave until evening the next day, not until my bf said that he had to go out and needed to lock his room. 

Ofc when he told me about everything I spiralled and every past incident kicked me in the guts. I had a mental breakdown. My bf thought I was overreacting but after hearing everything else he was pissed too. And felt bad about letting her stay over. I still decided to give her the hundredth second chance, waiting for her to call me and at least tell me that she stayed over at my bf's place. She never called, or texted. I blocked her from everywhere and she was just ""okay"" with it as if I never mattered to her.

It has been 7 months since this happened. Everytime I hear her name or see her face, my heart sinks. She has still not approached me, not even to ask why I cut her off. I tried to hate her but I couldn't. I feel stupid and used. I need a closure but I don't know how. I gave this person more love than she deserved and it feels like all this time she was faking her love towards me. I can't believe I've given her so much power over me.

This started about a year ago when my uncles dad was stuck in another city because of a buisness thing but when corona hit he is stuck there. My uncle has been hitting and abusing my aunt and we have evidence and puctures that prove that . But i think he has been manipulating my cousins because my other aunt was concerened so she contacted her cousin who contacted the police then the police came into thier house and confronted my aunt and told her you can choose go with us or stay my aunt wouldve go with the police but my cousins where manipulated and started blackmailing my aunt on to satuing and saying”if you go with the police ill kill my self” and that. Then she didnt go with them. There are still many videos caught on camera and i dont know how many bruises there are im scared because maybe my pther aunt and aunt that has been abused wilk die becuase my uncle has many connections what should i do?,25Sep2020,1
59,"Hello [25M], during this quarantine, I’ve been able to enjoy some things I couldn’t because of lack of time.  I currently work from home and found myself wanting to start a hobby or a small business where I could get a few bucks on the side.  I thought I could get into the T-Shirt business, at first it was going okay, but the amount of work goong into it stressed me out more than it should.  (Oh boy, did I make a mistake).

Recently, while talking to my wife about old dreams and passtimes, photography came up.  Man, did my face shine the whole room up.  During my high school years, I used a dslr I got off a trade to pretty much take pictures of everything and videos of our longboarding crew.  I enjoyed the gist of it so much, I considered Film and Photography school.  Parents obviously discouraged that goal. 

So here I am, considering selling all my T-Shirt Business stuff and considering finally delving into Photography while taking a few courses online.  Should I take the leap?",25Sep2020,1

im a a tall and pretty attractive guy to what most woman see, so its a huge surprise and apparently a huge let down when they find out I still have my V card...

I have tried for years at all the tricks of optimizing my study time, learning how to concentrate, engaging forms of studying, breathing techniques for anxiety, and it's clearly not working for me.

64,"So our college closed suddenly due to emergency lockdown in our country, and we were forced to evacuate within a day in March. That time we were expecting it to last maximum 2 weeks, so I only took bare essentials and didn't have time to do my laundry or take it with me since I live 1200 km from my college and flights have baggage weight restrictions and I had to take my books with me. Now we're to return after 6 months and I'm absolutely terrified of opening my dirty laundry, God knows what all is growing in it, and I need tips to make it clean and hygienic and wearable again.

If it's any help, all the clothes are cotton, with a few cotton-lycra mix leggings. My college is in a hot dry area where temperatures reach 49°C (120°F) in the summers, so the clothes have weathered dry heat, and now it's monsoon, so now it's humid and temperature around 36°C (97°F).

Currently I'm thinking of letting the clothes airdry in the balcony for a day to get the smell out somewhat, then soak them in hot water with detergent and Dettol for an hour or so and then wash them.

I've been having a certain mental struggle for a long time now. I'm old enough now to start getting into serious relationships, so this problem has begun to affect others and not just me. I'm scared to seek actual psychological help because I'm worried I'll be called crazy or something and I really don't need that right now. 

It would be wrong to say there is a 'voice' in my head, but for all intents and purposes, that's what I'll call it. It demands that things 'go to plan'. For example, if I want something to happen, and it doesn't happen the way I want it to, it feels like there's a screaming voice in my head that's angry and confused that it didn't. It's narcissistic and its so, so loud. It screams things like 'How dare they' and it sometimes even bullies me if I'm the reason something didn't go to plan. 

It makes me seem like a horrible narcissistic and childish person and I hate it. I actually broke down crying last night because it was so loud and harassing. Last night, my girlfriend went out with some friends, she told me she wouldn't drink, but ended up doing so due to peer pressure. Now, this girl is lovely and she would never intentionally hurt me. But the voice was so angry that she was spending time with anyone but me, and that she was drinking when she said she wouldn't. It tells me to make her feel guilty and ashamed but I don't ever want to do that because she's someone I truly love. 

It's getting to the point where it's hard to tell if the voice actually exists or it's just me and I've created this personality in order to exempt myself from responsibility. Regardless, I don't know what to do. I don't want to be like this and I don't know how to stop it.

69,"This has probably been posted a million times, but my situation is kinda different. My friend (22F) texted me this morning that she has a crush on me (20M). What makes this different than every other reddit post about this topic? Two factors:

1. She has been in an open-relationship for a very long time. Their rules stated she could have sex with other people, but dating is off the table. I had sex with her once, but that is a year ago and I deem it not relevant for the current situation. I do not want to be part of another relationship. I know her situation concerning this has changed somewhat, so I'm a bit unaware what that relation entails these days.

2. She set me up with one of her best friends a week ago. I have gone on two dates with this girl and that has been a lot of fun. It is still too fresh to say anything substantial about it, but it does play a role I think. My friend setting me up is in hindsight probably a form of emotional self abuse. 

I would be lying if I said I was not confused right now. My friend and I are very close, and we have always been very flirty. But I have never loved her in this way. If she hadn't been in a relationship and I wasn't dating I would totally go for it, but that is not the reality we live in. Clearly, I don't want to lose my friend. Lastly, as hinted above she does have some mental health issues. Therefore, it is really important for me to approach this correctyl and carefully.

I am unsure how to proceed and could use any advice I can get. Thank you for reading and I hope anyone can give me some advice on what to do.

Sorry if the formatting is weird. On mobile.

Anyway, I have this friend, let's call her Willow. She and I have the same ASL teacher (since there's only one in our school) let's call her Ms. Brown. I'm in Year 3 of ASL while my friend is in Year 2. 

My friend really hates Ms Brown. In her first year, Willow was accused of cheating on a rather simple test (out of 30 points total) and she was not given the points of taking that test. This caused Willow to only get a B that term.

Ms Brown does not tolerate cheating whatsoever. I understand and respect that, but my friend was not cheating. Willow is not the kind of person to cheat. Ms Brown also treated her rather harshly, which I cannot condone. Willow started crying that day before we got on the bus and I held her hand. I had never seen her cry before, so this was a big shock.

Ever since, Willow has really hated Ms Brown. Ms Brown is harsh on the first years so they know that taking a language class is hard anyway. Then she lightens up on the year 2 and 3 classes because they know what to expect.

Willow is only taking this class for college credit and she does love the language. The problem is that she constantly complains about Ms Brown. Complains about her grading system, her personality, her ""punchable face.""

It's really hard to listen to because I really like Ms Brown. 

She was always nice to me and knew that I didn't cheat when I told her I wasn't. When I was a disruptive butt with her teacher aide (her out of the room) and I was called down to talk to her, she understood that I'm not a person who likes being told what to do. She gave me a warning but didn't treat me any differently.

Maybe I was too dumb to realize she was treating my class unfairly in my Year 1, but I always liked her class. 

I don't really know how to defend Ms Brown because I can't dispute that Willow had these experiences. Yesterday, Willow told me it was fine I liked Ms Brown and her class, but Willow did so in such a way like she was forcing herself to say that to me and didn't totally mean it.

Her and I are close friends, and we tell each other almost everything. I just wish that she wouldn't complain about Ms Brown when I'm around.

86,"My friend is... in a bad spot. Last year, he and his wife had a child who they didn't think was going to live, and since then they've basically been having to constantly go to to specialists and have several surgeries (it's literally an unprecedented case, so there's no prognosis how long he'll live, what quality of life he'll have, or if he could even wind up fine in a few years).

Fortunately, my work has been extremely gracious with him; they basically let him work two days a week, he can take off whatever time he wants, and to my knowledge, merely asked that if he feels he can't handle any of his work, that he delegate it to others.

Well our department is four people total (including both he and I), so not exactly a large group.

Well, for *some* reason, he just doesn't seem to like one member of the team, who is our primary coder. I get along with him, he's a generally quiet but friendly guy, but my friend is kind of a ""Type-A personality"", and I think harbors some resentment that our coder is actually better as coding than my friend is.

Alright, so here's ""the situation"".

We share a single office room. There are two desks that sit right next to the windows (and offer a beautiful view), and the others are just next to the wall, with windows that look out into the hallway and other offices.

When we first got out office, we all wanted ""the window desks"", so it was decided that it should simply come down to seniority; my friend and our coder had been there longer than myself or the other person who worked here at the time (has since left).

Well when the covid stuff began happening, our coder requested to work from home, and was granted it. Because of that, my friend seemingly decided ""well if he's not going to come into the office, then I'm giving his desk to somebody else"".

My friend offered the desk to me, but I was pretty frank and said ""look; that's fucked up. If *you* were the one working from home, you would be *pissed* if somebody stole your desk without even talking to you about it"". I didn't even bring up the fact that my friend is working from home most of the time *anyways*, for the safety of his *own* family.

I told him ""since we're supposed to maintain the 6 ft distance thing, why don't you just temporarily let the new guy use his desk"".

Well, he did just that, so the new guy moved to ""the window desk"". We all just got back in-office yesterday, and the new guy was already talking about when the coder ""uses his new desk"". My friend didn't correct him.

The thing is, I know our coder already is frustrated with the job, and particularly how my friend ""manages"" our department. He's already said to me that he's willing to quit if my friend starts expected to be treated like our *boss*.

This is such a stupid issue to pick a fight over, but I worry that exactly what my friend is *trying* to do; pick a fight. Stealing somebody's desk -- without telling them, while they're working from home -- can really ONLY been seen as a giant ""*fuck you*"".

And if our coder quits over this petty bullshit, it has the potential to actually *cripple* our department. My friend and our coder are the only people who actually *really* know how to code, and my friend already complains he has ""too much to do"", and I know for a fact our coder handles a ton of work.

TL;DR

My friend (who became supervisor last year) basically gave my coworker's desk away to someone else, for largely petty reasons, and I think it could be enough to push said coworker into quitting, which could put our entire department in jeopardy. But when I brought all this up, he got pissy with me and did it anyway.

88,"So here’s the backstory, I (22f) lived with my parents and 2 siblings and our 8 pets. Long story short, my parents broke up (as expected, they already divorced 10 years ago and got back together about 6 yrs ago) and my mom moved out. We had a family vacation and this is where it all kind of set in, they were completely ignoring each other and acting kind of childish about the whole thing in front of our whole (moms side) family. After the vacation in mid August they decided to literally never come home to hang out with their new boyfriend and girlfriend and left me to handle my siblings (16m and 18f) and the whole house and the pets. Like, we didn’t even have food and I lost my job at the beginning of the pandemic so I could barely afford my cat food, gallons of water, gas etc. my siblings were living on ramen. Fast forward to almost the end of September and my dad is considering buying a house with his girlfriend who has 2 young kids, 4 yr old and 9 yr old. I had only met them twice as I was so stressed out about the whole thing I’ve been going out a lot and spending the night at a friends house often. I did like them though and was getting excited at the idea of buying a house and having my own space if I paid extra rent. 

Anyway, I get home a couple days ago and they are literally moving all their stuff into my house without me ever being told. My brother now sleeps on the couch so the kid can have his own room. Meanwhile, my old dog is aggressive with strangers and has to be locked away all day for them to be in the house which is totally unfair to him and me. Being that no one has been home I haven’t even seen my dad so I called him at work and told him that I was uncomfortable and this was not right for him not to tell me and I only met them twice and now have to share my living space with them. He tried to blame me for not being around, but like, I was already having a mental breakdown trying to care for my ill disciplined siblings and all our pets, I had so much anxiety I had to get out. All he said was ok. Fast forward two days later and it still hasn’t gotten better. I woke up early to the sound of children screaming and running and my poor dog is stuck in my bedroom crying and barking. I still feel terribly uncomfortable, I don’t even want to go upstairs and be in my own kitchen with legit strangers.  Maybe I’m dramatic as everyone else seems to think but I feel fully intruded on and have the worst anxiety of my life and I feel like there’s genuinely nothing I can do about it. I don’t think my dad even cares about how I feel. I can’t move in with my mom, I would have to take all the pets and she lives in a one bedroom in Manhattan and I can’t move out on my own. I feel completely stuck and really horrible and I keep telling myself to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can. Is there literally anything I can do? What would you do?",25Sep2020,1
90,"My roommate (24f) has just started running every day with me during the pandemic so she can help her physical activity and get healthy. I am a college soccer player who runs for the sake of keeping active when the season starts again. We have a small gym at home, but we are missing a treadmill. We usually prefer natural running to be able to get fresh air, so we run in our nearby park for warmup. But since winter is coming we decided to buy a treadmill. I suggested to go for a slightly higher quality one (the price is higher as well, but I was okay with pitching in the extra money). Its solid and really feels nice when I run on it. My roommate suggested a cheaper one that feels like I'm running on an earthquake. I told her no, no way in hell are we getting this. She is originally a biomed student, and i am not, so when it came to the sciences, I would trust her a bit more. But after I heard this, I started questioning what other bullshit she pulled out of her ass. She said it shaking would exercise the muscles and strengthen them. I was like at the speed we run at, I'm pretty sure we are gonna get his and her knee replacements in 5 years from that thing. She keeps pulling bs science like that to justify bringing this half broken earthquake machine into our house. I need this for training to be fit enough for tryouts when covid clears up, but cant afford to by the better one all by my self. How do I convince my roommate to forget about the cheaper discount one and to see it my way for the better treadmill.",25Sep2020,1
91,"It was about two months ago, and my boyfriend let me pick out my ring because he was too scared to pick one out that I didn't like. I found this beautiful pear shaped opal ring, and he ordered it online. He offered for me to wear it before an official proposal, but I told him after he receives the ring in the mail, I'd like for him to keep it in a safe place until he's ready to propose.

I didn't even know it came, until I went upstairs and both my future MIL and her sister were exchanging it to put on their fingers, and telling me it was a beautiful ring. I don't think they had bad intentions, so I didn't say anything to them, but it just made me uncomfortable. I still love my ring, but for some reason it makes me sad that two people wore it first before I had the chance to.

93,"I want advice. Idk what to do anymore.
The events that hapenned are these:
Today morning, my friends wait at the corner of my neibourhood and when I got out from my front door I get a call from my 1 friend. As a joke i picked it up without talking since it's an inside joke. What I heard her say  was ""why the fuck isn't she just waiting for us in the corner? I can't understand that"" and thats when they saw me walking their direction and closed the phone and greeted me from where they were standing. I tried to talk about it with her later and she was passive aggressive saying ""but i have to call you everytime and you know i dont have much minutes on my phone to call you everytime"" with an aggressive attitude, but it's the oposite cause whenever they are waiting for me, I'm always on my way. Except I'm not exactly on the corner and on my front door heading their way.

Next thing:
She always says im too critical of my bullies. These girls spread rumours all around town made me suicidal and got me a low self esteem they caused me to hit my head everyday and hit myself till my skin is almost bruised. So my friend telling me I'm too critical of them makes me feel like she is defending them I've told her everything but she doesn't understand. My other friend told me that she understands and that hitting is a self harm method but my other friend(that says im too critical) says that its easy,i just stop hitting myself and become more sociable. It's not easy i feel like im goinv crazy and I cant get comments like these out of my head. I don't know if I did something and whenever I talk i always cohnt my wirds in order to not get my feelings hurt. Please I need advice.",25Sep2020,1

I was basically on my grind, tunnel vision type shit. But during this time I knew she liked me, she tried and tried to get my attention, but I was locked in, trying to get stuff done. So just I told myself “Just wait for later bro, just finish everything you need to do and then you can just come back and let her know how you feel.” But the problem is I never told her anything, I’ve never been a good communicator (I’ve learned my lesson now) so I never told her that in the back of my mind I knew she was the one. She made me feel like nothing before. She accepted me for who I am, she didn’t judge me, she never wanted anything from me, she just wanted me for who I was. But because of my lack of my communication and other things, during the last couple months of school I started hearing stuff about her and her ex. I eventually got to texting her and actually clearing up all the confusion between us after school had ended, but I was too late. She went back with the other guy. The reason I’m even explaining all this is because I really tried hard man. I tried to convince her, I tried to communicate everything about what happened but she wouldn’t budge.

It's gotten to the point where I look in the mirror and just break down and cry. I cry because of how I look and that I don't look like all these perfected girls plastered over the internet. 

I view myself as nothing compared to everyone else. I never understand how my boyfriend can view me as beautiful? I constantly worry that he will leave me for someone better because to me everyone is better. 

Its really starting to put a strain on my relationship and daily life because I have such little self confidence and hold such negitive opinions about myself.

106,"I'll start this by saying I live with my boyfriend and his parents. Boyfriend's mom is the picky eater and Boyriend's dad is the one who almost always cooks dinner. 

Recently I told my boyfriend and his mom (half joking half serious) while we were all sitting together in the living room that maybe I should start making dinner so no one gets sick any more from Boyfriend's dad's cooking. 

Boyfriend's dad is a good cook but he doesn't like to do it every night so instead of telling us he doesn't want to do it he ruins the food and makes everyone sick.


I would like to help out Boyfriend's dad by helping take over cooking dinner but am very unsure due to Byfriend's mom. Boyfriend's mom and I have a tense relationship to put it lightly and she's quick to criticize anything and everything I do. 

Boyfriend's mom is also very picky with what she likse to eat and doesn't like a lot of the meals I know how to and am used to cooking for myself. I really like cooking with chicken and more cheesy meals where she doesn't really like that stuff. 

I'm also really nervous and scared to cook for Boyfriend's mom because if she doesn't like a meal she will have a tantrum and send it back like she's at a restaurant and expect you to cook something else for her (I've seen her do it to boyfriend's dad enough times). 

Also Boyfriend's family really likes dishes with onion but I cannot be anywhere near chopped/cooking onion because I start having an allergic reaction, that severely limits my options of what I can cook as well.

Boyfriend's mom's food preferences are mostly fatty processed things from the store that take little prep and aren't very good for you (recently we've been having kievs and toasties a lot). 

I really want to be able to cook healthy meals and stop eating so many bad things because that's all she'll be willing to eat.

This broke me and I quit texting her at all. Then, a couple of weeks after I text her, to try to explain just how much I wanted to be with her, to which she mocked me and I raged and blocked her. Fast forward to this week, I texted her again telling her I’m sorry for treating her like that when I was so broken. She forgave me and even said sorry herself for mocking me. But here’s the thing, I only texted her to say sorry, not to start talking again. I still like her, and told her the opposite. So, I don’t know if I should lose her all over again by telling her this, or if I should wait and see if her effect on me wears off along the road.

So, I don't want to write my entire life story on this post. If anyone's interested, you can [check out my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/i7vf4w/my_dad_passed_away_15_years_ago_and_i_dont_think/) in r/offmychest. It has most of the important details. I'll try to sum up the aspects of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The gist of the situation is that I've been in and out of love ever since I was 18. I always tried to find the ""perfect partner"" for myself, even though I realized that no such thing existed. I've always felt that whenever I was in a relationship with someone, I was..happy and content with myself. 

Yes yes, I know the sayings, ""*Be happy with yourself, love yourself*"" blah blah blah, but that's just not the kind of person I am. I feel more..at peace with life when I have someone special in my life. Anyway, the summary is as follows -

&amp;#x200B;

* My last relationship ended this year in January, when I realized my ex was addicted to weed. Even though I asked her multiple times to give it up, she didn't and it was something that I could not compromise on. After moving on, I tried my hand at online dating, but it just wasn't working out. I was investing too much of my time into it, without getting any results.
* My father passed away in March 2019 and my life turned upside down. He was the rock in my life, the one person I could always depend on for everything and who I turned to for advice. I don't have a solid relationship with my mother, but I've improved upon it since then. 
* I have 2 best friends, both married (one also has an infant daughter) and a couple of office colleagues/friends. 
* My job isn't the most amazing job in the world. Because of certain ups and downs in my career, I've had to start over and work my way up the corporate ladder from the very beginning multiple times. Currently working my way up for the third time. 
* When I'm not working, I like to play video games on my PC or phone, I go to the gym at least 3-4 times a week and play with some street dogs in my society. Recently learned video editing during the lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, combine all these different aspects of my life and I realized today that I'm just...**stuck**. I don't feel like I'm making any progress in my life on any front. 

I'm 29, so either I ""should"" be married or ""should"" have a decent job or ""should"" be ""settled"", emotionally and/or financially, but I'm not. I'm none of those things and I don't see myself making any progress over the next 5 years either. *(should is in quotes, because apparently society dictates normal male adults to have achieved either of those things by the time they reach my age)*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if its my mindset or if I'm looking at things too negatively, but I really don't see myself becoming...anything useful. I feel like I should be capable of doing better, but I'm not. I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the advice I'm looking for -

1. How do I get past this feeling of being stuck ? 
2. Am I looking at my life (or life in general) too negatively ?
3. Anything else that would help.

132,"I want to preface this by staying my younger brother is the golden child he's been known to me as Prince (his name here) for about two decades.

My wife and I (Both 34) have three beautiful boys (9, 5, 2).
They are very well behaved, well mannered and mostly sensitive to what goes on around them. My parents, seem to want little to nothing to do with them. This is a shame seeing as my wife's parents are deceased and my mother and father are the only grandparents these boys will ever know.

My mother insists on taking my brothers children every single weekend, sometimes for the whole weekend. She went so far last year (and did this year too, although they got no use) as to get season passes to an amusement park for them. 

We have tried to have an adult conversation (no yelling screaming or crying from either side) on multiple occasions to which my mother replies ""I do other stuff for them"" and leaves it at that. Which infuriates my wife. 

My boys are getting old enough now, to start asking why grandma's spends so much time with there cousins, and never comes to see them etc. So recently I considered taking a job on the other side of the country (us) so that at least when they ask I can tell them it's cause they live closer to grandma than we do. Until they're old enough to understand the family dynamic at least.

And now I'm catching hell for wanting to ""Take those boys away from their family"" I'm not sure what to do anymore. My wife loves the move the ""F"" away idea but I'm totally unsure... Any constructive advice is welcome PLEASE!",25Sep2020,1
133,"Hello everybody,

Two months ago I (F25) got a job I like - office work in a corporate enviroment. Not everyone's dream, but I'm very happy about it, especially in these difficult times. Good office, two weeks of home office, pretty good pay. So I'm trying to be as careful as possible about me, well, keeping the job. 

As a (still, I think) newbie, I make some mistakes. I fix them as quickly as I make them and I'm not afraid of taking responsibility for them. Trouble is, my coworker who does exactly the same job, but has been employed since the beginning of the year, reads every mail I send out to clients (we share mailbox and take on clients and tasks 50/50) and tells me about mistakes I make or notifies our boss, which I find the least appealing. She herself rarely makes mistakes, is very much full of herself and definitely a perfectionist and stickler for the rules of sorts, but not very eager to take on more work than it's in the contract. I have been making unconscious mistake for whole of employment because my former coworker didn't tell me one detail. She yet again consulted our boss about it behind my back. She and boss and one more person are having a meeting on Monday to talk this case out and something else. I find it very stressful (I really don't want to lose the job) that I haven't been included and angry that she didn't get to me first. I've been working in office enviroment for years now, but that's deifnitely a first and I have no idea what to do about it. My coworker might be doing this out of goodness of her heart or she wants to stay on top of this little team. Or perhaps she's afraid of cleaning up after me. Either way, she definitely has a temper and I can imagine her exploding if I mention that she should come to me first. If anyone could please tell me advice on this, it would be much appreciated. Aside from ""don't make mistakes"" - that one is obvious.",25Sep2020,1

To keep it short and not waste too much of your time he was talking about how you can be around people, have friends all that good stuff and still feel lonely and deep down mortally terrified of really showing your true self to anyone, I feel like I do this. Sometimes I'm in calls with friends and it's happy good times but more and more recently the words are coming out of my mouth and I'm not really trying to calculate how I act but it just does not feel like im really being me.

137,"I was ghosted by a very close friend of mine last year. I won’t go into detail about what caused the fall out because I’ve come to terms with it. However, after thoroughly reevaluating our friendship, I realized that it’s possible that she was not friends with me the way that I was friends with her. 

I say this because, for one, she would vent to me alllll the time about things going on in her life and I would also being a listening ear. Some time we would be talking about a subject for hours. I noticed that whenever it was time for me to vent, that energy was not reciprocated. She would be short with me or quickly change the subject. Dont get me wrong, there were sometimes where she would listen but I mostly felt like my problems weren’t as serious to her. 

Another thing is that several of her friends have talked crap about me to her and she ran back and told me everything they would say. It was mostly petty sh*t but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that her friends always felt so comfortable talking crap about me to her. I get that you can’t control what other people say/do and I also considered that the majority of her friends were messy/petty, but it still never sat right with me. One day, she told me about how she got into it with one of her friends because she was talking crap about me. My friend ends up telling me everything her friend said and I can’t lie, it did piss me off mostly because what she said wasn’t true. My friend seemed pretty pissed off as well. So I decide to message her friend and tell her off. I normally would not do this but this time I was pissed because this was not her first time talking about me. Whenever me and my friend were discussing the situation, I told her that I confronted her friend about what she said. She ends up saying “yeah I would never confront someone about something they said about me because I’m actually secure with myself.” She might not have meant anything by this but it felt like shade. Almost as if she’s telling me I’m insecure because I confronted her friend when, in reality, I know she just didn’t want me to say anything to her. (I could just be sensitive, idk)

Honestly, after reevaluating our friendship, I feel like I was just someone that she used to dump all of her problems on. I didn’t think it was that way at the time but you know how they say hindsight is 20/20.",25Sep2020,1
138,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I really need help. 
A few days back, one of my friends committed suicide. He was a college friend, one I'd talk to everyday and go out with every weekend. We even went on a trip together. But since lock down started, we haven't met, it's been about six months. We have spoken on video call a couple of times, with our group of friends. And the last one was about a month ago, where he seemed perfectly fine. He even texted on our group often, right up until two days before he passed away. 
I'm so shocked, this was a very unexpected incident. I couldn't even process it when I first heard this at midnight, and I spent the whole night crying. And the past few days, it's all that's been running on my mind. I don't get a good nights sleep, I keep seeing him even in my dreams, due to which I wake up and just, can't go back to sleep anymore. I've never had someone close to me pass away before, so I do not know how to deal with this. When I'm not doing anything, it's all that's on my mind. I keep remembering the times we spent together, and what went wrong, what I could've done. 
I couldn't even make it to his funeral due to me being in a different city at the time, but I don't know if I could've handled looking at him on his death bed, honestly.

141,"So I talked about being open to having sex with a guy on a post and some dude that is about 3 years older messaged me but he's just really straightforward. 

I talked with him about being curious about sucking dicks and he just really wants to do it in the toilet and it's literally my first time having any sexual contact at all. I've had no girlfriends or boyfriends and even though I told him I'm not comfortable having my first time in a damn toilet he still doesn't really let off. He doesn't want to do it in a hotel because it's ""expensive"" and they aren't available for booking right now 

I think I made a mistake of giving him my telegram although luckily he doesn't have my number or my face but neither do I. Should I just block him ?

I do enjoy the chats I had with him but he keeps defaulting to ""I wanna suck your dick"" and derailing the whole thing. He doesn't seem interested in talking much.

Should I apologize to him before blocking him ?

This is my alt so the post isn't here I will DM you the post though

TL;DR: He's local and I want to have my first experience but him really wanting to do it in the toilet coupled with me not knowing him personally is a huge risk and his advances are frankly scary but at the same time attractive.",25Sep2020,1
142,"Past few weeks my (now-ex) girlfriend  has been experiencing problems with anxiety etc etc.

We had a perfect relationship, we didn't argue once and we were talking 24/7. She would tell me how I was her sunshine a couple days before the break up etc and I wouldn't want anything more.

Friday I had a little bit of a scare saying she didn't think i deserved to go through whatever she's going through with her and I said I'm willing to go through whatever your going through because I love you and she said thankyou and I love you too etc. (She drunk a lot that night so I assumed it was because of the drinking.)

Next few days were perfect again, back to our usual selves, I had no sign of her not being different or unhappy you know?

This monday(the day we broke up) we planned to see eachother that day and again, we were chatting away, no issues even phoned and spoke on the phone and she seemed completely fine and there was nothing wrong. She was her usual self saying she loved me etc. But then there was radio silence for a bit until she messaged me asking to rearrange to see eachother Tuesday instead, the day after because she was a little upset after having a chat with her mum and said she had low battery so she wouldn't be able.to reply. I said okay all good and I'll speak to her later and I hope she's okay. 7 hours later without talking that's where I got the text. ""I'm so sorry but I know you want to help me through this but I don't want to hurt you and thankyou for being there for me etc etc I care for you and love you so much, I hope.you can forgive me"" I said don't be silly, it's all good and I understand everything. We were still friends after this and continued talking.

I deleted all my posts of her off my social media and her comments because I didn't want to be reminded the heart break and she did the same. However, although she changed her cover photo, the old one of us is still up if you swipe far enough and there's still a few photos of us on her Facebook. I don't know if she forgot about them or not or willingly left them up.

However, literally the second we broke up, she was NOT herself and she wouldn't carry on convos like she used to, she would give me dry replies and I can just tell she wasn't the girl she used to be. I sucked it up and assumed she was just upset and maybe it would pass in a few days. I messaged he saying ""I know you wanna be alone for a bit but is there a chance we'd ever get back together? If not now but after everything is sorted?"" She said ""maybe it's best you move on, you deserve better than me and I'll always love you as you were the first person I properly loved"". I said ""It's you I want and I'm willing to go through whatever you want but ill respect your wishes""

A day later I messaged her again about everything and she said ""I don't wanna get your hopes up and say we will get back together and I don't want hurt you and say we won't get back together. I really want to make us work but I don't know what I want"" obviously I respected her wishes and said okay. 

Now yesterday is what I want to talk about. Still dry texting me etc and her best friend also said she was a bit quiet and distant but my ex sent a topless (with bra pic) with a caption ""someone talk, featuring dirty mirror"" and that hurt me because to me, it seemed like she moved on in a matter of days and already trying to get the attention of other boys. But my best friend, who is a girl also got the  snap so I didn't know whether it was just to talk to anybody or.to get boys attention you know? But anyways, remember when I said she would sing and dance to music in her snaps? She sent me a snap of her ""shower concerts"" we'd call them and she had no energy, no dancing, just lip syncing you know? And thats when i deffo knew she wasn't okay so i asked her if she was okay and she dry replied with everything I sent so her best friend told me to leave her on opened and see if she's willing to put in the Same energy as you are because ""I know she doesn't want to lose.you completely""

I did just that and a couple hours later my ex texted me if I was okay. I spilled my heart out nd everything saying how much I missed us and how much I still love and care for her and how much I wanna help her but I cant because she's being so distant and I didn't know if I was annoying and if she's losing interest  etc and she replied saying she's sorry if she made me feel that way but she doesn't know how to tell me how she is because she doesn't know what's wrong with her etc. I said don't be sorry and it's all good I understand etc. 

She didn't mention anything about the love or missing us so or how i thought she was losing interest in me so I'm getting major mixed feelings.

She asked for space and I'm gonna grant it to her and as of today, it will be the second day on our space and it hurts so much because I haven't not spoken to her for this long in ages.

But, as I said I'm getting major mixed feelings. I don't know whether she wants to get back together in the near future when she's feeling better or not because she's saying she wants to make us work and also said I should move on aswell as saying she still loves me you know?

And I don't know how long she wants space for and I don't know if it's a good idea to message her in a few days asking how she's coping because I don't want to lose her completely.

Also don't know if she wants space to move on and sort herself out or to think about everything and sort herself out you know?

The whole situation is a bit shitty and I don't know what to do and I miss her.

It was a year since we left her but she messaged me saying that she changed and that she’s been so sad since. I truly thought she changed and decided to hang with her again. Bad mistake. All of a sudden she started targeting me out of everyone. I was nothing but nice. She was in love with Willow and Willow and I was very close friends. I felt like she was jealous of away. I tried talking to her when it was just the two of us but she would give one-word answers and surf through tik toks. I thought that she might like me if she got to know me better. She started to destroy my self-esteem and knew all my insecurities. I would stand up for myself but it would only make things worse. We had a big fight and she told me that she felt like I hated her and that I never try to become friends with her. I’ve told her so many times I didn’t hate her and offered to play games with her but she always told me she was busy. Willow told me that all those bad things Tammy was saying about me were just baggage she had from me. I thought this was insane. She was commenting negatively about my voice, appearance, everything. How could all those things be baggage? She was telling me how weird I was..picking at my insecurities and so I broke down crying. Even typing this brings me to tears. We eventually patched this up and started being nice to one another but any friendly banter I made with her. She would comment “there’s a lot of shit I could talk about you do I wouldn’t push any further”. She banters a lot with friends so I assumed she’d be fine with it. Lea doesn’t like her much either but she likes to hang with Willow too. Tammy has been saying how we’re getting along when we’ve talked for only 5 minutes and nothing after that but she still continues to jab at me and will get angry if I do it back. Willow believes that we have to be patient and stick with her to change and I believe that too but it’s been so long. Sometimes you have to be brutally honest with someone if they don’t take the multiple hints. Even if it will hurt them. I want to leave but I’m scared I’ll lose the two.

153,"Basically the title. I am an 18F for reference. I've been friends with this guy (18M) for about a month now and it has been really nice. I've generally had a bit of difficulty making true friends throughout middle school and high school (mostly just had a LOT of acquaintances but only maybe 1 or 2 people I truly considered to be my friend). So now that I'm in college, it's pretty refreshing to have become friends with someone who I respect and who respects me, and we basically have a connection where we have similar interests and similar goals.

The issue is that from the past week I have found myself becoming romantically attracted to him. And I don't think I want to be. I feel like this is a natural response that I can't really help because we do have a connection. I'm quite sure that I just want this connection to remain platonic though, and I have no idea what to do. I feel like it's disrespectful of me to feel attraction towards him because I'm worried that me going above and beyond for him subconsciously stems from my romantic interest and not because I care for him as a friend (this probably makes me sound like a terrible person but I'm not sure of the right way to word this). I don't think he knows that I've started feeling this way about him and I don't want him to feel betrayed that my care for him was coming from a different place than his was for me. I want to stop being attracted to him so that our friendship is a mutual situation where neither of us crosses the other's boundaries.

I hope this made sense, and if it didn't I'm very sorry and am willing to answer any followup questions. I'm sure that there is no obvious answer to this, but I thought I might give it a shot asking about it on this sub anyway.",25Sep2020,1
154,"I've been good friends with this girl for a few years (I'm 32M, she's 29F). She's always been in a relationship, so honestly, I ""friend zoned"" her early on (FYI, I know ""friend zone"" has gotten absorbed by gross women hating folk, but I don't use it that way, just the less offensive way it used to be), because I had to, because I didn't want to fall for someone, I didn't want to make her uncomfortable thinking I was attracted to her, and I didn't want to cause problems between her and the guy she was with. Even back then, as far as I knew, she was hoping to marry and start a family with this guy, so I just couldn't allow myself to think of her that way.

Now that she ended that relationship and is angry that she wasted years of her life with him, I've stopped thinking of her as being ""friend zoned"" and I've fallen a bit for her. But, I'm fairly certain she's also ""friend zoned"" me. It's kinda hard to read sometimes. She's been telling me about guys she's chatting with on dating apps and going on dates with, which I know is the worst sign. But she's also positively compared me in little ways to both her ex and one of the guys she was chatting with. She also giggled and played along when I made a joke about she and I being on a date. On two separate occasions, she also just happened to get her boobs and her butt pretty close to my face before awkwardly apologizing for both. Eh. I know I'm trying to look for stuff that isn't there, though.

It just really sucks, because I really don't want to lose our friendship, as she's very important to me. And I can't see a scenario where I tell her how I feel and it doesn't lead to the end of the friendship. Not being able to tell her is eating me up inside. I feel like I'm ""hiding something"" and breeding dishonesty, and undermining the friendship.

At the same time, I know it's not her fault that I feel the way I do, and so it's not fair for me to drop those feelings on her. And as her friend, I care about her and I want her to be happy. And she's told me in the past that it would be terrible if we weren't in each other's lives anymore, so I know it would be incredibly hurtful of me to give her a reason to cut me out of her life.

I dunno. Even if it could be appropriate for me to tell her how I feel, this is probably the worst possible time, because she's still dealing with the breakup and trying to relearn how to date.

It's just really bothering me so much, because I care about her as a friend, and I don't want to be a bad friend. But it's so hard to just sit on this. It's kind of eating me up inside, and it just really sucks. Is there even a good option here?",25Sep2020,1
155,"I moved to my country's capital (central EU) in 2018, after my bachelor's degree and after not being able find a job in the field I wanted. I started doing internships there and doing a master's degree on the side. After two paid internships (6 and 9 months) I got my current full time job in Sept 2019 and I finished the degree this year in June.

Since I was working full time while studying pretty much since the beginning of living here, my only circle of friends are from uni, but it was a very international degree program and most of them moved back to their countries since Covid started. 

Additionally, now that I have been in my current job for a year, I have seen ""everything"" there is to my position. While it is secure and pays ok, there is pretty much zero opportunity for advancement, different tasks, or pay raises in the future. 

So I decided instead of trying to build a life in this city during these times, I want to move back to the city where I did my bachelors, which is way closer to my family and the people from the bachelor's degree program that I'm still in touch with (not to mention the cost of living is cheaper).

Now I'm not doing to quit my job during a global pandemic without having something new lined up, so right now I'm just waiting for adequate job listings and applying. 

Now since making this decision I kind of feel mentally stuck, sort of in a ""holding pattern"". I don't feel like committing to things, knowing I will move away in the foreseeable future. I am trying to change my lifestyle and habits (saving more money, eating better, more exercise), but big picture, I just feel stuck. Moving here, starting to work and getting a degree has made the last 2,5 years feel like a time of constant personal improvement, but all that has stopped a couple of months ago.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation before? Any coping strategies you can share? Am I just spoiled by having my efforts pay off in a more short time frame until now?",25Sep2020,1
156,"I had a situation for a while now with my ex best friend and it's really hard for me to move on. Our friendship changed a lot this year and I actually wanted to talk about a few things that weren't good from my side in the past. She said that she didn't wanted to talk about it because she thinks that I don't understand the situation at all because our realities do not match anymore and she changed so much.   


I ended the friendship in June but it's very hard for me to handle the situation, there are so many things that remained open and unclear about her and our friendship at the end, she even might have different reasons than I do to end it. She does not even want to hear my side and what is important to me at the moment. I mostly felt like she ignored my boundaries and wishes towards the friendship and I knew it was a problem for a long time but I have not talked with her about it because i was scared of losing what we had. She had times were there was something going on in her life, she had not told me about it but I felt like an open book to her while she was completely closed off. She could read me very well and I mostly couldn't read her at all because she was so complicated.  


we had some wonderful times but also really difficult ones. She is not good in talking about such things and always said that she wants to say nothing at all instead of something that might sound wrong or didn't came out as she wanted it to. I have made my mistakes in the past just as she did and I can't continue with this like nothing happened and talk to her like nothing happened. She said she thought that we could end up as friends and see above all what happened. but that does not make sense to me somehow. I think communication is a healthy thing to do when there are problems in any kind of friendship. I can't just Ignore stuff like this and continue as if nothing happened that would not be healthy for me.  


I feel good for making my decision about this and ending the friendship but I also feel really bad and sad because of what we had and all the uncertainty at the end. I don't know how to handle that right at the moment and if we ever going to talk about it at all. She does not even want to listen to what I have to say about what bothered me in the past.

157,"My perents met each other when my mom was 19 (f45) and dad 23 (49). They were together for 10 years and got married when my mom was pregnant with me (f14). Yesterday was their 15th anniversary. The thing is I know they don't love each other anymore. Our house is small so no personal space and you can hear two rooms away and because of this I hear them argue at least 5 times a week. They have confided in me when they argue and with money matters. My dad has a temper and will never admit when he's wrong and is somewhat only thinks about what he wants to do when he wants to do it and 70% we only go places he wants to go or when he wants to go. My mom on the other hand still thinks she's 20 and is hurt easily but hides it well. She also has a bad smoking problem and drinks more than one does and has a rocky relationship with her perents but all in all is a fun, loving person same goes with my dad when he's in a good mood.

Sorry for the long background check but I feel like it goes with what's been happening recently. My perents have Benn drifting further and further apart these couple of months especially with lock down . They have been fighting more and more about small petty things like my mom taking my dad's beers or my dad doesn't want to cook this night and moaning about every little detail of what's wrong with us. It's gotten to the point where my mom doesn't wear her wedding ring anymore. They always have me in the middle of their fights and I have to brake them up sometimes.
Well yesterday it was their 15th anniversary (big deal for my mom) and she wanted to go to an Italian restaurant she wanted to try. She got my dad speakers which he really needed and wanted . But when my dad got home he got her flowers (only because I told him the night before to do that) and threw it on the table not saying anything and went in his room locking the door behind him. This made my mom very upset and I had to help cheer her up. Later in the evening she went to him and said that they should go to the restaurant she wanted to try but he argued that we should go to the pub at the harbor ( we go there every week) because he's friends would be there. My mom and dad started arguing about prices, friends, and kosher (my dad's Jewish). It ended up with my mom storming out the room and slamming the door to going to bed. My dad did nothing and went on watching sailing videos . This really made me sad not just because of what happened but also because I'm used to it. I'm used to going to school crying or tearing up and having to quickly straighten up so no one sees. I'm used to going in my room with my headphones full blast so I don't here them and I'm used to hearing how they want to divorce and are only together for me. This situation made me so emotional that I screamed at them saying ""why can't we be happy family like everyone else. Why can't you two love each other."" The whole time my dad is ignoring me so I stopped what he's watching so he had a excuse to listen. He just said ""what..."" And turned back to he's computer. I yelled out while crying "" just divorce now for fucks sake!!"". I went up onto the roof for a few hours to cool my head down. We ended up going to the pasta plays for me and had fun. But I could see my mom's eyes were puffy from crying . I don't know what to do. I feel like it's my fault they are unhappy. I don't want this to continue or get worse. What should I do...",25Sep2020,1
158,"Hello people, i am new here and i need some advice/venting. If this is unsuitable for this subreddit then delete it. Sorry for long post.

A little background: we both live at my parents, he is quite successful and is moving out this year. He is my family’s sweetheart, my mother and father always taking his side. I am my family loser, still working on my degree that is past its due date. It is not that i slack, i work in my profession but that is not enough for them i guess. Everything i do is not enough, no matter how hard i try. I am quiet, timid and quite gentle person, so this rage attack got me by surprise. Also i have these self isolating, crying episodes, i am melancholy person, cry baby,  i must admit my mental health is not as good as it used to be, i am in a kinda dark place. 

Back to the story. My brother bullies me for the past year or so. I guess we are close, but his way of humor is putting me down, making fun of me and stuff like that. Every day he talks how much of a low life i am because i am not as successful as he is, my mom does the same. When i say to stop he never does, my parents take his side-as usual. That is why I don’t talk to my family much. I am rarely at home, but when i am, i am mostly in my room secluded. 

This week because covid at my workplace, i had to stay at home.  Both mother and brother came to my room multiple times a day, even though i said to leave me alone they never listen. 

When i am at home, he constantly goes in my room and bullies me. Every day he comes to my room and nags me, bullies me, shit talks about me. Today, as soon as he came home, he started to say what a loser i am and how pity my academic successes are. 
I said to stop and he didn’t, as always, so i went to my room. He came after me and i warned him that i will hit him if he goes to my room. He didn’t listen so i went after him. 
He got afraid and locked himself in his room and called mom. Mom again stepped on his side tried to stop me. I had it enough, they both come to my room, multiple times, never leave me alone, always talking about what a failure i am. So i rammed to the doors until he opened them and i started hitting him. My mom tried to get in the middle.
I hit him few times, then he grabbed me and threw me out of his room. I said to him to never talk to me again. He said i am over reacting. 

I don’t know what happened to me, this is out of my normality. I snapped and I shouldn’t. 

What is wrong with me? 

Long story short: i lost temper because constant bullying, i hit my brother.  I shouldn’t. That is not the normality for me. Family life is terrible and i want to leave but I don’t have resources to do so.",25Sep2020,1

Before the incident I did weed every now and then for enjoyment, nothing else. When my parents found out they went completely hysterical and in my opinion overreacted. They acted like it was basically the end of the world that I had done weed. I specifically remember them telling me if I ever do it again they will never be able to trust me again. Anyways, it’s now a year and a bit on and I really want to enjoy my life again. My friends all do weed and they really want me to do it again with them. I’m so fed up of sitting inside all day whilst they are out having fun. I feel like I’m older now and I can be more responsible when doing things like weed.

We’re currently on holiday in Turkey near Bodrum and today we visited a quiet hotel beach. While we were there a group of 8 young girls (in their mid teens, talking in ?russian) accompanied by one man in his 20’s/early 30’s, came to sit by us. The man spent the whole time on phone calls and his laptop whilst the girls drank and busied themselves on their phones. At first we thought it was maybe a photographer/model deal but when we realised how young the girls were, we felt really uncomfortable about the whole situation.

169,"When I was young, I was sent away to a different country to be raised by a relative because my parents could not come to an agreement of who was fit to care for me. Both parents remarried and had three new kids. I grew up and finally, after 12 years, my mother decided to bring me back. Out of guilt or love, I still don’t know. 

Ever since I’ve been back I’ve tried to fit in with her family but in more than one occasion she’s showed me she does not see me as a daughter. She was always embarrassed to introduce me to her husbands family, as the first child. Child out of wedlock! Ooooh! When she’s introduced me to friends they’re often surprised because is the first time they’ve even heard of me. She kicked me out of her house and said I was a bad influence for “her” kids about 8 years ago and has never asked me to come back. She’s struggled with my siblings and their teenage years, and although they’ve done worse things than I did when she kicked me out, she still begs them to be around and is super close with them. My mother doesn’t invite me to family events and says it’s because I have a fiancé and am probably busy, or because she knows I’m tired from work, or probably out with friends etc. 

She’s shown me more than once that she doesn’t see me as a daughter but more of a niece, younger sister or cousin. She disclosed to one of my sisters that she had a feeling her husband and I were having an affair behind her back. At a wedding party, she made me and my fiancé move to the children’s table and she had my sisters take our spot next to her. Whenever there’s an issue at their house they come to me and ask me for help/advice and crash at my house for a week or so, but when they’re happy, I go back to nonexistence. 

I want to remove myself from them in the least dramatic way possible or she’ll go crying to my aunts and twist the story around to make me look like I’m hurting her, like she usually does. I’m tired of her making me believe her lack of interest in me is my fault and I don’t want to be hurt by “her” family anymore. I’ve cried so much, I’ve been hurt so much, and I don’t want my future children to see or ever feel that. I’d die if I ever see my mom put my sisters children over mine.

When my brother got back he informed me that they found the cat dead in the elevator when they were leaving in the morning. There was blood all over the place and he said it was a horrific sight.

177,"I've had a hopeless crush on a coworker for about a year now, ever since I came back to my now current job. We ended up getting pretty close, we chat very often at work, and we're friends, but there are a few problems.

1. First and foremost, they're my coworker. I've gotten involved with coworkers in the past when I was younger and it never worked out well, obviously. I've also seen fellow coworkers get into relationships with each other and almost always crash and burn. It's just... not good.

2. They have an extensive past with another coworker, and it's complicated. Me and another one of my work friends think there still might be some lingering feelings between my crush and the other coworker, moreso on my crush's end.

3. My crush is with someone. Someone I know they care deeply about, and personally I think they're meant to be, as much as it crushes my spirit. My crush has even spoken about marrying this person.

Even though I know I shouldn't feel this way, even though I'm well aware they don't reciprocate, I can't seem to break out of it. I care about them... I know they care about me, too, but not in that way. I mean I've never asked specifically /how/ they care about me lol but given what I know, I can assume it's strictly platonic. But when they say things like that, when they see me at work looking down and come to check on me, when they randomly bring me coffees, whenever we catch eyes (which is often it's a smaller work space), it all just pulls me in deeper. I know they are a kind person so I don't think they do this for any other reason than the fact that we're pals, but it's gotten to me. And now, they're the only person I want. I try talking to other people to take my mind off them but the others never pique my interest. I'm too hung up.

We don’t play loud music, and we both prefer to go and find the other instead of screaming out for them. 

Tonight we received a letter that I’m fairly anxious about. It started by calling us bogans (Australian), and then said that ‘our foul mouths and disregard for neighbors put us in no favor with them’. 

It then went on to complain about our dogs ‘constant’ barking (she barks a little but not a lot and we always go out and get her to stop), and getting out and defecating on their property. She hasn’t gotten out for about a month and a half now, and when she did we found her very quickly. 

It then told us to sell or rent our home as we’ve ‘really pissed everyone off’, continuing to say ‘don’t think this is a joke’, and that it’s ‘best we leave’. Then said that my (specifically) foul mouth wasn’t appreciated - only two houses are close enough to hear us speak, if we speak extremely loudly - and told us to ‘do ourselves a favor’ and leave, finishing with ‘we don’t want you here’.

183,"I think I’m the youngest person at my job (20) and I’m just a call in. It’s a daycare/preschool institution. 

Normally if I do something and one of my coworkers corrects me, I’m not faced at all. Like “hey don’t put your coffee there!!!” Cuz a child might get their hands on it. I would usually be like “oops!” And just move the cup, no big deal at all.

Today, I was just exhausted for no real reason aside from my allergies and a little extra sensitive. Every time they corrected me I just kind of felt really sick to my stomach for a minute or so. They definitely see me as a kid, and not a fully functioning adult, so they rarely even let me explain myself. It’s like “shut up, I’m right, obey.”

A quick example: every time the kids eat, someone cleans the table and also uses a broom to swipe the floor. I cleaned the table and I only swiped some of the floor cuz I just clocked in, was tired and I got confused. I had just asked if we should bring two pairs of shoes in the bad weather cuz I was bringing in a lot of sand. For some reason I only cleaned the sand up and then went outside with the kids. This lady comes storming out like “you need to swipe the floor too!” And I was still confused so I said “but I did—“ and then she interrupted me like “NO YOU DID NOT— NO I CAN TELL YOU DIDNT.” And then went on to lecture me about why it’s important in a really aggressive tone. It’s only my third shift at this institution.

It was a mistake on my part, I’m aware. Fuck it sucked though, I really wish I could’ve just said “oh my bad, I got confused because of our conversation! I’ll do it right now.” Instead I’m just left speechless and feeling unintelligent.

I have a friend who I’ve gone to school with since kindergarten. We are both 16 now and he is struggling with severe depression. I hadn’t spoken to him in a long time until last school year when we were put in a class together. He is very quiet at school, eats lunch alone and doesn’t really have friends. I would only talk to him in class, but when COVID happened I started talking with him online. He confided in me that he is extremely depressed, doesn’t talk to his family and is shut in his room all day. I talk to him frequently and yesterday he told me that talking to me was the only thing that made him happy.

I really want to help him but I’m not sure how. He has obvious romantic feelings for me but seems to know I don’t reciprocate them. This still makes me feel uneasy to spend time with him alone, so I don’t really want to ask to do that, although I’m sure if I did ask he wouldn’t want to leave is house.

I want to make a box for him of little things that make me happy and drop it off at his house. So far I want to include a candle and some snacks, but I’m looking for more ideas. 

I’m really just lost here. I don’t know how to help him and I worry every day that he will end his life. When I try to find answers online it just gives me the suicide hotline which I don’t think is going to help this situation. I know he is not open to talking to any adults about this.

188,"I've always had butterflies. Intetionally id go from relationship to relationship or crush to crush, always having someone in my life giving me that heart racing adrenaline rush. 

Lately I haven't felt it with ANYONE :(

Its so off for me because it not like a hit or miss with me. I constantly will feel it with anyone I find appealing. 

I've tried going out on dates to see if I was just off but no matter who or what I didnt feel the chemistry. These guys were pretty up there with my type and what I like in a guy too.

Idk whats wrong with me, its been 6 months since I've felt like this. 

Recently one of my guy friends and I got pysical, since there was tension for a while. I used to really crush on him for a while in the past. I figured this would be perfect and things would reignite, but I got nothing. 

I did feel really satisfied and happy though the next morning. Like ontop of the world in a different way. Ive never had a physical relationship with anyone I wasn't serious about. So idk why all of a sudden I'm like that. 

Then again I'm only comfortable being close to him, since we're friends first, which tells me I have some control and I'm planing on hoeing out haha. 

Is this normal? Am I going through a phase? 

Could it be depression or that I have my walls up or something?

190,"Well, a week ago I got my hands on the Motorola Edge. Quite a good device, certainly something I was looking for, a 5G device. I was going to choose between a Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite and a Motorola Edge. The Mi 10 Lite was cheaper but the Motorola Edge had better specs, and in my country they were almost at the same price ($500 the Motorola Edge and $480 the Mi 10 Lite). So I said, I should invest a bit more and get the Motorola Edge since it had better specs than the Mi 10 Lite.

Now, I found out that for about the same price, I could have gotten the Pocophone F2 Pro here, which had a better processor and a better battery, but doesn't have the multimedia experience that Motorola tends to offer.

I am somebody who thinks I am lucky for just having a phone, while others can't have the same luck I have to get a decent one. That all of this are just things that happen in capitalism and lots of times, getting a good phone is a lottery given their failure rate. But still... I just feel terrible and can't get this out of my head. I can't get out of my head that I bought a phone that, for the same price, I could have gotten a better one. No matter how much I try to find failures in the Pocophone, it is still better and now I can't return the Motorola Edge as I am still paying it. I treasured every phone I had despite they weren't the best and I don't like the idea of switching phones every two weeks.

I just can't get this idea out of my head, it's been around for days and it is tiring me off. I like my phone but all reviews and recommendations I've seen prove me that I may have thrown away my money, despite I like my phone. It is stressing me out and it is having a huge impact on my job performance.

I don't know what to do.",25Sep2020,1
192,"My mother is a very emotionally distant person and her passive aggressive tendencies have always kept me at arms length from her. She is someone who tends to distract herself from the real world by spending hours a day just playing mindless games on her phone, or the computer, I assume so she doesn’t have to face her thoughts and so she can feel stimulated without actually having to do anything since she also seems to deal with depression (although I doubt she’d ever admit it). She cannot take responsibility for her faults or mistakes and she tends to take any level of constructive criticism or advice extremely personally. If you offend her, she’ll cut you off for an indefinite amount of time. I’ve gotten the cold shoulder from her for sometimes weeks at a time, even as a child. I know that she wasn’t close to her parents as she grew up in an unhealthy environment and I fear that the fact that she didn’t bond with her parents led to her not bonding with her own children. I don’t feel like I can trust people to be reliable, to genuinely love me, or to be open to communication. I feel like I’m never enough. Is there anyone who’s been in this situation? How did you learn to cope and build a healthy romantic relationship with the weight of these trust and bonding issues?

193,"For context, I'm gay and trans, and until recently, almost nobody in my family has been able to accept that. When I came out my mom screamed at me until I cried and then told me not to come out to anyone else (because she was feeling ashamed of having a transgender child). She has come around to accept me now, but denies that any of this even happened. My grandparents have been in denial about it and still are. They have never accepted me and probably never will, and this really strains my relationship with them.  


To top that, I'm pretty severely mentally ill and my family has always treated my mental illnesses like they were a burden. I had to beg over a course of years for them to even consider letting me have a therapist in order to be able to build the proper coping skills for my illnesses. If I'm struggling with something because of my illness, my family has always blamed me and acted like I'm just being difficult on purpose. They refused to take it seriously right up until I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt when I was in high school, and then they took me seriously for about a month before going back to the same.  


I'm not giving this context to gain pity, it's just to explain what has been building up for years to cause my resentment. Because of these things, I have never been able to form a meaningful connection with anyone in my family aside from blood. I started isolating myself from my family when my mental health issues started getting worse, and then even moreso when they refused to take it seriously. I became even more alienated from my family upon coming out as LGBT. Because of this lack of any meaningful connection in the first place along with all the ways my family has hurt me, it's extremely easy for me to feel resentful towards them and I feel horrible about it.  


My grandma lives closer to my college than my mom, and I haven't been able to find my own housing, so my grandma lets me live with her. I can't drive, so she gives me rides to work and school. I normally pay for my own food and groceries. So she does a lot for me, and I am incredibly thankful for that because without her I pretty much wouldn't be able to go to college unless I lived in the expensive dorms. But her not accepting me makes me resent her quite a bit. She's very judgemental of my identity as a trans person, and has said a lot of really hurtful things to me. She never tries to get my pronouns right and when I correct her she generally either laughs at me or jokes about how sensitive I am. I'm in the middle of medically transitioning, and it's been causing me to have a few non-life-threatening complications which I'm not going to be able to solve for a little while, but nearly any time I talk about it, she blames me for having these complications instead of extending any compassion. She doesn't take my mental health issues seriously either and typically blames me for any problem I'm having, or acts like I'm doing it for attention when I'm not. In addition to those things, she can be incredibly overbearing and condescending towards me, doesn't respect my boundaries especially regarding privacy, and any time I have tried to talk to her about any of this, she deflects and doesn't listen and it's really difficult to deal with.  


I don't want to go too into detail about my grandpa, but to keep things short he's incredibly rude and mean-spirited. If you've known him for a certain period of time, you've probably been berated by him for no reason at least once. He was incredibly emotionally abusive towards my mom, and while he's gotten better over the years, I can barely even exist in my grandparents' house without him making some rude comment or insult towards me. I barely even interact with him to avoid this, but sometimes even being in his presence is enough to make him insult you. And if you stand up for yourself, it turns into him either laughing at you or angrily berating you.  


These things piled up onto one another have caused me to resent my grandparents quite a bit, and generally when I live with my grandparents my mental health is a lot worse than when I've lived with my mom. I tend to be quite irritable with my grandparents as a result of my resentment. I feel terrible about this because they do so much for me. They are under no obligation to let me live with them and give me rides to school and work, and they still do. And after doing so much for me, what get in return from me is resentment. I feel like an ungrateful, spoiled asshole and like a horrible grandchild because you're not supposed to resent your family this way. I've been trying to figure out ways to be better for about a year now but I feel like I'm making no progress and I don't know what to do. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for regulating these emotions and how to let go of resentment.",25Sep2020,1
194,"I was selected to interview for the Dept of Revenue. I applied because it mentioned work-life balance and alternate work schedules. The site says they're open from 8am-5pm, M-F.

I'm not allowed to find a job, or leave the house for any reason deemed unnecessary. Our hopes were to wait it out awhile and hope that things would return to normal with a few months, but that obviously hasn't been the case.

There’s even been times I would dread it, I would make any excuse not to have sex with a male.

206,"   There's been some issues with my family recently. A couple weeks ago, my friend introduced me to BTS (side note; idk how i went so long without listening to them). Anyway, ever since then, my family has been really xenophobic. In subtle, and not so subtle ways. 

It's mainly my youngest brother, and I'm not so sure why he has such a big problem with it. He's 14, if that helps. I'm 16F. For the last week, he's basically just been bullying me about listening to them, and it isn't in English, so why am I bothering, stuff like that. Yesterday, he actually said something like this in front of my mom, and I had had enough. I told him, ""What I do does not affect you whatsoever, so I'm not sure why you're concerned, other than your internalized xenophobia."" 

My mom got super pissed, and told me that he doesn't deserve to be treated with such disrespect, even though I've been letting him say all these things for the past week.

I had gotten contacted and a women offered me an Apprenticeship in Domiciliary Care. This seemed perfect since I was looking for something related to H&amp;SC. The manager got in touch and it all started to go downhill.

I was sent to a training Centre which took an hour to get too. Even the manager of the centre was confused as to why I had been sent there. An hour might not seem too bad but for someone who doesn't drive and all it's inconvenient. Anyways, it was only for 3 days so I went ahead and completed it. Fast forward after my training and the manager told me I would be working somewhere even further then the training centre. Even after I specifically said I would only be willing to travel somewhere local or at least near me. The women who offered the vacancy even said it would be local.

However, the manager didn't want to hear it. Instead she came at me with an attitude and made me seem unreasonable for not wanting to go and patronising me. I know I'm not good with public transport and travelling having not done much of it so of course its daunting but the manager doesn't even hear me out. Instead she threatened that I would have to reimburse her for the training which i don't think is possible since I didn't sign any contacts or agreements.

I just moved into a nicer, modern, and fairly newer apartment near my grad school last month. I like the apartment, the amenities are nice, and the location is ideal. 

HOWEVER, my upstairs neighbor is a family with 2 toddlers. The ceiling is pretty thin but not to the point where I can hear normal conversation or the microwave beeping. They run back and forth for hours on end from the kitchen area and living room, which is basically the entire apartment because it's small. The constant thumping and stomping around is driving me insane. I work from home and also attend classes online. The noise is so distracting, I feel my anxiety and frustration go through the roof. I get that kids will be kids, they play, they run, they scream, etc. I can tolerate the baby crying in the middle of the night, the arguing of the parents, and the occasional high pitched scream... it's just the running around. They will seriously run back and forth nonstop for hours. 

I live with a roommate and in the beginning we hit the ceiling with a curtain rod very rarely, like 3 hits one time maybe once a week when we absolutely couldn't take it anymore. The father from upstairs came down and basically yelled at us for doing that. We apologized and calmly tried to express our concerns (literally just about the running) but he claims that his kids don't run around and if anything, they're just walking and following their mom into the kitchen... bullshit. I recorded some instances of the thumping on my phone and anyone can tell that they're running. 

I reached out to the leasing office to put in a noise complaint but of course, they said that they can't tell kids to stop playing... I get that. But they can't even tell them to at least try to stop running around? The only option is moving out of my apartment into a different unit but I would have to pay a size-able transfer fee (I am a student living off loans) and don't even get that option until 6 months after our move-in.

Because of my family’s wealthy background, I was never encouraged to get a job, I never needed money for anything, I never socialised much before uni and I didn’t generally ask for much growing up and I have a lot of money saved over the years, so an income didn’t feel necessary. Obviously my privilege is 70% to blame for that. 

My grades have always been very good, I go to a very good uni and study a very difficult course, one that makes it difficult for me to get a part time job in-between. But I’m here feeling like a privileged bum, because I’ve never had a job, and that will stain my resume. I’m not lazy, far from it. 

I plan on getting a summer placement job next year, hopefully I won’t have difficulty with that, and then in my third year of uni I’m doing a year in industry (paid). 

What should I do? I feel lost, and it’s dragging me down everyday, and it’s completely my fault. Am I wrong for feeling a little annoyed that my parents never pushed me for a job?",25Sep2020,1

225,"I work at a daycare / preschool (ages 0-6) and I’m just a call in, I’m not educated in this field or anything. I’m there to play with the kids and do some of the more practical tasks so everyone else won’t be overwhelmed. I like it a lot!

I’ve seen a pattern though. They absolutely treat me as if I’m not a fully functioning adult. The other day, I went into a specific room where our coats hang to go get my AirPods since I was on my break. A coworker goes “oh don’t go that way! You can’t climb out the window haha” I was so confused that I just said “ok...” and went through a different door to get to that room as well. Just as I’m rummaging through the pockets of my coat the same lady comes in and goes “oh you— you can’t go this way. You can’t climb out the window.” I said I was just getting my AirPods and she says “you have to go through this door” MA’AM IM NOT ON MY WAY OUT THE WINDOW.

A general thing is that if I make a mistake or they correct me about something I’m never allowed to explain myself. You know when I a kid is trying to justify why they should eat dirt? Yeah that’s how I’m treated if I try to explain why I did as I did. They’re so aggressive about it as well, yelling and interrupting me. They might as well say “shut up, I’m right, obey.” 

I feel so unintelligent. If I was more comfortable at the work place (I’m pretty new) I would’ve just said “I’m not on my way out the window! I’m getting something from my coat” but I’m always just left speechless.

226,"I’m not really sure what I should do.

So a little bit of information before I start is I am a quadriplegic which means I’m disabled and in a wheelchair. My disability is Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/arthrogryposis). Basically my joints are backwards and I have little to no muscle in my arms and legs. Here’s a link explaining a little more in depth of what it is and how it affects me. 

So I am a senior in high school and I really cannot decide what option to do after high school. I really want to do YouTube after high school but I feel like college could be a huge risk financial wise(i’ll explain a little more later on). 

Now the reason why I really want to do YouTube is because I feel like it would be a pretty smart job choice. The reason why I think it would be a pretty smart job choice is because it is something I would be able to do and something I already know how to do. I already am really good with computers, I’m pretty good at video games. I’ve had a lot of people say that I have a good mentality to be a YouTuber, and it’s something that I would would enjoy and be passionate about. I also feel like there is a niche for disabled Youtubers. If you think about it how many disabled Youtubers could you name or automatically find their name on YouTube. Personally I only know 2 Youtubers that are disabled that upload pretty frequently. I’m not saying that it would be easy to get a lot of subscribers and views, but I feel like I could attract the disabled side of the community. As well as, the gaming side of the community, and people that are just interested in the video. 

Now on the college side of things, I feel like it would be a huge financial risk and personally feel like college is not for me at this point in time. I feel that I would have a huge disadvantage later on after college getting a job. The reason why I feel like I would have trouble for example, I could have a masters degree and apply for a job and someone else could apply for the same job but have a bachelors degree. The person with the bachelors degree could get hired over me because he’s not disabled, And would not need any more assistance for that job. What I mean by that is the company would not have to hire someone else to help that person but they would for me if they were to hire me. By the way it’s illegal to not hire someone for a job because they are disabled. Even though it’s illegal to not hire someone because of their disability, they could just say “ sorry you don’t have the qualities that we are looking for”. It’s sad but I actually know someone that this is happened to them before but there was nothing they could do about it. 

Sorry for this being a long post but I really need some other peoples opinion on this and I feel like read it what is the best way to go!",25Sep2020,1
227,"I'm the maid of honor at my best friend's wedding. We grew up together as kids, each of us in the deep south from conservative Christian/Catholic families. I moved across country to be with my girlfriend when I turned 34... and now, my childhood best friend is having her wedding in my new state, with her conservative family along. My best friend knows about me, and she's liberal and accepting, but her extended family is quite conservative and I even  heard, ""They won't ask you about it, because there's gonna be so &amp; so's child there so they won't feel it's appropriate to speak about in front of her."" Eeek! Makes me feel crummy!  


I'm not sure how I should approach socializing, how I should introduce my partner, what topics are safe, and which I should stray away from? Should I deflect prying questions or answer honestly? I'm just nervous!! I'm not a confidant person, and I moved away from my little town in the south to get away from the old peeps and be myself. I know, a true best friend should be focusing on her friend and not worried about how \*I\* will be treated, but I'm an anxiety-ridden person and I've got a pit in my stomach and lump in my throat from fear of going. This feels like I did when I was a child and went to a school where I was bullied.   


Does anyone have any tips or advice on calming down, getting through the rehearsal in a few hours and wedding tomorrow? Thanks in advance, I do appreciate the people who take time out of their day to encourage someone else &amp; I promise to try and do the same!",25Sep2020,1
228,"This is my first ever post on reddit, so... hi! :) i also posted this on r/ugly, but noone responded, and i really need some advice welp ;-;
Anyway my first language isn't English,  so please bare with me.

So,I've always been ugly looking, always been teased for my dark skin( which is considered unattractive here), and unattractive features. 
So...., i had these childhood  friends who are verry attractive like atleast a 8/9 out of 10. They sometimes used to call me blacky, or just tease me for my skin colour. I remember one time, one of the girl was scrolling through Instagram, lets call her n, so .. n   showed us a picture of this really attractive model,  she said isnt she so pretty. I said, yes she's verry pretty, and the makeup and filters are making her even prerrier. She didnt seem to like what i said, she replied with, yea but some faces cant be fixed even with makeup lol. They both looked at me and laughed, i tried to act normal, and clueless and didnt say anything just laughed along side. 

But if you put these things aside, they really are great friends, or atleast fun people, and its really entertaining to be in their company. They can always make me laugh but can also shatters my confidence at times. Idk ...

Soo....One of the girl moved away for studies, and after that me and the other girl, lets call her b, we were not so much in touch. Almost been 2 years since i havent seen n. Fast forward yesterday,  b called me and asked if we'd like to go and hangout somewhere. I really, really want to go outside,  due to this current pendamic situation ive been in my house for too long and really would like to spent some time outside with other people.  And during this lockdown period, i think my appearance kinda improved aswell. I lost weight, have been eating healthy, drinking lots of water, and practicing meditation to work om my confidence. Now, i look at the mirror and think, yeah maybe im kinda cute :). 

But i dont want that hard earned confidence to shatter just like that. I know guys staring at them and ignoring my presence all together, or them just making casual jokes about my appearance, thinking that wont really hurt me. will make me feel a bit low, but I also want to go outside and just have some fun with my childhood buddies.  I really dont know if i should or shouldn't go.",25Sep2020,1
230,"I met this really cool female who was basically everything that I wanted in a relationship. We admitted we had feelings for each other and started dating, she recently said she doesn’t want to date me because my cousin likes all my post on Instagram and leaves comments. I’m so hurt yo, like I actually have never felt like this before, Idk what to do. After making a suggestion that I talk to my cousin and tel her to chill (I was trying to salvage the relationship) she said she wasn’t going to compromise because that’s just her personality. So I tell her later that she’s a good friend. I and j called her “Bro” so she writes “Dang” “maybe it is better off like this” referring to the friendship and I’m like Tf? Then she tells me “it’s not that, you know I need help and it’s best not to talk about it” after I told her we promised to trust each other. Fast forward 3 days and we haven’t talked, but I get word that she’s feeling bad, so being the nice guy I am I talk to her. She tells me she wants to remain friends, I’m like cool. So later on that night she tells me how basically her hormones are all over the place (iykyk) and that porn really wasn’t doing it for her. So then I tell her I was holding off on the sexual shit while we were together outta respect as she’s had things in the past happen to her. Take note I made 3 sexual flirty jokes with her throughout the relationship (2 weeks). Then she says “oh yea Ik, I had a gut feeling it wasn’t going to work out” so me being confused questions this to find out that apparently she broke up with me because I made sexual jokes and that “yea sexual jokes really really make me lose interest in someone when we are dating”. Take note that we are in a group of friends and she says sexual shit all the time but that’s none of my business. So then I come to find out that now she’s looking for a fwb. 4 days after we broke up. So to sum it up, I lost a girlfriend because she thought I was dating my cousin. (That’s the real reason but she won’t admit it), and because I turned her away because I was semi sexual, but now she wants to go and fuck random dudes she doesn’t know?? Like I’m cool with FWB and all (more power to you) but to say you broke up with someone because of sexual jokes and then turn around and say “I need to find me a FWB” just hurts man.

231,I'm 24 years old and I'm struggling to focus on almost anything. I get lost in my thoughts very easily and find it hard to snap out of it and back to reality. I'm a fairly creative person and I'll often see something random that will for some reason trigger an idea and I can easily spend and hour or two thinking about it. There have been times where I was on a road trip by myself and I'll drive 2 - 3 hours and it feels like 20 mins because I was just thinking. It kind of scares me to be honest. I dont pay attention to much when I'm in my head and I can often make myself look stupid when I make silly mistakes or don't hear what someone said to me. Does this happen to anyone else??

232,"I work with a girl in my office, small department of about 6 people, and I really like her. We hang out in OT and goof around sometimes, though recently I've been getting some pretty weird vibes that's not sitting well with me. For one, she's been obsessively clingy to our supervisor, which does make me jealous, but it's bothering me because it's very distracting, as well as right next to my desk. Whenever I turn to engage, listen, or interact I get told to ""get back to work"", ""what're you looking at?"", ""WHAT ANON"" all joking but it makes me feel bad. Secondly, there was a good amount of banyer and joking in the past, but recently in the last few weeks I've found myself being really mean and harsh, or at least ruining the mood for myself. I'm trying to reign it in but I can't help it, it's almost like I have no control, abd I definitely have a chip on my shoulder about it. Thirdly, I've been assured we're on good terms in private (at least from like 1 month ago), but I can't really believe her when she says so many passive aggresive things to me.

The big thing thats happened is yesterday I saw a tweet from her friend talking about ""the relentless creepy guy in our office is obsessed with her"". I confronted her via text and later in private and she explained it to me (her friend thinks our supervisor, who is a creep, is too much to handle). After listening to her I believe her, but not after I've had an 8 hour anxiety attack that left me nauseous. Today I'm just keeping my head down, but I doubt she even really knows how much finding that bothered me.

I know this is very very self-centered, she's her own person and doesn't owe anything to me except professional distance and making sure we do the job together, but I do like her and want to be closer amd on better terms, I guess?

In 6th grade, my friend invited me to his birthday party, essentially, he and his mom just kicked me out.

At the end of the 6th grade school year, someone began accusing me of breaking her leg during gym class.

So during the summer after 6th grade, one of my friends revealed that they are a horrible person, so I had to break off connections with them.

And then it became 7th grade, in 7th grade, 2 kids began stealing my things, so I told the principal, and she said that she was going to do something about it.. The next day, the principal got me and 1 of the 2 kids, and she asked him why he took my things, and he said that he lost it. And the principal told him to replace my things (which she never checked up on, and he never replaced my things)

&amp;#x200B;

So now its 8th grade, 

My math teacher is horrible, doesn't teach us anything, she literally just links an edpuzzle made by another teacher, and she tells us to learn from it.

My English teacher is a Karen, she can barely even understand any questions on assessments.

And in between classes my friend (from another school) told me to join his peardeck (something used for learning) and troll in it, so I joined his peardeck, and I simply put ""cock"" as one of the answers as a joke.

30 mins later, the teachers from the other school called my principal and said that I have been doing strange things, so my principal called my mom and said that when I go to high school, she wants to list me as a good recommendation, so she basically told me that I shouldn't be doing inappropriate things in other classes, 

and she told me why I did it, and I had to say the name of the friend who gave me the link to the peardeck and I basically apologized to the principal

so now my mom got mad at me and told me to block that friend who gave me the link, so I did

242,"So, I am going to make this as concise as possible to save you all time. Here we go.

* Age 18: attended public college, adjusted to the transition roughly, began having anxiety and sleep issues.
* Age 19: Got hospitalized for suicidal thoughts for the inability to adjust to the matters. Got put on multiple psych meds that caused side effects.
* Age 20 to 21: got demotivated, distanced myself from old friends from high school and freshman year of college, grades stagnated somewhat.
* Age 22 to 24: Graduated, struggled to find a job, gained more weight. Questioned my religious beliefs immensely, etc.
* Now: Been off meds for six months after PA authorized taper. Dealing with COVID so so. 

Honestly, the roughest part of the matter was the questioning of my religious views. I was raised in a Christian (Protestant) home and things were stable since I was heavily sheltered. Freshman year, I sheltered myself by isolating myself once I encountered people who disagreed with my religious views at the time. However, as time went on, I started to question whether the Bible is 100% true and all, and at times stopped attending church and reading that book. People I knew from church in high school and freshman year at uni distanced themselves from me. I relied more and more on my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like nobody would care about me when I died besides my mom. I started to wonder if God is actually real but all of the religions of the world are wrong. I felt so distant and alone and felt that the world hates me because my brain works differently and that I should become more self-absorbed.

I’m trying to move out so I need significantly more money and I feel as if I’m qualified for it. So I’ve been moving through the process for becoming a firefighter/EMT for a populous county in VA.

today i was scrolling through twitter interacting with all my new uni friends that i made through the app when i clicked on one of my said friend’s tweets. i was about to reply when i saw that someone already had done so. the person that had replied was one of the people i was finally ready to leave behind. from 2016 onwards they made my life a living hell at times and now theyre back and im not sure what to do.

im scared that they’ll infiltrate my friendship circle and ruin everything that i’ve got going for me right now. they dont go to the same college as me and my friends so im extra confused as to how one of them knows each other. i guess it’s because we’re both studying in the same city. im not close with my college friends yet but they still are people i consider my friends. im not sure how to approach this situation and i really need advice. do i approach the friend whos friends with my bully and tell them what’s going on or do i leave the situation alone entirely? im not sure if they’d understand or believe me? because we are not that close? i dont know what to do at all i feel like its a bit weird to talk to them about this. im not sure if this is something i should share with them yet and honestly i dont think i was ever going to but ???? im scared, i really dont want them to become close with my bully.

It's so gross, and I can't help but want to yell at him when he wears that shirt. He has plenty of other shirts, but he wears that shirt just to make other people uncomfortable. He also wears a pair of checkered boxer shorts that his pajama pants. They are ""shorts"" that cover like 70% of his legs, which make him look even more uncivilized. He has long, stray whiskers growing everywhere on his face, he has bulgy, puffy hair, an ugly unibrow, and he burps and farts really loud at home.

When he screams, his face turns red, his eyes bulge up, his hands turn into fists, and his volume increases exponentially by the millisecond. He makes me so scared when he is angry.

254,"Hi guys, I hope everybody is well in these trying times. I am in need of some advice...I am the middle child in my family and I have a successful older friend/family member who we can call Kyle (20M). Kyle is good in pretty much everything (sport, education, etc.), so good that he got into an oversees university. He is always talking about it and my grandad is super proud of him and gets along really well with him because they play the same sport together ,while I can only talk with my grandad about what book he is reading and gardening. I too do very well in class and get high grades, I play sport (Squash) and take part in activities like Academic Support and interact club etc. I feel as though I do well and I am some-what happy with myself, that is before I hear about how much better Kyle's life is oversees. Whenever I hear him talking about it I just feel that I will never be as ""good"" as he is and never ""accomplish"" as much as he did, which leaves me really sad. I feel as though I will never be able to make my family proud and make my life better. Should I be feeling this way?",25Sep2020,1
255,"When I am with people, I can be quite sociable and charismatic, but I generally can only handle them in short bursts. Sometimes, once I spend a bit of time with even one other person, I feel drained and need to recharge alone.

I wouldn't necessarily say that the situation described above makes me an introvert though. I think it's more about the fact that I'm not the most expressive person, with my demeanour generally being somewhere between subdued and mellow, so it's not surprising that I'm more of a listener than anything else. Because I usually find myself on the receiving end of a conversation, it just seems as if people tend to blab on and on to me about their problems, thoughts and opinions. This perhaps explains why my energy levels are left feeling depleted after having interacted with most people.

With that said, I've always harboured something of a lone wolf personality, dating back to when I was a child. I always preferred solo or competitive video games versus cooperative games, I do most things, like shopping, eating out, bar and club-hopping on my own. And, if I'm not doing those things then I'm - YOU GUESSED IT - at home alone watching something on YouTube, reading a book, or working on a couple projects of mine.

Now this brings us to the original question, and to play on the lone wolf comparison a bit more: how can I really go far as a lone wolf when wolf society is inherently cooperative? Mammals and homo sapiens specifically, are social creatures who thrive as a group - this is what helped spur us on to the top of the food chain.

In the past, with different careers and side projects that I had taken on, it's always been my relatively low tolerance to cooperation, maintaining friendships, and the thin and scattered network resulting from it that has limited my success. It also doesn't help that I have moved from city to city and country to country over the last six years, a transient, going from job to job. I'm a lone wolf with itchy paws who's always on the move searching for seemingly greener pastures elsewhere.

Right now I'm working on a project which consists of an okay YouTube channel (about 1,600 subscribers and 70,000 views  over about ten videos) that's connected to an interest of mine, and I am looking into ways to monetize it. I am working with a partner, we've just hired someone to help us with our social media, but I want us to use our detailed knowledge about the subject, paired with our media skills (stuff like graphic design, motion graphics, video editing, writing etc) to help sell our services to potential clients. That part of course requires contacts, a network, and the energy and know-how to approach people, network, then pursue and convert leads into sales. It's safe to say that this part is not exactly my forte. Unsurprisingly, I've already found myself in this situation with previous projects a few times.

The thought of reaching out and pitching to additional people just tires me. I've come to learn that I am just not that guy, I'm more the person in the backroom planning for and making the product, not selling and marketing it to the rest of the world.  

Nowadays I just tell myself to focus on my work, and master it to the point where people approach me instead of the other way round. But the issue there is, sometimes cream doesn't always rise to the top. In life, at times, those who shout the loudest and BS the best get noticed, as more talented individuals fall by the wayside. There are a lot of great, even excellent singers, writers, artists, DJs, inventors etc out there who still don't get any real recognition in part because they were just at the wrong place at the wrong time, or lacked the opportunity to get in front of the right person.

 I am beginning to pursue the digital nomad lifestyle, with me doing online teaching, voiceover work and the odd bit of article writing and video editing, all the while living in a way which that is dirt cheap and doesn't require much cash in the first place. Think living simply in the more developed world or living somewhat comfortably in a developing country where the living expenses are much lower.

I have noticed that I am quite comfortable with regularly communicating with others individually as well as in a group setting online. This converts itself to me typically being one of the more active members on WhatsApp groups, Reddit, along with creating groups and forums on these platforms myself. Maybe there might be something to that, but I am not too sure how much I can transmute this into real world progress.

But beyond that what do I do? How can I, as a lone wolf who is difficult to manage and not the most cooperative, fully realise my potential and more effectively follow through on my goals and projects?

Thanks in advance.",25Sep2020,1

259,"Hi Reddit, I was hoping you could lend me some advice regarding your careers and how you chose them with confidence. 

For a little bit of background, currently I'm in pursuit of my career in Law Enforcement in the United States.
I've never really had any gung-ho hobbies, I just
play video games and excercise on given days because that's all I really could/have time for. I'm a pretty basic guy.
However, I've always been told by those around me that I'm a really tech savvy person, or really good in computers. 
I don't really think so, I just know the fundementals of how to use one like your regular zoomer and how to troubleshoot.
I built my own PC but that's kinda just putting a square peg in a square hole. 

Essentially, to address the issue at hand, I feel as if I don't really know if I'm making the right choice. I don't know if I'm not suited for the line of work my heart tells me I want to do. 
I don't know if I could be making better money doing something else I didn't even know I would like, or even exists for that matter. 
Here in the US, my High School had the shittiest career counselors and planning for the future they could give. My parents just tell me
follow my heart but is that really something smart to do? 

I don't think the feeling of going to college and pursuing a career should be a shot in the dark, should it? 

With all that being said, this isn't a question of ""Is being a X a good career.""
It's more of a ""How do I know if what I'm doing is the right choice?""
Any advice from you all regarding things you wish you would of done/didn't do for your future would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking your time reading this, in advance.",25Sep2020,1
260,"So, I don't care about my birthday. I just see it as another day, but people seem to ignore my feelings on the matter and insist I HAVE to go out and do something. I don't like leaving the house...even before the quarantine. I don't much like being around people, and there are people outside! But seriously. My father feels the same way about his own birthday and he seems to be the only one who does understand it. Despite having told my mother every single year, since I was about 19 (I'm 31 now) that it means nothing to me, she continues to insist that it does have a meaning. My wife once asked me what I wanted to eat and started listing off all the things she could cook. I told her it didn't matter to me and I think she got mad for not telling her what I wanted. It honestly doesn't matter, though.

Before I got together with my wife, I'd turn off my phone and hide in my bedroom all day because people I lived with wanted to take me out and people would call me to hang out or wanted to ask what I was doing for my birthday. And some of them would get visibly angry because I'd state my feelings on the matter. That's another thing I don't understand...why do people get angry over something that's ""supposed to be my special day""?

My question is this: What would be the best way to convey the fact that it doesn't hold any special meaning to me and, more so that trying to treat me special just makes me uncomfortable? I've outright stated ""My birthday is just another day for me. I don't care about it."" to several people, but it seems they can't grasp the concept. 

TL;DR: My birthday is just another normal day. How to convey that fact to others when they ask me to go out on my birthday, want to get me gifts/treat me special, etc?",25Sep2020,1
261,"My apologies if this post is a little ""heavy"" for this sub, but was curious as to what your input was on this, or if you have any words of positivity or encouragement. I value the advice people give on this sub, so I figured it was worth taking the time to post here.

I just turned 30 a few weeks ago. Having hit such a milestone age in my life, I've lately become deeply reflective of my life choices that have led me to here -- and have become more cognizant of where I'm heading, going forward (both with my career and my personal life).

I spent my early 20s switching majors and careers a lot: Started as a Lib. Arts, then went pre-med but dropped out because I was distracted and dealing with depression. Switched my major to Business (because I didn't know what else to do) and graduated. Got a job working with disabled adults for a few years, then went back to school to get a post-bacc in English. Then went to graduate school and got my M.A. in English Education.

Things were going wonderfully. I enjoyed my grad work, and found a job as an English teacher immediately after graduation. And for the past few years, I've loved it (for the most part). But lately, and on-and-off for the past few or so years, I've been feeling as though I've made the wrong career choice. I've lost interest in my work. I've lost respect for my field. I want to make more money. I don't want to be a part of the often complicated, politicized song-and-dance of the education field. I feel under-appreciated and under-respected by the public at large for my vocation.

I've always had a profoundly deep admiration for the medical field -- specifically, for physicians. Having several doctor friends, I'm well-aware of the tremendous time/money/effort commitment of becoming one. All through my 20s, though, I've wanted to become one. I did pre-med at the age of 20 but dropped out because I was struggling with my mental health. But a year after I started my teaching job, I considered trying again. I went to EMT school and nearly graduated, then gave up because I injured myself, and started to forget the material by the time I was well enough to take the final and gain resume-building experience.

A few years ago, I moved out and have lived independently since. I have moderately high rent, tons of furniture, but no student debt. I feel like my prime window of opportunity for taking my post-bacc science classes and MCAT studying is over. I can't just quit my job and move home again. I can't just get rid of my furniture and personal belongings, nor would it make sense for me to pay a bunch of money for years on end for long-term storage (I'd need a huge space for my stuff). I don't have a car anymore (but live in a city with tons of commuting options, etc.). I also don't know what would happen if I theoretically got into a med school that was too far from my apartment. And the state I live in is super competitive.

I also don't know how I'd pay my bills while in med school (since I'd have to quit my job). And I don't know how different my life would be considering I wouldn't be finishing residency until my early 40s -- meanwhile, my colleagues would be 10+ years ahead of me. I'd be paying debt for a decade and wouldn't start making real money until I was close to 50, probably. And what about having a serious relationship or a family by my late 30s or early 40s? Not sure if that would be possible either.

I'm in the process of finding a therapist, because part of these thoughts comes from depression, I'm sure. It's not rational for me to feel this much withdrawal of interest in my day-to-day life. But I do think that there's a kernel of truth behind all these thoughts. Anyway, what are your thoughts on my situation? Am I thinking rationally here? Any advice on how I should move forward, or deal with this? Any advice is much appreciated!",25Sep2020,1

271,"so for context, i am a junior in high school and my parents have been going through a very messy divorce for over a year. the current set up is i live with my mom and see my dad every other weekend and every single  Wednesday night.

this coming Saturday is my mom's weekend, but she will be at work. so my dad gets first right of refusal and my siblings and i spend the weekend with him. it is nothing personal, but i want to stay at my mom's house even though she will be at work. i have been sick for the past week and a half, and have a lot of school work to catch up on. i think being home alone at my mom's will be good and quiet and i can just plow through all the work i need to catch up on. the issue is, i know he will take this really personally if i bring it up to him. i wish that he understood that at almost 17 years old im old enough that i don't need to be babysat while my mom goes to work, and that its nothing against him but id rather just stay at my mom's to get my work finished.

another example of this is when we stay Wednesday nights at my dad's, its a MESS. we have to bring tons of stuff over to my dads, just to spend one night, go to school the next morning, and we don't have a school bus that takes us to school from his house, so he has to find someone from church to take us because he goes to work early, but if we were at our moms' we could just take the bus. i have told him that it would be ideal if we spend the evening with him on Wednesday nights and have dinner with him, and then going back to my mom's house to sleep and that way we can have a routine in the morning throughout the school week, and we dont have to worry about taking things back and forth, and finding a ride from someone at church. when i bring this idea up, he gets very offended and feels like i only want this so i can spend more time at my mom's house. he won't listen to me when i say it isn't personal and its all for the sake of convenience.

what can i say or do to make sure that he doesn't take it personally? i want things to be easier but i feel like i am walking on eggshells so that i don't offend him and he thinks its all because i just want to spend less time with him. im a really good kid and never get in trouble, but he views me not wanting to go to his house as ""against the orders"" and so he thinks im just being rebellious and out to break the rules and to spend less time with him. any advice appreciated.",25Sep2020,1

273,"Hey. 15F here.

Time is going too fast. I'm turning 16 in November and I've wasted what are meant to be the best years of my life. I want to change myself, become a better, confident person and spend my last teenage years the best I can, and that starts with myself. I just don't know how.

I'm awful at socialising, and after years of stuttering and shyly backing away from everything earlier in life, I took it upon myself to not take any more bullying from everybody, and because of it I became stoic, cynical, and all around edgy. I found comfort in the idea I was going against everything and wallowing in my sadness to the point I enjoyed, actively making people hate me so they'd leave me alone. I still do. If I keep going on like this I'll never get anywhere, but it's not like it matters. I convinced myself that I'd take the easy way out, either end it all when things started to really get tough or just become too apathetic to even do that and aimlessly live on as a NEET.

In the past, I've tried to take the first step towards a better future but I failed. Every time I'd think about changing who I am and becoming a better person I'd be reminded of how chained down I felt. If I changed, wouldn't that be like losing to myself? I see equally-nihilistic characters in media and feel compelled to stay the same as them, like a twisted role model. If I ever tried to move past this, the sense of betrayal and sorrow I felt when and remembering the high I got off acting like I was this rebellious loner going against everyone who hurt me took me back to where I was. Once, I think I even did manage to get past that immense feeling, only to be tied back again when my home life got too much again and I realised that not only I didn't deserve to change, but that these jaded feelings of hatred towards everyone and everything would always remain.

I want to change. I don't deserve it but I want to be happy. If I manage to get past my GCSE exams and move onto college I want to start fresh and make up for the countless nights spent wishing I was someone or somewhere else in my bedroom. I don't deserve it at all. Causing so much trouble for my family, making my teachers frustrated by my reluctance to study, being an absolute dick to everyone I know because I've been relentlessly bullied by a select few, do I even deserve forgiveness? Can I really change?

I know how edgy I sound. Laugh all you want. I haven't had a good life, not because of petty school teen drama, but for other factors that I don't want to talk about, so please, just for once, take me seriously.",25Sep2020,1

So recently someone i call my Bestfriend has been taking shots at me and idk why. For example, if i told her something personal about a family member she always brings it up and uses it against me. Like when we were on the phone a few days ago we were playing around bc and i was telling her i have no idea what i want to do for my birthday and she was like “well you better hurry up before u celebrate it by yourself” and i replied by saying, “I mean i don’t need you i can celebrate with my family” (i thought we were still playing)  and she goes off to say “Oh you don’t even like your family” and all this other personal shit and tbh i was caught off guard like wtf is the problem. She often does stupid shit like this and i don’t get why or like when i was talking to her about my dad she felt the need to chime in and say “oh he’s been trying to get his shit together for years” speaking on him as if she knows him personally. I really feel like she’s talks about my personal experiences and uses it against me  to talk shit... but I’m not understanding why. I would never do anything like that to her so now she has me questioning it shes really my friend 🤔 On top of all of this my mom had a severe stroke and my friend has barely been there for me i feel like she’s been a bit selfish and ik it’s not her responsibility but damn i thought i had a shoulder to really cry on but i guess not.

276,"Me and my boyfriend have been living together for a while now. He’s honestly my soul mate. 

Two years ago my sibling had gone through a rough breakup and had no where to go so me and him offered the spare room in the house we have now to them, to help them get back on their feet. They are almost 30 and do not know how to drive (nothing to be ashamed of but it def puts stress on my partner a because he is getting tired of taking them  to places.) they were suppose to learn how to drive while staying with us and also suppose to save for a car. Neither goal has been met. 

They don’t really pay any rent. They give my boyfriend 75 dollars a month for their phone bill. They are suppose to be buying their own food but they often use our groceries. This has been a financial strain on me and my boyfriend. It’s even caused our budgeting to go negative sometimes when we do our monthly financial paperwork. 

The room they are using has been trashed. They had a pet and the pet had ruined the carpet and the stain even sunk through to the basement ceiling. They also smoke a lot and the deck is always covered in cigarettes and ash. 

They also leave their dishes around the house and don’t really help with any chores at all. 

My boyfriend at one point was even taking care of her pets (she at one point had a few while living with us) so that was also financial stress that was adding up. They would also let their pet cages get so bad that we had to keep the bedroom door shut because you could smell the animal poop and pee. They would leave for a few days to spend the nights at their partners place and sometimes we wouldn’t be given the heads up and then we’d have to feed and water her pets.

Me and their partner DONT get along. They started to date after my sibling had gotten out of a long term relationship. They have been together for a little over a year. 

I had a friend group that I had introduced my sibling to and that’s how they met. But recently I have been trying to cut ties with the friend group due to terrible traumas I had suffered from them (sexual assault) and my sibling still chooses to hang around the group and even go to parties and outings with them.

My sibling left our house the day of my birthday to see their partner. I was really upset over it. A few days prior to this I took them on a cabin trip that they didn’t have to pay for. So it just felt like I was used for a free trip. 

Me and my boyfriend are planing on moving in a few months. I asked my sibling what they plan on doing and if they were going to move in with their partner and they flat out told me no and that they’d be moving in with us.

I do not know what to do. My family keeps putting pressure on me that I have to take care of my sibling but it’s becoming to much. 

How do I put my foot down in this situation without coming across as mean. I care for them but I feel like I’m giving up so much of my life (had to wait on getting married, stopped trying to have kids ** no room in the current house, trying to move past sexual assault but I keep hearing and seeing the people I’m trying to avoid, no alone time with my partner)",25Sep2020,1

278,"Hello guys, first time I post here. I'm at a loss about this. Also, big text wall ahead, sorry!

I have 2 jobs. An official one (administration) and a ""fake"" one, payless, but very good for my portfolio.

I've been working for this indie videogame with a group of people for around a year. Since we're not getting paid as is volunteering for portfolio, the Manager asked me if I could design technically everything, you name it, backgrounds, character design, props, etc..

It was hell, but after 6 months, we had the demo ready! Before the release, the Manager got to talk to a big company and they agreed to publish our game/app and do all the marketing/advertising for free. 
But they won't pay us...

So, here's where the problem begins. Since this company is now our ""client"", the Manager got more people into the group, everyone working for free. We were 5 before, now we're around 12.

One of them is a nice woman who already has experience with indie games. My Manager brought her to help me on the technical side of the designs, not the art itself.

Then my Manager told me out of the blue that 2 new artists were coming.
I wasn't even informed about that and got to meet with them via Zoom later. They are great.
I was told I was going to be the Art Director for the project, since I've practically designed everything, but every time I try to order or organize the other 2 artists, this woman with the Technical experience is the one who orders them and ME around. 
I can't blame it on her, since everything she does comes from the Manager, who doesn't talk to me anymore...

I've asked around and as Art Director I'm supposed to do that, to direct the art of the game and the artists under me (duh!) But it seems I can't even order anything to be done without this woman and my Manager overstepping what I say to direct the 3 of us as the same.

It's driving me crazy. Everytime I try to call that out, my Manager overexplains the process to me in baby language or simply ignores me for hours.
Makes me feel ashamed, especially in front of the other artists.
This is not helping me, my experience or my portfolio (can't say I was an Art Director if I've never directed anything)

I was thinking about quitting. If I stay, this game, once completed, will leave a good portfolio for me.

Leaving will mean losing said portfolio (not my work at the demo, but at the rest of the game) but at least this will stop to destroy my mood and making me feel angry and anxious at them.

He is very smart, and very analytical about things (engineer brain). He believes Trump is doing good things for the country, but I disagree. Every time I say something negative about Trump he asks to see the facts, or 3 examples of said behavior I dislike. He also said in our most recent tiff that “Embellishing statements based in fact isn’t lying.”. He says something similar whenever I pull up something that Trump has said that wasn’t true. That or he says it was taken out of context, or that he doesn’t trust the media. I then ask where he gets his unbiased news so that I could get news there instead, but he couldn’t give me a definitive answer. He doesn’t ask for these same unbiased facts when it comes to good things about Trump or bad things about any other politician (Hillary, Obama, Bernie, Biden, etc.). He says that all of the women (at least 25) who have accused Trump of rape, sexual misconduct, assault, etc. were lying and backed by the Democratic Party. 

I don’t know what to do. I am not as good at articulating my words as he is, and I’m a crier so when I get passionate or angry, I tear up, which makes it harder for people to take me seriously. How do I get him to understand how I think? How do I get him to see that someone so sexist and racist shouldn’t be in office? I love him very much but how can I be with someone who not only condones but supports Trumps behavior?

Last year, he was there to listen when I was really upset during a hard time, and this year him and I talk occasionally purely because we sit next to each other first period and the fact I moved up a grade and we're in the same grade. (Sophomores) At the beginning of the school year, he got together with a girl who's my age and a Freshman. I am friends with her as well, and she trusts me with any ""tea"" she has to tell. I am going to refer to her as K. 

Therefore, I am informed of their relationship by both. I don't really dig around in their business because I had have enough to deal with. Though, today during lunch, he is sitting by himself and is obviously very upset. I walk over, touch him on the shoulder, and say something along the lines of, ""It's okay"". I'm not very skilled at emotional support in my opinion. He sobs more, but he doesn't look up at me. A few guys who were his friends call out, ""Walk off"" or something along the lines of that. I take their advice, and I leave.

I feel like I should of stayed a little bit longer, but I believe taking their advice was a good idea. I plan on leaving him be for today and Monday say something to him like, ""Hey, I hope you feel better"" but not try to be nosy.

292,"Hi so quick summary he’s 20 and drinks a lot. To my knowledge he stays at home all day unless he’s working his job. He took a gap year out of college due to Covid. He’s constantly making these self-depreciation jokes, saying how life is meaningless, and how he can’t wait to die etc. Now my friend group sometimes jokes about this stuff so I wasn’t so concerned at first but it’s becoming a regular everytime I see him in person or we talk over discord (think voice chat with a group) and he’s usually pretty drunk and we know he’s a lightweight. 

A year or so ago he was on his roof one night drunk and we had to call him and talk him into going back into his room and then he went to some mental health ward for a week without access to his phone. His parents are divorced and that hit him hard, like me he thinks a lot of things are fucked in our country (USA) such as in recent the breonna Taylor ruling in which the cops got off free so I know stuff like that gets him down and I’m sure Covid didn’t help. 

Since divorce his relationship with his dad hasn’t been good and his dads kind of an ass in my eyes so I’m glad they don’t talk. I’m not sure how he is with his mom but he lives with her and his sister. 

Me and my friends don’t know what to do, we’ve basically come to the decision that we can’t do anything and that he has to get himself out of this depression funk; like he has to want to help himself and has to want our help otherwise our help is meaningless. He thinks nothing is wrong, “I’m fine” despite all the kill myself jokes. 

I’m not sure what to do. I haven’t talked to his mom about it and I don’t know her that well. I’m not sure if she’s aware he constantly drinks despite being underaged and I also don’t want him to get in trouble for that but rather in trouble than dead.

294,"**Disclaimer**: First time posting on Reddit, so here goes. Fair warning, this one is quite the long doozy, so brace yourselves. Also sorry for any mistakes, I haven't reread, kinda painful.

   Bit of background: Last year, I (23M) used to be a student at a big, French university (Paris), on a full-ride scholarship (undergraduate and graduate). I thought that my entire path was paved and that I just had to fulfill my own end of the bargain and just study till I bleed. Now, with hindsight and therapy, I realize that this hasn't been the healthiest mindset (Bit of foreshadowing, couldn't help it).

   During my last year of undergrad (3rd year, for anyone who isn't familiar with the French system), my marks started plummeting and my instinct was to try and study harder, staying up all night and all. I managed to land a good appreciation for my degree. Now moving to grad school, I was accepted at the same university for three programs (Not hard for internal students, seeing as they are familiar with their own standards). But I was also applying for Winter 2020 and Fall 2020 admissions for similar programs back home in Canada. I chose to pursue one program in Paris, in the hopes of getting accepted back home, so I can leave. The conditions for studying were not the best: I was staying with friends and sometimes family members, never having any stable place to study, but I tried to make it work. I had a lot to catch up to, since the field of the degree is very interesting but not exactly my area of expertise. Now I have to admit that I missed a fair few classes, here and there, because I either was behind and wanted to catch up on the classwork or simply because I was staying too far and I couldn't get there on time. And then the transport strikes happened (For more info, google RATP/SNCF strikes), which made attending classes harder. (This feels like ATLA's ""*Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked"").* At this point ( January), I was resolved to resit some of my first semester finals in June 2020.

   Second semester: I was in a full depression at this point and The workload was getting worse by the minute. A bit of hope came through when I finally managed to find a house, albeit far from campus, but by this point, all I wanted was a modicum of stability. I was catching up on second-semester courses, I had a great, albeit hard, research project. And all was well for some three weeks until the whole country was put under lockdown because of COVID-19. No need to go at length about those 2 months, humanity has suffered enough, but if my experience had been a painting, an appropriate name would be ""anger, paranoia, solitude and an ungodly sleeping schedule"". I was constantly trying to look for the bright side, and all I could muster was the fact that I was alive, I had a roof over my head and I felt guilty about not being thankful for the privileged and opportunities that I was blessed with, so I'd better study harder. But by this point, I was spent. and I couldn't advance much on my schoolwork (We didn't have lectures, profs resolved to give us the work and ask us to email if we had problems). I used to enjoy studying, I truly did. It was a thrill to discover and learn, but by that point, I had lost all my will and drive. Around the beginning of May, our head of department emailed us explaining that there would be no exams on short notice and we would know about any exam or deadline 15 days ahead. And like clockwork, one of our professors told us that we had an exam in 6 days (go figure). I guess I had had enough by that point because I booked a ticket to go back home that night (not to fly that night, I was impulsive around that time, but I did give myself time to sort things out before leaving). The only thing that I decided to work on was to finish my project (it was not my best work but what little drive I had in me by that time, I decided to put it in the work and move on).

   Looong story short: I didn't sit for my finals and most of my work was in vain. I got rejected from all programs back home. and I spent most of my summer going through therapy and found out that I was depressed for the longest time, and working myself till I couldn't anymore lead to burnout. But oh well, although my decision of stopping short of my finals is coming back to bite me, now that I feel ready to apply again to other programs, I think that I saved what was left of me.

   I feel like telling my whole story to an admissions committee would seem like trying to shift the blame on circumstances ( I wasn't blameless: poor planning, not developing the right mechanisms to recognize when to stop, etc ...), but I also feel that it wouldn't be fair to actually just say that I didn't do anything last year (and it would be blatant lying too). My relationship with my previous professors hasn't been the best since marks count for a majority of a recommendation and I don't want to bother the professors who recommended me last year, simply because I did that way too many times. My parents have been supportive through all of this, but they can't help but ask about the next step. Frankly, I don't know. Ideas?

   I hope that this proves to be a wakeup call to anyone who is going through a similar situation: You may have debts to others, and you may have obligations and ambitions. But the only people to whom you're most accountable are yourselves. Only you know what you've been through, and there are many things that can't be put into words, and that others have no idea about. So just be kind to yourselves. I know I haven't. I am not telling you to be passive, or to limit your dreams and ambitions, on the contrary. My dreams and ambitions have kept me going. But you can't do that at the expense of your health. Even if you succeed, you'll just have shells of yourselves once there.

295,"I've been doing martial arts for two years now. At the school, I met my friend Dave (this is a placeholder name for identity purposes). Dave is a dime a dozen, a true, genuine and wholesome human being, far too good for this world. I hope you meet or have someone like this in your life because they're far and few between. But if you know what I'm talking about, you know.

When I tell people one of my closest friends is 61 and I'm 23, they're first thought is that he might be taking advantage from me. This couldn't be any further from reality.

298,"
1. To attract a girl, don’t look for her validation:
The first thing you need to understand is that you should never look for the validation of the girl you want to hook up with.

Do not beg for her affection.
Do not ostensibly try to please her.

Because if you do this, you’re going to communicate in a more or less obvious way that you need her affection.

You’re going to communicate her in a more or less obvious way that you need her.

And you know what?

This kind of attitude makes women run away.

Women are looking for a man who is able to give.
Not for a man who can only take.

Women are look for providers, not for takers.

Women are looking for a stable, secure and emotionally healthy man.
Not for a doormat.

To attract a girl in a solid way, don’t put her on a pedestal.

Consider yourself as having a value greater than (or equal) to hers.
Otherwise the game is already lost.


2. Smile (when you approach her):
When approaching a woman you want to seduce, smile.

Whether it is to approach a girl who’s alone or to approach a girl who’s with her friends.

Whether it is to approach a girl in a night club, to approach a girl in the street, or to approach a girl in public transports.

By smiling, you communicate right away positive emotions.
You set the tone for the rest of the interaction.

On the other hand, if you approach a girl by pouting or by looking depressed, you’re going to communicate negative emotions.

Have in mind that when you approach a girl you don’t know, she doesn’t know why you’ve approached her.

Ideally, she should be able to understand from the first second why you’re here. At the sight of your facial expression, and then by hearing the tone of your voice (I’ll get back to this).

So when you strike up a conversation with a girl you want to attract, smile.

Obviously I’m not telling you to smile during the whole conversation (you would look like a complete idiot):
I’m telling you to smile during the first seconds of your approach, so that you can insufflate positive energy in the interaction.

Then you can stop smiling and adopt a more neutral facial expression.

And you’ll smile again only if it’s justified.

3. Look right into her eyes when you talk to her:
To effectively communicate your thoughts and emotions, look at the girl right into the eyes when talking to her.

Or should I say, right into the eye (you’ll agree with me that it’s difficult to stare at both eyes at the same time).

Choose one eye (her right eye or her left eye), then stare at it when talking to her.

By looking at the girl right into the eye when you talk to her, you radiate self-confidence and solidity.
And you can effectively connect with her.

On the other hand, if you say something by looking away, what you say is going to sound fake :

You’re going to look like a guy who doesn’t believe in what he says.
You’re going tolook like a guy who is not honest.
You’re going to look like a guy who is not at ease or who is insecure.

The girl is going to feel that something is wrong.

So when you say something to the girl you want to attract (especially if it’s something important, like your opening line), look at her right in the eyes.

4. Make her understand (quickly) that there’s something going on between you:
Like a lot of guys, you’ve probably already tried to hit on a girl who was seeing you as no more than a friend.

“Let’s be friends”

Sounds familiar?

It happened to me a lot back then…

The friend zone.

But I have some good news for you:

This is a situation you can easily avoid if you make sure to make the girl understand quickly that something is going on between you and her.

It can be done as soon as you approach her (if you use a direct approach where you compliment her).

It can also be done during the conversation, by declaring to her that you find her attractive (compliments are very effective for this, as well as stare and physical contact).

Be at ease with your desire.
Cause from that moment, the girl will know that she can’t consider you as a mere friend.

She’ll see you as a potentiel lover.

Make sure to make her understand that you find her attractive, but at the same time that you don’t need her.

Like James Bond who can be quite undertaking with women, but whose attitude clearly communicates that he doesn’t need them.

5. Lead:
To make a hot girl attracted to you, be in control.
Take the lead.

Your ability to lead is very attractive for a woman.

And if you’re dating a shy girl, this character trait will be of use.

Women love when they can just give in to a man who fully controls the situation.

It is your job to direct the movement.

It is your job to take the interaction to the next level:

To invite her to do something together later (and thus to invite her to put her phone number into your phone)
To ask her out, and decide when and where you’re going to meet
To decide where to sit when you take her to a bar or to a restaurant or where to go when you go have a walk with her
Etc.
It is your job to lead.
Do it.",25Sep2020,1

Today, he told me that he's addicted, and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day and went down to 1. Now, I don't know how much he still smokes, but he said he wants to stop once he finds a reason to (as in, motivation to live his life).

308,"So last night I tweeted a joke about how Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender is ""sexy."" A few days before I had also tweeted a joke about how Zuko and Katara shouldn't have ended up together but still should have hooked up.

A friend DM-ed me last night to tell me that Zuko is 16 and I shouldn't be sexualizing minors, real or not. Instead of just saying ""oh whoops I'll delete that"" I got annoyed and defensive. Here's a copy of our conversation:

Friend: just so u know zuko is 16 😳

Me: true but it's animated and it's fiction

Friend: i dont think we should sexualize minors both irl and fiction, they both influence each other in perpetuating harm

Me: dude it's a joke. also i don't recall them mentioning his age? anyway if you think i would sexualize actual children i don't know what to tell you

Friend: i mean, avatar is literally a kids' show. even if it's a joke i wanted to let you know in case u didn't already (and u didn't). i expect my friends to be careful about how they interact with others, especially minors because it's weird to react to knowing his age so defensively. you could've said, oh oops and moved on. this doesn't imply that i think you would sexualize children irl, but i am disappointed that you responded so flippantly.

Me: yeah, i'm defensive because you're overreacting. i'll take it down because ok yeah he's 16 makes sense but he is an animated character and it is a mild joke and just like. what the hell dude

Friend: i don't think its overreacting to say he's a minor and you shouldn't sexualize children lol. If you wouldn't call out an adult for thirsting over a child in a show that's weird?

Me: he's not portrayed as a child? anyway i took it down because it did feel weird so i hope that satisfies you. if you think i'm some kind of pedo because i casually used the word ""sexy"" in a joke where that's not even the punchline then i'm sorry and you don't have to talk to me anymore if it makes you uncomfortable

Friend: someone being a child isn't determined by how 'mature' they look or act i don't know how your perception of his character matters.

Me: ohh my fucking god I AM SORRY. it was a flippant remark but inappropriate. minors should obviously not be sexualized. are you happy? can i go to bed now? this is getting ridiculous.

Friend: I never said you're a pedophile but ya I'd rather not talk to someone who gets so defensive over being informed that the character they're sexualizing is a minor. goodnight. also might as well delete the katara and zuko post too bc saying a 14 and 16 year old should hook up is fucking weird too

Me: i'm sorry i was defensive. i've had a bad day and i took your message the wrong way as accusatory. i hope you know that though it was obviously a joke in poor taste i would never ever view a child sexually, real or otherwise. but i understand why that makes you uncomfortable so if you want to end things here i get it. 

thank you for pointing that out [about zuko and katara] and i will delete it. i think i keep forgetting the main characters are children but that's no excuse it's still wrong

I apologized over text to my friend and they said thanks but they're uncomfortable being my friend anymore.

314,"So today I went to the doctor to confirm my pregnancy because a few days ago I had took two tests, which came out bright pink and positive. I’m having mixed emotions, I don’t know if I’m excited or sad. 

The baby’s father is 22, him and I have been together for over a year and I was planning on leaving him because he’s been abusive. He can get very violent with me and he sells drugs for a living. He also cheated on me just a few months ago  and I’m still hurt about that. I don’t know if I want him around the baby because of how he is, however I also didn’t have my dad in my life and I don’t want to do that to my baby. 

I have My GED, and was planning on starting community college soon however I may have to do it online now. I want to start my own business and do makeup and nails and sell my own scrubs, lashes, lipglosses, etc. I have a plan and I’m doing what I can with the support I have. However he is still taking Xanax and isn’t even looking for a job. He makes quite a lot of money from what he does right now but that’s not the lifestyle I want for my family. 

I feel as though he got my pregnant on purspose so I’d stay with him. He is very possessive and used to keep me in his house and take my phone so I couldn’t call my mom. One time he’s pulled a gun on me before and I’m scared of what he could do while I’m pregnant. He’s been changing but very very slowly. And now that he knows I’m pregnant his whole demeanor is changed. He wants a relationship with my family, he’s been respectful and nice. But it feels so fake. I love him so much and I want to have a family but it’s so rushed and I don’t know what to do if I should stay with him or not. I just want to do what’s best for my baby because I don’t have the heart to abort it. Please give advice",25Sep2020,1

I was  upset that he asked to be with me but when I hesitated in the same conversation they said they were going to date this other person  thats when I found out theywere talking to someone else at the same time that really hurt me and things just haven't been the same since and theres soooo many more instances where he's picked and believed other people over me  lied to me way to many to write on here  but that's not what I need help on  here is where need help a couple of days ago we got into a stupid argument about him leaving work early leaving me with extra work I was tired and upset  when we came in the next day I wouldn't talk to him  which i know he can't stand I know I was wrong for that but I've got alot of anger problems I've found it best to just keep my mouth shut when I'm upset  .. but things ended up escalated into a loud argument that he actually was told that if it happened again he'd have to leave for the day but it went on anyways and it really was just the stupidest argument the same one we always have accusing each other of not being true friends not about caring each other  like we claim we do blah blah blah just stupid you can see why i went into absolute shock when another co-worker Walk up to us and he screamed out SHE'S ENCOURAGING ME TO KILL MYSELF!! it was loud enough that I'm sure other people could hear but  idk if they did or not he then told her that was going to go home and SF  which is something that I do but he knows how ashamed and embarrassed I am of it  he knows i don't tell people about that I went into shock  I think I screamed i know I ran into the back I fell on the floor crying there for about 20min while I waited for someone to come get me from work I could not believe what I was hearing I'm so embarrassed to have to go back into work and see those people the girl promised not to tell anyone but idk if I could believe her how could I I can't even trust my friend now ...I am embarrassed about what people would think about the SF  but what's really messing my head up is that he told them I was encouraging him to kill him self like where TF did that come from I know he has anxiety depression I know that he is suicidal  he also has a terrible home life we've had alot of conversations about that I think that's why we were so close we've got alot I'm common but I've always let him vent to me I've always told him what he thinks about himself is wrong that he's a great person and that I love him I've encouraged him to seek therapy go see a Dr he did end up going and getting meds he never took them told him I was proud anyways that he went and tried to talk about it with someone I've always encouraged him to get better so the fact that he accused me of doing that is killing me he tells me  he's suicidal thoughts are a daily thing and that everytime we fight or I stopped texting and talking to him it makes things worse and makes him  want to do it more so maybe that's what he meant to say that us fighting that day was upsetting him but the way he made it sound  to her is that I was literally saying kill yourself this whole thing has torn me apart idk what to do  he's also my only friend up there ive got really bad social anxiety so I don't make friends easy  so now I have no one ..he's friends with  most everyone up there so I feel like there going to believe him over me  theyre going to think I'm this monster who is just bullying this poor sad boy when it's actually the opposite ..I loved him so much I wanted the best for him I wanted him to get better I hoped one day we'd get past all that old stuff and end up together and if not at the very least I thought I'd have a forever friendship with him I'm so hurt and confused...

325,"I (27/F) live with my mom (56) for now until I get a place with my partner. My mom has been unemployed for a couple of years now and as she has less to do it seems she has more and more to say my sisters and myself about her opinions and it ruins quality time. 

She will always say things like “I will never stop telling you guys things because I’m your mom” and “I’m older so I’m not going to change.”

Recently she will point out the clothes I wear and tell me how she feels and I feel the need to tell her to stop sharing her options about how people dress that when she does it it’s always rude. 

Part of me feels like you should always call out rude behavior because you want to correct how a loved one treats others, and another part of me feels like my mom is just depressed and this is what she’s going to be like so maybe I shouldn’t upset her more.

To people of all ages especially older, do you believe there is a way we could show our mom that we respect her and want her love but she doesn’t haven’t to put people down to get her point across? Or should I learn to not be offended anymore and brush it off?

I hate being pitied. Whenever I try to be open about my issues, people will almost always try to console me and fix the issue. By talking about my problems, I feel like I'm basically asking them to pity me.

For example, I feel like I have nothing to be happy about in life and my family doesn't love me. If I went to someone and told them that straight to the face, they are almost guaranteed to start saying things like ""Don't worry, we'll get through this"" or ""Just remember I care about you"" or doing a number of other things in an attempt to make my situation better.

335,"It's approaching the beginning of term and my university in the UK is reopening and having some classes with face to face teaching but most stuff online. I honestly want to go back to university as my life there is much less depressing. At my family home there are multiple problems, my mom is mentally ill and often has episodes where she becomes very abusive. I have to tread on eggshells when I'm at home and I don't have nearly as much freedom. my parents' marriage is also hanging by a thread and they don't even speak to each other anymore. Despite some benefits of staying in my family house (mainly financial), I find staying here very depressing and the longer I stay the more I get trapped into feeling like I am needed in order for chaos not to ensue. Anyway, the point is I would prefer to go to university and just have to worry about finishing my degree. 

The problem is there's a part of me that feels like I should not go back. Mainly because my doctor grandfather thinks it's dangerous given what has happened recently at Glasgow university (120 students tested positive and now 600 of them are having to self-isolate until after Christmas). Part of me thinks my grandfather is being too paranoid and his staying inside so much with nothing except the news to entertain him is likely making him more scared for me than he needs to be. I am supposed to be going to my uni house in a few days but I feel guilty for wanting to disobey his wishes and potentially regret it in the future if somehow I end up getting pretty sick. It doesn't help that part of the way I fund my university \*housing\* is through money he gave to me last year. On top of all this, because of the state my family is in now and my parents' toxic marriage I also feel like if I go and my dad suddenly has no choice but to separate from my mom, then I may be stuck at university and unable to return home while my younger siblings (I'm the oldest of four kids) have to deal with the chaos/drama without me. 

Long story short I'm worried about the impact of me leaving my family home, I think having to be here for several months has caused me to return to old ways of feeling like I am needed here and have to stay in order to maintain stability. As you can probably tell from this post, I also have anxiety problems and often find myself ruminating/worrying intensely about the future because of everything that's happening. 

What should I do, leave because I want to put myself first? Or stay here and stick it out for another few weeks just until the 'second wave' clears up and it's less dangerous to return to uni??",25Sep2020,1

When I went to see them she was right, they were completely naked. It all seemed so natural and normal for them. I tried to act normal, but it’s hard not to stare at times when you’re so unused to it. Before we left they both came over and each gave me a hug. That part was really awkward and a little gross. I also found it weird that they used nothing to cover up any of the furniture. 

My girlfriend later asked me what I thought. I told her that I thought it was a little awkward and different for me, but that I did like them. She seemed to understand. We planned on going over to see them a few weeks later. Before that visit my girlfriend said she wanted to discuss things with me. She said that she thinks it would mean a lot to them if we went there nude too, to show them that I was accepting of their lifestyle and to show that I respected them. I was a little freaked out by this so I told her that I needed time to think. I didn’t really want to do this but I knew it would mean a lot to her family. I decided that I would try it out. When we got there we both took off our clothes in the car and walked inside. They looked really happy and seemed to think it was so awesome that we were joining them like that. They gave me hugs again, which was super weird this time as we were all naked. We did most of the same stuff, except this time obviously my girlfriend and I were both naked. 

Since I’m not a practicing nudist, seeing other people naked (my girlfriend) can get me aroused. This probably doesn’t need to be said but it meant that most of the visit with her family I was walking around with a hard on. The parents didn’t really pay any attention to it thankfully but my girlfriend definitely gave me some weird looks. I whispered to her that I couldn’t help it. We finally left. On the way home we were talking about how it went. I told her that I don’t think that I could do it. I said I can accept them being nudist, but I can’t do it myself. She seemed to be a little upset. She asked me why. I told her it was because it’s not something thats natural to me. I explained how I felt aroused because I saw her naked. She told me I was gross for sexualizing her and seemed even more upset at that. When I dropped her off she called me a disgusting man and slammed the door. 

I feel bad for being aroused around her at her family’s house , but I really couldn’t help it. It’s not natural to me and I’d rather just wear clothes. Because I’m refusing to be nude at their house my girlfriend believes that I don’t respect them or their lifestyle. I’ve tried to explain my side but she won’t listen. She is also angry at me and thinks I’m nasty for sexualizing her. Again, I feel as though I couldn’t help that as this is so new and different to me. What can I do to smooth things over with her and the family? I like my girlfriend a lot and don’t want to lose her,  but I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR-my girlfriends family are nudists. She is upset with me because I don’t want to participate in their lifestyle. What do I do?",25Sep2020,1

I’m 20 years old, was about to join the military but then was told I have to wait another 6 months because of my reentry code.

I’m talking to a girl that’s from Tinder and she’s about an hour away from me, we hit it off pretty well but she’s short with her texts and I feel like what ever chemistry was found over text is now falling apart. We were supposed to hang out today but that might not happen.

I am struggling with depression and I feel like the only way to possibly cure it is by micro dosing on shrooms or even LSD. I’ve been going to the doctor but I’m struggling to keep up with appointments. I live in my dads basement and he doesn’t know anything about any of this and I’m pretty sure I’m never going to tell him either.

I'm not sure if she's schizophrenic or bipolar but something is definitely wrong. She behaves in the EXACT same way Norma Bates does in The Bates Motel from a psychology standpoint. My dad(whom me and my sister live with now) is super supportive but my step-dad is an alcoholic and my two younger brothers (11 and 9) are already suicidal. CPS has been involved many many times throughout my life but she somehow manages to weasel her way out of any confrontation from manipulating her kids and those around her. I don't know what to believe anymore and although I am not in that household, my brothers are and its hard enough going into the same neighborhood. She won't let us go anywhere with our brothers without her because she's so paranoid. I know its crazy but I don't want to cut ties. I tried telling her to get therapy and brought up countless memories of her calling us names and screaming for doing nothing and she DENIES it. Hello? I LIVED it. She said I've been brainwashed into thinking she did all those things. ??? Its just so toxic and filthy everyone is depressed and hopeless.

tw: suicidal mentions

so i had a friend (T)(f20) who a couple months ago had a break up with another friend (W)(f20). they stopped being friends bc their relationship has always been kinda rocky in high school (?) neither told me much about their friendship and Initially i didn’t ask cuz it wasn’t my business. Anyways T asked if they were still friends and expressed her relationship concerns with W &amp; mixed with drama that happened in high school, they stopped being friends. It was presumably a very clean cut off. T came to me (we were good friends but not too close in my eyes). She had cut off friends previously that week and had started saying how it was awful how her friends could get tired of her (her as a whole and her ranting &amp; asking for reassurance in their friendship alot) and how they were bad people and I comforted her and assured her that she was 100% valid but also that other ppl’s feelings were valid too bc they gotta take care of themselves if they feel drained. She said okay and a day later said i gaslit her and I profusely apologized bc I didn’t see it like that but said sorry anyways bc that wasn’t my intention. She said she didn’t trust me anymore and I understood and thought that was it.

A week later T was kind of frantic and asking me for W’s number and said that she was super upset and asked me to relay messages to W, saying that she was “an awful person, was going to make her kill herself, deserved to rot in hell, was terrible etc etc.” which was a large jump from the clean cut off friendship from before. It was a drastic jump and I literally did not know how to handle it. I didn’t feel comfortable relaying such things to another person because they were quite brash and W was my friend as well. so T said that i had to choose between friends, her or W. The week prior, when they first stopped being friends, both T and W shared a mutual best friend (H) and T told H what had happened and said she didn’t want H to choose between them and that they could still be friends but separately. Now she was taking back her words and also saying that H couldn’t be friends with them both like she was saying to me.

When i said I didn’t want to pick either side, T started saying how I was a liar and gaslighter and how I didn’t mean anything I said and how I could cause her harm (to herself I think) as well and starting directing that anger at me and we went back and forth for a bit until she told me to never contact her again. It was eating me up inside. I have anxiety myself so I couldn’t sleep right I had dreams about her and I felt really bad for how Things ended. I started being disgusted with myself in the mirror, I started to believe I didn’t deserve love, and I started feeling physically sick. Mostly because like - I don’t ever wanna leave a friend who’s suicidal and that made me upset because I wanted to help but she cut me out.

(I since then apologized for how I handled it, as I could’ve responded with more patience and care, and she said I had crossed her boundaries by apologizing &amp; by not respecting her wishes)

In the moment when all of this happened, I was just feeling tired, and I didn’t want any drama in my life at all. I just wanted to push this aside and be done &amp; that played a large factor in why I stayed neutral. Now, with further thought, I see where I could’ve been in the wrong. My friend was obviously hurt by the other and I didn’t choose her side. She said the other had caused her emotional harm, and though idk how (as neither party told me anything substantial that happened in their friendship to get to this point), I feel like I should’ve been loyal to her. No, I didn’t like the way she directed that anger at me but maybe it was deserved? Perhaps it was the only way to get her frustration across?

now, as I am still learning, I am reevaluating my morals when it comes to friendship and realizing I may not want to be friends with someone who once hurt a former friend so deeply and feeling like I made a mistake, and would not wanna be friends with W either. Since the incident the relationship feels awkward and guilty and she was such a good friend to me before this but idk .. This would not be in attempt to reconcile with T AT ALL bc I’m not interested in being friends w her anymore. This would just be for me getting my own moral footstanting as I grow into adulthood friendships. What do u guys think?",25Sep2020,1
343,To start off I am very embarrassed. I’m the “smart” one to my friends and family. But this school year I really slacked off. I fell into this funk when my routine was broken and before I knew it weeks had gone by and now My gpa is basically zero.,25Sep2020,1
344,"I’m most likely going to delete this later.

Before I start I’d like to ask that you please don’t comment just to condemn me. I know that what I’m doing is horrible and that’s why I need your help.

In order to avoid creating bias, I will not be revealing my gender. I will say though, that I am in fact bisexual.
That being said, I’ve never really been into the idea of dating and romance. The thing is, many people keep end up liking me that way and they’re always asking me out, flirting, confessing, etc etc. Initially, I wouldn’t even give a second thought of them being anything more than a friend. The problem is that as soon as I learn that they like me, it’s almost like a switch goes off in my head. I stop thinking of them as a friend and instead, I use the opportunity to take advantage of their feelings and lead them on. Whenever people tell me they like me, it gives me a sense of reassurance and confidence knowing that there are people that feel so strongly toward me. Even if I don’t have any intention of dating them whatsoever, I still want them to keep liking me. I make them think they have a chance with me just so that they can keep on chasing me and continue to fuel my own sense of importance.

But wait, it gets worse.

Whenever I hear that someone like another person, I get weirdly jealous. I get bothered by the thought that people would have a crush on someone other than me, and I get more bothered by the thought of their crush liking them back. When that happens I would always find a way to sabotage them. I’d get the attention of my friends’ crushes and lead them on, so that my friend has no chance having their feelings returned. The only reason I’d enter a relationship is if I see that there is someone else who may have a chance with them, so I treat it as a competition and I take their crush away from them. I stayed in my last relationship for almost 2 and a half years only because many people I knew liked this person, and I didn’t want to give any of them a chance.

I am currently seeing a therapist, but I haven’t told her about this in fear of ruining my image. I know that what I’m doing is horrible and I shouldn’t give a shit about how my therapist thinks of me, but I still can’t bring myself to tell anyone.

346,"Preface; I am very healthy, super active, I work out, etc. I do tons of research on nutrition and I have a good amount of experience with losing weight and building muscle.

Here's the thing. My dad has been on a ""weight loss journey"" for like 3 years now. He doesn't understand nutrition at all. I've tried helping him so much. I keep giving him tips on how to lose weight, and it flies over his head or something! He's not obese, just overweight. But it saddens me to see just how terrible his nutrition has become. He doesn't eat large volumes of food, and doesn't eat junk food. However, he keeps following nonsense online like those scam ""diets"" that are designed to prey on gullible people who are too lazy to address their nutrition and want an easy way out without having to put in much effort.

Just recently I saw him put like 2 tablespoons worth of butter in his coffee. I told him ""Dad, you do realize you just added like 200 calories in your coffee, right?"". He says ""oh but I read online that putting butter and other oils in your diet helps burn a lot of fat"". I nearly facepalmed right in front of him. 

He's also very weak now, doesn't have a lot of energy. I remember back in the day when we used to build furniture together and I would screw in something as hard as I could and he would tighten it even more to make sure it's sturdy. And I was like wow you're strong. Now when I help him assemble something I'm the one who needs to ensure he tightens everything properly. He consumes a lot of nutrient deficient foods, especially high calorie drinks. 

How am I supposed to help him when he won't listen to me?? Isn't it obvious that I know what I'm doing since I've been able to lose weight and build muscle?? But he ignores my advice and follows scam diets that he finds online and in TV shows!! He looks weak, he's out of shape, and lacks energy. How can I help such a stubborn person?!",25Sep2020,1
348,"So, I met this guy on tinder in March ( when this lockdown due to Pendamic and stuff started), We started talking, I really liked him. We use to talk a lot, texting for hours and hours. We both liked each other and  started sexting too sometimes. But, we didn't decide to date officially yet, sine we hadn't met each other for real and we both live in different cities so we weren't sure when we would actually meet. Hence, we decided to not rush into things and start a relationship until we meet sach other. Anyway, everything was okay.. After almost 2 months of all this and then his work from home turned into work from office and he got busy with all that and our texting and talking became less.. It was fine, I understood he had work and important stuff and was okay with it, also we weren't officially dating so who am I to actually say anything right. But, then it became less and less... We barely talked, he would reply to my texts after hours. And I sometimes got upset about it, I told him and asked what's going on, he said he was in a bad place at work and is very busy, I understood and became okay with it. 
I use to tell him occasionally in some or the other way that how much I like him, but he rarely told me anything like that and said he isn't much of an expressive person. 
I'm someone who likes to tell people how I feel and like if it's reciprocated. He never did it, and it bothered me tbh. 
One day I got a little annoyed and asked him if he really likes me or not.. That, why he doesn't talk to me or expresses anything. Being busy is one thing but showing no feelings is something else. 
Then he told me that he doesn't know when we'll meet or if we'll meet at all ( since I'm applying for different colleges for my masters and I don't know where I'll go) so he doesn't want to start anything that we'd regret.. He doesn't express much because he doesn't want to get emotionally involved unless he is sure of the future. So, I asked what do you want.. And to that he said I don't know but he doesn't want me to tell people that I'm available either, that he likes me a lot and it would made him upset. 
Now, I just don't understand what to do. I like him a lot.. And everything he said about the future and all made sense, but I want to feel like a normal person, I want you talk to him.. I want him to text me.. I want him to show he cares.... But he doesn't do all of this, and I can't say anything to that since I'm not his girlfriend and it's messed up
I just don't know what to do, it just hurts..

356,"Okay so we've been friends for three years now (met in highschool) and she has always been clingy but I can't stand it anymore. 

I was always more of an introvert, I like keeping things to myself, I need my alone time, I need at least a day to prepare mentally before going out, and basically I need space.

She was always a lot more open than me, likes to go out (not partying and stuff, just with friends), likes to talk and always seem to find a way to spend her days to the fullest. 

But even with those differences we still are best friends, I always enjoy her company and we're doing a lot of fun.

A little background to add, she really likes to call me and talk about nothing. When we were in school, she used to call me at least two more times during the day after we spent the whole day at school together. I didn't call, cuz I didn't feel like we have things to talk about after spending the whole day together, but I still answered her calls and talked with her. Me not calling was never a problem to her. 

So the thing is, now she expects me to call her everyday, since we don't meet (everyday) anymore because of the pandemic and the fact that school is over.

And okay, I get it, she wants to stay in touch. But she literally wants as to talk every single day, and if I don't call her she's making a scene. For example, today I didn't call her because just yesterday we hung out for like four hours so I thought we didn't have to talk today... apparently I was wrong and she just texted me saying ""ohhhh, okay then"". Which means she is mad at me for not calling.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I feel suffocated. I can't spend a day without worrying about upsetting her, and I just don't feel like talking to her anymore. It feels like a task rather than a thing I'm supposed to enjoy. I can't talk with her EVERYDAY. It makes me bored and it became something that I just want to be done with and not something I'm looking forward to.

I don't know how to tell her that I don't want to talk everyday, I know it will upset her and she'll be salty about it and it maybe even drive us apart. 

I know she doesn't sound very good but she is actually a great person and I love her very much, she is just so very clingy.

Can someone give me advice? How can I say it without upsetting her?

I stopped growing somewhere in my early high school years and its destroyed my mental health and self esteem since then. To put it into perspective, 5'2 is lower 1 percentile for male height in the US. Meaning that statically 99% of men I will encounter on any given basis will be taller than me. And believe me this is definitely the case. Bit it gets worse, I'm constantly getting dwarfed by woman as well. And to make it even worse, this new generation growing up, Gen Z is so tall that I encounter 11 year old who are my height or taller on a regular basis. Idk how I'm supposed to live a happy life when I'll constantly be seen as a child everywhere I go, hell I can't even grow a full beard to make things worse with my baby face. Height is an extremely important physical trait when it comes to being a man, it will garner you more respect from other men and more attraction from women.

My mother in law (MIL) and grandmother in law (GMIL) come to visit my husband and I once every 2 months or so, and stay 7 days each time. We moved 2100 miles away from them, which is why they stay so long. 

Anyway, I love these two. They’re my only family I have left (long story), and I like them coming to visit. But we’re very different people. 

They smoke. My husband doesn’t let them smoke in the house (though we left the house one time, came back early and found them smoking inside on the couches). So they go outside about once every half hour. I don’t want shoes on in the house. I have two small children who play on the floor, and I don’t want them exposed to those big germs just yet. Plus, I absolutely hate when hardwood floors feel gritty. 

I’m a very non confrontational person. So after I’ve asked them three times in one day to stop wearing shoes inside, I just want to crawl in bed and sleep because it’s emotionally exhausting. 

They always apologize and take their shoes off, but 30 minutes later they do it again. They don’t clean the house when they’re here either. Which is fine, but it makes things exhausting for me and my husband. 

Also, they’re always eating snacks. They leave their food absolutely EVERYWHERE. In the couch, on the side tables, on the floor, in between my books on my bookshelves (why????) and in windowsills. 

My house stays clean 24/7 even when I’m home with both the kids (husband is an over the road truck driver gone 10 days at a time AND I also work from home). But when they come over it’s not 6 hours and the house is completely trashed. 

Two other issues I have are with the TV, and their wastefulness. 

I rarely turn the TV on. Maybe 1 hour a week. And then, the volume is somewhere between 10 and 15. Sometimes 18 on really quiet shows. But they come over and it’s on constantly. They stay up til 5 am and get back up at 10am (I go to bed at 8:30 with the babies because I’m usually exhausted). It’s on the whole time they’re awake, and usually they don’t turn it off when they go to bed. And the volume is between 30 and 45. And the shows are very stressful, like Maury where there’s lots of yelling and cussing. We live in the mountains, literally surrounded by a National forest with no nearby neighbors and zero traffic. So this is a huge change for us. 

I’ve tried speaking with them about this but they just think I’m weird and quirky (I am but that’s beside the point) and don’t change their ways.

My last issue is all the waste. I live way out. It’s an hour and a half drive for groceries so I don’t want to be wasteful in the first place. And  second, i live in a beautiful place so I really do all I can to be eco-friendly. They think that’s hilarious. 

I use a reusable coffee filter. They buy keurigs with single use cups.

I have a glass I use to rinse my mouth after brushing. They buy Dixie cups.

I use our dishes and wash them after every meal. They buy paper plates and throw them away. 

I use cloth napkins, they buy and use paper towels.

I buy my kids long lasting, quiet wooden toys, they buy cheap plastic toys that make lots of noise. 

I buy biodegradable eco friendly detergent because I live on top of a mountain with 5 natural springs and people who live down the mountain from me and get all their water from the streams that flow off my property. They buy harsh detergents to use the week they’re here. Refuse to use what I have even though it cleans very well (I have two children in cloth diapers, I know what cleans well and what doesn’t). 

I’ve tried speaking to them about all these issues but they just laugh because I’m so quirky and keep doing it. I don’t know if they forget, don’t take me seriously, or just don’t care, but it’s exhausting. I always want them to fly out, but by day 2 I’m already exhausted by them. 

I try to confront them (my husband has too) even though I hate it and it doesn’t work. I feel a little trapped here. Thoughts?",25Sep2020,1

367,"Hey, so a couple of things first:  
I've been lingering around here for a while now, but this is my first actual post on reddit, also English isn't my native language, so this might read a bit shaky at some parts.

So first I think I need to give a brief explanation about me and my best friend (let's call him F).  
F and I met through an online dating app about 3 years ago, it was pretty obvious for the two of us that no romantic relationship would come out of this, but we became online acquaintances, we chatted regularly, I helped him with his school work (especially math) and that was it for the most part, during the first one to two month. Then I started to play League again and we had more regular contact as before, became pretty good friends, met in real life, etc. etc.  
He is 3 years younger (20) than me (23) and still in the equivalent of High-School, while I'm at my 5th semester of University.   
Reason for that is, because you got bullied in his old school and didn't go to school for a full year, before he was forced to by the government.  
When we started to talk with each other he opened up to me, told me about his problems, the ones he had at his old school, problems with his family and well, we talked about every issue he faced.  
We also noticed that we had quite a bit in common, we both had an abusive older sibling, who was unhappy with us being gay, parents who didn't stop our sibling because they didn't wanna get involved, we have an alcoholic parent. Through that we could relate to a lot of the issues the other one had and became best friends.  
I helped him to get out of the toxic friendship with his former best friend. F used to have a crush on him and by his own words ""N was the only person which actually made me think I'm in love"".

N was emotionally abusive, blackmailing F with things F told him, etc. and they had very frequent arguments, times where the completely ignored each other and blocked the other person on social media.

After F's bloom in the last two years, I could see him crumble more and more, becoming ""numb"", using his own terms.  
and then new year was when it all started to shake up.  
Pretty much at the same time when I met F I, also met my now boyfriend C, but because F was already depressed about not ever having a boyfriend in his life I kept it a secret for a while. And then never told him how long C and I were in a realtionship.  
All of this would be half bad, if not for one cruical detail in which I entirely fucked up.  
F sent me nudes of him after C and I already were in a relationship and I never deleted them. C found them by browsing through my phone and confronted me (but never F) about it and I kinda wishy-washy explained it.  
We are still together and this isn't that big a deal for him anymore. But on new years eve C confronted F, who to that point had no idea that C and I were in a relationship that long.  
F and I didn't had an argument about that, F rather gave him self the fault for not knowing what I didn't tell him and saying that he only causes problems.  
F and I talked a lot about how and why he felt like that over the next couple of days and there was the first thing F said that still kinda gets to me, because he never cleared that up, just kind of pretened he never said it. He told me that he shares ""great personalities"" around him, to make him feel better and that I have him around me, because I have a ""helper's complex"" (that I feel the urge/need to help others, in order to feel complete).  
For me it meant, that the last two years of our friendship were just kind of us using each other, not even really liking each other.  
He then told me later that ""he didn't mean it like THAT"" but it still bugs me.  
F decided that he needed some space from everyone, to focus on himself and his problems.  
I respected that, but I still wanted to be there for him somehow, so I sent him a package with little gifts, no gifts to buy his happieness. In the box were small things he liked, to help him relax, so just get a deep breath during all that stress. In there were a scented candle, lavander bathing salts, candy, etc. also a letter from me, explaining that I will give him the room he wants, but that even though he doesn't have company, that he is not alone.

Things got better, we were like before- and then Covid came. The isolation drove me nuts, I am a very very extrovert person, and not being able to socialise in person drove me insane and made my emotions go crazy.  
That was the first time he made me mad. When I was telling him that I felt bad and that I am going crazy without anything to do, his first advice was that I should get some sleep, because in his experience sleep helps. The next day we spoke about it again and he told me in summary, that he's sorry for me, but that there isn't anything he can do and that he can't understand me, because he isn't bored.

Things settled a bit again and some small incidents happened, nothing too crazy.  
A few months ago I finally convinced him to get a therapist, helped him chose one and since them he started to make BIG progess, but also distanced himself from me. Before I always was his first choice to tell me about his life. What he's feeling, worrieing about, etc. but now I never know how much distance lays between us. I don't know how he feels about me.

But when he felt uneasy and lonely, because noone close to him had time for him (I life 2h away with the train, so sponatous gatherings are kinda hard), I made him a little booklet with drawings and a text, telling him that sometimes he needs to let loose, just imagine being somewhere else and take a couple deep breaths, and spending the day with him, to show him that people to have time for him.

  
This got worse over time. Just 2 more incidents before I come to my question for advice:  
A bit back F, my sister and a friend of the three of us came over to my place, to have a few drinks, play some games, and so on. They wanted to play Just Dance, a game I really dislike. It's just not a game I enjoy, I tried playing it mutible times and yeah.. but when they asked me if they could play it, because they really wanted to, I said ""Yeah sure go ahead"" and sat in the corner the next 20 minutes, watching them play or looking at my phone. As soon as they were done they exclaimed that they defenitly wanted to play again. They now had inside jokes, focused around the dances and made call backs on some funny incidents during the game- and to non of that I was able to relate, because I didn't participate. But because I didn't want to be a party-pooper that is like ""NO! You can't do that thing that all of you enjoyed so much, because I don't like it"", I let them go again, because I already felt irrelevant and no longer part of the group. They played again and I sat on my couch, listening to music and browsing memes on my phone.  
The rest of the evening felt like Me+Three other people I'm not part of, it pulled me down and kinda ruined the fun of the evening for me. I told F that, not saying it was anyones fault but mine, but that over all I didn't really enjoy the evening- to which he reacted defensive, trying to shaking off guilt that wasn't even there to begin with. Telling me, that it's my fault and that I pretty much have no right to feel the way I do because of that.

Now the most recent thing that happened. Today. I am a person that values his family a lot, for me friends and family are the most important part of my life- but now my family is breaking down more than it's doing anyways, because my parents are getting a divorce. It's not really messy but fucked up- my mom stole over 5000€ and cheated on my dad and now my dad told her to start packing up her things and look for a new place to live. I wanted to talk about it with F, told him what dad told mom and asked him if he'd have time on sunday to listen to my worries, so that I could get it off my chest. His response was ""no, I have to study for my exams, especially because today and tomorrow are pretty packed with events and work"".  
And that got me. The last three years I dropped everything to help him with every issue and problem he had, went (in my eyes) above and beyond to help him feel better. But now he can't spare an hour to for me?  
I told him that I honestly thought that this was pretty shitty of him to which he then replied, that his therapist told him to focus on himself and that he was already stressed out from listening to the problems of two other friends of his.  
I rarely ask for help, I'm just a kind of person that prefers to try and manage his problems on his own and first seeks help when he's stuck. And getting turned down after asking my best friend for help feels... terrible.

But there are a couple of things racing through my mind.  
He has depression, not self diagnosed, he's in treatment for it and his therapist told him to distance himself from other peoples problems. On the other hand I never wanted him to go over my worries with me, I just wanted someone I trust to listen to it all. After all I've done to help him, he leaves me alone.   
Does this friendship still makes sense? And I know I also did mistakes and fucked up, but this just isn't ok, or am I in the wrong about expecting my best friend to be there for me when I actually need him once? Am I the ignorant bad guy?  
What should I do?

369,"I’m almost 2 months in to my new job. I work as a senior analyst.

The job that I had before was horrible. I got let go during COVID after failing my PIP - the main takeaway was that I had poor attention to detail. This mainly stemmed from a combination of fatigue, anxiety over past criticism, anxiety over working with confidential information and just the overall stress of working with such a bitchy boss. 

My new company has been great - boss is great so far, work has actually been going well, etc. I don’t have to deal with confidential information like my last job. 

But lately I’ve been feeling disappointed in myself:

1. Lately I’ve been making little errors here and there - and they are all related to a lack of attention to detail. Every time I find myself making an error, or when my boss points out something that I should’ve noticed, I get reminded of my last work place. And I keep making up scenarios where my new boss eventually sees me as how my old boss saw me: someone incompetent, someone who can’t pay attention to detail. I would hate to disappoint, especially since they kept making a point of how well I’m doing, how I’m leading this part of a big project, etc. 

2. I feel dumb after meetings. My boss would say things that he thinks that I know or should’ve known and then when he asks “you get me?” I would reiterate what he says and then he would either correct me or I would have to ask for clarification. I don’t want him to think I’m stupid. Or incompetent.

I’m trying hard to do well and impress everyone. You can say I’m atoning for my sins from last job. Lately I’ve been staying past work hours to continue my work and making sure I get things done in a timely manner. Recently I was told that doing these extra calculations for a report was optional and that I didn’t have to do it but I did them in a short period of time anyway (report was presented in a meeting) and later on I discovered a stupid error in one of the formulas. Pretty embarrassing sending an email to people letting them know about it...

I’ve been getting tired and I’m sure everyone else who stays late does too. I WFH so I don’t know for sure, but it seems like I’m the only person making these errors related to attention to detail. And my boss has said that this is something that is so important in the work that I do. 

Is this normal? What should I do to stop making these mistakes in the future??",25Sep2020,1

I am 22m and my partner is 21f

on 28th august in the evening, we were fooling around and we tried to have sex but then it didnt really happen ( that morning i had ejaculated once but i had showered, thoroughly cleaned and peed after that). I had penetrated a little bit but then both of us lost interest and we didnt do it.

I did not ejaculate anywhere near her and while i did ejaculate in the morning, i had peed and washed properly.

Now her periods are delayed by a week.

Could it be that she is pregnant?

One more thing is that whenever we have sex, the next time her cycle goes from the usual 30-33 days to 40-42 days. Could there be a correlation ?

373,"So a really good friend of mine moved to phoenix about 3 years ago.

Then randomly he started being really dry. I was being really nice and not clingy or needy, but he started acting so uninterested. This really crushed me because of how random it was.

So. I don't have a current DL, which is from an entirely different state. This is my first time registering to vote. And the next appointment isn't until FEB to get a new ID.

I love art but don't want to make it my career, besides that I have no idea and I don't have time to ""find myself"" as I'm already in my sophomore year and building up debt with every class while juggling my job with finding an apartment.

I called the hotline and let them know that I had to take an absence due to not being able to physically get up. However I tried logging into my account and I couldn’t, so I assumed I was canned (I am going to call HR though to see what happened). I’m at the beginning of my college career and I’m doing something completely different from retail in college (and I plan to do internships). Is me getting canned from a job that only lasted a couple days going to affect my job search relating to my major (not going into retail at all)? Should I and is it required of me to let future employers know? If they do ask, should I say I was canned because I couldn’t do the physical demands?

395,"So, I go to a small college which has less than 10,000 people. At this college, there are quite a few students that cheat a lot, and many students cheat sometimes. The atmosphere of the students kinda suggests that if you tell a teacher about cheating then you will be called a snitch and basically ""socially expelled"" from the school. I never felt the pressure to tell until now, because I haven't heard about the administration expelling anyone for cheating until last week. A rumor has been spreading that people were sharing answers in a group chat and then were expelled for cheating. In the group chat for one of my classes people literally share answers all the time. I don't want to be a snitch and get them in trouble, but I don't want to get in trouble for being in the group chat. I don't think that I want to leave the group chat either because they say useful things sometimes, like reminding each other of due dates.  I never used the things that they sent; I like doing my own work. Do you think I could get in trouble for being in the group chat/not reporting them?",25Sep2020,1

I dont have a solid portfolio because I never know what I want to paint and Why i want to paint it. I have too many ideas of what could be a cool painting, I like a lot of different art stlyes to just focus on one, and my interests expand for days so having a solid subject matter, theme, style, etc. is still a foreign concept to me. 

The only sure thing I know about my work is my love for using the color red. Not in a violent or lustful way, but as a comfort and because to me it says life.

The medication Im taking for it is an antidepressant or something I think but it makes me like really mad when I take it so hopefully I can get it changed. 

I’ve been trying a lot of just natural things to not do it as much and I’m down to like three or four accidents a week at night and maybe one or two during the day. it was almost every night before I started trying stuff on my own. 
I got in a huge argument with my mom the other day though because I Hate! Wearing pullups omfg. If I’m down to a few accidents a week I feel like I shouldn’t have to wear them all the time? If it’s not happening more than it happens it just doesn’t make sense to me? 

But she’s talking about like if it only happened once a month it would be okay to not wear them. I can’t even imagine doing it that little tbh. She’s crazy! How often would a normal person say is okay to not have to wear them? 

And do you guys thinks it’s legal to like not be allowed to wear anything over them at night?? Because I have to get ready for bed around 7 but most of the time I don’t even lay down until like midnight because my adhd meds.... so thats a long time to not be wearing clothes just to make laundry a little easier right? 
I kinda feel like she’s just trying to make it embarrassing tbh. But idk if that’s how it’s supposed to be or not? 

I was really close to not having to deal with that but last weekend we stayed the night at my moms friends house, I was wearing sweatpants and lied about having one on under them which would have been fine and all but I fell asleep on one of their new couches and freaking peed all over it. But my mom actually got mad about it though and it sucked for me because I had to clean it in front of her and her friend and her friends kid IN NOTHING BUT A PULLUP because my clothes were soaked so she made me put one on and I was crying so it was just a mess. Plus she had to add that her friends kid was 10 and he wouldn’t have even done that...Thanks mom. 

So I’m pretty sure half the reason for not wearing anything over them is because she just wants to see it and that makes me even more mad.Sry for venting): but can I report her for this??

408,"My (14f) mother died when i was 10... now its just me , my sister (24) , brother (26) and my dad

It feels to me as both my siblings and my father are not concerned about me as the child and expect me to behave as the adult in every argument we’ve ever had 

My sister is controlling, throws orders around and doesnt have any valid argument for most situations... paired with the occasional physical encounter ( hasnt happend for a while but it has ranged from pulling of hair to ripping of shirts) 

My brother makes me feel very unsafe... he used to be my closest and most trusted adult but the more tike ive spent recently seen him as narcissistic, childlike and a gaslighter. He sees himself as the messiah of my family and he can never do any wrong. He’ll constantly lie about what hes said in the past and make it seem like i just am lying... we got into argument with my dad present and after hearing the conversation my dad concluded i was in the right, however after me being sent upstairs and half a hour of what i see as gaslighting, my dad decided he heard the events wrong and my brother was in the right. He doesnt value anyones opinion. I could go on about him for days but he’ll never leave me alone when i ask him to, berates me as disrespectful, fat, victim ( all things i confided to him i was vulnerable about) 

My father is just there... i feel guilty because i love him so much but i feel like im not his priority being his only non adult child left... he had said right after my mothers funeral that he was going to leave me to go to our home county when i turned 16

Ive told my aunts about the physical abuse when it happened but nothing changed,my siblings got slaps on the wrist whilst i still am traumatised by the abuse ive received, although sometimes i think im dramatising it. And another common thread thats said is that im a moody teenager with no respect, granted this is only my perspective but i think as the only child in any of these relationships i shouldnt have to be the adult in them and not want to defend myself... i dont know what to do with any of these feelings

I met bri through my buddy who was trying to hook up with bri’s best friend. We met them at a bonfire, they hung out with an old group I used to. But then it just became us four, and me and bri really hit it off. We were texting constantly and when we all hung out she would flirt heavily, and it was great. So I found out I liked her and took advice from her best friend to just “be more direct” so I did, and told her my feelings. The next day, she was good as gone. Texting me once a day, and often just not even saying anything, just a blank pic. And whenever her friend would ask me to buy her alcohol (cause I have a fake id) bri would long even tag along like she did. So after 2 weeks of this I just asked her what was up, she basically told me I moved to fast and that I need time out of my first relationship. And I understood that. But.. your boy here is a musican. So I wrote a song about the whole situation, and when I posted it she came back to me faster than a damn bullet. She said she was flattered about the song and how I didn’t mess anything up.It’s been a month and we’re talking more frequently than we did before. And today we hung out solo for the first time, it was great. The chemistry was smooth and relaxed and we laughed and had a good time. But then I saw she was texting several other guys (one being my enemy, and she knows I hate this kid) but she is lightly flirting with all these guys. Is that normal? To like a guy but still flirt? I’m sorry for my ignorance but I am new to actual love, for the girl I dated before I didn’t love. But after we hung out she asked for alcohol. I hope I’m not getting used for my fake id.

421,"Names are obviously changed for privacy and this is a long post.

My friend group is good, and continues to get better. I enjoy their company and I always thought they enjoyed mine. For context, we are all in our mid 20’s. A recent event has made me question everything.

Unfortunately, a bit of backstory is needed. 

This weekend is my 25th birthday and we are all hanging out for it. Kayaking, sushi, fun stuff! 

I invited this girl “Alpha,” who has sort of hung out with them in the past, but not consistently like myself. I invited Alpha because I like her company. I first cleared it with all of my friends, just to be sure it would be ok, because they don’t hang out with her often. She just went on a run with my friend “Kilo,” just yesterday because I suggested it. 

Apparently, they had this big conversation during their run where Alpha said that Kilo told her “that that our friend group doesn’t enjoy her and cannot handle her energy.” That’s just the gist, apparently it is was a heartfelt and respectful conversation. However, It is true that Alpha does have a big personality and often shares too much but that’s something I appreciate about her. She is a lot of woman, and I definitely like that. 

Now Alpha is not coming to the weekend’s events. 

Her issue with Kilo and our other friends is that they have extremely surface level conversations, and overall just low impact. I personally think that maybe it’s just too hard for them because Alpha tends to dump her emotions for everyone to see. That being said, it’s not hard to set boundaries so people don’t emotionally overload you. 

Kilo reached out to me today and gave the cliffnotes of her perspective etc. I see her side, but I don’t agree completely with her and have no trouble telling her. It’s hard to say exactly what happened between them, girls are from Venus. 

Anyways, this has made me think a lot about relationships. I definitely enjoy hanging with them, and I like their personalities. The one thing that has been lacking depth of conversation. I’ve known these people for between 1-2 years. I rarely feel “connected” to them, like I do with Alpha. 

It hasn’t really bothered me too much in terms of lack of depth with them, because I think I’m able regulate my feelings in a healthy way. I rarely feel the need to spill my emotions. We do have some deep conversations, but they often aren’t personal, and just abstract topics. I think the best way to describe it is that I don’t feel like I know my friends that well, especially after all this hulubaloo. However, I also like surface level conversations about sports, dogs, or other random shit. 

Also, I have other friends and family that I can talk about heavy shit with, including Alpha. Alpha and I have been able to handle each other’s emotions with ease from day 1. I also have a really close friend, “Jay” who is like my brother. He just lives a few hours away currently.

Here is a summation of my feelings: 

It makes me furious that they don’t want to hang out with Alpha, because they REALLY hurt her.
I feel bad because I think I was sort of the catalyst for all of this.
I respect Kilo and others for being honest. 
I’m just so bewildered that they don’t have to capacity to understand and handle Alpha’s tendencies to break out the emotional dump truck.
I think that Alpha should have the understanding that she probably shouldn’t completely overwhelm every person she meets with her emotional “baggage.”
I also feel validated, good, and confident that I can “handle” whatever Alpha throws at me and makes me wonder if we should be together (I feel 100% fulfilled playing Superman, and I’m REALLY good at it.) 
I want emotional depth, but I also like silly banter.
I think different friends can serve different purposes.
I’m afraid that they think the same about me, but just tolerate me because they don’t think I could handle the truth or some shit (imposter syndrome).
I’m afraid that this is going to make me an outcast amongst my friends. 

Does anyone see a problem with any of this or am I just completely crazy and stressed over nothing? Any advice to give?

TL;DR I (24M) find myself in an awkward place amongst my friend group, and it is making me question how close or how well I know my friends.",25Sep2020,1

425,"Let me be clear. I am in a really tricky situation. I know that at the end of the day, someone will be mad at me. 

The first event is a bowling tournament. I am a college sophomore at my local community college and we have a decent bowling team. If we make it far enough, we can make it to sectionals. Sectionals is a big deal because it is when all the bowling teams across the country (who make it to sectionals) compete against each other at four different locations to try to make it to Nationals. Last year, my team made sectionals and I believe we can do it again. Since it is a community college, this will be my last year bowling with everyone on my team. This will also be my first year bowling sectionals since last year it got canceled due to covid.

The second event is one of my good friend's wedding. She has asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding and I am completely honored. 

The wedding and the first day of Sectionals is on the exact same day. Sectionals is normally three days, with the first day being individuals and the second and third day being a team event. If I go to the wedding, I would only miss the first day of team sectionals. 

I am very conflicted on what to do. I don't want to let my team down but I also don't want to let my friend down. I didn't realize Sectionals was the same weekend as her wedding otherwise I would have expressed that to her. 

I am leaning more now towards going to her wedding but I still have my doubts about sectionals. People from my team have straight up told me they will be extremely mad at me if I skip out on the team to go to the wedding. It irritates me when they say this because it just adds more stress to the situation.

What would you do? Am I being a bad friend or a bad teammate? Either way someone will be mad at me.",25Sep2020,1

A few things about him:
He’s not an academic.  He’s smart, but couldn’t care less about traditional academics. His GPA is fine.  He’s a really good hacker.  He’s also great with computers, systems, programming, etc., in general.
He has a gift in dealing with people.  He’s a hard worker, and he’s very likable.  He has a job, and because of COVID he’s able to work days and do online schooling in the evening.  He’s almost working full time while still attending public high school.  We are allowing him to work a lot as long as his grades stay at B or higher.
He’s not interested in the military right now, but that was one of his prior options.  
I’m really worried he will blow off college or any secondary education if he doesn’t find his niche soon.

430,"My dad is really fat and gassy, and he farts all the time. He even does it on purpose, and he seems very proud about it. When someone asks him to stop, he's like ""gee I'm just getting rid of some gas"", and then he continues walking around farting. He often suddenly stops, opens up his legs, and toots out a colossal rip. It's so loud and disgusting, and it smells terrible. I don't even know how some people can manage to do that 2000 times a day.

It's so embarrassing when he does that. Once we were at a restaurant and my dad already had several bottles of beer plus several slices of pizza. And then he just released a loud fart that echoed everywhere. Everyone just stared at him and got very angry about it. Another time we were at the gym. My dad was in the swimming pool, and he let out a giant fart. Everyone was so disgusted they just left the swimming pool, while my dad didn't seem bothered at all.

At home, he farts all the time. He farts really loud in the bathroom. He also drinks milk straight from the milk carton, and he lets out a giant fart after he drinks the milk. Sometimes, he purposely does that to make people angry. He carries a milk jug with him literally everywhere, and he drinks right out of it when he's around other people. And then, of course, he has to fart like 40 times.

His farts are so stinky that even his underwear smell horrible. When he takes off his underwear and throws it in the laundry bin, they always smell so gross. He farts non-stop when he's on the sofa, and every 2 days we have to buy a new sofa. I don't even know what to do about this.",25Sep2020,1
431,"Hi all, 

My boyfriend made the big decision of quitting his stable job to start working to build a new brand of his own and I want to help make his work space a bit more comfortable.  He’s been pretty nervous about leaving behind the stability, but seeing him in that state makes me want to help him out as much as possible. He’s usually at his pc on the daily (for gaming and work), but will be working at his computer even more now to work on his new project. He currently uses a no-brand, slightly worn office hair (has no support, nor arm rests) so I looked into getting him a new chair—but we both think gaming chairs are scams... when I checked out the Ergochair 2, reviews were saying that it wasn’t as comfortable as they say and isn’t comfortable at all to sit in for long hours. 

Any advice in what to purchase to make his desk area more comfortable? Open to any advices (can be chair options or anything else in general that would elevate his mood!) 

Cheers!",25Sep2020,1

435,"Hey there. So recently my best friend and I started a new school together. We are trying our best to keep close to each other but we do different subjects so it’s kinda hard since we’re making friends in different groups, but we do still have lunch together every day. Anyways so she has made some new friends, who we had lunch with today, and it was really akward for me because none of them really spoke to me or anything and I felt like a scrape, I think people think I’m just tagging along with my best friend. But then she told me today that they invited her to hang out with them after school next week and she really wants me to come as well because she doesn’t want to go without me. The problem is I was never invited so if I go it would be really akward and I would be scraping, which just makes me look bad. So I don’t know what to do. Do I go? I would kinda like to go to get to know them better but I know they don’t really want me there because I was never invited. What do I do because she really wants me to go!

437,"Many people are jealous of my life. I have a nice house in a nice neighborhood, a nice car, a great job, an amazing intelligent 10 year old daughter, a puppy, and a wife who loves me. That’s the “me” that they see, but almost no one sees that I am dying inside and I just want it all to be over. I’m not suicidal, but if a doctor told me I have a week to live I would be sad for my daughter, but there would also be a huge sigh of relief deep down inside. And all of this is my fault. 

I’ll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. I’m an army veteran of the Iraq war. While I was in the army my HS girlfriend whom I was deeply in love with broke up with me and it broke my heart. In Iraq I lost close friends to a combination of accidents, enemy fire, and suicide. When I got home I found out my girlfriend had slept with or fooled around with literally every friend I had at home. It really messed me up and I never wanted to fall in love again. I went to college and met my wife online. She fell in love with me pretty quickly. I cared for her but I was honestly never in love with her. She had a great job and owned her own house. She seemed super responsible and I felt like a great friend to her. It seemed to be a good arrangement. I wanted a marriage that was a partnership and didn’t want to be the breadwinner. I wanted to share income and home responsibilities. So after being pressured I agreed to marry her. I do believe she has always truly loved me. But she turned out to be way more controlling, insecure, and deceitful than I ever thought possible. She fought to keep me away from our finances because she acted like I was too irresponsible to handle it. I couldn’t even check the mail without It turning into a huge fight. I should have seen the red flag, but I didn’t want to deal with the fighting so I let it slide. 

So, like people do we had a baby. After our daughter was born my wife was laid off from her job. She made really good money and we had a house and a car payment and a new baby who had very expensive health problems (long story). I had finished college and got a low paying job in my area of study and I had to work absurd amounts of OT just to keep a roof over our heads. She didn’t want to go back to work so I had to work as many hours as possible. One day I got a letter saying our home was going to be in foreclosure if we didn’t pay missed bills. Apparently she just stopped paying our bills and didn’t tell me. I also discovered that she had credit cards I didn’t know about and had racked up many thousands of dollars in debt and just stopped paying it. There were many cases I discovered of hidden debt and hidden money and I won’t go into all of it. I threatened divorce unless she gave me control of the finances, which she agreed too. 

She eventually got a low paying easy desk job at home, but now wants to quit so she can work part time. My career has grown into a successful career in my field. I have great pay and benefits and we can live comfortably. Our daughter has grown into this amazing child and my entire heart and world revolves around making her happy. But I am dying inside. 

I’m so depressed. My anxiety is so high I can barely sleep. I have nightmares where I wake up screaming. My jaw hurts from grinding my teeth. I see a psychiatrist and am on enough pills that I get full from taking them. I lay next to this person at night who seems to truly love me, if not in a borderline abusive way. She’s a good mom in a lot of ways, but also mentally abusive in others. 

I want to run away so bad it almost brings me to tears. I rarely get to see my friends because they hate my wife and she always wants to come along when we hang out. I’m afraid to leave because we’ll all lose everything. She’ll be in poverty and will most likely win custody because that’s how it works. I can’t imagine going so many days without seeing my daughter. She’s “daddy’s girl” and loves me so much and hates being alone with her mom. I won’t be there to protect her when her mom is yelling at her and her standard of living will plummet when our finances are split. I know I’ll have to pay her mom a lot in child support and alimony, but I still worry about the environment she’ll be in when she’s not with me. 

This is all my fault though. I chose practicality over love. It was safe. Someone I didn’t love couldn’t hurt me I thought. Well, here I am. I don’t know what to do.  I want to stay so my daughter has a more stable life, but I want to leave and live the life I want so I can be the man and the dad that I want to be. It feels like there’s no right answer. I’m lost and miserable and I don’t see a way out. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation? How do you know what the right thing to do is? How can I see the forest from the trees when I’m so buried in despair?
There’s so much conflicting legal, financial, and relationship advice out there that I don’t even know where to start. 

If anyone has any experience here and has come out the other side with a new perspective I would love to hear from you.

439,"This is long and im on a phone. I apologize for any misspelling or grammar issues. I also apologize for the length of it, but I feel its important for the story im about to tell. Lets begin:

I am a 32F. I am married with 2 kids. I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. Im the middle child. As my siblings and I got older, our mother has done some things to my 2 older siblings, that has made 1 of them cut her out completely of their life. Now I'm not there yet, but I feel like I'm on that path.

When i was pregnant with my son, i told my mom what i will name him (I'm just going to use ABC for this). I tell her and she says ""A?! Why A? I like B better. Ill just call him B"". I tell her ""No. You will call him A. If he likes B better when he gets older, you can call him that, but for now you will call him A.""

The day came and she barges into the delivery room several times thinking her third grandchild is here. I just about had to tell my husband to kick her out and block her from coming in. Well he comes and she falls head over heels for him. She suddenly has no problem calling him A. 

As hes growing, my mom is showing favoritism towards him and this (plus a whole LOT of other crap) led one of my siblings to cut her out. When my son was 2, I would let my mom have him over for the weekend every other weekend. She gets to bond with him and my husband and I get some quiet time.

After our daughter was born, we moved 3 states away. It was a 16 hour drive there. Exhausting doesnt even begin to explain that journey lol. My mother did not like that we were several states away and kept begging me to let me bring my son over for the summer. I told her hes too young for that and i dont feel comfortable with it. She keeps begging.

When my son was 8, i said fine. I met up with her half way and she took him back to her place. He had a great time and got spoiled by her, my sisters and my moms side of the family. Everything went great.

Next year rolls around and we decide to do it again. My mom works at cleaners, and she asked if he could go with her there and I said as long you can keep an eye on him and hes safe, thats fine. Well he goes and its fine. Then my mom asks me if she could have (well call her DT for Dumb Teenager). She asks if DT could watch him. She tells me how DT babysits for all my aunts and uncles and is a close family friend. So i say ok. My mom has to be up early for work, so DT as to be up for this. DT is aware of this. She comes and it seems everything is fine. Until i find out DT has been giving my son melatonin, so he could stay asleep and she can get more sleep and take a shower. I was pissed! I told my mom I do not want DT watching my son again. She doesnt think its that big of a deal but agrees. So she gets my cousin to do it and she does an amazing job.

After that incident i told my mom, only family can watch my son. She says fine. A few months after I get A back, my mom tells me how she bought DT new pair of shoes and a new bra. I ask why and she said shes like family so why not. I personally wouldnt  even let her in my sight, but thats me.

Another year later, my daughter is 8 and has been wanting to go since i first let A go. My mom would love to have her too and see the new place shes living in. This new place is her boyfriend's place (my parents have been divorced since I was 10). I was VERY hesitant about letting them go cause this guy i have never met. My mom tells me how hes divorced too. Has grown kids and even some grandchildren. He has a great job and the house is amazing. Doesn't mean much to me. I ask her if shes going to watch them like a mama bear and she said ""Always!"" I let them go. She was excited and so was the rest of the family. Everybody was making plans to see them.

They get there and the new BF has been amazing towards my kids. He shows A how to work on cars and shows him how to build a clock. He even takes them all out to see a battleship from WW2. He makes sure they have everything they need and they always feel safe. So i appreciate him for doing that. 

At this place is also some neighborhood kids that my kids became friends with. To say they were having a good time is an understatement. Im talking to A one night and he proceeds to tell me how one neighborhood mom is going to watch them while my mom is at work. My mom never told me about this nor did she ask. He hands the phone to my mom and i ask her about it. She tells me how (NL= neighbor lady) is such an amazing woman and her kids are good friends with my kids, and how my kids would have so more fun there then going to work with her. I tell her i dont feel comfortable with this, and i would rather they either stay with her or have a family member watch them (they all live really close, so its not like 4 hours away. More like 30 minutes). She tells me they'll be fine. I ask her when she was planning on asking me and she said after she talked to NL. I repeated no. She tries to convince me and i still said no. She then says ""Well i didnt know I needed PerMiSsIOn"" and hangs up the phone.

She then starts texting me how they'll go with her to work, but how i have hurt her feelings. Like how i dont trust her judgement. I tried telling her they are my kids, not hers. We continued to have a fight and i told her if this is going to be a problem, i will come get them. She says its not a problem. Why dont you trust my judgment? Dont you think their having a good time? Dont take them away from that. I thought about how my sisters havent had them over yet and one of them was planning on a big trip with them. They were having a good time, its just my mom fighting with me over something she feels shes right about.

I let them stay and they had a great time. They came back and had nothing but amazing things to say about their summer. My mom noticed how i wasnt as close as i was with her and i told her i didnt like how she fought with me over my kids. Those are my kids. Not hers. I have more authority when it comes to them. She continues to fight with me over it and tells me how she has lost all respect for me. I bawl my eyes out. She gets my little sister involved and my sister tells me i should let it go and mom says crazy stuff. That it never happened. They went with her to work, so why should i be upset. It never happened.

Im upset because my mom felt she had the right and has more say when it comes to my kids. Am i overreacting? Should i just let it go?",25Sep2020,1
440,Every day I walk home from school I think what my life has come to and I'm angry at myself that I haven't achieved anything great. I don't have friends. Ever Friday night my parents go to parties and I'm just there alone in the house. No one to talk to. My class mates smokes weed and get waisted every weekend and I'm not interested into doing the wrong stuff. I think it my parents fault I'm like this because they don't let me go out and be my self. Everyday I have to pretend that I'm someone that I'm not and it makes me sad when I think about it.

441,"A few weeks ago I adopted a 5 year old dog from the humane society. I like older dogs, because they are normally more independent, already potty trained, and don't require intensive training like puppies do. This dog isn't like that at all. He follows me around everywhere. I try doing a good amount of training with him in order to instill some confidence, but he clearly has a lot of separation anxiety.  I have to crate him when I leave for work, which is only 4 days a week, but he has broken through every single crate I have gotten for him. I can't leave him alone for more than 10 minutes without him dragging things off the counter or chewing on door frames and scratching at doors to get out. He is a strong guy, so he does damage. I rent an apartment, and I really don't want him to continue damaging the place. On top of that he drinks a ton of water, and he can't hold it while I'm at work for 8 hours. The stress actually sent me into a anxiety attack, and I had to call some friends in order to calm down. I've bought him toys to try and play with him to wear him out, but he doesn't want to play. Because of the property damage, I have a hard time liking this dog, which I feel bad about, because he's a sweetheart, but I just can't love something that causes me so much anxiety. The humane society has a policy that I can return him within the month if it doesn't work out.  I don't want to seem like I'm giving up, but he's really just not what I want in a dog, and I think he'd be happier with someone else. Someone that could love him better or maybe has a yard for him. If I gave him back, I know it would be like an instant shot of relief, but the feeling of giving up is really upsetting to me as well. I have a week left to figure out what to do.",25Sep2020,1

443,"I’m so sorry if the format is weird, and if there are any typos and/or grammar mistakes. I’m very frazzled right now and can’t really focus.

A little backstory, my parents have been divorced since I was like 3 years old, and my dad lives on the other side of town. It wasn’t a peaceful divorce by any chance, my parents HATE each other, and I have to deal with them constantly fighting. (Not physically, it’s more like my dad keeps telling me how much of a bitch my mom is, and accusing her of breaking into his house and stealing things/moving things around, while my mom tells me that my dad is an idiot and just sits around all day watching TV). I won’t get too personal, but for the most part, I’m on my moms side. My dad never had a job, which is one of the main reasons why my mom divorced him, and he does just sit around watching movies, living off the money my mom is forced to pay him every month because of the divorce. My mom is a doctor, which is good because she does make a lot of money, but she has to support 4 children + 1 ex husband (she pays for my siblings rents/food/cars/etc). So while other doctors in my area are loaded with big houses and nice cars, my mom works day and night just to make enough money to live by, we can’t even afford to fix/buy a new car to replace to small, decade old one we have now. And, because of some stupid advice from our realtor, we sold our house and was unable to find a new one before the new owners moved in. So for the last 2 years, we’ve been bouncing around from one rental to the next (in 2019, I lived in 4 different houses, and there was 1 summer where my mom + my 3 dogs literally lived in the RV)

Both my parents have their issues when it comes to living conditions. My dad’s house is very messy and cluttered (I think he’s a borderline hoarder because there’s junk everywhere, even taking up space in my room), my moms house is also very messy because we have 3 dogs with us and my mom has a habit of leaving food out. There’s lots of cobwebs around and overall just not a clean house. Just in the last 3 days, I found FIVE spiders literally in my bed, that was really the final straw for me and what made me write this post.

I live full time with my mom, and have for the past 17 years of my life, but I’m really starting to reach my limits. There are lots of nights where I am literally in tears because I just can’t take any of this anymore (I do struggle with anxiety and depression, and have been suicidal in the past, so it’s very hard for me to handle these kinds of feelings). I want nothing more than to move out like my older siblings, and I fantasize about what my future apartment will look like. But there are so many things standing in my way. I can’t drive yet, I’m too anxious to take the test. And it’ll take me months to actually find a decent place anyway. I also feel like it’s a big step to just take on a whim like this, I feel so unprepared yet so so ready to finally live on my own.

I don’t have any friends to stay with, and staying with my dad is just as bad, maybe even worse. I’m stuck living with my mom but I just can’t take it anymore.

I hope I included enough information for someone to really understand the situation I’m in. I feel like there are dozens of things I need to share, but that would probably make this post too long. This was really the gist of everything. I don’t really know what specific type of advice I’m looking for in this situation, but I just need someone to tell me what to do or help me figure out what my options are.",25Sep2020,1
444,"I've recently come to the conclusion that I have dependence problems. I'm unable to do a variety of simple things on my own, or elect not to, as I feel they are too cumbersome. It's causing a very big problem in a friendship of mine, where I'm turning into a possessive friend who wants to turn her entire life around me. It's dangerous and disgusting, and I want to stop it, but I don't know what to do.

Context on my friend, we met a month ago on a video game, and have shared some very personal and unfortunate parts of our past. We've come to have this relationship akin to siblings, where we try our best to help one another when we are struggling. I've realized that I'm becoming rapidly possessive over her, from wanting her to spend time exclusively with me, to becoming upset when I see her spending time with her other friends. This is wrong, and I am fully aware of it, but I can't seem to get rid of this feeling. I imagine this possessive feeling comes from the fact that I sort of see her as an outlet of my personal grievances, and I don't want to lose that. 

My parents were historically very overprotective of me, which I imagine is a big reason why I'm unable to do these things on my own. I'd like advise on both not be possessive, and how to become more independent, especially in terms of working with feelings, as I heavily struggle in dealing with my emotions",25Sep2020,1

447,"I'm 21 and the president of a policy making body at my college. A positive covid case was detected on campus yesterday, but due to privacy reasons, no one knows who it was. What we do know is that they were isolated immediately and their close contacts are under quarantine while waiting on test results. The most we can do is hope for the best, since we have to defer to the health department on how we handle covid policy (and rightly so.)

One of our organization's members lived in the same house as the positive case and is under quarantine. She is extremely stressed about the situation but has not divulged details of which of her housemates has covid. I don't blame her for wanting to keep it private. However, the secretary of the organization is needling me to find out who it is, saying it's irresponsible if I don't our members.

I shut down the conversation quickly saying it was already stigmatized and this person is probably miserable and embarrassed, so I don't want to out them. It sounds like the health department has it under control. Also, I am not a public health expert, but feel if we shame this person who could have gotten covid even if acting responsibly through work, grocery shopping etc. it will cause other people to underreport symptoms or not get tested.

I'm not asking for medical advice since even the best experts still have plenty more to understand. I guess I'm more worried about how to handle things with the secretary, since I'm sure she's angry and talking shit about me. Is this something I should bring up with her, report to my supervisor, or just let it be?

There was also a puddle of water in the hallway of my apartment, but water is not dripping from the ceiling anymore (I’m not sure where the puddle came from, but I’m assuming it’s from the ceiling). Obviously there is probably a leak somewhere. Unless the upstairs people are constantly running water for some reason, but that wouldn’t really explain the puddle. At first, I thought they just got a really loud fish tank or something, but again there was a puddle. I guess it’s possible that the running water noise and the puddle don’t have anything to do with each other, but that seems unlikely. It could be their toilet or something. 

Really my only options are telling my landlord about it or not telling my landlord about it... unless there is something I can do myself. Is there something I can do myself? I don’t really want to tell my landlord, especially if it has something to do with the people upstairs. The noise doesn’t really bother me much, it’s just very annoying after a while.

I am a 16 year old male who’s currently living with my single mother and in the final year of high school. I didn’t have many friends growing up. Actually, most of my classmates are up against me coz I’m a weird kind of a student. I came to 11th grade(for 15-16yrs old) where the class strength is really low(10 people with 4 boys including me and 6 girls) and we along really well to the point of being best friends with each other.

Well, here’s the problem. I was in 12th(for 16-17yrs old) when this lockdown started. Our class exchanged mobile numbers pre-covid. We all are in whatsapp where we can see each other status(like stories on Instagram). During this lockdown, I saw my classmates’ statuses and a weird feeling started to arise. See, they had status which featured either their family reunions or playing together as family. I have some strange thing going inside my brain when I see those. My brain has visions like I was torturing or murdering them in cold blood. Although the thoughts aren’t enough to drive me insane, it is still bothering me. Either in dreams or flashes of visions. Once I found myself taking screenshots of the statuses and I immediately overcame it and deleted all the screenshots. These visions often accompany a wave of emotions like sadness, loneliness, rage, and of course, the intent of murdering becomes higher when I go through sadness or rage and at one point of time, it nearly got out of hand.

For example, there was a status of my classmate where she took a photo along with her huge family and I had vision of murdering every single one of them, then a wave of sadness and loneliness overtook and I was weeping silently(I didn't want to bother my mom over this because she has her own tensions related to her job)

456,"Hi, I posted a while ago on here about a different topic, that did not work out. So, I had a question on another topic.

Background-

I will refer to this girl as Hannah, not her real name. I dated Hannah back in high school (junior to senior year). We dated for roughly a year and two months. Towards the end of the senior year she had broken things off with me. It was not a bad breakup. From my perspective it was pretty civil break up for the **most part**. Although, I was heartbroken just like any normal person would be with their first relationship.  Over time I picked myself back up and got over her.

Recent events (roughly 2 years from initial break up)-

Over the summer of 2020 we found each other again, and started talking over text. I was over her, but I had an inkling of an interest to explore what was happening. We both wanted to meet up and grave some coffee and catch up. However, I told her I would when college starts back up, August, as I was busy and was focusing on trying to get a medical scribe job and plethora of other things at the moment and did not want to get distracted. So, college has now started back up I texted her again basically saying lets meet up following up with our original conversation and she was on board. Although, she was now busy as-well with her classes, I did not name a date to meet up, but she said she would text me when she was free. We continued to talk over text and catch up.

Now-

It has been roughly three weeks. I guess my initial inkling of interest has turned into something more as I would not be writing all this out. My question is, should I text her asking and naming a date we could possibly meet up. I also just want an outside opinion, I may take it I may not, really just wanted a strangers opinion so I could judge weather or not to not waste my time.",25Sep2020,1

459,"hey.

&amp;#x200B;

i want to change myself but can't let go of who i am.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm quiet, cynical, sarcastic and stoic.

&amp;#x200B;

ideally, i'd want to still remain the same, it's not like i can completely change my personality, but become more... sophisticated? i can't express myself well.

&amp;#x200B;

when i think of who i want to be i think of someone who is quiet, a little less openly sarcastic and cynical, and stoic, yet with an air of elegance around them. someone more... feminine? that doesn't sound right. i'm a girl just not very... girly. the type of person who dines alone at fancy paris resturaunts during the night? someone who is openly a lot more sentimental, someone who appreciates stuff like how beautiful the architecture in the city is. it's not like i'm a poser or anything, i think like that now. i just don't express myself in that way, and cover it up with my nature.

&amp;#x200B;

it's like i want to retain how i am yet slightly change to fit what'd make me feel more confident. let's face it: being a an apathetic loner isn't cool. however, being an apathetic loner who can appreciate the arts with an air of mystery and grace to them is.

466,"So I made a new friend on Hinge. Let’s call him Luke. He and I have been hanging out on a weekly basis and we have even written songs together. I remember after one time we hung, I told him that I had an urge to hold his hand while we taking a walk. However, he told me: “Look I think you’re great and tbh, if you had held my hand I probably would have let you. But I am a recovering alcoholic and I don’t think I’m ready for a full-on relationship. I still have urges to hit the bottle and I would hate to put anyone through hell if I relapsed, especially you.”  

We then carried on hanging out after that like normal. 

And the more I interact with him.....it’s like damn! This guy is a literal angel and he literally checks off all my boxes in terms of what I am looking for in a guy.

A part of me wanted to send him a message that says this: “Look I remember you said you’re not ready for a full-on relationship rn and that’s okay. But I am still curious about one thing. Do you think there is a chance of our friendship developing into something more after you take care of everything that you want to take care of.”

A part of me wanted to ask this to see if I would be wasting my time waiting for him. But then I stopped myself because I feel like I would overstepping boundaries by doing that. And plus....he doesn’t need any further complications with his recovery. After all, he said he had friends with benefits before and then ended the relationship as soon as the other party wanted to get serious because he couldn’t handle the complications of sleeping with someone who had serious feelings for him when he didn’t or just simply wasn’t ready to settle down. So a part of me thinks I would be ruining a great friendship if I asked him something like that. 

And I also don’t know if I would be wasting my time trying to meet other guys because I still can’t stop thinking about Luke and want to be with him. And tbh, I am not sure if I will find a man who compares to him. 

And another thing....if Luke found out that I am talking to other guys, he might think I only see him as a friend, think he has no chance with me, and thus not bother pursuing me.

But I am not sure if I would just be holding out for false hope here.

470,"I just wish friendships could stay platonic. I'm a super tomboyey girl because I grew up being influenced by my older brother so I get along with guys more than girls. I have a group of female friends, but I put on a mask around them. I just feel way more comfortable around guys because I can be myself. 

It wasn't a problem when I was younger, probably because puberty didn't hit anyone. But now that I'm in high school, it seems that I just get treated so differently by guys. Maybe it's just an unintentional natural instinct kinda thing, but that's not my biggest problem.

I always end up finding someone I get along with super well and becoming close to them. We have a platonic best-friend relationship for a long time before they end up developing feelings for me. I literally never flirt or anything at all, and I always casually bring up that I don't want to be in a relationship. Even they always tell me that I'm just one of the boys to them and that I act like a dude. 

But they always end up confessing to me, and I always say I don't want to be in a relationship. I ended up dating my 2.5 year long best friend for 2 months but I slowly realized that I only wanted to be best friends with him. He would get sad because I would talk to his friends but I can't just stop being friends with all his friends if I had always been friends with them... and then he told me he hates me talking to his friends because 3 of them likes me but didn't tell me who. I talked to him about just being friends because I didn't want to drag it on. We agreed to stay friends but he started giving me short answers and now he never hits me up anymore. I know he was really hurt and I feel so terrible for always hurting people. 

I don't see my guy friends as anything more than friends, but I do crush on some guys that's not them. And I just feel obligated to not date anyone or talk about any other guys because I don't want to hurt them. 

I met another guy a while after the breakup and we hit off really well as friends. It felt clear that he saw me as a friend in the beginning but as months went by, I could sense that he was starting to develop feelings for me. I dreaded and dreaded because I knew that confession would come. I would play dumb at every little hint he gave me and then there it was. I told him that I didn't want to date anyone and right then and there the friendship got hurt. We were still friends for a while after but it was just never the same. He would joke about the future, like getting married and having kids with me one day. And that made me so uncomfortable, I couldn't take it anymore. I started trying to get him to stop having feelings for me by doing unattractive things to get him to lean off. I'd encourage him to go out and go to parties and meet other girls that wasn't me, and he'd never get the hint. Eventually, the friendship completely broke again because he would figure out that I feel completely platonic towards him. I just feel like such an awful person because I ALWAYS END UP HURTING PEOPLE. 

And yet again, I somehow ended up becoming close to another guy friend. We've been super close for over 5 months now. He had a girlfriend for the first month we were friends so it felt completely platonic. But they broke up and he moved onto me very slowly. The friendship started to become weird 2 months after his breakup, and I could sense it. And again, confession. But this time, it was a little different. He told me in his confession that I can reject him and we'd stay like normal, and it has been normal. Except he also keeps joking about how he's going to marry me one day, and makes sexual jokes. And I hate things like that so much. I always change the subject but he just wont take the hint. And yeah, that's still the situation now.

I KNOW that all of them could get girls so easily. They're attractive but just not to me because I see them as friends. Why do they always have to fall for me? Am I just not allowed to be friends with the opposite gender? Can I please stop guilting over hurting them because I don't share the same feelings? Can my friendships stop dying? It makes me so MAD that I can just never fucking be friends with any guys at all. Or if I try to reject them, the whole friendship breaks apart. Just what am I supposed to do? Sure, I still have some guy friends that seem to absolutely have no feelings for me, and they treat me like a normal friend. But I don't want to get close to them because I don't want history to repeat itself. But having a close friend to talk to about everything and anything is just so nice, and I have yet to meet a girl who I get along super well with. Should I just stop becoming friends with guys? Sorry for the rant.

How do I reject close guy friends without hurting the friendship? Is it impossible?

471,"So I’ve been unemployed for 5 months now due to the pandemic. I’m civil engineer graduate with 9 years experience. (Graduated in 2011) I’m 40 years old. I have a wife and two kids. (5 and 9 years old)

At first I couldn’t find a job. I applied at 30-50 different places. Now I have three to choose from.

1. I received an offer for a decently paid government engineering job. (Pay is approx. 70K) This job is solid. And the professional experience I’ll get is amazing. Bad thing is, it’s 8 hours away from my hometown and in Austin, TX where it’s really expensive. I’ll be leaving behind the kids grandparents which includes my mom who’s a widow. (I’m a big help to her given that my other siblings live out of town)

2. This job is here in my hometown as a General Manager to a new up and coming solar panel company. This job pays a little more than the actual engineering job in Austin. (70k-80k) I wouldn’t have to uproot my family and move which in itself will be a lot of work. But, it’s not an engineering job. 

3. Haven’t heard back from this one yet but it’s potentially the highest paying one. (Could be up to 90k) It is an engineering job working for a dependable company that’s not going anywhere any time soon. As in, they’ll be in business forever. And it’s only 3 hours away. I would have to move but I would have family there. My mom would probably follow and move there since there will be three siblings living close by now.

478,"Hey there. I am kinda freaking out, so I could use some advice. Last weekend I hooked up with a girl who I like. She doesn't want a relationship, more like a FWB thing. Whatever, kinda unrelated. Anyone, I hooked up with her. And the condom broke. I didn't realize until it was too late, and I had finished inside her. We're both young and mostly unexperienced with this kinda thing, especially her. This happened at around 4:30 in the morning. The next morning (same day, techincally), she took plan b. I said I could go with her but she wanted to go on her own. Assuming she took it when she said she did, that would have been around 10 AM. So about 5.5 hours after the fact. She also was a day late for her period the day that we had sex, so I'm pretty sure that decreases the chance of pregnancy, plus the plan b means we should be clear. 

I apologized countless times, but she was clearly pissed. I figured that she's probably stressed, as was I. I was barely getting any sleep. Not the be that person, but this wasn't my fault. If I had any idea that the condom broke I would have stopped immediately. She is barely communicating with me, not responding for several hours (sometimes not until the next day). The next day I told her that I was so sorry that this happened and that if she needed me to do anything or if she wanted to talk then just ask. I checked up on her every day. But she's ignoring me in person and being cold through texts. 

If she isn't that into me then that's fine, but right now I feel like we need to communicate until it's over. She's making me feel like it's my fault. She hasn't once asked how I've been doing. The way that she's acted has made me change the way I feel about her. 

The problem is that it's been about 5 days since, and she still hasn't had her period, even though she was due the day before we had sex. Is this normal for plan b? Should I be worried? I feel like the mix of plan b plus the fact that she was due for her period (which means it's unlikely she can get pregnant) should mean the chance of her being pregnant is small.

I am dyslexic so I've always resented her and my other teachers for not noticing (it took a month at my new school for them to pick it up). I just feel so angry at her. I laugh about it sometimes but it feels like sometimes it tearing a hole in my heart. I really want to forgive and forget but I don't know how.

Oh and she also made me eat upstairs away from everybody for the last six months because I had a tendancy to not eat alot. I think it just made my eating habits worse as I don't like eating without other people around me.",25Sep2020,1
485,"I was in the kitchen cooking lunch and the kitchen has windows to the backyard with the blinds open. We also have a screen door with a dog door so our dogs can freely go in and out during the day when someone's home, but we can also close our main door and block it.

i have no idea if the dude saw me in there, he didn't seem to from what i could tell. i completely froze. my first thought was that he could be a burglar trying to check out our house and i didn't want him to try to come in. 

my dogs (very non intimidating mini poodles) ran out and were barking at him, they ran out before i had a chance to try to stop them and I was also scared he'd hurt them but he didn't seem phased by it at all and just ignored them.

then after standing there and not really doing anything he just casually left. also our gate to the backyard is locked so idk if he jumped the fence or what. but that was out of my view.

i'm really nervous since i'll be home alone for a few more days. i've been on edge since that happened. i'm also not sure if there is a legitimate reason he was there and i'm just not aware of it.",25Sep2020,1
486,"On mobile so apologies 

I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (22m) since the beginning of the year and it has been the easiest relationship I've ever been in. We obviously have spats and disagreements and come from very different backgrounds but we've always been committed to open communications and approaching problems as a team. I've never been happier with a partner.

I have a friend G(21f) who I've known for several years. I've never had much in way of girl friends but we were fast friends and we've always been close. We met in that weird age frame where life priorities change quickly, so while through the majority of our friendship I was buckled down in studies she was more into hookup culture and going out but we tended to bring out different sides of each other when together. It was a great friendship and recently g began slowing down as she's entering her last semester of undergrad and began seeing a guy seriously about 2 months ago. 

Now I recently moved several states over from the college town we all lived in as I got a good job offer from a company thats paying for my masters. This has put a minor strain on my relationship as my boyfriend is finishing his last semester but I think that's to be expected and we're making it work very well.

Sorry for the long backstory but I thought full context was important so onto the main issue.

Messaged me the other morning about a guy who I had recently followed on Instagram. I told her his name looked familiar and he had added me back. The conversation then went along these lines:

G:he's an old dealer of mine and saw i followed you so asked who you were

Me: oh weird. Idk how I would have known him them.

G:he says he thinks you're cute

Me: I am cute

G: he says to hit him up if you ever want a knew man

Me: thats kinda disrespectful 

G:I don't think so

Me: it just feels rude to see people in a relationship and try to insert yourself 

G:well he is cute....

Me: and not my boyfriend ??

G: but he's attractive and has weed

We got into a back and forth keeping along those lines fore awhile until she stopped responding and I was kinda bewildered. She's never said any negative about my boyfriend (and she's the friend that would say something). In fact we had talked about the 4 of us all going on a camping trip together as a couples weekend.

I reached out a few days later to try and get some clarity but she never responded and has now unfollowed me everywhere.

What should I do? If I should do anything. I feel like maybe she feels something missing not that there isn't a ""wild one"" in the friendship but that in no way gives her the right to be so disrespectful to a relationship she apparently has no problems with. It all just seems like ridiculous and baseless drama and I can't understand where its all coming from and if its something worth trying to sort out with her.",25Sep2020,1
487,"i’m 17F, a senior in high school (well, online high school). a little background about me: i deal with bad social anxiety. it escalated and got really bad in about 10th grade. my parents agreed to let me do online school. so they transferred me to an online program called Penn Foster, i started it in January 2019. it’s worked alright for me. so i’ve been doing high school online at home for the past 1.5-2 years now. i still deal with horrible social anxiety. i rarely leave my house.

anyways i just feel so lost. so confused. i don’t have friends. it’s very difficult for me to go places in public. social interaction is incredibly hard. i don’t feel like i have any purpose. i don’t know what direction my life is going. i don’t know what i’m supposed to do. i don’t have any skills. well, i try to draw. drawing and art are one of the only things i enjoy. i’ve always wanted to maybe do something with art, or start some kind of business. but i don’t think i’m good enough. i don’t have motivation. i’d like to go to an art school but i just don’t think i could get into one, and i don’t know if we could afford it. i’ve always really struggled with not knowing what i want to pursue in life. i have no idea what job i’m going to do. i can’t drive yet. i don’t know how i’m supposed to go to college, i don’t know how i’m supposed to get a job, i feel useless, i feel dumb. i just want to crawl in a hole. 

everything feels like way too much. i don’t know how to talk to people, i can’t look at people in their face, i just stare at my feet. i get so nervous i shake, my face turns red, tears form in my eyes. what am i supposed to do? what do i do with my life? i feel like anything i try to do isn’t going to be good enough. should i go to college? how do i even get into a college? i can barely even focus on my school work. i feel like if i did try to go to college i’d just fail. i don’t have motivation. i don’t like myself. i stay up at night overthinking everything. im probably depressed. my parents are expecting me to do things though. they’ve been asking me “when will you start going places? when will you start driving? when are you finally going to work?” i just don’t know. i don’t know what to do. school ends soon. what do i do?",25Sep2020,1

Last week she started throwing up. She says it's because she ate some KFC that was left out overnight, and she couldn't keep anything down for a few days. The last day she was sick was last saturday or sunday.

I don't know how illnesses like that work and I'm nervous of catching anything. I'm emetophobic which is the fear of throwing up, and I'm honestly really nervous I could get whatever made her sick. none of her other family member's got sick, and she tells me she's been feeling fine all week, but I'm still pretty scared tbh.

492,"So a couple months ago during the pandemic, a guy followed me on instagram. I followed him back thinking it was someone from middle school. Not long after we started talking I realized that he was not from middle school but just some random dude. Nonetheless, he is fun to talk to, and we have a lot in common. I continued talking to him because home life was crazy due to pandemic and my high school friends and I drifted apart. We all just went our separate ways, and my family and I just moved into a new home, a new town. I honestly felt alone and bored. When he came along, I kinda went along with it, talking to him helped me escape from it all and helped me feel less lonely.  

Fast forward, he says we should hang out. Now of course I am fully aware of the dangers of meeting up with a stranger. I plan to go to a public place, that is far from where I live. I would also plan for noon, plenty of time and sunlight. 

The problem is my mom. I can't lie to her. It's something I cannot do for the life of me. I know the minute I tell her my plans she'll laugh in my face and call me crazy. She'll say, ""what if he is a pimp luring women, what if he drugs you, what if he invites all his pimp friends to kidnap you."" She'll then tell me no. Im not afraid  because I feel like I know him, but at the same time I don't *know* him for sure. So I understand her concerns. But at the same time, I want to hang out.",25Sep2020,1
494,"This turned out to be a long one, there's a TLDR at the bottom.

So basically, one of my friends approached me in march time to ask if I could teach him how to use a music making software after lockdown ended. I said sure, thinking it'd be a one off.

When school reopened in my country, he asked if he could come round with another friend because they basically wanted to start a ""band"" - but not a band because it's ""too professional"". I said sure, and I showed him how to use the software.

(Because we are in the same school / classes we could meet up since we are in the same bubble)

He then asked to come round the next few weeks, thinking I wanted to go ahead with this band thing, with him wanting to find a singer from our school. He plays guitar, the other friend and especially me are not particularly musically talented at all. He knows a couple basic songs on the piano and I've used the software for making some appalling remixes and some game music.

We've met up about 3 or 4 times now, and I don't know what to do. I feel like if I say no i would seem like an asshole because I've suddenly changed my mind and I don't want to let them down.

But. This friend is sort of a twat. I'm a game developer (in no way a musician) and I recently released a trailer for a game. I sent the YouTube video to a group of friends, and they all thought it was fantastic. Except him. He said it was ""shit and anticlimactic"" and that I was an idiot. Not only this, he calls everyone else in the chat twats, idiots and bellends constantly. As my friend accurately put, he ""says loads of rude stuff in the chat and insults people, then at school I don’t really want to be around you"". He probably says this jokingly, but we all find him super irritating and I did find it insulting that he said those things.

Me and the other friend in the ""band"" are not confrontational in the slightest and I don't really say no without coming up with an excuse like I'm busy or my mum says no, but I can't do that week after week. So, how do I say that I don't want to go ahead with this band thing because I find it really boring without letting him down too harshly; his taste in music is nothing like mine anyway? How do you even word it??

Every time I think of how to say no, I change my mind because he starts talking about what we could do next time and I feel guilty. :(

I've asked the other friend if he likes doing it or finds it boring, because when we're there, he just sits on his phone for the most part browsing Reddit or something. I'm yet to get a response.

I've just realised how long this post is. If even one person reads this, thank you.

TLDR: I accidentally got myself into a ""band"" with 2 friends, one of which is sometimes a massive twat and I don't know how to say I don't want to do it anymore without letting them down.",25Sep2020,1

This friend who told me hated her and wanted me to block her and I don’t ever want to do that. 

I guess I might’ve said some things wrong and she thought I was lying and which I wasn’t cause someone told me but she said she wasn’t and I believe her cause she explained to me but during our argument of course we were mad at each other and I don’t know she said some things I didn’t like and hurt my feelings really it almost made me cry because I know I just lost a friend like that and after everything I’ve done for her everything she just wants to throw away our friendship and not only mine but the one with this other guy she’s been friends with since day 1 and we never did anything bad to her and I don’t understand why I’m going to talk to her later tonight.

But today I saw her post on her story and she @ some guy I didn’t know and when I realized it, she found a new guy friend and I felt crushed, I don’t know I just have this insecurity whenever I see I guess someone who looks more superior and taller than me I don’t know how to feel I just feel completely inferior. deep down I love her very much and care for her as a friend and I’m not saying she can’t have other friends it just hurt me to hear those things she said to me. I don’t want to talk about them.

It really effect me like I feel depress, been having a lot of anxiety recently, and my self esteem is really low. I live with my mom, sister , brother, and my stepfamily ( stepdad, stepsister, and stepbrother) with three dogs. 

  
 I'm in alot of stress since I been going to college on campus and sometimes online at home. Its hard to focus alot since well my family. My mom is really nice and kind but she yells a lot if the house is a mess or I didn't do something that she want me to do.  Like today, I get yell because the dishes are wash and put away. Its not really my fault though. I haven't been eating at home due to college but I don't really eat since I forget to eat when working on assignments and studying.  I also got yell at that I didn't help clean the living room and kitchen. Its hard to make my mom happy. Isn't really fair that I have to do everything and I can't do everything.   


My stepbrother is too lazy to help out to clean or help with anything at all. My stepsister helps a bit but can't do much correctly since she has a disability. My sister is 14 and has been focusing a lot in school  since her teachers keeps sending her assignments to do, she does helps but sometimes she gets mad that I do help enough. My sister makes comments about me such us me being too skinny and make comments about what little food  I eat or what type of I eat. As for my brother he is 6, so He can't clean since he doesn't know how to. He mainly on the Xbox. As for my mom and my stepdad. My mom does clean when she home. She works long hours and comes home really late. As for my stepdad he woks from morning to afternoon. He doesn't clean at all. All he does is sleep, eat, and play with the dogs. But he does yard work so that pretty much it.

It sad that I am the one who has to do a lot of stuff. My online long distance boyfriend doesn't like how I am basically doing everything at home. I basically wake up early just to get ready for college , feed the dogs, and make breakfast / lunch quickly for myself since I don't really have a lot time left. When I get home I work on my assignments and study, make my little brother lunch, wash my and little brother dishes, clean the countertops, table, and broom the floors. Not to mention I take the dogs outside and feed them. I sometimes do my laundry and help do my mom and my little brother laundry.

I really want to leave this house and move out to live my boyfriend (he lives in a different state) but I really don't have  money to make such travel and get myself an apartment.

513,"TLDR: I was inspired to start a personal finance/self improvement/personal growth blog. I purchased a domain name ([thealphasteps.com](https://thealphasteps.com/)), worked on some articles, and realized that I don't know what my end goal is or if it's worth the money.

Over quarantine, as an effort to better myself and 'invest' in myself, I wanted to start a little project that I found enjoyable. I look up to creators like Matt D'Avella, Thomas Frank, Joey (from Better Ideas), Nate O'Brien.. yeah you get it. Collegeinfogeek and their story was what really got me interested in this idea. What they do seemed really fun and I wanted to do something like that. I'm pretty into personal finance and investing as well so I wanted to do something related to that. I decided to buy a domain name, learn the basics of building a website, and started writing posts.

It was at that point that I realized a couple things.

1. Writing out articles consistently is a lot harder than it looks.
2. A lot of ""self improvement"" articles and videos out there are just basic motivational word fluff that don't offer anything original or new. I want to put something new out there, but I don't know where to start.
3. Did I just waste a couple hundred dollars on a domain name and hosting plan for something that I'm not fully committed to? I don't know.

I wrote a few articles, got frustrated, and cleared the whole website out and deleted my articles. Started over. Did the same thing again. I finally settled down lol and have spent time writing two articles that I don't plan on deleting haha. I put quite a bit of work and research into both of them and I will say I'm proud of them!

There are a few concerns I have though. Should I be working on this as a team with other people? I'm knowledgeable in a few things but definitely not everything when it comes to website building and article writing. Is this manageable as a solo project or am I wasting my money? I don't even know what the end goal is. My website was originally labeled as a self improvement site but after realizing how cloudy that can be I don't know if I should just stick to personal finance or just give up on the whole thing. I can't help but feeling embarrassed about it either, as over quarantine, I was very excited to start this whole thing and had pretty big dreams. Yeah, I probably blew it up in my head, and writing when you don't have an audience is difficult! I commend all those bloggers out there who stuck with it and made it.

I'm just afraid I'm wasting my money on something. I really enjoy personal finance and self growth in general and it would be ideal to support myself financially doing something like this one day, but obviously that takes a lot of time. I'm just torn on what to do, if it's worth it or not.",25Sep2020,1

OP: I pray that you will grow and that God will lead you to a place in your faith where your personal beliefs no longer hurt SO and that they can feel accepted and loved despite not falling in line. His choice of what to persue in life is no more your decision to make than it is for him to choose for you and this already has made him happier. He has been living life attempting to be seen as a male and I've never seen him more confident and happy with his own body and mind. The times that I see him struggle most is when he doesnt have the support of you and MIL, it's all he's wanted is to have your support. He isnt hurting anyone, and he is finally getting some self confidence. All SO is missing now is the support of his family.

FIL: You are funny.
SO will always be my daughter and I will always love her. 

OP: He does not agree with your religion in the slightest but still supports your decision to follow it because he knows it brings you fulfillment and joy. He supports you because he loves you, even if he doesnt agree with your lifestyle. SO just wants the same in return.
I do sincerely hope that you open your heart a little bit. That's not coming from a place of pettiness or anything, I really really hope to see you and MIL supporting SO in one of the only things that has brought any joy or self fulfillment into their life. 
SO hasn't overdosed or attempted suicide since perusing this. I've never seen him more sure of himself.
That alone is a huge step. Clearly something changed that was for the better.
And I understand not wanting to think that my views may be misplaced, I was a very passionate christian until just recently and nothing anyone said would change my mind on my beliefs.
But I dont think you would disagree that no matter how much time you put into being faithful to Christ, there is always more to learn.
I have yet to find anywhere in scripture that labels being transgender as sinful. I've found passages that clear up that nothing you take into your body will taint you,and that you will be given a new body when entering the kingdom of heaven, but nothing that would nullify somebody for how they choose to change their bodies.
Even though it's not something that was normalized in your upbringing or around your church does not mean its immediately bad. That kind of xenophobia is something that Christ himself spoke against I believe. He challenged people and showed that their beliefs they had been crafting their entire lives were misguided.

FIL: Sometimes lol
I think you should keep reading your bible

OP: I get that you probably wont want to listen to me given who I am. I cannot make you do anything, but i am being absolutely genuine when i say yours and MIL acceptance and support means the world to SO.
Through my military career alone, I carried my bible and read through the new testament 3 times and the old one twice

FIL: Love and support are to different things

OP: You can love somebody and not support their addiction to Heroin.
But this is not a drug, this is not violence, this is not immorality.

FIL: We love our daughter we can not support something that will be harmful to her
I wish you could understand that
Keep digging 
Eventually you get to stories that aren't lining up with your narrative

OP: This is a change to SO's body and theirs alone, something that for years they have been considering, researching, and seeking therapy and professional advice for.
Just like if you wanted to get a nose implant or something.
If you wanted to get weight loss surgery 
This is something that cannot be changed by a diet though

FIL: Sad to see you buying into the lies
Keep doing some research man.....

OP: I will, and really hope you will do the same.

FIL: You have to dig deeper to get past the stories that you want to read
You don't have to worry about me man

OP: I know you love your children. I really hope for SO's sake you will try to understand.

FIL: You just don't get it
It is amazing 
I cannot support something that is bad for my daughter......
SO will always be loved 

OP: That I understand, I just hope you will see why it isnt bad for everyone.
Its not for everyone
But it is for some people.

FIL: That is you opinion and you are welcome too it
Just wish your opinion wasn't going to wind up hurting my daughter

OP: Just as you are welcome to yours. Your kid is hurting for you to accept them because of your opinion though. Even if you dont approve of surgery or hormones (Which is completely fine, I understand that it's a controversial topic) but what SO wants at the very least is just to be respected enough to be called He/Him.
I dont think that asking to be called a different pronoun is a sin anywhere.

FIL: Lol

OP: Even minus the procedures and beliefs, that at the very least would make SO very happy to have your backup on.

FIL: I can see this conversation is over.....she will always be loved!

OP: Yes, but your love isnt all SO needs from you.
I hope you will at least think on that. I'll see you later FIL.

FIL: No need to think on it
I will never be able to support SO in a decision when it could/will end up hurting her. Doesn't mean I don't love her.",25Sep2020,1
516,"I’m a 17 year old girl and I’ve had a history of self-harm. Nothing too bad, just scratching myself with a pair of nail scissors and I got in a really bad fight with my dad and showed him my latest cuts out of anger, because I wanted to talk to him about it. Obviously, it wasn’t the best time to do so as we were both hugely angry at each other. 

He proceeded to call me an idiot for it and essentially told me that I was grounded and not allowed to go out. My mum took away the scissors and shouted at me as well. I’m not angry at them anymore, as I can understand how it must be terrifying for them to know this. My mum told me, after we calmed down, that she was scared to leave me home alone and I feel so guilty for making them so scared.

What can I do to try and restore our relationship and make it up to them?

Please ask me if you need any more details, in order to help.",25Sep2020,1
517,"I will say that my friend is 16 and so they still live with their family(but they are trying to get out of there as fast as they can, but it's quite difficult). 

So. One of my closest friends is having an issue with their family. Their family steals the food they bought for themselves to eat because they are a fussy eater (they have Autism which makes them fussy with foods and textures, and they also may have ADHD but I'm not entirely sure) and then not only do they confess to stealing the food, they then turn it onto my friend and saying that it's their fault?
And they force de my friend to have to waste more money to buy take out, and they do also starve themselves sometimes because they don't realise how hungry they are. And again, they are a fussy eater and most of the left overs their family leaves is gross shit that they don't want to eat.
Their mum doesn't believe that they have autism and also believes that they starve themselves for attention, so in simple terms she's a huuuge judgy bitch who can't get over herself.

I know this post is a bit over the place, but I want to be able to get some advise on the situation and what could be done about it.",25Sep2020,1
518,"So Im pretty creeped out. Some number I did not recognize  texted me saying it was a girl who I follow on instagram (my instagram is private, I don't know how anyone could see my followers) asking if I wanted to hook up. They immediately said they were just kidding and they were actually another girl I follow on instagram who just so happens to be friends with the first girl mentioned. (Both girls were right on top of each other in terms of order on my instagram followers list) I barely know either girl and messaged a mutual friend to ask if this was a joke. The mutual friend said it was not and both girls were very uneasy about the whole thing. In addition, whoever was texting me was asking if I wanted to hook up, unless I was ""hooking up with someone else."" The whole thing was extremely creepy. I guess it had to be someone who follows me on instagram texting me since my account is private, but I do not really know. I am wondering if it is a girl I recently started talking to on a dating app. I already have her number so she would have to be using multiple numbers. Either way Im pretty paranoid now as I am supposed to meet up with the dating app girl soon. Please help!",25Sep2020,1
519,Hey so my boyfriend left to boot camp and I feel like I’m slowly forgetting how things were with him. Our memories feel really distant already. Mind you I’m only 19 but I do have really bad memory. Anyways he also writes like a robot AND I understand that he doesn’t have time to really write. But idk I’ve written him like 15 letters with a bunch of topics he could respond too but he rarely brings it up so it feels like whatever I’ve said goes unnoticed like I’m writing so much and pouring my heart out for nothing? And I’ve brought it up to him on our calls and he said he’s sorry that hes getting more time now. But idk I just need some opinions and advice.,25Sep2020,1
520,"This has been coming up a lot lately but I really hate getting thanked for things that I have to do or are just a part of normal life. For example, my boss thanking me for the absolute most basic functions of my job. If it's a special project, sure, thank me. But if it's something I have to do continually or that I have to do it just irritates me. Or like if my husband thanks me for making a really simple dinner. Well I mean I had to eat so yeah I had to make it. Or if he thanks me for feeding the dog. Well it had to be done and he wasn't doing it.

521,"I'm a male (20), and I've just gone back to University. My head is all over the place at the moment. I've come to the realization that I really don't have as many good quality friends as I first believed and I've been spending a lot more time alone than I anticipated. Now I'm sure this is mostly due to Covid and it's subsequent strain on social interaction but that doesn't take away from my lack of friends. I'm back on the dating apps after a 4 month break. I feel that I would like to give dating a go and possibly work on a relationship. I've had trouble committing in the past so I have always ducked out of relationship's before they got too serious. 

Now more than ever, I've been feeling super lonely and would like some kind of companionship. I don't have a ""best"" friend here at University so it's not like I'm super close to anyone. I'm naturally a recluse but once I get a taste of the social life, I get withdrawals. I find myself giving too much of a shit about what people think of me as well; I'd love to experience some sort of ego death. I just kinda thought I was more popular/liked than I actually am, and I hate that it's getting to me, but I can't help it.

I want to improve my speaking and writing skills. I also would like to increase my ability to listen and understand things that may be complex.

526,"His OCD relates to things such as oil and grease and even things like if people appear to have cold sores. He was first triggered by his cousin coming over after having been at work (he was working in shop for an oilfield company). The next day my boyfriend threw out several of our household items in a complete frenzy and deemed our brand new couch, dirty. This went on for awhile and eventually he kind of tried to get help, but not really. He was prescribed an extremely low dose of an anti-anxiety medication and took it for about 6 weeks before giving up saying it did nothing for him. We fought ALOT because he wanted to move out of our now contaminated apartment to somewhere new, which at the time we simply could not afford(especially since he left his last job due to the OCD). If either of us ever touched anything he deemed contaminated we would need to shower and change our clothes. Because the couch was considered dirty we had to wear specific clothes that were only for wearing to sit on the couch. 

Fast forward a year and we have moved to a new place, where he promised that his feelings of contamination would go away. Obviously I knew they wouldn't go away as this isn't an easy fix. He threw out almost all of his personal items and wanted me to do the same before we moved in, so that the new place wouldn't be contaminated. Because I have a lot of sentimental items and well, some irreplaceable things, he fought with me. So now that those things are in the new house he won't touch them and I'm afraid to myself, as he gets very mad. I have no idea what can be done to get him help. He doesn't think he needs help but i know he does. This has ruined a lot of his relationships with friends and family members.

I have a million examples of things that have set him off. He once got a brand new Drivers License, but because the woman who dealt with him appeared to have a cold sore, he threw out the ID, and his credit card simply because she had touched them. 

I have tried my best to get him to get help and try to support him without enabling him. I am at a loss. 

Is there anyone out there with any experience close to mine with advice? Or even just some support, I could really use it. My mental health has deteriorated drastically.",25Sep2020,1

528,"Couple of months back I took up courses from theoretical physics, software engineering mainly ai and some related to environmental engineering. I found it ridiculously easy. It was really easy to pick up the concepts. Maybe it was cause I was dealing with initial lectures, but I actually got bored on how easy it was.

I like to learn for fun so I'm planning to get in there again, but overall I enjoy the idea of being a rennaisance human.

My parents were right. Most stem colleges teach outdated material which was taught in 1960s and haven't updated it.

529,"Background-

I've always felt like someone who can offer up more than I do (I know literally every person on the planet thinks this of themselves). I didn't try at all in school, my grades were reflective of that. I half-assed my way through college, this includes picking a major I couldn't regret more if I tried (economics, would've went for a comp-sci/engineering degree if I had a chance to start over), and not even bothering for an internship. My days were go to school, sometimes not go to class at all, and get home as fast as I possibly could. There I'd usually take a nap, then do fuck-all for the rest of the day. In fact, this seems to be how pretty much every day of my existence has gone, a desperate need to fast forward time to an arbitrary point in the future I've deemed ""big,"" only for that moment to come and pass while I continue to do absolutely nothing with this precious gift of life.

I'm currently unemployed. I had a desk job in a field I fucking hated for a bit, and seemed to be doing well at it. Then I quit after having a mental breakdown, with no regard for my future. I've tried looking for jobs since, and am just overwhelmed by how far behind the curve I am. I don't qualify for nearly any entry-level position. There's so many skills and qualifications for the interesting sounding jobs (an analyst-role seems something I'd be good at, if only I could stick with something consistently) that I'm not close to meeting. The only open positions that wouldn't immediately toss my resume would be for part time jobs or highly repetitive jobs that pay low and don't require education. Problem is I'm over three years removed from graduating college. With the type of resume recruiters use for laughing material. 

I've been hospitalized twice for my mental health. I feel nothing ultimately came from them, the first being a week-long stay, the second coming less than a month later in the form of a three-week stay. I've been on and off every kind of antidepressant, currently on nothing as none of them have produced any discernible affect. I genuinely feel at this point I can be effective at managing my depression and anxiety, but there's gotta be something more, for me to continue this self-defeating behavior.

I just don't know what to do and feel I'm running close to wit's end here. I'm incredibly fortunate in that I have a home to stay in, but my parents have financial difficulties of their own and this situation could dissolve at a moment's notice. I don't know what to do. I couldn't be more confused. I have no identifiable passion for a potential career, other than daydreaming of being famous, and even then the reason changes from acting to establishing a Theory of Everything. I'm at the mercy of whatever my next instinct is.

I've applied for a second-degree math bachelor's, with the hopes of meeting the requirements to transition to my local college's engineering school. Even then, I won't be done till I'm 30 conservatively, and I'm not sure I actually want to do it. I don't know that I want to do anything. And I just can't seem to stop wasting time.",25Sep2020,1

531,"I sure did love poetry. Been fascinated with it since I was very young (and I’m a high school student, so technically, still young).

I didn’t write many, and I’ve lost a few pieces over the years, but I still wrote with anxiousness yet joy. I’ve had people read it, and they liked it. I was planning to make a hard-cover book filled with pieces of my poetry that my friend and me can cherish and read time and time again. Truly wonderful idea, that hasn’t been spoken of since the beginning or middle of summer. I worked all summer, and I dropped the majority of things I knew. I forgot lots of math, history, politics, English vocabulary, motivation to study psychology, and the loss of poetic writing. Yet I have As and Bs so far. I know all of this is cluttered, but I need to know from whoever is willing to provide a solution.. how do I recover?

But later on  I noticed that I was feeling shorter and I look at my back and my posture and realize it is bad. Like I have a exagerated spot on the lower curve, like anterior pelvic tilt and I noticed I had a slight forward head posture and rounded shoulders. Whenever I would try to stand as tall as I could, it would give me some height but it would exagerate the curve even more. I measured with like a broomstick over my shoulders and I used it to stand up as straight as possible, it fixed my rounded shoulders momentaritly and helped with my neck and I forced my hip to go straighter and I measured at .5 under 6 ft.

I had an idea to do something, but don't know if it's BIZARRE or not.

Basically I went to buy something at the store about an hour ago, and the worker who helped me was super nice, talkative, and seeming to want to be my friend. For some reason. They basically said stuff in the vein of ""you're cool, I like you"" and ""I really hope you come back/I really hope I see you again.""

This has been a problem for years. He lets them everywhere in the house and they sleep in his bed at night. I've never let them in my room but he has and near enough every time they've peed on the bed.

The other day, I had the house to myself and left my door open while I was downstairs for about half an hour. Then I saw the cats were outside, they'd left through my bedroom window.

Fastforward to the night where I get out of the shower, hop into bed and feel a wet patch on the duvet. Maybe it's where my towel was? Let's smell it!

Long story short mum picked me up and I slept at hers that night. Dad was great and got me a new matress and duvet today. I thanked him and said, even though how great he'd been all year, I felt like I had to say please don't let the cats in my room.

He felt guilty and told me what happened in April, but not to worry because he scrubbed it clean. He said this smiling, almost laughing. He finds it funny because they do this on his bed often. He went upstairs to put on my new bedsheets.

He came back down and apologised. I told him not to talk about it or it'll ruin my last night with him. He got annoyed and said I'm overreacting. We haven't spoken since.

Like they are compensating for some emotional wounds. Everything they say can be summed up to ""waah, mommy doesn't love me! "". 

The second thing is I know they aren't coping with their environment well. The reason they are fixated on me even though I'm younger is cause they aren't doing well among their peers or aren't at that level, so they are competing with the kids. And they aren't up to that level either.

547,Hi I've been really constipated for like a week and my fiance came home from work today with some Fleet enema thing thats supposed to help you go in like a few minutes. I'm kind of being a little bitch about it bc of all the warnings and shit can anyone on here help me feel more confident about this/hype me up? I'm really nervous about this I've never had trouble using the bathroom before... All I see online are reviews saying good things about it but I'm afraid it wont help me go and it says if you dont go in like 30m you need to call a doctor but I/we dont have a doctor and cant really afford one thanks to the pandemic affecting our income.,25Sep2020,1
548,"Hi there,

I'm not as depressed as I was before therapy, but college is slowly eating me alive. **Because of COVID-19, I lost all contact with friends and I am unable to live a normal college life.** I just started online courses for my university, but I am extremely unhappy. I'm not an online learning person, I've always grown up with in-person classes. The work I'm being assigned by these courses are atrociously excessive and I simply have too many distractions at home to keep up with college. I'm beginning to consider dropping out simply because of underlying problems (distractions) and the fact that online courses are 100x harder especially when you're at home and **the university has prohibited on-campus housing.**

I've already spoken to my father about what I want to do, he fully understands what I wish to do but is advising me that I should take a large break after this or at least until the COVID-19 outbreak is over. I've expressed to him that I worry about the financial burden I will put on the family, he says don't worry about it, which puts me at ease with the financial situation. **I feel like a total failure at life, but** **my father thinks that I'm doing great and that just because I leave college doesn't mean anything, it just means that I'm still finding my path, and that there is no failure.** I don't know what to think because I feel like I have no idea what I am doing at all. I thought I could handle college and now I feel like I made a terrible mistake.

Perhaps college isn't for me, I don't know. I either realized that too late or I needed to experience a taste of college to realize it wasn't for me. It's good to know that I have a great father, but I still haven't told my mother what is going on. I am constantly **losing** the **motivation** to keep going with the college work because of how complicated it is to get from one class to another and to turn in work for classes. **The college professors give little explanation as to what to do sometimes and leaves it to us students to figure it out. The college I am in is making me feel like my hobbies are an obligation in life, leaving me with nothing but my wits.**

I want to be happy with my life, I do not want to stress myself to death over almost impossible due dates, workloads, and professors I have to work with. **Please help.**",25Sep2020,1
549,"To preface, let me briefly mention that as far as I know, she has NOT received any money off the pieces she has traced, and she hasn’t publicly posted them claiming they were hers. She has, however, told our circle of friends that she made them herself, and even put her watermark on them giving the idea that they were her original work.

This started when she started doing artwork for us. She made a piece for me, my girlfriend and a friend of mine. She even claimed and gave the impression she drew it all herself. However, the following day, my girlfriend discovered that she had traced the drawing she did for her. We found it this website here[Piece #1](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/iTbxmhw_clip-collection-of-free-braids-anime-download-on/).

There is no proof she ever public distributed this as her own work. She did, however, put her watermark on the image which gave the impression that the work was hers.

The other art piece she did was for my friend. Which we found out to be a copy of this image here[Piece #2](https://www.uihere.com/free-cliparts/anime-male-manga-zuko-drawing-anime-3713901).

We also found that the earlier images were made using this website[Site #1](http://animeoutline.com).

For each of these pieces, she had give the impression that the work was originally hers, and we don't know how to confront her. She is a good person, but she clearly doesn't understand the seriousness of what she's doing. Need help figuring out how respectfully confront her.",25Sep2020,1
550,"So, as the post says, I was assaulted about ten years ago, pretty severely by multiple men. I was 18 at the time, and ended up not reporting it. I’ve since done therapy and worked through it, and honestly feel that I’m as “over it” as a person can be.  But... I’ve never told him. 

We’ve had a somewhat rocky relationship, but that’s mainly in the past. My sibling had a TON of issues, so my parents attention had to be pretty much all on them for years. After being raped i didn’t want draw attention to myself, and given some issues from childhood, I’m really not the type to ever want to ask for help from anyone or admit to anything being wrong. I’ve always been the type to take care of things myself, regardless of how difficult. 

I ended up dropping out of school, getting a job, and being in a kind of shit place for awhile. Since then my siblings in a better place, my dads been able to relax a lot and we’ve really repaired our relationship a lot. I’ve also travelled a ton, found a job I love, moved continents a couple of times, and am honestly in a great place now. 

I’m currently living with my dad (my VISA was up so I had to move back to my home country temporarily) and am getting along great with him and my sibling + his girlfriend and her kids who are all also at home. I just really feel like I should tell him this, but whenever I gather up the courage I just can’t.  I feel like I freeze up and just don’t want to ruin things.  He’ll be devastated, yet also very likely angry at me for a) not telling him right when it happened, and b) for not reporting things.  I don’t want to damage our relationship, yet I hate feeling like I’m keeping something from him that he would want to know. 

Just... if you’ve had to te a parent about being raped, or as a parent, have had a child tell you, what advice do you have? I feel like it’s something I need to tell him, but just can’t get the words out to even ask to talk to him about it. 

Also, please don’t come at me about not reporting. I’m not getting into the circumstances here, but it wouldn’t have done anything. At all.",25Sep2020,1
551,"I guess there is some sort of glitch associated with my address. I ordered a shelf and got two, a drill battery and got two, skates for my friend and I got two (The pair I ordered plus a more expensive pair). I was sent the wrong order from another company and then called them so they sent out another and then the original item plus a more expensive item arrived. Now I have this electronic item worth $250 and I sent it in on warranty. I received two warranty replacements and this morning I got a notification a third will be arriving Monday. I ordered $140 of items off another website, they emailed me to say they were out of stock proceeded to refund me then mail me the items anyways. When I got the shelves and batteries about a year ago I thought I was lucky. Everything else has literally happened since March 11 when I went into quarantine. I’m really generous with my friends so they always say I just have good karma. It isn’t isolated to postal service, fedex, ups and dHL have all double delivered.

552,"Hello reddit,
I started university a year ago. I have made many new good friends and its going well socially. But still o kind of feel lonely. I dont think its because my new friends are ""fake friends"" but rather that i am ready for a relationship. I never was the guy to run from one relationship to another. In my life i only had one serious relationship. I am 21 btw  I just feel like i want that again but i dont want to force it. In summer a female student told me she was in love with me but i did not have the same feelings for her so i declined.
I do not know how you guys can help me but it may be worth a try.",25Sep2020,1

554,"This is my first ever post so I’m sorry if it’s bad. I’m looking for help because I have a tough situation I can’t figure out.

A few months ago my boyfriend and I went through a messy breakup and now we don’t live together. 

Along time ago I had a zippo lighter engraved with song lyrics for him as a gift. He repaid me with a beautiful necklace that unfortunately broke by accident. 

One day when we were at my family cabin he lost the zippo lighter, we couldn’t find it anywhere and eventually took the loss and moved on.

However yesterday after about a year of it being missing my mom was cleaning out some boxes and happened to find it. 

Though him and I had a harsh breakup we use to be good friends so we were still in touch. I of course texted him excited to share the news my mom found the missing lighter.

He instantly said he wanted it back. I felt now that we were separated and we both moved on it was appropriate that I kept the lighter and returned the necklace to him. 

I still have the necklace but when we broke up I told him I’d fix it since i felt bad about it breaking. At the time he was okay with that.

However after our conversation about the lighter and how I felt it was best to return the gifts to where we came from he got angry. 

He yelled about how it belonged to him and demanded I send it back. I was taken back by his anger and tried to help him understand my thinking but he wouldn’t listen. I told him he can have the necklace to maybe give to his new girlfriend and I keep the lighter somewhere safe.

No matter how hard I tried to reason he yelled over me and wouldn’t listen and eventually threatened to sue me over it. He even said he wants nothing to do with the necklace now, just that lighter.

Idk what to do because I felt like I was trying to do the right thing but now I feel like I’m doing the wrong thing. I told him I’d fix the necklace for him and send it back and the lighter, but it doesn’t seem fair or right to me. He even threatened to stop talking to me over it

I guess I came here for advice so I’d really appreciate the help, thank you if anyone read this.",25Sep2020,1

557,"So my manager and I are very close, almost friends. We have an hour long conversation almost every week ranging from work to life, to politics, our personal issues, to family and etc. I’ve recently made a huge mistake that was completely my fault. She told me she had to drink some wine before our conversation, I obviously did too, but way more than she did. She told me there hasn’t been a decision made yet, but it doesn’t look good for me and my termination will probably be swift. 

For context, I work in high finance and have passively been trying to find another job for a while. Obviously, I’ve been unsuccessful. I’ve also been studying to go back to school to change careers, but I’ve been unsuccessful at that as well. My lease ends next month and I just can’t go back and live with my mom. We have a great relationship at a distance, but I left home as soon as I got into college at 18, I’m about to be 28 now and I would much rather live that van life than live with my mother. 

This was my first job out of college and I’ve been working there for four years. I have a friend who lives in Charlotte that I maybe could use his address for job applications or I could find a cheap roach infested apartment in New York to try to find another job. Maybe there are other financial centers I could consider, but I’m honestly too shaken up to think straight. I ultimately wanted to go to business school, but that’s at least a year away. Plus the way my career works, I doubt I’d have any time to study, because the work hours are so long and the job itself is so demanding. I’m not at an entry level position anymore but eventually my savings will deplete and my poor financial management will catch up to me. I’ve never faced this before and I’ve always been a great employee at all my previous jobs, I just made a stupid stupid mistake that will probably result in me being fired. 

I also have a dog that I foster, he’s an urgent need dog and if I lose my job, I won’t be able to take care of him. So he’ll probably be sent back to the shelter (I can’t imagine how sad he would be) and he would probably euthanized shortly afterwards because he’s the dog that has lived in the shelter for the longest amount of time, it breaks my heart. He’s a good, happy boy, I’ve tried my hardest to give him a good life, but I can’t do that if I don’t have income. 

I also struggled with MDD (major depressive disorder), PTSD, ADHD, and insomnia. I won’t be able to afford therapy anymore and subsequently my meds. My family is pretty poor, so are my close friends, so I can’t rely on them either. I’m single too, so I can’t depend on a spouse to help me either.

I just need a game plan for the inevitable. This is also sucky because of the pandemic. I don’t even think I could get unemployment if I’ve been fired. 

I just need a game plan. Something to give me hope. Something so that the depression doesn’t win and well...you know...

Tl:dr about to lose my job, I have limited resources to survive, and I struggle with depression. I just need a plan to survive for a year to find a way to get into business school and get my life back on track.",25Sep2020,1
558,"So I’ve got old old old self harm scars. They’re not going anywhere, it’s been over 7 years. I am tired of feeling like I gotta hide my arm to avoid an uncomfortable confrontation if a nosy person happens to see. 

I’ve got 4 tattoos already. One on my thigh serves the same purpose and I’ve felt SOOO much better about wearing shorts since I did that. No ragerts, as they say. I want to do the same for my wrist. I’ve tried every scar treatment short of a skin graft (including supervised medical treatments). I’m sick of the waiting and hoping it’ll improve. I’d like to just color over it. I don’t even much care what it is tbh. 

My work is very accepting of tattoos. Lots of former military, nobody has to hide anything. People have full sleeves and it’s cool beans. 

So... I need that extra push to go through with it. Hype me up pls. I want to move on with my life but I can’t with these scars looking at me every day.",25Sep2020,1
559,"My dad is constantly giving us a bunch of problems. He is really gassy because he has severe lactose intolerance. However, he always drinks milk straight from the milk jug, and he lets out gross farts because of this. Every time he sits on the couch, he squeezes out massive, disgusting, loud farts that stink up the whole place. I can't even begin to describe how angry I am when my dad farts. He seems to do it on purpose, and he never apologizes for being gross and gassy. The odor stays in the fabric, so we have to buy a new couch every two days. My dad spends a lot of time sitting on the couch, drinking milk and watching TV.

He goes to the bathroom about 90 times a day, and he spends about an hour in the bathroom each time. He uses about 30 rolls of toilet paper every single day, and he never flushes after he uses the bathroom. It smells terrible afterward, and I often have to go to the library, which is just 5 minutes away, to use the bathroom.

According to my mom, my dad farts non-stop at night. About 5 years ago, she stopped sleeping in the same room as him. However, since he farts so loud, everyone can hear him fart, and he makes his mattress smell terrible, so we have to buy him a new mattress, new bedsheets, and a new blanket literally every 2 to 4 days.

He farts non-stop in the car. The seat absorbs the farts, and the stench also goes into the AC system that if anyone turns on the AC the whole car smells like crap. Therefore, we also have to buy my dad a new car every single week. He wastes too much money, and we are deep in debt. My mom works 4 jobs, my brother works 3 jobs, and I work 3 jobs as well to support my dad's lifestyle. He needs to improve himself or at least invest in a couple odor proof and sound proof pants.",25Sep2020,1

Last year I decided to open up and confess, however all this time I knew she would friendzone me, and that was exactly what happened. After that I tried to find another girl to date, but to no avail.

To this day we are still on really good terms and talk regularly. Recently I suggested to become closer friends and to hang out a bit more, she accepted the offer. Problem is, I don't know if I should expect any change in her perception of me. She says I'm a good guy, although stating that we won't be dating. My question is: what should I do? Should I hope for a miracle that she will change and will love me back? Should I move on and start finding another person to hook up with? Any kind of suggestion will help, 'cause I'm not sure what to do myself.
