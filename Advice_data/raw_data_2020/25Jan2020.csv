1,"My friend just called me up, hysterical. He just finished his third and final week of training for a second part time job at a phone company, mainly in one of the many stores they have. He decided to stay around for a bit and help out with a couple of customers; fist one? No problems. Second one...hoo boy.

From my understanding she was asking if they could restore some photos for her and they did that; he was watching one of his co-workers get the photos and she saw him watching so she said ""they're private"". He looks away and thinks that she's out of the store when he says ""if I'm behind the counter you can assume I'm training; like, what the fuck?"" But the co-workers point out that she's still in the store...right by the door actually. he feels HORRIBLE about this and she was long gone before he could go after her and apologize to this woman; his co-workers are saying they don't know if he has a job with them anymore

I'm trying to get him to calm down and that it was an honest mistake that could happen to anyone...but what do you guys think? Is he screwed?",25Jan2020,1
2,"I don’t usually like to give my age out on the web, but I’m 14(M) and my parents are making me keep my door open all day except for when I sleep.  All I have been doing is playing video games in my room, not looking at porn or doing anything illegal.  I just feel more comfortable with my door shut.  I have a limited amount of time each day to play on the computer (2 Hours), and I have been honest about that to my parents.  However, I think they still suspect that I am lying about it and they threatened to remove my door.  Is this something normal for people my age? Does anyone know how to help? Thank you!",25Jan2020,1
3,"I’m currently a senior and I am struggling... especially financially. My current job doesn’t pay me that much to support myself and I do not get any hours. I’ve just been hired at an amazing job that provides benefits, insurance, and a $20 an hour pay. Insurance is a great bonus for me, because my insurance has recently cut me off completely. I’ve already done all of the paperwork to my job. However, I’ve had to hold back on starting the actual job because the 2 weeks of training begins during school hours, and now I am stuck on what to do. 

I know this isn’t the greatest plan, but I am thinking of dropping out of high school to go to this job, earning my GED immediately, all while earning the money I desperately need for myself and for me to be able to move out of my household. My family is far from rich. I pay my own bills and I cannot even do that right now. My parents, especially my step father, is horribly mean to me every day of my life. We got into a big argument today and he put his middle finger up, recorded me on his phone crying my eyes out, and chased me out of the house. I thought he was going to kill me. 

My main focus right now is to make money. I am so depressed with the way my life is, and unfortunately, my high school life/grades are the worst they have ever been. Any advice?",25Jan2020,1

7,"Tl:dr 26M with good paying job, lost between staying at said job in not as nice of an area vs moving to place with less pay but better area. 

I hope this doesn’t become too long and if you stay with me then I truly appreciate the empathy. 

I got out of the military this year, I was living in Southern California and absolutely loved the area. I got into lots of outdoor sports which was a childhood dream of mine, and I feel like I really came out of my shell. I hated being in the military and I expected that going in, it’s hard to explain but it was something I always wanted to do mainly because I respected my grandparents so much who were in WW2. I felt like it was a good coming-of-age quest and it would be good for my personality to experience some grit. 

I was too much of an individual to get sucked into the military mentality but I gave it my all in terms of working hard and trying to be a good person which helped me get into supervisor positions (I was in an aircraft maintenance shop.) 

I made excellent friends, but I COULD NOT wait to finally be free. I knew I was going to miss the area and the friends but I felt that the freedom would cure all my angst. The skills I had learned helped me to get a super good job back home (New England area) and now I’m debt free, and essentially anything in life financially has been made available to me. I don’t mean buying Ferrari’s and having a mansion but essentially all my needs will be met and I can save up for any significant purchase in a very short amount of time. 

The job has zero stress (huge contradiction from the military) and during the frequent downtime, I am allowed to catch up on reading or anything else while on the clock. It really is a perfect job but is pretty monotonous. For some reason I am so unfulfilled and everyday that goes by I get anxiety about everything, I have a hard time connecting with my friends here, I feel extremely lost and all I want to do is move back to California and be with my military friends. We used to go on backpacking trips, mountain biking trips and all sorts of camping events during our free time. I don’t do that nearly as much anymore and it makes me feel like I gave up the stuff that I truly liked doing all for money. 

My childhood dream has always been to own a farm, so this is where my boring story takes a turn (please still be reading.) I’m not talking big agriculture, more of just being self sustainable and having property where I can enjoy my self. My current job makes this an absolute reality, but I’m forced with stay in an area that I don’t really enjoy day to day. I liked being in California more but the job would not pay as much and I don’t know how I would feel 10 years down the road with not nearly as much saved up or anything for my future planned out, but I would probably enjoy my time more. 

The other part of me wants to not deal with any of this at all and travel the world working on farms or living in a commune, which doesn’t sound like a good plan in the long run. 

SOOOO if you made it this far then I love you. 

Do I leave my stress free, good paying, cushy job that is pretty boring and the area sucks for my hobbies, OR go back to a place where I would enjoy my self more in the day to day but really have no future because I’ll never make the same money.",25Jan2020,1
8,"Hi guys.

First full on post to reddit, throwaway account. 

I'm going through turmoil in my life. 

I honestly dont know what to do. 

When I was in my teens, I've cometo realize I had a dismissive-avoidant personality type. 

Thanks to some childhood trauma, I would meet guys, and as soon as they started liking me back I would shut them out. 

Later, at about 17, I met this guy, and I decided that enough was enough, and I would commit to having a full on relationship, because I wanted to be normal. 

I did, and we were together for 7 years. The last 4 were the worst time of my life. He became abusive, mentally and sometimes physically, and I honestly don't know why I didn't leave. I think that this relationship robbed me of all my friends and hobbies, and so I didnt think I could get anyone else. 

Until one day. 
When I got wasted with a long time friend, and we ended up hooking up. 

Now this friend, he came from a fucked up relationship aswell. 

The day after we hooked up, I felt that teen feeling again. 

I wanted to be as far away from that abusive asshole as possible, and whenever he talked to me, I just felt.. Indifference. 

I broke it off 3 days later. 

That summer I went to festivals, hooked up with a couple of guys, and just all around had fun. 

But that first gjy, that old friend, just had a special place. 

So we kept that going, and eventually graduated into a relationship. 

Well, that was about 4 months after the abusive relationship stopped. I know, too soon, but I really trusted him, knew he had a similar experience to mine in his previous relationship, and just simply felt really connected to him. 

That's where things went kind of sour. 

I really love this guy. With all my heart. 

We've talked about kids. But lately, he's started to become distant, and talk less. 

And looking better when his housemate comes around (she lives away, but has some college courses unfinished so comes around a week per month). 

I'm pretty sure he's cheating on me with her. 

And hinestly, if he isnt, he's just distanced himself from me, and shrugs me off when I try and get some reassurance. 

Lately, it's been feeling like my old relationship all over again.

So my question for you is, what should I do? 

Why did this happen? What in my personality triggers this in people? 

Did I over commit? 

I have so many questions.",25Jan2020,1
9,"I'm new here lmk if this isnt the place to post this but.

I did agree to stay here initially and  she was hesitant at first but needed help with the bills

Im currently renting a garage space from my step mother I pay $500 of the $1600 rent. Here are the problems.

She only allows one guest over (my girlfriend)
There is one bathroom that she does not clean and leaves Pampers and clothes on the floor
My garage space does not have flooring (just wood that I can get splinters on if I walk barefoot. And my brother has already got one and she doesnt let them in here. (Its been three months)
I have access to the living room but it's a total mess all of the time kids toys and even a slide there.



I asked if my girlfriend can move in she said she would have to pay $300!!? Extra on top of the $500 I'm paying 

And not only that the internet which was agreed to be in the agreement has been off for 3 days


Am I being taken advantage of or should I be grateful I live in Denver and can find something about the same for maybe $100-$200 more

I can help her stay afloat and I live very close to the light rail (train).


More info 
No it's not cheaper to leave, I'd end up paying around $700 a month max for a room. Our relationship is ok but shes very manipulative and a liar  also she said this which was the last straw

If I am up early or before everyone is up shell come and look at me then go back into her room, I brought this up to her and said it was kind of creepy and she insinuated I was hallucinating. After I said the next time it happens I'll say something then and there she then came up with some excuse to why she was doing so.

She literally goes into my space when she knows I'm not home",25Jan2020,1

Now every single one of my online friends has blocked me - some of them I've been friends with for years. I've been banned from the forum and everybody believes them and hates me now.

11,"I think the title is self explanatory but I wanna give some more context as to what my anxiety is like. 

First of all, it’s in my genes, I’ve been cursed with this bs since I could remember. It changed over the years from being simple panic attacks when I was a little kid to worrying about everything as I do now. Most days I can manage it, I don’t feel the adrenaline rush or the feeling like my heart is going to explode. There have been episodes in the past where I would go days with feeling nothing but anxiety (which also made me physically sick) and I was prescribed a medication (hydroxyzine/atarax) for it, only temporary, no refills, that was 3 years ago. I felt like I didn’t need medication because I’m okay most days, however it’s gotten worse this past year. 

It’s affected my sleep. I don’t have troubles falling asleep but I wake up a lot in the middle of the night. My spikes happen when I’m eating which ruins my appetite, spikes in the morning as soon as I wake up making me feel like I can’t function enough to go to work. Sometimes I’ll be at work, having a good day and suddenly I get that weird feeling in my chest and I’m unable to breathe. I’ve had multiple breakdowns at work (some had legit reasons but not all). I’ve isolated myself from socializing too much to avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed, I procrastinate to avoid feeling the same way which obviously is the exact opposite as to what I should do.  

I’ve considered therapy, sadly it’s not an optimal solution for me right now since I am moving out of my parents home in a few months and need money saved. I also don’t know who to talk to about this and my medication made me tired all the time and didn’t work that well. Keeping busy doesn’t seem to work as well anymore nor do any of my other hobbies. I feel stuck and hopeless that I’m gonna be like this for the rest of my life and that it’s gonna get worse no matter what.",25Jan2020,1

I have some money saved up but don't know how to hire someone to teach me or if there are places that can let me borrow a car.

I can’t even hate the company that fire me because the people there were so nice to me when I was there and they seemed to take really great care of their workers.

I’m an idiot, I got an art history degree, totaled my stupid fucking affordable paid off car a month ago, and now I have $500 in car payments and insurance a month with my first car payment in two weeks. I’m sad tipsy right now, probably don’t make sense, but feel like absolute shit. The agency that did the temp hiring is collecting my stuff from my desk tomorrow and I can collect it Monday. They said I got terrible feedback but I always arrived early, basically worked from 7:45 or 8:00 straight through 4:30-5:00 no fuss and I made a few little mistakes but I always fessed up to them. I only ever took maybe 10 minutes total in my day to use he bathroom and chat on discord between spreadsheet entries. It took me seven months of bumming off my parents to get this job and for all that I only got five months of it. I don’t know what to do or where to even start working besides going back to being stressed to the max after every 3 hour retail hell shift and crying myself to sleep because people like to pick on me as a retail worker and that’s the easiest job to get and find.

19,"I hope the ‘how do you?’ turns into a ‘how to’ by asking the question here.

Physically and mentally disabled persons are abused and taken advantage of all the time. In this case the victim is my mother. The abuser is her husband for 30+ years. My mother was physically disabled to varying degrees for years. He appointed himself sole caretaker and shut down any suggestions from the family. He was controlling and made us all think she was just “crazy” when she openly complained about her treatment.  He maintained a well crafted ‘good man’ image that just hid a monster underneath. The entire family was gaslighted by this creep for years.
He is 10 years younger and wanted to get on with his life so He slowly killed her by over medicating her. He never settled her estate with us kids and instead this year at the holidays (2 years after moms death) he informed us he was moving his new girlfriend into the house and we could ‘deal with it or don’t come’. The new GF has the same name as my mother... and we never even met her before this announcement.
Needless to say I did NOT come to the holidays and told him exactly how I felt about him.
He won’t give us my moms personal belongings and it just eats me up!! I am helpless to seek justice against this creep.

21,"This is my first post on Reddit, please be nice!

After a long shift at work I come home and realize I need to do laundry. I worked the next day and had no clean scrubs left. In my sleepy State doing laundry was the last thing I felt like doing but it had to be done. I put it in the washer and wait the 50 minutes for it to finish. When I open the washing machine I realize there is a tube of ChapStick in the drum. No biggie at least it didn't go in the dryer right? So I set the dryer and I go to sleep. I wake up the next morning, grab a pair of Scrubs from the dryer and get ready for work. I think I went about half a day before realizing there was a  greasy stain on the thigh of my pants. I get home, check my dryer and to my surprise find a half-melted tube of Vaseline it. At my workplace the air is very dry so I always carry some lotion and some lip chap on me and I sometimes forget to take it out of my scrubs. I checked the other clothes in the dryer and to my horror I realized that basically everything in the dryer has some sort of stain on it from the Vaseline. Now here is my problem: I have tried three different times to get the stains out. Once with normal stain remover, once with pink solution stain remover which claims to get rid of anything, and once with chalk. The chalk was recommended by YouTuber who said that the chalk would break up the oils or something like that. After washing it with chalk and realizing nothing had happened I looked back at the YouTube video and realize that she said you have to use old-fashioned chalk because the new types of chalk have wax in them. So my question is this: does anyone have any tips or tricks for getting petroleum jelly stains out of clothing? There were a lot of scrubs in that load and some other clothes that would be very pricey to buy again. Please advise me how to get these stains out!!

The friendship started out fine, but over time he just became kind of a drag to be around. He would come over to my house, and start cooking my food. At times he would be a Narcissistic Liar. (e.g. He says he will only go to a school that offers him a full-ride scholarship, but has 400k dollars in his 529) He also says very insensitive things like ""Bro I think your dog is dying"" in a joking manner, even though she actually is dying. He also once came over and took my lighter and my oil can and made a flame thrower out of it, and started firing around. I told him to stop multiple times, but he wouldn't. At one point I had my arm around his neck on the floor, and he pointed it at my face and fired. Luckily I didn't catch fire. I was able to grab it from him and kick him out of my house.

So when somebody criticizes me for doing something wrong, I apologize and they're not satisfied I tend to say something along the lines of ""Yes I am [negative attribute they are accusing me of] and I need to change that.""


 Apparently that makes people really uncomfortable? Because they think I'm seeking reassurance from them that I don't have said bad quality or compliments, when that's not my intention.

It is basically an investment scam, where clients would invest their money into our ""stocks"". The catch is that clients are not allowed to withdraw their money in large sums, and their gains are all fake - there are no stocks. If they ask to leave and shut down their accounts, the balance drops to zero and their account is terminated with no way of tracing it. I would leave this stupid place, I would report them to the police, every minute I spend there feels like hell, but I am so in need of the money and there are no other jobs I can work. 

I go to college, have massive debts, and live alone in a foriegn country where English-speakers are a very small minority. I came here with a plan and a reliable source of income, but things went down the drain very quickly when the business was shut down by the police, as my business partner was not fully transparent with me and had done some illegal things under the table that got him in prison and ruined the business. 

I would try free-lance, but I cannot find anything that will sustain me or help me pay my debts, and I'm really struggling because I am a med student with barely enough time to even breathe, and this scammer job pays really well and has unbelievably flexible hours. 

I am conflicted, I am scared, and I don't know what to do. 

I sit in front of that desk every day, trying to get the clients away from this scam, but some of them are still convinced regardless of how rude I am to them. I still try to keep it a bit covert because I don't want to get fired.

34,So I'm in 10th grade and in 8th grade I met a girl who meant the world to me. She became my best friend and eventually I developed feelings for her. Unfortunately I'm a very insecure person and I became scared that she was using me as a way to stop herself from being bored. I was scared that she was only talking to me to not be bored but I was too scared to confront her. Instead of confronting her I stopped talking to her completely and I waited for her to confront me. I thought that that would be my only way of talking it out because I was too scared to confront her. Eventually we did talk things out but things were never the same. The worst part is that she had developed feelings for me and was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I felt like shit because I hurt the most important person in my life and I missed my one shot at true love. One day I asked if we were still friends and she told me we were but she just hasnt been on social media as much. I responded to that by telling her I felt shitty that things would never be the same and she didnt respond. After that we never spoke again and she ended her social media break so she was back online posting. After months of hoping she would talk to me I blocked her and prepared to end it completely. Eventually I unblocked her but didnt follow her again but the feelings still havent left me. We havent talked in almost a year but my feelings for her are still haunting me. I want to follow her again and try to patch things up but I'm afraid that she thinks I'm a piece of shit and it's not gonna work out.

The women was in bikini or lingerie and was not naked but was laying belly down on a bed in with a provocative look on her face. The image was a link to see webcam girls. I did not click. I closed my Gmail and delete web browser history. I am nervous now that I could be fired for looking at a explicit email. Any advice would help.,25Jan2020,1

39,"I am having a hard time in life right now. 25 year old male. Estranges from parents, live by myself which is uncommon in my society/country. Society/your parents don't expect you to live home unless you marry. Most people leave home in their 30s. Living by yourself in your 20s is a big red flag here, people instantly associate it with estrangement from family.

Anyways, I am menally ill. My depression skyrocketed again, I am suicidal again. Got subtstance abuse problems too. Right now I am starting a drug/alcohol session. Can't avoid it, it numbs the pain.

My parents are the only people that genuinely love me and I am isolated and I really need their love right now. I miss my pets, a stray dog I adopted and a jack russell. I miss them. I cry a lot. My parents physically and mentally tortured me for many years, it's hard to forgive and forget, but we patched things up on new year. 

My parents know my problems, maybe they don't know the extent of them. I am an only son. My dad has a bastard daughter, 12 year old, sometimes I feel he cares more about her and my older cousins.

Honestly I don't know how to approach parents. I need company and they seem to be willing to give love back. But they habe their own problems, I'd feel guilty being a burden. I burden everyone. Got a doctor too, I do therapy and take my meds.",25Jan2020,1
41," 

So I (24 female ) have been seeing this guy for about 10 months. For the last 9 months we were just sleeping together. I decided to finally talk to him at that point to see what he wanted. I personally am going through a lot and don't think it's the right time to be in a relationship. About a year ago I was sexually assaulted and am still dealing with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. All of which I do not want to share with this person. I asked him where he was at. He told me he had a lot of person things going on, and that he really liked me and cared about me but didn't want to be in a relationship because he was dealing with depression and the loss of his mom. I understood since I am also in the same place. We both agreed that we would communicate with each other if we started seeing someone new and also disclosed to each other that for the last few months we had only been seeing each other. I felt pretty good about our conversation.

A few weeks later our relationship changed - turning more ""relationshipy"" he called me every night while he was on vacation, brought me back a souvenir, and pretty much hung out 4-5 days of the week. Which I mean, I am not complaining.. I really like him.

for the last month things have just been feeling different. Even got me a birthday present. Anyway he has been joking a lot about having a child and also moving in together since I am looking for a new place.

I talked to my friends and they think it's super strange that he is constantly making jokes about having a child.

exp:

""We should have a baby""

""Are you pregnant yet? We've just been having so much sex""

""I think you're ready to be a mom""

""Oh, you don't want to have a baby with me, this is awkward. ""

Is this weird?",25Jan2020,1
42,"i know it sounds crazy, but its just uncomfortable, i sometimes wish it was smaller so that when i get a boner it wouldn't rise above my pants, AND IT SUCKS i feel it touching my belly button and i have a sensitive belly button so it tickles. when im wearing joggers without compression boxers(uncomfortable) my penis can be seen from outside my pants. I always think a teacher or someone can notice it so i try to end the conversation really quick. 

this was more a nag or something i needed to tell someone more than advice, but i NEED advice on what to do, should i wear a cup?!?!?",25Jan2020,1
43,"I am wondering if there's a reason for it and if I can do something to fix it, because it's affecting my relationships. 

It feels like someone talking for a longer period of time stresses me out a lot basically. My heart rate goes up too. 

I'll use my best friend as an example. When we're talking to each other, and she gets really excited about a subject and talks 10,15, 20 minutes about something I not only zone out but also get restless, as if I have to move, change how I'm sitting, get up etc. I literally can't understand what she's saying anymore. I look at her and see her talk but unless I concentrate very hard on every word, I don't understand the meaning of it. I can focus a bit more when I move around then. It's a really weird feeling. I'm not bored by what she's saying. 

If the conversation is mostly equally weighted - as in, both me and the other person talk an equal-ish amount of time, or even if I get a chance to speak every few minutes - focusing is much easier and I don't get as stressed out. 

This happens with almost everyone I know. It's the worst with my boyfriend because he changes subjects lightning-fast sometimes and it physically makes me dizzy. Like, the room starts actually spinning on top of me being stressed out. 

I don't understand why this keeps happening. I'm not bored at all by what's being said, and I desperately want to listen/understand but I just can't do it ... 

Does anyone know why this happens and how I can fix it?",25Jan2020,1
44,"So I’m a 15 year old girl who goes to online school and I never really leave my house.

I’ve only really ever had one friend who moved to another state in 7th grade. I really wanna go and meet people, but I have suuuuper bad anxiety and I don’t know where to start. I’ve tried to make friends from a youth group at my moms church, but it ended up not working out. I’ve also tried to make friends from reddit, but it also never really worked out plus I kinda want a real life connection.

45,"So I met this guy three weeks ago and i don't know if i'm just paranoid, but i think he is flirting with me.

I asked my other friends what they thought, and they all agreed they sense that, for him, there's more to this friendship.

However i grew to dislike him very much. I will not go into detail, just know that im always irritated and drained after spending time with him.

He now invited me to his birthday celebration, which is more like a hangout in the mall, in which i don't know a lot of people that will go.

I'm in a dilemma. My options are:

•(since i don't want to be rude and turn him down, specially if i said i'd go before) i would go and spend a few hours and leave early, giving him an average gift;
•say some kind of excuse and feel guilty about not going, and buying a good present;

What should i do? If not those, what else?

What he finds funny and the stuff he talks about are usually equivalent to what 12-14 year olds like. He's turning 18 this year. We are the same age. Usually I try to ignore his dumb jokes and ""pranks"" but sometimes he says pretty inappropriate stuff (e.g WW3 memes in a group chat) and sometimes know about what most people consider basic knowledge. He's good at heart but sometimes his lack of knowledge and thought can result in him saying some pretty insensitive stuff. I once told him maybe he should think more before acting and he got kinda bummed out and was like that sounds so boring and tiring. Our other mutual friend also mentioned shes really afraid hes gonna become like an incel. He has mentioned he wanted to become more mature. I really hope he gets better at being independent and responsible for his own issues but he seems to feel zero urgency regarding anything. It sucks to say this because its kinda like forcing people to conform but I really hope he ends up learning how to communicate with other people and make more friends outside of me and another 2 schoolmates. However, I dont know how to help him and sometimes talking to him makes me feel like im babysitting again. So basically nowadays ive been thinking about the problems 1. How to help him 'grow up'   2.

He was also a big motivation for me to choose this path. I was able to keep my thoughts clear when doing it but it's gotten so much harder. All I do is think about them, I'm instantly put back into the hospital hearing her last words to me. I don't know how to enjoy the hobby anymore, I sometimes break down crying.

I’m afraid he’s gonna disappear or maybe he’s talking to other girls, which is weird because I never felt this way before with someone. I never worried about these kind of things.

55,"Hey 

Sorry for bothering but this is something I feel like I really need to get off my chest. I'm a 24 years old dude working as a nurse. I live by myself in a small but relatively nice apartment. I can't say my life is bad these years. I have a stable job I love, I have a few friends and could probably get into a relationship too if I tried dating someone. 

But no matter how good things look I feel like I'm being haunted by my past. In short there is a lot of crazy shit I went trough and I can't shake this feeling that it's a burden that will keep dragging me down no matter what I do. 

Longer version: My childhood sucked. We were crazy poor and my parents didn't do anything other than fight constantly. More often that not it would end with my either my dad beating up my older brother or/and my mom threatening to kill us all when we fall asleep. Or that she will kill herself because of whatever we did she didn't like. I had a room with broken window with fucking ice forming inside as I slept. They didn't fix it of course. 

Then there's this stuff that keeps coming back to me and makes me feel like shit. I traveled to school on a bus as a kid. Got thrown into class full of rich kids and bullied. I would always get just enough money to pay for the bus and it sometimes happened that my classmates took that money from me. There was a time when I had to walk for hours to get home and my older brother refused to take a bus and walked with me. Makes me feel so bad for the guy because later on I would become the older brother for him as he fell into alcohol addiction and I couldn't help him no matter what. Then there was a day I was 10 cents short on money and had to act like I just dropped it somewhere so that I don't have to walk home for hours in freezing cold. All that bullshit and then when you get home and don't do some chores or they aren't to mom's standard you get called a bastard and much worse stuff. Also for some reason I really loved my dad. He was a funny guy and had interesting hobbies like IT, games, puzzles whatever. I had good memories with him he and when they divorced he was automatically proclaimed the worst person on earth universally hated and blamed for everything at home. In short I kept visiting him for around two years then after a big fight he had with my mom didn't see him until a year ago. 

So when I moved out my mom got basically super lucky. A super rich old women basically ""adopted"" her and gave her money to start running a few pubs. She owns them now and makes a ton of money from them. I got younger siblings too that thankfully don't grow up in poverty. But they do often get the shitty treatment we got. Funniest part for me is that for some reason my mom was always considered a hero trough all this. Everyone saying she's a single mom caring about us when all she did most of the time is yell and complain. Even now she loves to complain how hard is it to run a business but whenever I visit all she does is sleep or sit around playing games on her phone while her boyfriend takes care of business and my siblings clean up the house. 

It makes me feel like shit but I feel like there's a strong hate in me towards her. And it's getting stronger. She keeps patting herself on the back while she and my dad are the ones who fucked us up as kids. And it's getting to a point where I don't call when I come to visit for a few days and just pack my stuff after few hours and leave because I'm getting angry each time she talks to me. All those years of emotional abuse fucked me up and I can guarantee if I told her she would make  me look like ungrateful shit.

But to the point. I feel like I can't escape all this. No matter how good I feel these things always creep up on me. I will never be able to change that I went trough all that shit. Then I see people like Chester Bennington and can't stop thinking that there's a chance that no matter how good will I do in life I will never run away from this. I'm here really wanting to change this. If anyone has experience or advice for  me that would mean a lot. 

Thank you and have a great day.",25Jan2020,1

We have been trying for 3 months first with a Waxahachie Walmart then midlothian Walmart and now a cedar hill Walmart, but no luck. His store has already approved him and even sent an email asking for a reply for the transfer to those stores, but on email and phone calls we keep getting ignored and it seems even the personnel person at his store can’t get through to anyone.

60,"Disclaimer: First time poster and on phone. 

I need advice on how to deal with my parents. I can never talk to them properly about things that directly affect my health (food timing, sleep timing etc.) or things like having trouble with my friends (they’ll just ask me to focus on my schoolwork, but I’m one of those that’ll get seriously affected by my emotions. I tried but trying to ignore it but it’ll just build up to a full-on panic if it’s not resolved.). 

I can chit-chat or talk to them about my life or my friends and worries about my friends and I know they care in their own way. But the above stuff that I can’t talk about are really what matters most to me. The food/sleep timing related stuff will start on argument, no matter how much I say I really have no choice because the school timing really messed up my body clock and I honestly rather follow my school’s time for food because I’m there 5 days vs 2 days I’m at home. For other things it’s a mix of school workload causing me sleep late or me just wanting to stay up past 12am (I end up sleeping at around 1-2am).

Honestly I’m giving up on them already, and it’s already been showing in my behaviour a bit but they don’t get why. Most of the things I want to do are honestly experiments that if I find it effective, I’ll continue doing, otherwise I’ll stop. And some stuff I want to do is to just blend in with my current group of friends, I’m already known as the sheltered kid, I don’t want to be the outcast. I was the odd one out for awhile and it really affected me school-wise, mainly the feeling of seeing everyone having large groups of friends while I’m alone, and I can only really ignore it while I’m home. And that’s only because I end up burying those feelings instead of dealing with them which I should’ve, but if I talk to my parents, I’ll get things like just focus on your schoolwork or their life stories of how they experienced it and dealt with it by ignoring it (with how social media is expanding I highly doubt that works anymore, because you need connections to go up in life, now more than ever). 

And finally there is my little sister who has autism. I honestly feel she’s a super entitled brat due to my parents caving in more easily with her and spoiling the shit out of her. Like they used to give her whatever she wants to get her to talk, coax her to go to kindergarten by bringing her out shopping,basically bribing her all the time. I strongly suspect her recent temper tantrums are mostly due to the way she was raised and now that my parents are trying to not give in so often to her (result tends to be a shouting match between her and my parents, if my dad’s involved, he’ll end up raging and get out of the house). My parents expect me to raise her when they can’t but I honestly don’t want to, especially if she still acts like an entitled brat. It’s a really big burden on the wallet and there’s no guarantee that I’ll be as successful as them, plus that’s assuming I don’t get married (my future partner certainly didn’t sign up for this why should I burden them with this? Especially if they have no interest in it). Let’s face it, by the time I have to take care of her I’m probably married with kids. With how bad her tantrums are starting to be and how it tend to be over minor things I fear the impression she’ll give my future kids(if any) and I can’t expect my partner to accept having to live with her. (I’ve seen other Reddit post of people with partners in this situation asking if they’re the ass for not wanting to be involved and the responses I see tend to be NTA so I’m not going there.) 

So guys, any advice on how to deal with my parents? Because I’m desperate and honestly believe it’s a reason for me wanting to die young (so I won’t have to experience old age and all the pains that come with it that’s caused by my current school schedule induced health issues that they won’t help me with , plus I won’t have to raise my sister if I’m dead).",25Jan2020,1

64,"We are only in 7th grade, but my one friend wants to date really bad and has been confessing to a lot of guys she likes. She’s been pretty depressed lately because they’ve all been turning her down. She gets mad really quickly and upset because of it, but I don’t blame her, maybe there’s more to it, I don’t know. Sometimes she says she wants to die and it makes me concerned.

Recently, she started dating one guy. He broke up with her only a day or two after, no idea why, but I see him as a jerk now. She texted our friend group chat that she wanted to die again. I begged her not to and the next day at school she said she wouldn’t kill herself. She seemed very happy that day, really happy, so I believed she was fine now.

Then came the next day.

She was happy again until lunchtime. She pulled me aside where no one would see us and she showed me her wrist. It was red and her skin was being irritated. She was trying cut herself. I looked at it in disbelief, she was still smiling, then slowly she began crying and I hugged her and talked to her. She said she’s been faking being happy all day. I didn’t really know what to do because she had so many problems, yet I don’t know what they are and she won’t talk to me about it. I told her that if she felt like cutting herself or dying, talk to me.

When I got home, she texted our group that she cut her wrist with a fork.

I talked to the people in that group chat at school. Should we tell the counselors? But if we did, she would get mad at us and have no close friends to talk to afterwards.

I'm meeting them tomorrow evening for dinner and it feels like such a chore to go through with it. I was thinking to end it tomorrow night (like ripping off a bandaid) but it all just seems so insensitive and like I'm just adding to their misery. 

They were looking forward to having dinner with me. And I feel like I'm going to ruin it.

69,"My boyfriend borrowed my car the other night, bc his was parked far away (we live in the freezing midwest). My gas was on E and I intended to fill it up in the morning. Anyway, my boyfriend had to fill it up in order to drive it. When he got home, he mentioned that he had filled the gas tank up for me and I thought it was sweet. I thanked him.

The next day I got in the car and saw he filled it up only halfway. He used hardly any gas (he just went across the street) but - still. It felt like the nice thing to do, or the chivalrous thing to do would have been to fill it up all the way. For some reason, filling it up halfway made him seem stingy and cheap and really turned me off.

We are in our thirties. He has plenty of money and the cost of a full tank of gas is nothing for him.

70,"I have a few friends that are part of this  let’s call them Jack, Victoria, Charlie, and Braxton  we will start one year ago. Freshmen year (Charlie is Jacks brother and both of them are my step brother) 


A while ago Jack and Victoria were in an abusive relationship. Victoria would kick and hit Jack and us. No one really thought about it too much till I brought it up at a sleepover and we chatted till he changed the subject so Charlie decided to look at his messages and like holy shat he was being Manipulated and mistreated. Charlie didn’t approve of the relationship in the beginning and man she’s been totally bad talking him. Charlie found a way into Jack’s messages on instagram and looked at them. She tried to convince him to not be friends with us anymore and it made me pretty upset how he tried to comply verbally but wouldn’t do what he said they did some bad stuff over text too (stuff not following our bro code which is like pretty intense) and we went along with it and then Charlie talked to him and Jack just started punching him over and over. I’m no where near as big as Jack or Charlie and so I got thrown Braxton broke them up from fighting. And we dismissed it but then Charlie was done with it he made these sides with the slogan bro’s over hoes and Braxton is good friends with Jack they are always hanging out and playing video game together. Braxton wanted the fighting to stop I wanted them to stop dating. I called some of my 2 other friends  and told them fractions and asked them what’s up they were both in the neutral party cause I didn’t tell them the other stuff.  On a sort of party day at school we had someone of the group in twos  follow him to make sure he doesn’t do anything he will regret. We confront him at the end of the day after seeing him try to get away and hang out with her. We tell him you have to choose and he choose us we were cool for that time. 





Flash forward to now Braxton and I have started hanging out every weekend when I get a notification about a contact having a new Instagram account opened and I check it out it’s jacks new Instagram and he mention getting old Instagram pictures back recently. But I didn’t believe him he hated Instagram after what happened but then I noticed he was following only one person..Victoria so I tell Charlie and Braxton and we take a look. Charlie knows Jacks Instagram password so we all bounce back on the cons and pros of doing this we end up doing it in a moment of Curiosity. We find too much it’s horrible worse than the first time 10 times worse there was so very bad stuff.  
He doesn’t know anything and she doesn’t either and they plan on doing something bad soon.

71,"i wanna ask out my crush. Now listen please.

- i went to 2 clinics and to my OWN normal doctor.
i asked about removing the raised mole above my lip, and the clinics said they cant remove it/ i would have to get stitches.

- My own normal doctor actually said he could do it, but i decided not to, cause at that time i didn’t visit the clinics yet, and it was also Tuesday so i had to go to school with a bandaid or something.

However, i didn’t ask my own normal doctor if he ALSO uses stitches just like the clinics do. 

i can ask him on Wednesday. That means i could get the removal on Thursday, then skip school to heal on the Friday and weekend. (Then on Monday i can ask out my crush)

- THE PROBLEM: What if i wait until next week then he also says he uses stitches as well? Then i’m not gonna remove it.... BUT that means i wasted this week when i could ask her out this Sunday instead

(i know she doesn’t care about a mole, but i hate it, and i’m planning to take a selfie with her and i wanna look the best i can while sitting face to face and just confessing and talking)

I accepted that because he meant everything to me, but then he told me this story about an anime.

74,"First of all, I’m on mobile so I’m sorry if the formatting here sucks. I’m in a Discord server with 12 other people, though not all of them are very active. One person, whom I’ll call A, has been friends with me for over a year, we’ve never met irl, but we’re pretty good friends. She created the server. Someone else in the server (I don’t know who) pmed her and asked her to talk to me about a joke I made. 

See, someone had sent a picture of a snake and called it cute, I said if you took a mallet to it then it’d be an even cuter belt. Harmless, or so I thought. Apparently, it made someone uncomfortable, and so, A asked me to chill on the ‘animal killing jokes’, I should mention that I’m not commonly making jokes about killing animals, so I was surprised. I haven’t responded to her message yet, but honestly, I’m mad for several reasons.

1- There are tons of things in the server that make *me* uncomfortable, but I haven’t gone complaining about it. These people have ignored a phobia of mine (which A 100% knows about) and still send things that trigger it, and I don’t make a fuss because I know they like it, so the fact that a joke set someone off is definitely irritating to me.

2- Whoever was bothered was apparently too cowardly to say this directly to me and instead went behind my back. I consider myself friends with the majority of these people so I don’t know why they couldn’t talk to me themselves.

3- This isn’t the first time someone’s complained over something small. It’s starting to get on my nerves. If something is offensive it has to be posted in a chat for triggering content.  An example of something deemed offensive was a picture of a NiceGuy saying women would be happier in the kitchen, I sent the pic to the chat and poked fun at him for thinking that way, and I was told to not send triggering content.

4- Nobody in the server is vegan or vegetarian, so isn’t it a bit hypocritical that it’s making them uncomfortable when I made that joke, but they still eat meat?

I don’t want to lose everyone there as a friend, but this sensitivity is just... ridiculous, to me, at least. I don’t know how to reply to A. Am I an a$$hole for thinking they’re too sensitive? Should I just go with it and say okay, or bring up my concerns? And if I should point them out, how can I do so without losing friends?",25Jan2020,1

Background: I was fired for breaching the code of ethics of my employer. But I am not 100% certain. Would like to have someone else's take on this. 

I was pulled into a meeting this past week with my supervisor, an internal investigator and HR. I was completely oblivious until the second the meeting started. I referred a family member for a role within the company, she was unable to complete the assessment using her computer so she asked me to do it for her. I agreed to open the page from the laptop i had on hand, which happened to be the company one. I opened the page, while I had her on the phone. I read the questions and answers out loud to her and allowed her to choose the best answers. 

Looking back, I absolutely know that I screwed up. I should have never accessed the assessment for her. 

I was asked a multitude of questions by the investigator and I answered honestly, going as far as to provide times for everything. To the minute.

This did not make a difference, I was fired on the spot.

I’m always there for her and listen to her, but I never really thought much of it because they’re always happy in public. This all changed the other night. 
We all went out after work and I could tell they were arguing through text. Within 30 minutes it had escalated with him telling our whole group how much of a cunt she was. We were ALL shocked.

They said things like “you deserved your rape,” “you need to kill yourself,” “i’ve never been happy with you,” and just a bunch of totally awful, mean things.

95,"I started doing my degree in electrical engineering in a college, mostly because i wanted to learn physics and math (Im almost at the end of the semester), and i just realized that i have good enough stats to get accepted to a university (which is considered a higher quality place than the college that im in at the moment) to do a degree in Physics with an emphasis on math (basically what i wanted to learn).

The thing is, is that i already made myself a big group of friends in my college, and from what i have been told the the treatment in the university towards their students is on a much lower level and much less personal than the college that im in now.

And if i do decide to switch to university the whole semester that i have been doing will go to waste.

Basically im having a hard time deciding if i should switch or not, on one hand, after ill do a degree in electrical engineering ill straight away go to the job industry, unlike a degree in physics and math which ill probably have to do a master in order to find a job (i was already really considering on doing a second degree in the future so its not that problematic).
On the college side, i already have a big group of friends, and the treatment towards the students is better and more personal.
And on the university side i do think that the degree there suits me more, and its a better quality place.

I am leaning more towards the university, but my family really wants me to stay where i am at the moment.

96,"This will be lengthy, and there will be a TL/DR at bottom of post.

History of my family and the relationships we have with each other and had with my father.

My father and mother married in 1987, they were in their early/mid 20s. My father started an oilfield service business in the western Texas panhandle along with my grandfather. My sister was born in 1987. By the time my brother was born in 1989 my father’s business had grown substantially. I was the youngest of the children, me being born in 1992. 

My father fought depression, and had severe bi-polar disorder. He took strattera for almost 25 years before his passing in 2019. He was an alcoholic who neglected his family and responsibilities to them to chase success, and recognition in the quarter horse world. Growing up we would drag race, and do plenty of activities together. Had plenty of good times along with plenty of bad. My sister, brother, and I have always remained close. In 2009 my brother had the first child of the three of us. In 2011 my brother was involved with the wrong people, and become addicted to methamphetamine. He went to prison for six years. During the time he was in prison my sister got married and had three children, my father and mother were divorced, and my father adopted my brothers son in the early years of my brothers sentence. 

My father remarried in 2010. I lived with my father and his new wife during my junior and senior year of high school. Upon graduating I attended college for a semester, I didn’t pass 1 class this semester and my father refused to pay for any more schooling so I had dropped out. My father and I hadn’t spoke again until 2019. My father abused my sisters credit, and got loans in her name to pay for race horses. My sister’s relationship with my father ended around the same time ours did in 2011/2012.

I married in 2016, and had my first child in 2018.

My father reconnected with my sister and myself in 2019. We visited once in early March, and once on Easter. With it being a really great time.

On May 19th, 2019 my father committed suicide.

Upon his passing my sister and I had discovered he left us each a life insurance policy. My sister’s was valued at 1.6m and mine at 400k. (USD). He carried these policies for 25+ years, so the manner of death didn’t matter in the payout. We also discovered he had 130k in IRS debt.

After getting his death certificate, we applied for our payout, only to find he had switched the beneficiary on both of our policies to a business associate none of his family, beyond my step-mother had met.

This is where it gets weird:
His insurance agent never processed the beneficiary forms to change it to his business associate. We have been involved in a legal battle since weeks after my fathers death.

(I can add more details to this later if anyone is interested, my dad wrote 11 books for each person he was involved with in his personal life detailing what he wanted to happen with the life insurance policies and his estate, one the insurance is paid out I can provide images of these books; it’s interesting and the people who I’ve shown, including a probate lawyer of 30+ years, had never seen anything like it)

Well, the business associate, my sister, and myself find came to a settlement and split the policy into thirds, granting each of us 667k each. This will be paid out in 3 weeks from when this post is created.

This is what I need advice on:
We have sold his race horses, and they have brought in less than 100k, and 80k of that went to the ranches the horses were stabled at.

Totaling 110k in IRS debt left, his estate was worthless beyond the land and house he owned and paid for. The land and house are valued at 300k.

My step mother expects me to pay the IRS debt to remain in the house, I feel this isn’t right to expect so much from someone.

I firmly believe I should pay the irs debt, and transfer the title of the house into my name. Maybe let her remain living at the home, if not, sell the home; pay myself back and give whatever is left to my father’s adopted son (brothers son) into a trust fund.

TL/DR:
Dad had life insurance policy worth 2m. I got 667k in proceeds. IRS debt totals 80k. Value of estate is 300k in a house. Step mom wants me to pay so she can stay but I am torn on my decision.

let me know of any questions you may have.

I responded saying I could just hold it until they can pick it up with cash in person, and asked when they'd be in town. No response as of yet, but I just sent it a few minutes ago.

105,"I never really like to go online for this kind of thing, but I figured I would try to get some clarity on the subject at hand. 

To preface this, I have never really thought the idea of long distance / online dating was a good idea. It just seems like it would be hard to maintain. But I was playing online on CSGO in early November with a bunch of random people and used voice chat and met a girl. We won the match, she added me cause I was communicating and being goofy. Long story short, we ended up talking for weeks, eventually adding each other on snapchat. We would play daily and talk whenever we weren't playing. We were into the same things and had similar interests. She helped me through the last bit of schooling I had left and it was awesome. It was nice finishing up school, getting hired at an internship and finally meeting someone that actually seemed to care and like me.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't just some random person that I met online at this point because we had talked about many personal things and would talk about personal issues with family, school work and etc. It got to the point where we knew so much about each other and I thought I knew for sure she was honest. She told me really personal stuff (such as getting raped as a child, suffering from major depression, and having a lot of real life issues). She confessed that she liked me and to be honest I liked her back. From mid November until two days ago we would talk almost everyday and play games together, unless she was busy or feeling super depressed. Of course there were arguments like regular ""relationships"" about not answering texts or worrying about talking to other people. There were times where she got upset and ignored me before, but it was never longer than a day.

Eventually I asked if we could ever date, and she said she does like doing long distance relationships, but loves me so its hard. Around the holidays she was getting stressed and depressed and wasn't talking too much, I got upset but understood. Since then she was not as talkative and I could tell something was up, but she continued to say she loved me and talked to me everyday so I dismissed it. Before getting on she would always say "" I am getting soon, dont start a game without me"" or something along those lines.

But then the other day she said ""Let me play a few games by myself then i will play and hop into discord"". She would normally get like this when she was depressed or tired, just not in the mood to talk. So I waited for her a few hours, no follow up. So I asked her ""So I assume you aren't playing with me tonight, Ive been waiting for yah?"", which resulted in her saying ""dude we arent talking like this anymore, I said no relationship and you are treating it like it is one"".  I then said I wished she would of expressed it earlier because I would of respected it. I was thrown off guard because we were just saying how much we loved each other a few days before and she sent me some ""pictures"". I would occasionally ask her if it was okay to say ""I love you"" or other similar shit, and she always got offended when I asked.  

&amp;#x200B;

I told her this could of been different if she just elaborated on what she wanted, and that I still thought of her as a really good friend. She then asked me to leave her alone and that she doesn't want to do this. So I figured she was just being emotional about something and I pushed a button at the wrong time. I waited until the next day to talk and jokingly asked if she hated my guts and she proceeded to block me on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

**To elaborate on a few things in case there are any questions:**

I knew for a fact it was not a catfish, we facetimed a lot and sent each other snapchats. 

I never said/did anything without making sure it was okay with her. 

We've had bad arguments but never ended in her blocking me on everything. 

Normally I try to avoid any ""romantic"" relationships with girls because I am in a part of my life where I need to get things situated. However, it was nice having someone who I genuinely thought cared about me. It was nice, even if it was just a three month relationship I felt as if I found a new best friend. I opened up to someone and it just ended so quickly. A day before she blocked me we were talking like normal and there seemed to be nothing wrong. 

My question is not how do I get her back or win her back, because at this point I think it's over with no recovery. I guess my question is how do I recover from something like this mentally? Could this random action of blocking me mean something? Was she seeing other people and got guilty and decided to block me out of her life instead of telling me?

&amp;#x200B;

I dont even think I am too sad about it at this point, I just feel like I have been thrown away.",25Jan2020,1

112,"Throwaway account because I don't want my friends finding this, and on mobile so sorry for formatting.

The title says it all, and I don't know what to do. To start off with some context, I am a 17 year old boy who's just passed his first semester of senior year. For the sake of this story, I will dub myself as Jake, as well as some others. About 2 years ago, my cousin (whom we shall call Tom) introduced me to his best friend at her party, (whom we shall call Kate). It was on halloween day, and since we were Sophomores, we were all in costumes. I remember immediately being attracted to her, but I figured it was just because she was pretty, as well as in a slightly revealing costume. I also learned of her boyfriend, who shall be called Nate. This definitely made me suppress the feelings I had for obvious reasons, and it took a few weeks to do that. There were more people at this Halloween party, but I feel as though they are not important to the story. 

 As time goes on, I get to know her much better, and we quickly became best friends. She's sweet, compassionate, as well as loving, but it was never in a romantic way. Nate was a great guy, and I learned he was a professional Smash Bros. player, which was surprising because of his huge and imposing stature. He's a great guy, and I think he treats Kate great as well. 

 Another year goes by, and Kate is still acting the same way she always does, with the addition of some quirky things she does like snorting when she laughs. Our friendship now consisted of sexual jokes like her saying, ""Nate, would you have a threesome with Jake."" To which he would laugh and say ""No."" But it's not all sex jokes, we still have normal human conversations like any high schooler would. I just thought that would be relevant to this story. Anyways, I digress, back to the story.

 Throughout the rest of the past year, I start to feel what I have felt in the first weeks. It comes back slowly, but strong, and I don't know what's so different that caused it to arise. I try to just ignore it for a while, but whenever I visit her, I can't get the thoughts of love out of my head. I go to my cousin, Tom, to express my love for Kate, and how I should handle it. I didn't want to say anything to her, because I feel it would be way too selfish to proclaim love while she already has a boyfriend. Plus, Nate is cool, I may have learned of some problems Kate has with him, but every relationship has a problem, and they very much love each other. However, my cousin suggests I should tell her about it, because I would only have doubt and regret in my head for the rest of the time I spend with her, as well as without her. I know I will be rejected, and I figure that I'm just confusing her compassion for romance, but Tom pushes me to ask her. I reluctantly agree, but I still have that feeling of selfishness in my heart.

 I plan that I should tell her at the end of Valentine's day, and maybe write some letters anonymously beforehand and deliver them by foot. My cousin says it's a stupid idea to do it on Valentine's day, but still urges me to tell her someday soon. Should I listen to Tom, and tell Kate about my feelings, should I not do it at all because it would be disrespectful and selfish, or should I do the Valentine's plan?

There was no other Information on the notice other than it was a parcel and where/when it could be picked up. 
I signed the back of the notice left it in my box for a couple days and it was never picked up so I tossed and figured if it was important they would try again or that It had maybe been a mistake.

I've never worked in an office before in my life. I owned a painting business before this and some nights I would bartend for extra cash. It was just me, painting with some headphones in. Looking back, I loved it. At least compared to now. 

Im decent at sales and I like talking to people. It's everybody else in my office that drives me insane. Two brothers own the company and they care about no one but themselves.

I don't have a college degree and I have no real marketable skills. My cousin got me the job I work now and I'm very thankful for that.

I can keep working this job but it will drive me further into a dark oblivion, mentally. I'm no longer cheerful and happy. I have no real positive thoughts anymore. I feel dumb and inadequate everyday.

138,"I (15F) have two friends at school (16F) that I am very close to. The two of my friends truly hate each other. They just won't get along. 

We will call one friend Bianca. Bianca is friendly and sassy, but sometimes a bit harsh with her words and opinions. 

The other friend we will call Kimmy. Kimmy is a very sweet girl, but she's just awkward and a little bit.... eccentric? She's very ""strange"". Kimmy could possibly have an underlying mental illness, so I try to protect her as much as I can.

Bianca has tried to be friends with Kimmy in the past, but Kimmy is very stand-offish and has an unconventional way of socializing. This probably freaked out Bianca, so Bianca would only talk to Kimmy occasionally just to see what weird thing Kimmy had to say about a particular topic. I thought it was cute.

After a few weeks, Bianca said Kimmy had been ignoring her recently and was upset about it. I asked Kimmy about it and Kimmy said Bianca was poking fun at her. I told Bianca to stop fucking with Kimmy and she got very defensive and said that she was ""just playing around"" and that it wasn't serious. Eventually tension built up and Kimmy and Bianca hated each other.

My breaking point was hearing Bianca gossip to other girls about Kimmy. Kimmy has said things about Bianca being ""ugly"" and ""idiotic"" but I thought Bianca took it too far by mocking Kimmy's tics (whistling, hair pulling) and I told her to cut it out. She wouldn't, and kept making fun of her. I was infuriated by how rude she was, but I was too weak to actually stand up so I just walked away.

I told Kimmy about what Bianca said (through a call) because I thought she needed to know and Kimmy freaked out. She shouted at the top of her lungs and called Bianca VERY insulting things, including a few racial slurs. Kimmy cried to me afterwards and asked me to stand up for her and say something to Bianca. I was shocked that things had went so far so I promised to say something but I also told Kimmy to not say offensive things back. This angered her even more and she told me that she was free to say what she wanted, and that I should tell Bianca all the things she said. I told Kimmy to not call me that night and I hung up. I told Bianca to not talk about Kimmy again, and Bianca began to tell me that I was ""picking sides"" and that I was protecting Kimmy because she was a ""weird bitch"" and that we were friends even before Kimmy so I should try to see things from her point of view, especially when Kimmy was insulting her looks. 

I love both of my friends but at this point I have no clue what to do.

tl;dr my two friends hate each other, one is making fun of the other for having a mental health disorder, one is being very racist.",25Jan2020,1

140,"Hey, uh, this is my first post on Reddit ever and I'm a little nervous. I think before I ask for advice you guys need some background knowledge. There will be a TL;DR at the end because honestly nobody really wants to hear my depressing stuff.

I am a female in highschool (16) and I'm in accelerated courses to graduate early. Not too long ago (about October in 2019) I was sexually abused by my former best friend's dad. I vented about it to my friend and they reported it through an anonymous tip line and the next morning police officers were knocking on my door. I didn't tell them anything at first because I've had a history of being sexually abused and I have a big issue with people with authority because of that and I was scared. I ended up going to them the next day and explaining what happened. They began an investigation. I would like to say this wasn't just dropped on my friend all at once. I told her what happened between her father and I,and she sent me out the door. After the police began their investigation I dropped out of school for a bit because I was scared of what my former friend would do and she ended up coming to my house every few days and stalking me. 

I lost a lot of friends due to the rumors she started and those friends spread the rumors. I came back to school an outcast and I was shunned by nearly everyone.

Now, the former friend has moved to another state and they've slowly started trying to become friends again. I don't trust them but I don't want to be alone anymore. They want things from me (Like art, money, food) and I'm thinking of caving.

TL;DR:
Rumors were spread and I lost a lot of friends, and now the person who began the rumors has moved and the people who left are trying to come back and ask me for things.

Is there any advice you guys have on what to do?",25Jan2020,1

142,"Last Saturday my uncle committed suicide and it's devastated the family. He was my mum's brother and she has been finding it so hard to cope. My dad was close to my uncle and had known him for over 27 years and although I have never heard or seen my dad cry, it broke me to hear him break down on the phone when he told me the news. I currently live in Germany but my family are from the UK and I don't know what to do. I feel like there is some hierarchy of grief in that I shouldn't be upset because his children are and wife and siblings and they all have more reason to be upset and I realise it sounds strange but I just don't know how to handle this. I'm so sad that this happened -my uncle was such a lovely, kind and thoughtful man and I only have positive memories but he suffered severely from depression and has done for the past few years. What makes it even more heartbreaking was that he said last week that he really wanted to get his life together. I don't know how I can be there for my parents when I'm over here in Germany (I've been told to stay because my parents are constantly driving up to see my aunty and it would add a lot of complication and money to what's happening and due to the nature of his death, the process is a lot longer and it's been difficult to organise a date for the funeral). I want to be there for my family so desperately but I don't know how and I've been coping so terribly too, I'm constantly exhausted and sad and confused as to why this has happened and I just need some advice if there is any on how to handle a situation like this. I want to be strong for my family and to help my mum but everytime I speak to her I break down and so does she and it's so hard to talk, I've asked to speak to my dad but I think he's been coping so badly that he knows he'd breakdown on the phone and hasn't spoken to me much.

Hey, let me start by saying that I live with my parents. I have a very good phone, I have an incredibly good lifestyle, etc. However college and other projects I have are taking a HUGE chunk of money. Yes, my parents pay for college and food. But anything extra is on me. I am currently setting up a business (a record label - which they do support economically but to a certain degree) which needs a big chunk of money for promotion, covers, etc.

I am in bed right now thinking what would be the best option to earn some money... I am already looking for a summer job but from here til July there's a bit chunk.

I could work on April for about a week but that is still not enough, although I'll try and find a job. I even though about selling weed or prescription drugs I have because I suffer from anxiety and sleep deprivation.

147,"Hey all - hope everyone is having a nice evening. On a backup account because a few people know my main one.

As the title says, I’m an American college student (male) studying at an Ivy League institution (apologies if this sounds braggy to say, I just think it adds some context to my whole situation). I’m currently starting my fourth semester at this school (sophomore), and feel uneasy about returning to school after the break. This is not the first time I’ve felt this way; during my three prior semesters I’d often think about quitting or taking a break.

Academically, I’ve worked my ass off my whole life. My parents raised me well, if not a bit too over protectively. With the pressure I put on myself, the pressure they put on me, and how fortunate I’ve been to have wealthy parents, at first I was happy to have been accepted to this university. Now here I am sitting in my dorm writing this post.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not depressed. Though I do get a little sad or nostalgic sometimes, I really just feel lost. I talk to friends from home that go to other colleges and they seem like they’re having the times of their lives. I’m sure they exaggerate, but I can’t help but feel a bit disturbed that everyone seems to be enjoying the supposed “best four years of your life” far more than I am.

Academics are sometimes difficult, and I think they sometimes contribute to the anger I feel towards my current situation, but the times I feel the most like quitting are when I’m not busy with schoolwork. For instance today I didn’t know what to do after finishing my last class so I just drove my car around town for 2 hours debating whether or not to even write this post.

The connections I’ve made with others have been relatively few, but genuine. I had five really great friends, but as of late that number has been reduced to two, as three of them joined a fraternity and I rarely see them anymore. I made an attempt to join the fraternity as I thought I might enjoy it, but I dropped during the pledging process. Now I hang out with my two other friends, but they have their own interests (girlfriends, etc.). It seems as though all of my friends have found their “thing” while I’m still looking. I do spend more time alone than before, which likely amplifies my feelings of being “lost,” but I did feel this same feeling when our friend group was still intact.

I do try to find things to do, and make sure to eat right and get good exercise, but I still struggle.

I’m not really sure how to end this, so I’ll just say this. I know it’s time for me move on in life — I don’t think giving up and moving back in with my parents is a good idea, but I also know that I haven’t grown as a person or really enjoyed my college experience thus far. What the heck should I do?",25Jan2020,1

154,"Hi there. As the title suggests, I'm stuck with toxic family. Not abusively toxic, but toxic to be around. It's been this way my whole life honestly. My mother and my sister are currently disabled (sister was born disabled and my mother became so due to aging) and I feel like they need me. They're both incredibly poor. They live off of disability and honestly can't even afford to eat. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work to better the situation, but as it stands, all we have to eat for the next 7 days is 9 eggs and some oatmeal that's running out quickly. I have very generous family that's willing to take me in, and I even took that offer in November and quickly returned home because of my guilt of leaving them. I love them very much, but aside from the money issues there's tons more. They're constantly fighting with one another, they spend their money recklessly even knowing how bad the financial situation is, and our tiny apartment is flooded with animals that I 1.) Am allergic to, and 2.) Never asked for.

I wish I could just move out somewhere a few miles away but lacking college education (I'm 24 and going back to college to pursue a degree is not realistic with my current situation) my chances of finding a job that pays enough to support that doesn't feel realistic at the current moment.

155,"my family just moved into a new place about a month ago. we never met with the owners, but we met their assistant. she was very welcoming and the application process was really fast. we didn’t get to see the home until 2 days before we moved in. my family didn’t mind because we loved it just by looking at the pictures.

once we fully moved in, we noticed an attic door on the ceiling. my mom told us to leave it alone and i joked about it being scary. a few days in and every night i’m hearing creaking sounds, cabinets closing, i even hear footsteps. i try to be reasonable and say that it’s the wind because we do live in a secluded area so we keep our windows open. (we’re in a city, but it’s always quiet around here and it’s also gated) 

i’ve tried closing the windows, but i still hear the creaking. the place was remodeled in 2008, so maybe this might be normal? no one ever told us about the attic so we don’t wanna open it, but i’ve also seen some cracks near the door. we have renters insurance, but i’m getting creeped out. any answers on what this could be?",25Jan2020,1

158,"So this situation I'm in is a little complicated. I just started a new job. It's fantastic. I love my co-workers and the overall atmosphere of the workplace. Now there is one co-worker who I have been particularly starting to develop very strong feelings for, and I know the feeling is mutual. From the second I saw her, I knew that our lifestyles were compatible is such a way, that a match like this only comes around once or maybe twice in a lifetime. I literally am just so happy when I even get to see her for 6 minutes during shift change. Or when I wake up to a goodmorning selfie from her. She is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen and I have told her that. She has told me I am very attractive to her as well. Our boss even notices how flustered we get and how we flirt non-stop and calls it a ""secret crush"" that we have on each other that is absolutely adorable.

Now the problem is...she is moving three states over at the end of the month. Her boyfriend lives there. She didn't hide the fact that she had a bf or was moving or anything. But when it became blatantly obvious that we see each other as more than friends, I told her that I get she has big plans to move and that I will respect that. BUT we cant stop talking or trying to hang out or the little minor brushes of body contact when we walk by each other, or all of then flirtatious comments we make. I want this woman in my life more than I have ever wanted a woman in my life ever before. I can see it in her eyes that she feels the same about me as far as that goes, but I think she feels that she just doesn't have any options since she's committed to move in with her boyfriend. I'm conflicted. Bigtime. Tonight we hung out with a group of friends at one of those intense lazertag places where it's super legit. It's dark in there and we got close and tangled after she kept playfully hitting me out of the way. Our faces were very close and I could see that we both wanted to kiss each other right there. I have never felt so lost in a moment. I pulled away in fear of crossing a line that would ruin the last month I have with her before she leaves.

My sister saw how much he loved the cat, so she gave him the cat to stay at his house for a couple days or so. 

I was alright with this, but then a couple days became a week, then a couple weeks, then I started asking questions when it hit a month. My sister insisted that her boyfriend really wanted the cat for just a little longer, a couple months specifically. I was hesitant but gave it the Ok in the end. Mainly because we found another cat, abandoned, at the time and that I love very much to this day.

It should be noted that we are long-distance friends, where I live in the southern Mid-Atlantic area where he lives in the Midwest, roughly a 10-hour difference


Here is a little background on him, he is working a job where he feels like he is not being appreciated, he's pretty much paranoid that everyone is talking to him behind his back in a bad way, he has a relatively small social Circle, with two people who are a little bit too clingy towards him oh, and he doesn't have much Hobbies outside of listening to records and playing old school Sonic games.

I've been trying to help him the best I can, I even went out of my way to get a switch for him the kind of help him up and get into something new, as well as a bunch of other games and movies that we stream online. I'm even moving up there with him in about a year's time.

I'm a bit worried though, his aggression and frustration about his life has been going up even more, and I can't talk to him without him talking about how bad his life is. The reason why I'm coming here is that he was talking to me about getting in contact with the suicide hotline, and how he was ready to end it all.

I've been a Muslim all my life, I'm 22 now I started wearing the hijab when I was 8 almost 9. I can't really remember what it feels like to not wear one. It's hard to be honest about how I feel because I don't want to say anything bad about Islam, I don't hate Islam and I love God. But I just feel like I've been pulling away from Islam. I'm always on and off about it, sometimes I get angry at it, but sometimes I feel like Islam really is the truth and it's all the word of God. I really don't know anymore. I'm afraid to have my own opinion because of how Imams and Sheikhs ""have studied these things for years and years so they know more about what the Quran says than we do, especially since the Arabic in the Quran is different than modern arabic today"". Idk.. I'm just tired of the sexism in Islam. I don't think girls should have to wear Hijab. I believe girls should be able to wear whatever they want. Hijab limits me. I love swimming and I  had to stop because wearing hijab is really hard to go swimming in. I feel that I can't be myself and wear the things that I want. I feel depressed everyday because I'm always scared I'm going to make a decision I'm going to regret in the afterlife. Imams and Sheikhs always say life is a test, and that it's supposed to be a struggle. That's why God rewards us with heaven. But all of this makes me feel like I can't be happy, I almost never feel happy and I always feel that it's the religion. But I haven't been able to let go because I'm scared I won't go to heaven. Because heaven has different ""levels"", I'm worried if I take off my hijab or give up things that I don't believe are right, I won't get a highest place in heaven that I've always dreamed of in the afterlife. Everyday that I decide is going to be the day I take off my hijab, I always feel like I’m choosing the world over God, and so I give up on the idea of taking it off. I feel like I'm being weak and not trying hard enough, or I'm not making as big of a sacrifice than those other Muslims who have, like the girls that wear full on hijab.

A new person was hired recently and asked for more hours, so our boss cut my hours. I attempted to discuss it with my boss, but she ignored my emails regarding my request for more hours. A professor at my college offered me a job during the week (10 hours during the week/no weekends). I accepted the job and thought this was a perfect arrangement: I don't have to attempt to confront my boss anymore and the new employee can work the hours she needs. After accepting the job, I informed my boss I can no longer work week days due to my school schedule. She was content with scheduling me weekends only for about a month, then she realized that my school schedule (the company keeps our school schedules on file) permitted me to work two days during the week. She is now refusing to accept my new availability of weekends only, even though she was rarely scheduling me during the week anymore (I was scheduled during the week about one shift every two weeks).

175,"I taught English in Korea, my first employer fired me almost immediately. The director, who personally picked me up from the train station at 1:00 AM must have made the decision to fire me right there when she met me. She brought me to my apartment and talked a lot of bullshit and told me a group should pick me up in the morning at 8:00 AM. I went to bed and woke up early. They didn't come, but I had no phone or email connection to contact anyone, so I wandered outside and found the foreign people who looked like me. In hindsight, I knew the lead instructor of that group was trying to avoid the situation by not picking me up. They took me a long anyway and when I came home later that day I had a TON of emails from my recruiter. I skyped immediately and they told me the school was most likely going to fire me. They advised me to come. I refused, I started sending out my resume that night. I went on three interviews in a week: two rejections and I landed the 3rd one. It was the perfect job. It ended up being the best decision of my life.

Why was I let go?

I have cerebral palsy and am very short, 5'2"". I had surgery at 12 and believe it stunted my growth because I'm the size of a 12-year-old (and a DNA test says I'm supposed to be 5'7""). I ended up befriending the lead teacher and I asked him why, and *I said: ""*is it my height?"" He didn't confirm that, but only asked, ""Have you ever experienced this kind of discrimination before?"" I Said no because I haven't. He said it was because they have cameras in the school and adults might not be happy seeing someone like me on camera. So 6 years late, I still don't know if it is because of my complexion, slight limp, or height - or just the combo - but I turned the situation around. 

If an employer asked, ""what's a challenge you've overcome""? Would it be appropriate for me to say, ""I was discriminated against almost immediately upon arriving in Korea at my first job, they fired me because of my height, but I turned that situation into a positive and didn't give up. I found one of the best jobs in that city. ""?",25Jan2020,1

On one of my alt accounts I still follow both his instagrams, and I can still read his messages and message him on Discord (though I've get to actually send him anything other than a ""wish you the best, sorry"" afterwards.   


I think I mostly just wanted to vent and say that I still feel really bad about it- he just kinda stood there in shock and clearly had no idea it was coming, but that's kind of the thing- he could never tell how I was feeling, which isn't really a requirement, but when I've had a rough day and he comes over all playful it really just pisses me off even more. There's a variety of things about him that I dislike, and a variety of reasons that I should just get over it, but I feel like it just slipped away all too quickly.

181,"Once upon a time, I was friends with a group that went to another school that we knew from a weekly dance for middle schoolers that they had in our area hosted by a community gym. My friend, E, was dating a guy, A, and he had a group of guys that he always hung out with, SB, CE, and SC. I lost contact with them during high school after my friend broke up with A, but I saw SC at a concert when I was in college and had always had a crush on A so I asked about him. SC gave me A’s info, me and him reconnected, and ended up getting together.

Mine and A’s relationship was one of those where you have a fantasy in your head about someone from when you were younger and they turn out to be nothing like that. As kids, A was outgoing, a bit of of bad boy, and always made me laugh. But at 20-21 he had become a computer gaming hermit that drank a lot and after a couple years I found myself only being in love with the idea of the “storybook” quality of our relationship, feeling like I was always missing out on fun because he never wanted to go out. His job didn’t help, he was a welder and worked swing so he didn’t come home till 4 am and we didn’t live together. I fully admit I was a terrible girlfriend, unfaithful as hell and loved going out with my college girlfriends and my group of high school friends including E. I often messed around/slept with guys and I just chalked it up to being young and wanting to have fun but I knew what I was doing wasn’t fair to A.

When we were 24, I broke up with A after the guilt finally overcame me and even though I never admitted to him how much I cheated on him. We were apart for a month, got back together, and then a few months later at Christmas he proposed in front of his family and I reluctantly said yes. When I graduated, A still did not want to live together so I moved in with his friend SB and his girlfriend M. That arrangement was fun in that we constantly had the friend group over but they were shitty room mates who used my pots and pans to cook but never cleaned them, were always in the living room so I couldn’t ever use the TV, and they took long ass hot showers with the door closed and no fan on so black mold grew in our bathroom and even after repeated cleanings they still didn’t change their showering habits.

On St. Paddy’s Day, we had a big party with the whole group and CE, who ended up transferring schools and hadn’t been around much during high school had started hanging out with us again, was there. After way too many Irish Car Bombs, I blacked out and did a bunch of stuff I don’t remember (mainly I had a huge bruise on my thigh and no one could tell me how it got there other than I had challenged SB to a wrestling match and it got kinda crazy), but I retreated to my room and as far as I know went straight to sleep.

After the roomie situation with SB and M was falling apart, I decided to move out a month early and they understandably were pissed off but I couldn’t take living there another day. SB went off on me about what a slut I was, and threw this nugget of info out that I could not refute or confirm: CE said you guys slept together in your room on St. Paddy’s Day. I told SB that if that was true, then he raped me because I definitely couldn’t have consented. I didn’t see CE again after that, and the relationship with my ex-roomies was pretty strained so I never pressed them for more info either. A and I eventually broke up a year later after we moved in together, and a combo of my unfaithfulness and his drinking and refusal to quit ended it (but I don’t know if A ever found out about the extent of my cheating). I met my now husband and we got married a year later and I never felt the need to cheat on him because we had a much better more compatible relationship, but I digress. 

To this day, I don’t know whether or not it’s true. I woke up the next day totally hungover, no recollection of much of the night and I don’t recall feeling weird or thinking “did I have sex with someone?” I put it away in my head and hadn’t thought about it for a long time. I currently work in a neighborhood liquor store where there are quite a few car dealerships. And wouldn’t you know it, a guy started coming in from Lexus who looked familiar; when I looked at his card, it was CE! But, he hasn’t seem to recognize me and I haven’t let on that I know it’s him. All the questions about that night have come rushing back and I can’t get it out of my head. I still don’t remember anything and I have no legal basis to even stand on if I wanted to pursue it, but it’s gnawing away at me. Some days he comes in and I want to confront him, but I know that a possible rape 10 years ago is a weird convo to have with someone and the last thing I want to do is create a huge thing when I will never be able to say for certain myself unless he confessed that it happened. 

My husband, who knows about my past and knows about the incident already prior to CE coming into the store, is very supportive of what I want to do either way. I want to leave it be but it is so hard to deal with CE several times a week without having a huge amount of anxiety. He came in just a bit ago and I couldn’t even look at him in the face, and that’s what made me decide I need some outside opinions about this before I decide to confront him or let it go.

185,"I’ve had this long time family friend whose spouse is generally speaking an okay person, but this spouse likes to put a lot of blame and responsibility on my friend’s shoulders. 

Examples: instead of doing things themselves, the spouse (let’s call them K) likes to ask my friend (D) to do it for them. This is normally financial stuff, scheduling, taking their kids to sports games and other extracurricular activities, etc. 
They own a business on top of D’s 9-5 job, but K does little of the communication and mass shipping aspect of the job and instead fulfills small orders in the middle of the night. 

I’d like to make a note here that K has a whole host of mental health problems, and they have not sought out/wanted any metal health assistance in over 10 years. 
I try to help and give advice to D, but I don’t really know how without it sounding too harsh or borderline impossible. Besides, D already knows that this is a problem and is aware of how unhealthy their current situation is, but D is willing to just live with it.  I, on the other hand, hate to see D just settle for such a life.

I also really want to help K get some mental assistance, but I don’t know how to approach them about it. K has a whole host of mental issues including but not limited to depression, social anxiety, insomnia, some type of paranoia that everyone is out to get them and what not. The minute I mention their mental health issues, even just a brief mention, they begins to have spiraling thoughts that lead them to think that I’m purposefully trying to ruin their buissness, family, life, etc. This used to be a heavy strain our relationship. 

I honestly just want them to work things out whether that means staying together or getting a divorce, but they’re stuck in this middle ground and neither is willing to make a push towards a solution in fear that it would just cause more trouble.

192,"Hi. I’ve vanished from reddit for a while, solely to fall into a rut. There’s a lot of things that have happened as I was a child. A lot of bullying, and looking back on it, a lot of red flags for future mental health issues. When I was in elementary school, I was alone. I spent my whole childhood alone, only with my family, and now I struggle practically every day. 

I’m a freshman in high school now, and a childhood bully of mine is in my third period, which coincidentally, is the class I was hoping would bring me out of my comfort zone. The teacher put me next to him. I went up to the teacher later that day, asked him to move me, and was told to just “get over it”, because he has issues with the kid, too. 

That was two weeks ago. Since then, I’ve felt disconnected from everything - from my classes, my girlfriend, my friends - everything. I don’t know how to fix it. I feel like I’m living my life as a character in a movie, like I’m watching it in the theater and nitpicking everything about the filming and the plot. It’s horrible. I don’t know what to do anymore.",25Jan2020,1
193,"So this morning was rough. With about 10 minutes to so rare before leaving for work by dad dropped by to give me a few things he had of mine. I invited him in thinking it’s be quick and painless. Boy was I wrong. He began to lay into me about all this family drama I had not even brought up and was finally able to put behind me until today. I’ll try to keep it short but no promises. 

About 3 months ago or maybe 4 months ago my dad informed my mom and I (me 25F, mom 62F going to be 63 in a few weeks form that day) that he wanted us to move out before the beginning of the next month. My parents had been divorced for many years and we had been living with him out fo necessity. He had never expressed any desire to have us leave until that day.

It was like the 10th of October or something g like that. So he was giving us less than a month to be out. He said he would help with a few moving expenses and even a couple of our more expensive bills (phones and car insurance) but only if we met his deadline. We were both broke. Sure we talked about moving out one day but a lot of people talk about it by that doesn’t mean they have the means to actually do it immediately. 

So we both scramble to pack and look for a new living situation ASAP. With days left we finally found a place and with only a couple hundred dollars between the 2 of us to spare after rental fees we begin the moving process and get the majority of our things out in time. 

After all this time he has brought up how he never said he was evicting us and wasn’t dead set on the date but just was giving us a little incentive to move. Both of our mental health has been taking a huge hit since he demanded we move out in less than a month.

I’ve told friends and family that night and days after what he did to us and he expects us to be gracious. He put my mom back in her depression as well as myself and life has not been more difficult. If it were not for friends and distant family as well as coworkers I don’t know how we would have gotten through this mental, emotionally or at all. 

He just started yelling  at me for both is us thinking of him as cruel and even evil for making us leave when he never forced us out the door and how hard it’s been for him since we left. It has really come to the point where for the first time in my life I have had to consider completely removing him from my life.

It seems every time I go see him or talk to him he has a way of making me seem small and worthless and himself as the protagonist. He makes my depression engulf me and it is very difficult to even go to work some days. With my recent promotion as well as my mom also getting promoted we can finally afford to pay our phones and car insurance as well as the rest of our expenses.

I have told him to remove us from his phone plan and to start the process of transferring the car insurance information over properly. I just want him out of my life and to finally be able to move on and live a full and happy life. Can anyone give me any advice or similar experiences on what to do in this situation? I’m sorry if I left anything out or cake off in a bad way. It is late and I’m exhausted and have to get up for work early tomorrow.

194,"I've begun to notice recently how often my parents fight. I never really noticed this when I was younger, but it seems like since they have less responsibilities with us as adults they have more time to talk and frankly be angry with each other. The main problem seems to be that my mom can be very frustrating sometimes. She makes everything about herself and gets upset or feels attacked really easily. Seriously, her mood can go from good to screaming in seconds. It's unhealthy, we all know. But she's been seeking help for years and it's been very hard for her to get over this. My dad, on the other hand, doesn't really know how to handle her and gets frustrated back because he gets blamed for nothing most of the time. It's been concerning and I hate having to hear her yell at him every night, but I also really don't want them to split up. Coming home feels exhausting and scary nowadays. I've considered asking my dad about this and if he's happy in this relationship. There's nothing more I want than for my parents to be happy, but I'm worried that if they split up that nothing will ever be the same and that it will ruin our family forever. Plus, I don't think my mom could genuinely live without him (she is very dependent and has been for 20 years).  And I'm scared that asking will possibly open a door to divorce that my dad hadn't previously considered. I know realistically that their relationship is known of my business, although when it interferes with my mental health and home life I think I have somewhat of a right to say something.

200,"I reluctantly accepted responsibility for collecting and paying the bill for my 3 roommates, simply splitting it in 4. We signed separate leases and were placed together. 

Some things I consider to be straight forward enough, like a month long vacation in winter clearly requires continued payment since most of the bill is heating, flat fees, etc.

Should I expect to continue collecting the full amount for people gone for 3 months in the summer? I get the impression some people keep with the same flat fee while others calculate and lower the charge.

What about the roommate who moved countries already? 

She still has a lease, so I consider her technically my roommate since the only person who can occupy that room is her or a sublessee. She’s planning on getting one soon, and hopefully I can just charge for the sublessee’s use. But if the sublessee doesn’t work out, I wouldn’t want to charge full price given she doesn’t use appliances, lights, hot showers etc for the remaining 6 months of her lease. It feels like she’s gone and I don’t want to charge anything, but realistically I think I should continue charging at least something as a person with a lease and a room that must be heated above 55 degrees, etc

I replied with what any horny 20 year old would, yeah let's do it.

It was odd, I did a little bit of research on people are always seeking pleasure at any extent, and the first thing I got was drug addiction searches, so it came to my mind if I will sleep with someone, so I asked her if she is a drug addict and she replied with yes you could say so.
So after talking to her, I learned that her parents dumped her when she was 14 at the orphanage, and that she really doesn't have anything going in her life, she is an 18 year old highschool student who lives with her sister, barely has any good friends, just people to hang out with.
She has been drinking alcohol since she was 14, along with doing hardcore drugs.
I decided I would meet with her, and talk to her more, when she came she was shaking heavily, and she had cuts all over her arms.

We had our ""first"" meeting this semester on MLK day, so we had no school and significantly fewer people than the normal meeting. After playing some games the groups broke off until me and my friend (another board member) had no one else to play with as other games were already going on. With only a half hour left in the meeting at 9:30 we left to get dinner before most restraints close at 10, this being the only time I've left a meeting early as a member or a board member. A few days later one of the board members (who was also only elected last semester) said that they hated this trend where people leave the meetings and unless it's an emergency we shouldnt leave or miss meetings. This has started a huge fight within the club amongst other riffs. The same board member hates the two most popular games within the club and has been very angry every time people play it or Express the desire to play them. The same member is known for not playing during meetings and just sitting and talking to friends. The member historically had been rather nice to me but today stomped past me in the hall. I'm honestly baffled at how childish this member and others have acted. How should I respectfully yet effectively explain to this and other members that the childish arguments, and mismanagement needs to be addressed and fixed?",25Jan2020,1
205,"I (F14) have a friend in my class whose father is currently on the brink of death. He was diagnosed with cancer and is going to die any time now, and won’t get to see his sons graduate to highschool. The situation is very upsetting. My friend has a brother in my grade but I am not very close with him so I think it would be weird to suddenly try to help him through a hard time, so I really just need help with the kid I see as my friend. He is popular but usually gets teased a lot. He and his brothers are twins, and he just so happened to be about a foot shorter and a bit more hyper. I don’t think he knows that I’m aware of his situation, as I’ve witnessed most of it through my mom’s facebook account. I have been doing little things, though, to try and help him out for when his father finally passes. I am really nice to him all the time, I defend him when people are rude, my parents are going to pay off his $100 lunch debt and put some money on his account, and I’ve just been really supportive in general. I’m not completely sure how to act when it all happens, though. I think it would be weird to say, “I’m sorry for your loss” and be formal about it. But I don’t want to act like nothing happened because that’s rude.

TL;DR - My friend’s father is about to pass and I don’t know how to comfort him afterwards. Any tips?",25Jan2020,1
206,"What happened was that this freshman girl was beating up some kid, like slammed him on the ground hard and whacked him in the back repeatedly. He was tearing up a little, but he shook it off. Then she started talking to me (we know each other, but aren't on good terms), and I tried to say I wasn't involved in whatever was going on. She started calling me names and I told her to shut up. Then she started walking towards me, saying she was gonna make my nose bleed. I walked around in circles, trying to calm the situation down. Then her bus came and she had to go home.

I got my phone and called the police department office to file a report. I told them exactly what I told you, the girl's first name, my name, how old I am, and how old she is. They said they'd call me back.

Thing is, I'm not really sure I should've called them. I feel like I went overboard or crossed a line doing that. Plus, I don't know if they can even do anything. All I have for evidence is my own word. What should I do?",25Jan2020,1

I mean, I show up and do what's asked of me. But I really can't bring myself to care about the business. If the business goes under, I'll just go find another fuck-ass minimum wage job at a burger place or something. I'm literally only there for the paycheck while I go to school (fire/EMS/rescue school). 

It's not even that it's a bad job. I'm literally so indifferent to this job that I don't even hate it. it's just a means to a small paycheck every 2 weeks. I don't particularly care about getting promoted in this company because it's not what I wanna do. Some days, I don't even really feel like doing it. 

For context for this next part, you need to know that I work in a thrift shop, and part of my job is recieving donations and putting them in carts so the back can sort them. Management asks the carts get stacked ""nice and neat"". Honestly, I don't even really bother. I just stack it well enough so it won't fall down, and send it back however that happens to be. I really don't care how much it needs up weighing. 

I guess that's the main problem. I don't really care about the job. It's just a sort of survival gig, I guess. I live at home, so it's not like it's enough to pay rent.

210,"TLDR; 8yr old son's best friend from before we moved connected with me on Facebook Messenger. Constantly sends messages, photos, videos, adds me to group chats with other children and keeps trying to call/video chat with me. 


My son is 8 and is believed to have ASD (as well as ADHD and other things). We moved to a new place over a year ago and he has a lot of troubles making friends but did have one really good friend in our last city that is the same age. 


We dont drive so we have had no way of going to see them since moving but has had the occasional hangout, sleepover, and phone call. Her family is very nice, though we dont know them well but always changing phone numbers and really hard to get in contact with. 


Yesterday I received a message on Facebook Messenger that said something like, ""You are now connected with * Child's name * VIA kid messenger.""    I have my privacy settings pretty high and am not usually able to get messages from people I don't have as a friend. There was no friend request or any option to decline. We were just automatically connected on messenger. 


She proceeded to send me about 50 messages or more from 9pm - 11:30pm. Adding me to group chats with a bunch of other random children that I do not know. Trying to video chat and call me for over a half hour straight even though I ignored it. Sending me photos of herself and videos. Some messages made absolutely no sense.... and has since repeated the same thing tonight as well. Always past 9pm up until almost midnight. 


I believe she thinks she's talking to my son for some reason but my son goes to bed at 8pm, isn't allowed to use social media or have access to my phone. He does have his own phone but only to play games like Pokemon Go and watch Pokemon TV for a little bit each day. 


I have my own struggles. I have extremely bad anxiety/paranoia, am likely on the spectrum myself and am honestly pretty scared/uncomfortable around children. 


I tried to get my husband to contact her family over the phone for me but as I had mentioned earlier, we were unable to contact them. 


I have no idea how to handle this situation so any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to hurt this poor child's feelings but I'm also extremely uncomfortable getting messages from her.",25Jan2020,1

213,"I've been considered 'gifted' my entire life, and have been the top of my class despite rarely studying and having a habit of doing homework the period before it's due. I just finished my first semester of freshman year of high school with a 4.194 unweighted / 4.586 weighted GPA. 

I feel bad about this, because I don't think I want a job like an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer like many people expect me too. I don't care for school at all - I think it's boring, and pointless, and the grading system is beyond stupid. 

I don't particularly want any job. I loathe the idea of a stereotypical 9-5 office gig and I'd, frankly, rather die than do something I don't want to. Which is most things. 

Traveling, singing, writing, drawing, crafting, learning without being tested or evaluated - just pure learning. I want to create, to have a life that's never boring or dull. I want to have politics and true crime podcasts and write songs and voice act and play instruments and write novels and draw and upcycle and craft and bake and EVERYTHING that's considered a useless and risky idea. 

Everything I've been taught is stupid and reckless, is what I want to do. 

I don't even have much interest in going to college, to be honest. Why be in debt to a place that teaches you exactly what you could teach yourself?

My friends, family, teachers - everyone says I'd be wasting my potential and that I'll end up homeless or living with my parents. 

What can I do to make my dreams of, for lack of a better term, just straight up vibing, a reality? 

Can I do it? 

Or should I just give in and get a normal job?

216,"Well, I’m 16 and female. I have two sisters, a mom, and a father. I have many problems with my parents, especially my father. He has anger issues and explodes violently and yells at me or my mom or my sisters whenever we upset him. It was me this time: I yelled something similar to “Don’t tell me to f***ing behave when you never do!” I said this because he acts like I’m the only one with anger issues. If anything, I’ve learned from example. I was scared he’d hit me or something (he’s not physically abusive, he just yells to the point where I think he’s going to hurt me...his loud angry voice is terrifying). I know he’s going through a lot and so is my mom, but why can’t they for once just listen to my cries for help.  Why can’t they put their own problems aside and focus on me and my sisters. Btw, I’m pretty sure me and my family have all had at least one mental illness per person, especially depression and anger related issues. I’ve told them several times I the past that I need mental help, but they just indirectly tell me it’s my fault because mental illnesses don’t exist. My father ranted for over an hour while I hid upstairs in a closet hoping he wouldn’t find me. Not that he’d even try to, I’m just so scared when he yells like that. I’ve been acting really concerningly as my family has been telling me. That’s why I want therapy and mental help. But I’m just being negative according to them, especially according to my parents. My parents are both South Asian, so that explains why things are so emotional in my household. But I’ve changed so much from this innocent little girl that I used to be when I entered 9th grade. The changes when I was 15 and I’ll be 17 in a few months. Almost 2 yrs in, and no matter how hard I try to change, it never works. They tell me it takes time, but how do I even turn to normal if I don’t know how? I never used to believe mental illnesses were a thing, but now I do. The rest of my family think I just have to change my mindset. I need to know how to fix all these family tensions...there is so much more left unsaid but I don’t want to make this any longer than it already is.

We can use our cut for whatever we like. That's the deal. And one thing I've always wanted but never got to have. Has been a pickup truck. I've ALWAYS wanted one. And everytime I've almost had one, it didn't work out one way or another.

234,"LONG POST AHEAD. 

Im a guy (21) doing my army conscription and am still living with my parents cos im in a country where people live with their parents even to their late 30s.
I think i have a strained relationship with my brother (31), also living w our parents, and my dad (60). 

My dad was a pretty strict man who ended up physically beating my brother alot when he was younger. My brother on the other hand really yearns for my dad's approval on everything. My brother and i have a 10 year gap and we have another brother(23) who is 2 years older than me, 8 years younger than the oldest. So this 23 year old bro and i have a pretty good r/s because of the small age gap while my eldest brother and i not so. 

My oldest brother yearns so much for my dad's approval in everything and this causes alot of arguments that happen between my dad and him. These arguments can get really bad and both of them would start shouting and screaming at each other. When i was younger, i would usually just stay in my room and not do anything until it was over but eventually they kept telling me that whenever theres an argument going on im not telling them what i think about it and that i should not keep quiet in these situations. But to me staying quiet and letting the arguement die down were my coping mechanisms. 

I eventually tried to voice my opinions and thoughts when arguments arose and one day i just snapped and just started screaming for everyone to shut up. I started hyperventilating and couldnt think straight. I would huddle to a corner and wouldnt be able to have anyone come near me as i felt really scared and paranoid. I believe these were panic attacks although i cannot confirm as i have not gone to the doctors or anything. Usually when these ""panic attacks happen, my bro and dad would stop arguing and would try and console me but nothing would help unless i am on my own for say 15-20mins. And within the 20mins or so they would start arguing about who caused this to me and back to square 1, i go into another ""panic attack"". 

But even when i try to tell them that, them arguing is what causes me to become into this ""lunatic"" they tell me that arguments are bound to happen and that i should not get panic attacks as in the ""real world"", it would be worse and that i would not be able to survive if i get ""panic attacks"" over ""small matters"" like these. Because of these arguements etc, i tend to stay away from my family as much as possible and try to stay with my friends as long as i can but even at 21 i still have a curfew that i need to follow and even if my dad doesnt care if i come home before 12mn or whatever the curfew is, my brother gets really pissed at me. To him, because my dad was really strict with him, and now my dad isnt as strict as he was with him, he should be the one who should be strict with my 23 y/o brother and me. I try to explain to him that pretty much everyone i know dont have a curfew when they are 21 and he tells me that their parents doesnt care about their kids but i care about u, so you should listen to me. I dont know whats wrong w me, my brother, or my family. Do i need to see a professional for my ""panic attacks""?",25Jan2020,1

Anyways, the past 3 years I have been stuck on this one girl. Every time I begin to get over her and we start to act like normal friends, she says or does something that makes me have some shred of hope. Sometimes its saying “you’re so damn hot”, then leaving with another guy. Other times she will literally tell people she wants to get with me, so I try. And I fail. At one point she told me “shut up and kiss me”, and I did, and then claimed it was to help my chances with this other girl somehow, which is BS. 

I have never explicitly told her how I felt, but she has made it clear she is not interested, despite what dropping what most people consider obvious hints. 

People have told me she just uses me for attention, and I’m starting to believe them. I just can’t shake my feelings for her because when were together its honestly the only time I’m happy.

244,"I was playing around on my boyfriend's phone tonight, taking a bunch of silly selfies and fraping him etc to tease him. To my surprise, I noticed the tinder app, and decided to open it bc he never showed me his profile from before we started dating two years ago bc he was too embarrassed. When I did, every single photo of him on his profile was taken by me; so I know they're recent. However, they were no matches and no bio or anything. Just recent photos. So, does Facebook do a thing where it'll automatically put together a tinder account or...does he have a secret tinder that he has just deleted everything off/never really pursued?",25Jan2020,1

248,"This afternoon, my son came home crying after he got off the bus. I asked him what happened and he told me that the bus driver just started yelling at him. Apparently there was this aerosol can of air freshener being sprayed, he said it wasn't him but the driver targeted him. They said she started yelling. That she threatened to whoop his ass in front of all the other kids on the bus if he did it again. Oh, and my daughter said she came to an abrupt stop which caused some other girl to hit her face on the seat in front of her.

Come to find out, my daughter was the one spraying the aerosol. My son just got in trouble for it.

So, i was pretty pissed off. First thing i did was call the school and tell what happened to a school admin who said they'd review the Bus camera on monday and straighten this out. However, my son came forward. He told me that his sister told him to say that. She didn't want to get in trouble, so i guess she shifted blame to the driver.

He told me that she did yell at him about the spray can and she did give him a stern talking too before he got off, about distracting the driver. He said he kept trying to tell her it was his sister.

But yeah, none of what he told me actually happened. So i tried calling the school back but i guess they went home. I'm so embarrassed because i just accused a driver of bullying my son and threatening him.

Last night we hung out and had sex, we were extremely drunk this time around and immediately after we realized our mistake. she was in agony, and i was in shock. we sobered up immediately after the deed was done. she loves her boyfriend and he has been nothing but good to her. i feel like a total asshole for contributing to this, it is awful of me to agree/continue to go further into getting intimate.

what do i do? i’m ashamed, and she is torn between breaking up with him because she ruined it, or her wanting to continue without telling him. i am absolutely positive she will not admit to telling him. i wanted to get back together with her and still do, but not like this. i feel just fucking terrible and want to know what you guys think about think about this or what you experience is.",25Jan2020,1

So im 16 and moved in with my uncle a few months ago after a disagreement with my parents and since moving here its been alright but 2 things have happened that kinda have me worried.1st event was a few weeks ago, I woke up to find my door slightly open which isn't normal since i always shut it at night and my uncle NEVER enters my room unless he needs something from me so it kinda felt odd but i ignored it but tonight.2nd event was today, i woke up at around 4am which was a bit odd since i only had 4 hours of sleep but i could say that was because i had a 4 hour nap like 12 hours before (maybe important but ive had an inverted sleep schedule for the past few weeks until yesterday/today and most days my uncle is either out at work or with friends and sometimes i dont see him for days) and today i woke up fully naked, This isnt an odd thing on its own as i usually do sleep naked during summer since i get really hot during then but last night it was definitely not hot enough to warrant doing so and i know for a fact that i fell asleep wearing a t-shirt and pants so when i woke up i didnt really think much other but it made no sense and i started worrying.

In all honesty im probably overreacting since in months these are the only things that has happened and its fully possible i had taken of my clothes in my sleep but this has never happened before and i find it hard to believe that i'd be able to in my sleep. I just came here since im worried something may be happening and maybe you guys could give explanations or advice on what to do. Thanks for reading

259,"I've been dealing with horrible neck and back pain after seeing a chiropractor to help with low back pain that I had been suffering from, which is also now worse. I've tried massage therapy (2 hour DEEP tissue *ouch*), dry needling treatment at physical therapy (PT) with an electric current, exercise at least once a day with specific movements, and a myriad of pain medications (both prescription and holistic). 

*Please exclude recommendations for CBD oils or Marijuana as I am allergic and cannot heed your advice*. 

Everything makes me hurt and it's driving me and my spouse crazy.

The pain has been going on for two months and it's starting to really discourage me. I haven't been able to work, since I have a highly physical job. Even the smallest chores take so much out of me and I end up in pain. I suffer with self-confidence as well as depression and this has been making both much worse. I'm unable to lose weight that I've put on from stress eating because I can't do much and it makes me feel like I'm falling apart. I am only 23, I have already had a surgery and many medical issues within the span of 5 - 10 years. 

I've run out of patience because it seems just as one part begins to improve, another spot will be aggrivated. I go to PT at least once a week and we dry needle every time, plus my daily exercises. I use a heating pad and holistic biofreeze at least once a day, without much relief. My pain meds don't get rid of my pain and instead make me feel doped up so I don't think about it as much.

263,"I'm 43, and when I couldn't take one more jab/insult/outrage two years ago, I told my stepmom she is a bitch and successfully didn't have to talk to her anymore.

My daughter was born in 2014. My dad flew in to see her and left the same day. No stepmom.

For Christmas presents, we are told we won't be getting any ""because they have enough grandkids."" She has also hardly got presents for her birthday.

November of this year we all decide to suck it up and meet in Asheville for a few days, and it wasn't the worst. Had a pretty  good time with the dad/stepmom!

so for Christmas I get them both a present and we got jack shit. Not even a card.  Then the Sunday after, my dad asked me if I had a good Christmas and I said yes. I don't know if he doesn't even know we got 0 presents.

His birthday is on Jan 30 and I sent him some presents that arrived last Monday. Today I asked him about it and his reply was ""too much""... not thank you. not yes I got it. no questions or interesting things to say about it. Just ""too much""

264,"For context as to what i’m trying to figure out, after months of thinking, here’s a few things that I deduced, that might have led to this.

1.) I’m a man and she is a woman. Over one summer, we got really close because we were both just at lonely points in our lives, we agreed to a fwb thing for a couple weeks, then we kinda just moved on from it. I then started dating somebody when I got back to college and have been dating this person for a year and a half. Out of the blue, my friend asks me if I told my partner about our little hook up thing and I said yes and that was the last thing she ever said to me. At this point, my friend had found herself a partner. We “dated” once in high school for a week, which involved making out. We have, however, always shared a pretty intimately platonic friendship. Cuddling and what not, nothing serious. But we have always been real close. We have mostly been single, but whenever she got a boyfriend, I made sure to back off. So has she developed feelings for me since that summer? 

2.) Maybe a month prior to her cutting contact with me, she told me that it feels like every conversation we have turns into me talking about myself. I responded with something along the lines of “i’m a busy person now a days because i’m finishing my major and i’m sorry but myself is just all I can afford to think about right now.” At the time, I didn’t really understand where she was coming from because I always listened to her when she vents, when she sends me a meme I send her one back, and when we were texting I thought I was being inviting. Thinking back I didn’t respond to her for a few hours to a day and that maybe would be selfish of me. But, I also just started a relationship that I was investing a lot of time into. There was another time where she showed off her new boyfriend (same one as mentioned previously) and normally I ask about them and what not but that specific time I think I just said some one-off dumb remark to be funny. So i’ve been thinking that maybe i’ve just become toxic for her and I was just dragging her down. Maybe my attitude with her has changed but I truly do not know and i’ve been thinking about this for many months at this point. I suppose we texted less than we normally did but that wasn’t abnormal for us, we always had a certain ebb and flow with our communication. Not in a bad way, just in a “life gets in the way,” way. 

3.) 3 years ago, she had started to become increasingly more rude to me, congruently during a period where she had a boyfriend who didn’t like me. Like, genuinely being insulting and rude. I’d ask what concert she’s going to and she’d say something like “just google it, it’s not that hard.” She blocked me on FB (back when I had it) for no discernible reason. She would say mean things to me and what not. After dealing with that behavior for 8 months or so while being endlessly supportive of her, I told myself enough is enough and I messaged her something along the lines of “I cannot handle  being friends with you right now, if this (I listed her behaviors), is how you’re going to treat me. I am sorry that i’m making this decision but you’ve kind of forced my hand. My door is always open and I love and care about you but I am not going to take this anymore.” A few months go by and I suddenly get a text from her saying that she had no idea how to respond and that she was really disappointed with herself and she really snapped out of it once her and her controlling boyfriend broke up. So I said it was okay and she told me no, it isn’t, I really want to be a better friend to you, so then I said that I forgave her, which I did and still do. She accepted that and continued be a good friend and genuinely has continued to be a good friend 2 years later, even right before she stopped talking to me. We spent a lot of time together from then until now. So maybe she still feels guilty over this? Or maybe she thinks i’m a hypocrite because now I started to be a bad friend to her? 

She hasn’t responded to any of the texts I sent her. 2 of them were just innocuous. “Hey what’s up, wanna hang out,” and the one was basically a text saying that I was genuinely sorry that I hadn’t been investing more time in her. No response. That was about 4 months ago. Considering all of this, I truly can’t figure out what happened. Have I become a bad friend to her? Maybe she hasn’t told me that i’m starting to become a bad friend because I kind of shut her down when she told me the whole thing about me talking about myself. I’m really thinking that this is where it stems from that specific exchange, but I also can’t think of any instances where I was being a particularly “bad friend.” Absent, if anything, but it’s not like I never talked to her. I’m just stumped. And hurt. And I’m desperately trying to figure out what I did. We’ve been good friends for more than 5 years and we have shared a lot of life experiences together. I don’t want this to become a thread on her character, I just want to see what other people think about this situation. Do I sound like I was becoming a bad friend? Feel free to ask questions about our friendship if you need more context, maybe that’ll help me think of instances of me being in the wrong.",25Jan2020,1

I’m currently studying social sciences hoping to go on to do criminology, I’m worried that if I have bipolar working in any sort of police work will be off the table. 
I seem to have a view that if I don’t have an official diagnosis it’s not there.

271,"I work at a university in an small department office. I am an admin 2 and technically my direct supervisor is the admin 3 (which is higher then an admin 2) let’s call her H . 

H’s supervisor is the chair of the department, the chair of the department is not my direct supervisor but the chair most definitely has the say on who stays and goes in the office. 

Me and H are supposed to work the same hours 8-5 mon-fri it is university policy with a one hour lunch break. I get to the office every day at-least by 7:55 so I can open the office. When I was was hired H would always show up atleast by 8am. Then it started to be 8:10, then 8:15. Last semester she would get in around 8:20-8:30 but she would always text me. This semester so far she is not coming in now until 8:30-8:45. Today she didn’t even show up until 9:00. 
H doesn’t always take a lunch but when she does even on the day she shows up 30min late she still takes a full hour for lunch.

I will be honest at the end of the day, only about half the time do we walk out together at 5:00pm so she may be staying late the other half and I just don’t know but I know she is coming in late 5 days a week and we walk out together at least 3 times a week right at 5pm together. 

I have been at the office 2 years. Mine and H’s relationship is more colleague then supervisor and subordinate. We are very open and honest with each other and tell each other almost everything. Down to I have told her when I have applied for other positions and she was my reference. (I love my job but more money ya know!)

This time things is making me upset and is making me feel like I am being taken advantage of. Someone has to be there at 8 to open the office it’s not fair that she can just stroll in when ever she wants. Not to mention it’s university policy we have to work 8-5 not 8:30-5 or 8:45-5 that’s time stealing. The part that suck is our chair gets in at 9:30 every day. So H is always there before 9:30 so the chair does not know she is coming in late every day.

272,"I'm 29 years old and I am going through a bit of a personal crisis due to the fact I'll be 30 soon, which signals the end of my youth. The vast majority of people can look back at their youth with fondness as a time of many friendships, wild nights out, drink, drugs, lots of sexual partners, lots of new experiences.

I have mostly failed to enjoy my life so far. I am intelligent and I have a college degree but I  earn significantly less money than I could if i lived up to my potential. I haven't made a single new friend since I turned 25, and the 3 friends I actually have are more like drinking buddies. I couldn't call on them during a time of crisis. I chose to work online for the last 4 years and I have mostly been lonely during that time.

I haven't engaged in any new social hobbies, such as starting a martial art. I hated college, the vast majority of people love it. You only get one shot at life and being young and I've blown it. I've never even been in shape; I've mostly just been of normal weight but with a beer gut. 

When I think about the rest of life in front of me, however long that may be, it seems like it'll be mostly downhill. I will get old and die. My parents will die. There's no guarantee I'll ever find the right job for me. There's a very good chance I'll never make another friend. There's a strong possibility I won't ever take the steps to push myself to try new things; things I should've tried when I was young.

The only positive thing I experienced was living in Southeast Asia for 18 months during my 20s, which was possible due to my online work. But while that sounds exotic, I was mostly lonely and only ever transiently connected with people while drinking.

274,"Earlier this week, my wife received a phone call from the school superintendent. 

Apparently, she had made a comment on social media about the school systems attendance. They missed a few days last week and returned Tuesday after the MLK holiday. 

She basically repeated something she had heard from a friend of hers via text. That the school attendance was still low and that he had said they he wasn't closing the school system again and they would have to toughen it out. 

Now I understand it's hearsay and rumor, but it seems unprofessional to me that a man in his position would use school resources to look up my wife's name and phone number, just to let her know she was wrong. 

Wouldn't it have been better to have sent a message out dispelling all the hearsay instead of calling her personally?

She was upset over this, and didn't tell me until tonight. She was embarrassed by it.

It had reasons why I’d be a good hamster owner, why it would be beneficial, how to look after it, and even *44* notes of recommendation from my friends, family, and teachers to make it funny and convincing. It took a lot of effort.

I left the booklet on my bed and texted my mum when I left for school asking her to read it. She ignored all my texts, and when I got home she told me she hadn’t bothered reading the booklet and I wouldn’t get a hamster because it’s a distraction. 
I kind of just nodded, then I wen upstairs and cried for two hours (which sounds really pathetic). I didn’t realise it would affect me so much, but a big part of it was that I’d made that whole booklet, which showed I obviously cared a lot, and she hadn’t even bothered reading it. It was quite clear that her reading it meant a lot to me. I just wanted something to make me happier. 

Later, she asked if I’d been crying because my eyes were puffy, and I said no, but texted her 10 minutes later saying that I was upset she didn’t read my booklet, and that I’ve been feeling really lonely and I thought a hamster might help. She ignored it, but I know she was on her phone. 

I know she cares, but I can’t get her to listen to me. I just wish she’d understand from my point of view. It’s not even like a hamster is a big deal, and I said in the booklet, if she’d have read it, that I’d pay for everything and look after him completely on my own. She doesn’t have to get involved at all. A hamster isn’t a massive distraction, and I have hours outside my revision schedule to look after him in. There isn’t a downside. How can I get her to see this? Especially now she’s said no?",25Jan2020,1
278,"So me and my boyfriend officially started dating a month ago. At first he was very sweet, gave me compliments, chatted for hours, amd wanted to meet me a few times a week, i loved it. But now we didn't meet for almost 2 weeks and he lives not that far from me. His excuse is that he is a lazy person, I know that he spends his free time playing video games with his friends. 
 I don't know if I'm over thinking it or there really is a problem with our communication.
I want to be reasonable and understanding, but everytime i suggest to meet up he shots it down, maybe he's tired, busy or lazy. Seems like he doesn't care anymore and it really fucks with my mental state. Seems like I'm not interesting enough or that I'm boring and he rather spend his time differently . And i don't want to make drama where it isn't needed. Should i pressure him to meet me? Should i tell him all this, even if its uncomfortable and may not even be true cuz of my overreaction?

285,"I've been long distance best friends with a girl back home for a while. I had to move to a new country due to a work contract. We're in our mid-late 20s and have been friends for about 7 years. At first, building the friendship was difficult. We were both pretty jaded from past friendships, but once we connected, things were good. Up until about 2 years ago, things were very relaxed, we considered each other to be best friends. 

Then she started to hang out with a few other girls, one of whom really doesn't like me much. Since I am no longer in the country, she's been spending much more time with this new crowd. I'm super happy for her; we all need friends and support and I'm so glad she has that now that I'm gone. But since they've grown closer, I can feel her distancing herself. 

She used to 'like' my posts on social media, but that has stopped completely. When I made a big sappy post for her birthday, she ignored it. She still sends me private messages, but never makes anything public. No comments, no acknowledgement. But with these new friends, she takes and tags photos, likes their posts, makes public birthday posts and other salutations. Just is all around vocal about their friendship. 

I think she ignores me on social media to save face with her new friends. Is she embarrassed of being my friend? Does she pretend to not like me to gain footing with them? Does she even still want to be friends when I come back to the states eventually? 

I want to confront her about how shitty this makes me feel, because to be honest, I don't have many friends and she is very important to me. But I don't want to offend her or make assumptions about her actions. I also recognize that this is a ridiculous issue and that my being upset about her lack of social media attentiveness is stupid. She still keeps up contact with me, but I feel like a dope for liking her posts, commenting on her posts, and making public announcements about our friendship when this isn't reciprocated.",25Jan2020,1

287,"Like the post says, my play tonic female friend is an absolutely boy crazy whack job. She has a new guy in her life literally multiple times a month and she is calling me constantly about different scenarios involving these guys and seeking my advice. 

I feel guilty because I know that part of being a good friend is being there for all of the ups and downs of the other person's life. However, I moved across the country a few years back so her and I really only talk when she needs something.

I'm just getting so incredibly tired of her crying on the phone about this guy and that guy and then two weeks later telling me that she met a guy that she can see herself marrying, only to hear two or three weeks later a 45-minute story about something that happened on a trip with them and whether or not she should stay with him. It's incredibly grating to have to tell her the same words of comfort over and over and over again.

The thing is, if we had more of a friendship beyond her just calling me when she needs advice, I don't think I would have a problem with it as much as I do. Also, it's literally once a month or a few times a month that she has a new guy in her life so it's happening on a very regular basis. If this happened maybe two or three times oh, I would have no problem but it's getting ridiculous. 

I'm flattered that she trusts my advice and likes my words of comfort so much that she keeps coming back, but I simply can't continue to do this. How do I tell her politely that she needs to find somebody else for these types of situations?",25Jan2020,1

So I’ve been stressed out today because of family and work reasons that I won’t dive in to, but I had just sat down to play some sims and try to chill out. My dad comes downstairs and immediately starts bitching about our dog (she is paralyzed and can’t really do anything by herself, he loves her to death but he turns his sadness to frustration) so this puts me in a bad mood, I went to text my mom to let her know that dad was “being f*cking annoying” and without realizing I accidentally sent the message to my dad, he flipped out on me. He finally calmed down for me to cry in his arms and apologize profusely and explain why I did what I did and that I didn’t really mean it. He went upstairs for a little bit and came back down to ask if I wanted to watch a movie, I agreed. It was hard to focus on the movie while quietly sobbing into my tee shirt for the first 30 minutes. By the end of the movie we were quietly cracking jokes about the movie. It’s still a bit tense between us, and I feel absolutely horrible. He has done so much for me, I can’t imagine how he feels right now. I don’t really know why I’m posting here since I don’t have a question, but I just really need to vent.

290,"I've posted pictures of my face in semi/demi public spaces before, and I frequently get comments about my lips. I've always had very full lips thanks to my Native American blood, but I guess I'm too pale for people to assume that's the reason. It doesn't help that they aren't proportioned ""naturally"" for white people, seeing as how my top and bottom lips are almost identical in width. I've had people (strangers who don't know me in real life) comment about how lip fillers and other cosmetic procedures are damaging to young girls' psyche and I should really be upfront about any work I've had done before posting with the hashtags ""nomakeup"" or ""nofilter"". The actual verbiage used is way more condescending and accusatory, but I'm cleaning it up a bit...

On one hand, I can see their point, but on the other, *I have not had any work done*. At all. Should I really have to preface each and every post with ""Yes my lips are full, but they're 100% natural""? They look pretty dang normal to me! Also I keep getting notifications that my photos are getting shared/republished, and I'm worried about where people are sharing my pictures and what they are saying about me. 

How can I prove I don't have fillers so that this stops? Am I being too paranoid? I don't want to consider reduction surgery - I like my lips! Also, I don't have many, if any, pictures from when I was a little girl when I wasn't smiling big so you can't see how wide my lips were.

294,"Alright, so there is a veeery long story behind this post; I’ll do my best to break it down as easily as possible.

For the past twelve years, I’ve been homeschooled both by my parents up until the eighth grade, and online school throughout my high school years. As I progressed, my parents pushed me to skip a few years here and there, and I am now currently two years ahead of my peers, as I am a senior at 16. 

While this, in and of itself, isn’t a big problem, I am worried for what the future holds for me. I am currently dual enrolling at a local college, and while the academics aren’t too much of an issue, I seriously struggle to make friends or fit in with the other students, as the overwhelming majority of them are adults and several years older than I am.

On the other hand, I enjoy hanging out with my high school friends more than anything, and I actually feel like I have a place amongst them. For all my life I’ve been homeschooled, and never really had the time or opportunity to be a kid or teenager, uncaring of what the future holds. My whole life has been focused on school - without end, I’ve put my studies and academics over literally everything else.

Now that I’m at the end of this process, I can’t help but feel like I missed out on so much. I want nothing more than to just be a teenager for a few years, and live the life I’ve been given. Yes, I’m ahead academically, and yes, I have the opportunity to go to college a a younger age than most - but honestly, I don’t want any of that. I’m more than happy to wait two years, and simply go at the same age as the rest of my peers, rather than struggling to adapt when far younger than my classmates. However, at this point, I don’t know if this is possible to do; my parents, of course, only care about academics, and want me to move on to college. Logistically, I’m not even sure if I can go back - I already have a set GPA and high school transcript, and as far as I know, these can’t be redone.

So, basically, I wanted to hear what you guys think of my situation, and if there’s anything I can do about it by this point. I just want to live life, and be a teenager for a few years before moving on to adulthood; unfortunately, I fear that is too much to ask by now.

She pointed out the cops’ races, two White Males  and a Hispanic Female. She said she felt more uncomfortable by the Hispanic female and said along the lines of “Hispanics are worse than white people when it comes to racism” and said she was searching her house even though she was only a witness to the case.

303,"i am 25. i have been in college since 2013. i took one semester at my dream private school but left because it was too expensive and then took about two semesters off before going to the school i now attend. 

there have been outside contributing factors for why i have not graduated yet but those factors my parents have understood and were the original suggesters of taking less classes during some semesters. 

i am also double majoring in sociology and english. so that takes a little longer graduating, naturally of course. i am almost done with my english degree. 

i broke my leg last april during finals. it really threw a wrench in my plans. i would have my english degree already and almost done with my sociology degree if i hadn’t broken my leg last year. 

i didn’t want to go back to classes this semester. it’s the first time i’ve been back since spring 2019. 

i became more depressed than before when i broke my leg. i had “cabin fever” from being bedridden for months and having no visitors aside from family. 

i knew my mental state was not stable for me to come back, even if i could walk the campus again (but still need surgery again after spring semester, to fix my ACL and my torn meniscus). but my parents insisted. 

it’s only been two weeks but i have rapidly declined with my mental health. 

my step dad wants me to finish school asap because he’s tired of how long i’ve been in. he also wants me to graduate so i can get a good paying job and move out of their house. i understand. 100%. my mom wants me back in too because she thinks school will give me a goal again. 

but i don’t know what to do. 

i don’t have financial aid, my parents pay for my college and have since i switched to my local state college. i know they’re ready to stop paying. i have been grateful, always. i understand their need for me to graduate. i do not blame them at all. they also want me to have my degrees so i can have a real job within my degrees and be on the real path to adulthood. 

but i have been thinking of killing myself every single day for the past year. and it has been almost two years since my ex bf of 4 years ended things with me. 

it destroyed me. i still have a hard time coping. i haven’t slept with, kissed or even flirted with someone else since he broke up with me, totaling it being almost 6 years since i’ve been intimate with someone else other than him. 

and dealing with my leg issues have only worsened things. it was so random and unexpected. i worry about my future. i want to travel. and have a child and be able to carry it on my hip without my knee giving out. 

i can’t do school right now. i can’t focus. it’s so hard navigating campus. i go to school in the city. students aren’t thoughtful of my visible leg brace. i can’t go down the stairs normally because that’s a different bodily motion than going up, i have to take a step down, bring my other leg and foot to the same step and repeat to go down. like a toddler. 

i have to wait until everyone has used the elevators because i can’t go up the two flight of stairs to go up one floor. and everyone who uses the elevators go up to the 5+ floors. when i get on a full elevator, students are visibly annoyed that i’m using their time to use the elevator to go one floor up. 

it’s too much. i had to leave class early this past wednesday because i was having a panic attack in the library.

308,"Sorry, this is going to be long.
Okay so i’m starting with this. I just recently started to accept that I’m bisexual. I’ve always been attracted to both males and females since as long as I can remember. I’m okay with this and have been for a while. I’d say i’m a very accepting person and never felt the importance to try and prove my masculinity to anyone. I’d say i’m actually more feminine in some areas and i’m not afraid to show my feelings.
Coming from an old-fashioned family, this is frowned upon due to past generations of practicing toxic masculinity. By showing your feelings or doing/acting/wearing anything slightly feminine, you automatically surrender your “pride”. I don’t understand that and think it’s better to just be yourself instead of constantly seeking approval from other men. I’m happy with who I am and I try to embrace it more than ever now. With that being said, I haven’t told anyone about my new discovery and it’s because I don’t know what would happen. Like I said, i’m completely fine with it, but I know many people wouldn’t be. 
Also, I don’t have many people that I trust and can talk to about this. My friend groups are small and we all know each other, I live in a small town where all people do is gossip, and i’m not sure how my girlfriend would react to this.
Just recently coming to grips with this, I haven’t told my girlfriend. We have been together going on 4 years and I just don’t know how to tell her. I know she would accept me, because she’s amazing. However, she is also very insecure, and i’m not sure how she would take it. I constantly reassure her that I love her and how beautiful she is to me, but sometimes it’s hard to know if she truly believes it herself. It’s heartbreaking because I love her and want her to know I mean what i’m saying. I feel like by telling her, she’s just going to become more insecure or worry that I’m more attracted to men or like she has to compete more. I try my hardest not to give her reasons to be more insecure and that’s why it’s so hard to tell her. I feel like if I told this to anybody, i’d want it to be her though.

Okay so now for the story. I recently had an office party where we played a game where we split into groups and competed against each other. My group was missing a member so it was just 3 of us. In the game, we basically had to gather points by taking pictures and videos of things. The first team to complete the list and show everything to the manager wins. For example, some of the things on the list involved taking a picture with everyone in your group in a shopping cart and a video of a member twerking.
Well, one of the pictures we needed was of two group members kissing. My group consisted of 2 males and one female. The girl in the group was in a long term relationship and the other boy (we’ll call him Tyler) was single. Well the first options was her kissing one of us, which I wasn’t going to do due to my relationship. But then she said she can’t either due to hers, Then we figured the best option would be the two guys kissing, because that would be better than me kissing a girl right? Tyler was straight and according to everyone else, so was I. I have always found him a little attractive and easy to talk to, but never imagined this would happen. Well when the time came, we went in for the kiss. When our lips touched, I didn’t expect his to be so soft and it surprised me. I felt a little jolt of excitement and the kiss felt longer than it probably was. We pulled back embarrassed but I was secretly kind of happy. It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. It was a little awkward after that, but we shook it off and almost started acting like nothing happened. Well I couldn’t stop thinking about that kiss for that whole night and when I seen him at work the next day, I felt nervous. I’m not sure if it was just because I had my first kiss with a boy or not, but I felt happier.
However, now I don’t know if I should feel regret. I’m not sure if I should tell my girlfriend or how I would. I don’t feel like I betrayed her since it was for a game, but I did like it at least a little bit. I’m not sure if I liked it just because it was a liberating moment that helped me come to terms with my sexuality or another reason.

316,"I am a female. My husband and I have been staying with my parents for a few months until we find a house. Very thankful for them. 

My mom pretty much has no filter with words and sometimes actions. If we’re around the house hanging out or I could even be doing dishes, or go to her room to ask her a question, or be on the couch watching tv. Literally anything and I might get a flash. Sometimes she might like move her boob up or shake them if I look her way or if she’s braless sometimes she will flash me. Sometimes if she’s on the couch if she’s in a dress or even pants she will spread her legs and flash me, sometimes she has underwear, sometimes she has nothing on. Other scenarios include her flashing me when like my brother or husbands head is turned the other way as if that’s funny. One time she pulled her dress up and said “wow look how my butt is getting flat”, no underwear. Every time I look away but I obviously get an accidental fucking glimpse that I hate and had no warning for. One time I was stretching on my back and she stood over me and had no underwear with a dress on. Like come on. 

I want to clarify this is not a 24/7 thing, but it does happen I would say once a day to at least 4 times a week. My mom and I are close but I am not close with anybody in the sense I am comfortable with flashing or anything. Idk where she got this, I know her mom does not do that. 

Today my mom did it and I had to raise my voice because I tell her everyone “please stop it bothers me when you do that” and she’ll say “oh what are u talking about i didn’t do anything”. Also, I’ve exposed her to my dad and brother and husband and just said it all out loud to stop flashing me and it’s scarring me and if I had a daughter I would not be doing that. I feel like there are funnier things to do or say and more intelligent things to do or say. I told her today it was abuse and it really bothers me. She seems to be quiet and she eventually apologized and said she didn’t mean to hurt me in that way. 

My mom is really open but she honestly doesn’t get clues, and doesn’t care about feelings until you get super mad. 

This isn’t something that consumes the days but it does bother me for a while because I have the image in my head and I am in awe that she thinks it’s funny/ok.

318,"I live with 2 random roommates who are best friends with each other. Over the semester we've had some issues. We decided on laundry days so we wouldn't get in each other's way, but one of my roommates would consistently leave her clothes in the dryer on my laundry day. I mentioned this to her and it took forever for her to finally stop doing that. However, she sometimes has her boyfriend over and lets him do his laundry on my days without asking me first.

The day before finals week, my roommate interrupted my laundry to dry her things without asking me first. I didn't say anything and ended up waiting around 3 hours to dry my clothes as they sat in the washer. Later she knocked on my door and asked if I was done with laundry (Why didn't she ask me that BEFORE she started doing hers?) I was irritated and said, ""No."" She's like, ""Okay you seem to have this chip on your shoulder and this attitude has to stop. None of this is a big deal."" I yelled at her and said, ""No! Go away. I'm not dealing with this right now. I've got a lot that I'm dealing with. Just go away!!!"" She's like, ""I don't care what you're dealing with"" Later, as she left the apartment, she said, ""If you raise your voice at me again, you're going to regret it. Just letting you know.""

I'm also the only one who takes out the trash. I made both of my roommates aware of this. However, I'm still taking out the trash almost every time. Whenever they change the trash, they tend to leave the trash bag right next to the trashcan. Yesterday, I noticed this again.

I said, ""There was a full trash bag sitting next to the trashcan. I took it to the dumpster. Idk who left it, but when you change trash, please take it to the dumpster. I'm mentioning this to (other roommate) too""

She responded, ""Who's mom are you ? Oh that's right, NO ONES. Stop talking to me. I've been trying to be civil with you but I see you don't know what civil is. Don't tell me what to do. I do what I want. You weren't even supposed to live where we live. It was an accident and now we're stuck living with you so act accordingly. I was trying to be nice and not block you but now I am blocking you so whatever you have to say save it because the message won't go through :)""

I've barely made any requests as a roommate.

\*Things I've requested\*

\-that we remember our laundry days and remove our laundry when we're done with the dryer

\-that trash bags are always taken to the dumpster and that we alternate on trash

\-One time my roommate left her underwear in the kitchen sink and I asked her to let it soak in the bathtub or bathroom sink instead

\-One time they were super loud on a school night at 2 am- I posted in our group me and asked them to be quiet

Those are literally the only concerns I've brought to them as a roommate and this one girl started arguments with me every time. I'm a quiet introvert and spend most of my time in my bedroom whenever I'm at the apartment. I don't think I'm being unreasonable.",25Jan2020,1
319,"Hello -

I am 28/F/straight, if that’s relevant. 

I am a manager at my place of work. One of the employees in my small department (and friend of mine - 29/F/straight) found out 3 months ago (4 months into her pregnancy) that her baby would be born with a rare birth defect that has a 0% survival rate. The baby may live a few minutes or as many as 3 days, but will ultimately pass away. There is also a 50% chance that she will give birth prematurely. She is due in two months, if all goes well. 

When she found this out, she told me right away. She also told me that she had chosen to carry the baby to term, despite knowing all this. Most other people in the office do not know and assume she is having a healthy baby. She has been very candid about her heartbreak and struggles surrounding the situation with me. 

Although she has mostly been calm and accepting of the current situation, I know that once she has the baby and experiences its passing, she may feel very differently. 

Reddit, I don’t have any of my own children so I honestly can’t imagine what she is - and will be - going through, and need advice on how to make her feel supported when she returns to work (and during everything leading up to it). What are some things that I can say and help her? Is there anything I can do to help prepare our coworkers for her return to the office? (i.e., briefing them of the situation - with her permission, of course.) I don’t know what is appropriate in this situation, especially considering I am one of the only people in the company who knows.",25Jan2020,1

322,"I am in my last semester of college right now for a major I hate, and I feel like I have absolutely no resource to help me. In fact, the nearing end of college feels like the approach of death. Below I'll elaborate a little.

I know I can't just idle after college, I need to earn money somehow because that's the world we live in, but no level of the education system prepares you in knowing what you want to do without a trial by fire. The one shallow friendship I had on campus just betrayed me last week, and recently, I am starting to feel like I am slipping into a big state of depression for the 2nd time in my life. 

The only thoughts I've had about possible careers is either acting/voice acting, or the military (either as an officer or attempt spec ops recruitment, because the difficulty and prestige of the former attract me). My personality and outward expression were shaped years ago with bad social experiences in elementary/middle school, and the lack of expression and some social skill/confidence I have today means I have no genuine friends, and socializing past formal situations is a road to failure. My outer self is entirely different from my inner self. The fear of having the attention of people drawn to me and myself being embarrassed is probably what makes me keep to myself in most social situations.

Most days I just watch videos or play some games, but many times this is just to remove myself from reality and attempt to feel some entertainment. I think it may just be either genetics or the past, but I can't even recall how many years ago it was that I actually felt 'happy', even if not depressed/sad. If it wasn't for my love of my immediate family/pets, and sentimentality, the idea of being dead wouldn't be so detestable. And if I had lost them, I'd probably break.

I'm fit, smart, adaptable, and much much more, but every day I die a little inside because I feel trapped. I really fucking hate it all, and I want to scream and even cry as I type this because of the position I am in today. One of the things that just makes it all worse is that there is no one out there that can help, and life's a solo mission to suffer through.",25Jan2020,1

Instead, everyone kept the truth from me and let me fall on my face, let the slow burn of coming to the realization myself do all the revenge for them. They decided to spare my feelings?

325,"Dear folks, please share your wise thoughts with me:

3 years ago I bought a cat as a companion for a sick family member. Since that person couldn’t take care of the cat, I took all responsibility upon me, took care of her since she was a kitten and even moved the cat with me in a small apartment of only two very small rooms that we both shared with initial difficulty but successfully. Over the last months and year, I built an emotional and friendly connection with this wise looking animal.

After time passing by and me being occupied with work and other things, I found the cat more and more looking lonely at certain times which also broke my heart. As a starting entrepreneur, my total image of myself also did not really involve a cat. Yesterday I sold her to a new home where she would most definitely live happy and share the place with a fellow cat friend.

I never knew how I would miss her until I came home and saw her empty spot and the place and the things she played with. Her sudden absence without her funny cat behavior, left me with a sad emptiness. Never had expected this from myself either.

I know that, in time, I would manage the feelings and get used to the new situation without her. However, I would always remember this feeling as if a close part of me was ceded and I should maybe have had found another solution. I also know that if required, I could get the cat back and improve the pets situation with me (by among others getting a second cat in the future). I had already invested a lot financially. 

I still cannot shake the idea of getting the cat back but on the other side, I don’t want to be egoistic and bereave the poor animal from happiness too. Does that argument even work here? I am at a 60 - 40 ratio of leaving the cat in her new home but the poor animal had become a part of my family. Was I too hard on myself and maybe on her too? Have I made a mistake?",25Jan2020,1

328,"Ok. So I live in a house with a sibling in university, my mother, my father, and my grandmother. This past year has been really hard. There’s been struggles going on financially, physically, and so this additional strain that has always been present just is intolerable now.

My grandmother is 83. She’s always on her iPad looking at propaganda. We learned to stop caring what she does but the problem is she’s constantly yelling at her iPad. Like yelling at the people and insulting them. And if you confront her she gets incredibly defensive and angry. She insists she never said a word even when you were right in front of her. 

Also, she’s a senior. So this technology is not very compatible with her. She’s always tapping to hard and not being patient and then becomes convinced someone did something to the wifi and gets mad. 

There are other problems. Like she makes a huge mess when she cooks and my dad hates that. But my family can’t endure this anymore. She’s my grandmother so obviously we aren’t going to kick her out. She is very, very, VERY dependant and clings to my mom, so homes aren’t in the question.

It’s tearing my family apart. We can’t leave her home alone with my dad for example. There’s a fight almost everyday. I do my homework with the noise of her yelling. We just don’t know what to do, because she has so much space but always creates drama. Like she treats her bathroom very poorly and obviously it’s still our house but you can’t bring it up because she’ll get so mad. She talks to herself a lot. I love my grandma, I really really love her and I regret having to see this dark side of my family. I want a solution more than anything but it’s just hard to make any progress because she is in denial and doesn’t tell the truth and is very easily offended and dramatic (exclaiming I hope my food is poisoned after being asked not to make such a mess).

Please take the time to read this and help or pray for me. I feel like my house has always been a senior home. There’s so much different about my physical house and my life that have been made to accommodate for life with a senior citizen. I don’t regret it but I just want to live in my own house. There’s already so many eggshells to walk around.",25Jan2020,1

330,"I feel like I’m looked down on because of the things I’m sad, angry, and stressed about. People have been through so much worse than me, yet here I am contemplating suicide. 

I grew up lonely with no friends because I was homeschooled. And I’m very awkward socially. 

On top of this, I’ve had trouble with what I believe is ADHD. I have many symptoms of it. 

I’ve been stressed about not being able to get the help I need for these things. And not being able to pay for other things such as fixing my rotted teeth, speech therapy, therapy, and an ADHD diagnosis.

And This next thing is something I feel really stupid about, but also really hate my parents. I feel stupid because they’ve been financially supportive. They’ve bought me the things I needed or wanted growing up. They bought me a car, and a then different one because the first one didn’t work out. And just spoiled me with things growing up. So I’m thankful for all that. I’m thankful for all the financial support. 

But there is mental abuse that I can’t forgive them for. My dad cheating on my mom and threatening to leave constantly, the few times my dad threatened to beat me, my mom saying hurtful things to me, being manipulative(I think), them doing questionably sexual things in front of me. 

And overall, they were not very supportive emotionally. They think that I’m just lazy or that “I just want something to be wrong with me”. 

I hate them for all these things, and no matter how hard I try I can’t forgive them. 

And I also just graduated school, and I live far away from town. So I can’t get a job just yet. I have to get my drivers license. Which I’m in a process of getting it. And then be able to get a job. From there, I hope to move away, and distance myself from my parents. And pay for all the things I need, like the therapy and all that stuff. I really just want to get away from my parents. I hate them, and I feel like there nothing I could do about it.

I feel like a I’m just a spoiled brat for feeling this way. I feel like everyone looks down on me for it because they’ve probably been through worse or something like that. I’m scared to go get help, when I am able to afford it, because I’m afraid I won’t get taken seriously. I feel like nobody takes me seriously because I’ve been privileged financially, and had everything that was supposed to make me happy, but I’m not.

Am I just a spoiled brat for feeling this way? I feel like I am and I feel pathetic about it.

331,"I'll start this off by saying that I got paired with 2 other roommates that I've had lots of problems with. One of my roommates just kinda sits around all day and plays PS4, and we're friendly but he's not the type of person I would hang out with. My other roommate is probably the least favorite people I've ever met. I don't need to get into the details, but having crappy roommates has made it extremely difficult to make friends during my first year of college. During the first week, they were out every night and were never in the room so I never even got to know them the first damn week of school. Also, there's only 3 other rooms on my floor and I've only talked to one of the kids out of all those rooms. Everyone on my floor either has a friend group already or are extreme introverts.

During my first week of college, I met a lot of people and I hung out with those people for a couple of weeks, except for some reason we just stopped staying and touch and now I never talk to them. Overall, I've just gotten really weird vibes from a lot of the kids that I've met here. Majority of the population are Cali kids and they're either douchey or just straight up weird. (Both of my roommates are from Cali). I've also partied with like 10 different groups of people and then we never talk after that. Maybe it's my fault that I'm not initiating another hangout, but it just seems like they have good friends already. I even went on 2 ski trips with one kid and we seemed like great friends, and then I asked him if he wants to go again, and he just never responded. It's been a lot of that kind of stuff and I don't know why.

I also had a good friend from high school that was here for a couple of weeks, but he ended up leaving and decided to take a gap year instead. I eventually met someone that ended up being my best friend and we did pretty much everything together. He was in a similar position as me - crappy roommates and floormates and didn't know a lot of people. So we tried meeting other people together and we did meet a ton of people, but none of them really ""stuck"" because it seemed they were all in a friend group already and didn't want to expand off of it. And unfortunately, this friend decided to leave after the first semester. This pretty much screwed me over for the second semester because I really did everything with him and it seems that everyone else is already in their friend group. 

I have a couple of friends that I can go skiing with on the weekends but honestly, they're all kind of weird and I don't love hanging out with them. I'm also in two clubs but since it's such a big school it's basically just signing up for trips, but it's super hard to get on them. I also rushed a couple frats last semester but that just gave me weird vibes. Sucking up to the brothers during rush and basically paying for friends and parties just seems unnecessary. I also don't feel like I'm extroverted enough to just go up to different brothers out of the blue and initiate conversation. Although, I am considering doing it again next year if I still can't find friends.

Not having anything to look forward to on the weekend makes me pretty miserable during the week and makes me wonder if I should transfer or something. Idk. I'm just really worried that I'm going to waste my college years because I want to love it here so bad but my lack of social life won't let me. I absolutely love the school and my grades are good I just hate my current social life.

For next year I applied to an apartment with roommate matching, and I put in all of my interests, so hopefully that will pair me with people that I can become friends with. Also, my friend from high school is coming back, so that should help too. But I'm pretty much banking on the roommate match thing to work. If I don't end up being friends with them, I have no idea what I'm going to do. All of my friends from home have a friend group because of their roommates and it makes me so jealous.

So basically, am I going to find my friend group eventually? Am I wasting my college years?

334,"Hi all, I apologize in advance for length. My neighbor has a male cat who is not fixed and who she has been keeping her back door open for all day &amp; night. He's a very nice Kitty and I have no issues with him coming and going. My issue is he's very obviously not fixed. I've spotted him mating and can also hear him at all times of the day and night yowling. He's quite the Casanova. 

I have 2 issues with this. The first is extremely selfish in that he's very loud and it's obnoxious in the middle of the night. He has a favorite lady friend that lives in the complex next to us, the balcony of which is just a few feet from my bedroom window. So, being the romantic that he is, he cries outside her door in hopes that her owner let's her out. He's so loud that the first time it happened my boyfriend and I heard him over my noisemaker and we jolted up in fear that it was one of my own cats in distress. 

The second is that I'm very very against not fixing your cats and then letting them run amuck. I hate the idea of poor baby kitties being born and shelters being overrun. Not all shelters keep kitties alive until adoption. Also, shelters force you to get your cats fixed before bringing them home for a reason. Kitty pregnancy is very difficult on cats, as is kitty labor. Especially for his feral baby mamas. He doesn't seem to have a job, so I doubt he's paying child support. 

So I'm wondering if anyone could give me advice about bringing this up with my neighbor? I don't want to upset her, she's very nice. But I'd like to offer to get him fixed. I'd pay if it meant less abandoned babies in the world. Is this something I can bring up with her, or is it something that might make her angry? 

Any advice is appreciated!

But when I got out I started going to college, I'm a straight A and B student. And plan to stay that way. But is it all even really worth it? Just cause I get my degrees (computer security, and industrial technology, I want to stop cyber crime....)  Doesnt mean ill get a job, I have no friends, no family, and I'm so ugly no girls will ever give me a chance. 

I really think my best bet at ever being happy is suicide. It seems to be the BEST option. I just am not sure what else to do. I really want to make a difference in the world for the better but I have a feeling ill be a ugly, lonely virgin, working at mcdonalds the rest of my life. 

Should I kill myself? Idk what to do anymore. I havent slept in days thinking about this, I fall asleep on the drive home fron work sometimes. Ive given up.",25Jan2020,1
340,"My household is in a hectic state and I feel like I’m getting the worst of it. I know that probably sounds selfish but there’s so much. I don’t have a room, per se. 2 family members are now living with my parents, my sister, and I. They are insufferable. I offered the younger one my room, as I was already in talks to make myself a room in our garage. So, for a few months I was stuck in a limbo of sleeping on the couch waiting for everything to be finalized. I talked with my parents about designing it and all of that. When the actual renovation came around, I realized that it was actually a big mistake. My dad commandeered the whole thing; he put in square carpeting for his favorite baseball team, with a heinous mural covering an entire wall to match. Whenever I talked about the room in an excited tone, he’d shut it down saying it’s really just his poker room. Why did no one tell me this? Why are we even working on this room in the first place? Even worse, my dads home office is in there. I figured it wouldn’t be a problem, since he usually works away from home. Now, he’s there ALL THE TIME. I can never get a second of privacy. My dad and I also haven’t been in a good place in our relationship. I’m uncomfortable even being near him. I keep trying to voice my concerns to everyone around me, but no one seems to care.

341,"For back story, this guy and I met on a video game we both play about 3 days ago.

I don’t know how, but somehow I managed to to talk him out of it. He was crying, I was crying. Thankfully I must have said the right thing because it worked and he is still here today.

Anyway, my screen name on this game has candy in it and today he sent me a picture of a tattoo he’s getting of a lollipop dedicated to me. I’m so glad I was able to help this guy, but I’m a bit concerned about having something dedicated to me on a strangers body forever. I feel guilty for being uncomfortable with it, but he is insisting he wants this. I don’t think it’s my place to tell him not to get it, but I feel weird about a stranger going this.

344,"I’ll try to keep this short. I’m a senior in high school. I’m going to move away for college next year. Long story why, but it’s just not a good idea for me to stay here. My plan was to go to Portland state university, but the more research I do, the more it seems to just not be the school for me. My parents don’t want me to leave, and it’s taken a lot of convincing for them to even consider letting me go. Not that I can’t just go since I’ll be 18, but it would be “against their wishes”. PSU (Portland State) seemed like a great school. But I’ve started to realize that since it’s a commuter school, the majority of students are older people who are returning to college. I’m not saying that I only want to go to college to party and stuff, but I also feel like doing the stereotypical college activities include partying, being around young people, and having fun. I care a lot about my education, but I also want to have fun. I’ve started looking at Arizona state. It’s actually cheaper than PSU, and it’s in a warmer state, with younger people, a bigger party scene, and a good acceptance/graduation rate. The only problem here is that I’m scared my parents will freak out at me for trying to switch universities and that they’ll say I’m being immature. I’m also scared that since my older sister lives there, she’ll get mad that I’m trying to copy her or something. I’m probably overthinking the second part, but I’m lost, and I have nobody to talk to, and I’ve been having a bit of a mental breakdown about this for the past couple hours. I just feel confused, and I’m scared of people getting mad at me or something. I don’t know, I just really need help, and someone to make me feel better, thanks",25Jan2020,1

350,"I’m asking for general advice, resources, or support-

Over the weekend, my boyfriend was in a serious accident. He fell three stories onto his back. My boyfriend broke his skull, his neck, five bones in his back, four ribs, and collapsed his lung. 

I was there when he fell, I truly thought he was going to die. He was bleeding out from his head and his eyes had rolled back (apparently this was due to the spot he hit in his brain). He does not remember the fall and I feel as if I have not been able to process it completely. 

The incident keeps replaying in my head. Even the events after the initial incident- looking down at my clothes and hands, covered in blood. Thank goodness he does not remember the fall or the first night in the ICU. 

He is not paralyzed in anyway nor did he sustain any sort of permanent brain injury- only a serious concussion.  It is truly a miracle that he is expected to make a full recovery. 

My boyfriend and I live together. I will be taking care of him while working full time. As a side note, I will be able to help him out of bed in the morning and he can get up out of a chair with assistance and hold food/drinks up to his mouth. 

I guess I am reaching out for advice from anyone who has been in this sort of caregiver role. I anticipate a lot of anger/frustration from his part in the next couple weeks- totally understandable and reasonable. I just would like some resources or help so that I can respond appropriately and help him recover as positively and efficiently as possible.... also to vent a little bit.",25Jan2020,1

360,"i’m not sure what to think here, and i could use some help. 

some background- i was abused as a kid (physically but especially emotionally), not many of my friendships have lasted, and a few months ago lost my best friend of a few years (and a few other friends with them) 

i keep thinking of what they said. “your friends don’t deserve an awful friend like you”. “have fun cutting yourself by yourself”. “i hope you’re other friends realize how fake you are and drop you just like your health is dropping”. maybe i’m just saying this to trick you all into feeling bad for me, but it all keeps running through my head. 

well now all i am is practically friendless (i have 5 at most, which i mostly only text here and there), and all i really hang out with is my SO. 

we’ve been together since we were 15(almost 16)/17 (1.5 year gap), and he’s always so nice to me. i’m so scared that i’ve tricked him into loving me, and that maybe the best thing for me to do to him is leave him. 

today i ended up just crying a ton in my car. i felt miserable, dug into my skin with a paper clip while he wasn’t looking, and curled up on the floor of my car just crying. feeling like i needed to end our relationship, for his sake. feeling like my crying was just me being even more manipulative, making him care for me. 

by the end of the night (he had to leave), i regrettably pretty much refused to promise to see him tomorrow (was thinking of game ending myself.. or maybe i just wanted him to worry.. i don’t fucking know anymore).. he started crying, and it made me feel so sad for him/shitty to have made him cry, and yet i also maybe liked seeing that he cared?.. 

i know it’s sick, i hate it. 

so i promised to see him tomorrow morning for breakfast (8 hours from now). 

i got home and we texted some.. he was still so nice, it makes no sense. he said he loves me and that it’s ok (every time i said i was so sorry for ruining the night), that he just wants me to be happy. that he could never hate me, that he wants to be with me as long as he can.. he said i should quit abusing myself when i tried to express that i worried i was being abusive to him... that he hopes i can learn to trust him and his judgement on what’s best for him (wanting to stay with me)

i don’t get why he could ever still want to be with me, when being around me fucking sucks. unless i’ve somehow groomed him or manipulated him somehow. i feel sick, i love him and want to be with him but i also want what’s best for him. 

i don’t want to lose him but i do want what’s best for him. i need someone to talk some sense into me, please. help me.",25Jan2020,1

367,"Yesterday I was at my friends house (will call him Joe) helping his mom and his brother load stuff into a small trailer. My other friend (we’ll call him Tom) pulled up to the house, and keep in mind he was diagnosed with clinical depression about 3 weeks ago and has been on antidepressants for about 2 weeks but he isn’t suicidal or at least that’s what he has told me before. He also has taken many other drugs before. This is what he said when he arrived.

Tom: “dude I just took hella fuckin narcotics before I came here”

Me: “uh what do you mean like your anti-depressants?”

Tom: “No I took 20 pills of...” (I don’t remember exactly what he took and he was fine and drove here so I didn’t think a whole lot of it, I know it was completely stupid to sorta dismiss it and I should’ve done something right there)

Me: “How do you feel?”

Tom: “honestly I feel fine”

So convo ends, now let’s skip about 20min later. 

So me, Joe, and Tom are the only ones at the house since Joes mom and brother left. 10min before they left, Tom had gone to the bathroom in the house (whilst we were still loading stuff in trailer). So after the mom and the brother leave, about another 10min pass and I go and check on Tom because he’s been in there for 20min and had told me he took 20 pills. 

Me: *knocks on locked bathroom door* “Tom what are you doing in there?”

Tom: “lying down”

Me: “uh why?”

Tom: “cause I feel like it”

So I go back into a different room that Joe is in when all of a sudden I hear a subtle thud, at first I didn’t think much of it but then I decided to check on my friend anyway. I get right next to the bathroom door and just hear Tom let out what sounded like an angry scream of rage as if he was having a mental breakdown which isn’t like Tom at all. So I immediately go tell Joe that I heard screaming and that we should check on him. We both walk back to the bathroom door and knock but no response and then we start hearing a bunch of fast loud thuds repeatedly so Joe rushes to get something to open the door. We get it open and Tom is on the floor having a seizure, eyes wide open, saliva coming out of his mouth, and shaking like crazy. So we call ambulance and such and they took him to the hospital and Tom is now fine. 

But the biggest question that I have is, why 20 pills? No one just takes 20 pills of something, especially since I remember Tom told me the recommended dose is 400mg and he took 1000mg...so what I’m asking is, was this some sort of suicide attempt? Please let me know what you think.",25Jan2020,1

369,"Sooo. This all started from my sophomore year in high school. I had a girl in my class and she was a freshman (let’s call her Emmy). Time passed by and we kinda became a thing but for only a week because I didn’t feel ready to be in a relationship and I know that sounds extremely stupid. Nonetheless I didn’t know what I was doing at the time. I was extremely surprised and in shock by the fact that she liked me back. 

A reason why I called it off was because we had a lack of communication. But something I didn’t know at that time was that her parents were extremely strict and they didn’t allow her to have a phone and I only saw her for 1 class, 3 times a week. I was never in a relationship before so I was awkward as hell. 

Fast forward some more time into the beginning of my junior year after that small little thing we had. I believed that she moved on... Also I got to know her best friend (let’s call her Ash) and I may or may have not caught some stirrings for her. 

The way I caught stirrings for Ash was by getting to know her and because she kinda helped me out to ask a girl out to a homecoming dance, I did ask that girl out and she said yes (but she said yes to avoid me on getting embarrassed infront of the whole school, it was a very big thing in the cafeteria and it was stupid but I’m still friends with her though) some time has passed after that rejection and one of our friends was throwing a Friendsgiving around thanksgiving. Ash and several friends from our school showed up and we were there having fun. Then it started to get cold and we started cuddling together, she laid on me and held my hands while we were on a blanket together and watched the rest of our friends have fun. That day ended and I caught feelings for Emmy’s best friend. 
The day of the homecoming dance came, Emmy couldn’t go because of her strict parents but Ash could. I met up with her and I guess she became my date. We danced, had a lot of fun and by the end I carried her around because her feet was hurting from her heels. And by the end of it all of that I caught even more feelings for Ash. 

Winter break arrived and on Christmas night I decided to text Ash on how I felt about her. She responded with “idk what to say” because I typed a whole essay like this one. I never got a response and I guessed she had me friendzoned the entire time. Or maybe because I confessed my feelings trough text I don’t know, it was 2 years ago. 
More time has passed and during our lunch period I sat with both Emmy and Ash (along with another friend and we’ll call him Mario) 
I guess Ash told Emmy about how I had feelings for Ash. While we were getting lunch, Emmy stayed behind with our friend Mario. By the time we got to the table, Emmy was sad and broken. She was crying and we didn’t know why. This led to Ash getting sad too because she felt horrible on why her bestfriend was having an emotional breakdown and she couldn’t do anything to help. Eventually Emmy left the cafeteria and said that she wants to be alone and it left all of us confused and shocked. Ash then fled to the restroom stalls and Mario and I tried to follow her but she was gone. Mario started to break down the situation for me. He told me that Emmy still had feelings for me and she just wanted me and Ash to be happy together.  But clearly she wasn’t happy about it. 

A few days have passed and we were back in our lunch table. But this time it was different. Emmy and Ash were together while ignoring me and my friend Mario. When we started to walk to class together I overheard them saying that nothing will break them apart and something about how it will never happen again and how a guy will not break them apart. 

I started to put the puzzle pieces together but I just pretended like I didn’t hear. 

More time has passed and I became a simp for Ash because of the whole friend giving and homecoming dance events. I was skipping class to see Ash and buying her a lot of things... typical simp I know. 

Senior year has arrived and we all have gotten over it I guess. I asked Ash to homecoming this time but she said yes in a pity way since I put a lot of effort to asking her. I got roses for her, a big poster, and chocolate. After asking ash, she separated herself from me and I felt a lot of pressure from her talking to her friends in the corner and I knew it was about me. I got this strong feeling of sadness and this annoying feeling on your throat you get when you know they were talking bad stuff about you but you acted like you didn’t hear a thing. I knew that she wanted to reject me but she didn’t wanted to hurt me so she just said yes. Ash then made up an excuse to leave class to “pick something up” and she didn’t come back till the end of class. 

Emmy has gotten a new boyfriend with some guy who seems nice. I swear I didn’t get jealous but yeah, kinda hurts. 

Homecoming dance came and Emmy still couldn’t go because of her strict parents. Ash went but this time she ignored me the whole time. Yes I danced with her for about 2 songs but she then left me alone to go dance with other friends. We met back together at our table at the dance and I asked her if she wanted to go dance, she told me that I can go dance and she was gonna stay there. I didn’t know what I did wrong but I felt really alienated at the table because she was talking to one of our friends the whole time. 
Ash then went to go dance with her friend even after I asked her if she wanted to dance, so i was then left alone at the table. I felt lonely so I went to another friend’s table and his date. (His name shall be Dan) 
Dan was going trough the same thing but he was with his girlfriend and wasn’t ignored at all. His girlfriend went to go dance with my date and it was just me and Dan joking about how our dates were stolen. Then Dan went to go dance with his girlfriend so I was alone. Ash was dancing with her friends and I’m starting to realized that I was there for nothing. I really sad seeing everyone together. 

The homecoming dance ended and I didn’t see Ash at all. Ash went home and everyone else went to the after party. I went to Denny’s with a group of friends because I wasn’t in the feeling to go party. 

While we were at Denny’s I looked at Ash’s snap story and she posted a picture of one of her best friends (she’s a girl) and she captioned it “my new homecoming date” and that’s when I started to have an emotional breakdown. My friends were there to cheer me up but I had a bad night nonetheless. 

I guess it’s karma from what happened with Emmy. 

Throughout senior year, I don’t know what was wrong with me but I somehow still had the heart to forgive Ash. 

I still simped over her too..

Prom has arrived and guess who went haha. Ash and I had the same groups of friends but she ignored me still. In the end we still danced together because I asked and I guess she said yes out of pity. 

I’m trying to cut this story short now

After prom we hanged out at Denny’s, same group of friends but this time ash came along. 
When I was dropping Ash off I told her I got us tickets to a concert in summer. She said yes in a heartbeat because it was her favorite artist. 

I was a simp to a girl that friendzoned me in a way. I don’t know she never told me to back off or she’s not interested. 

I realized that ash wasn’t interested and she didn’t wanted to tell me she wasn’t so I just puzzled it together. And I just put all my simpy feelings away. Took some time and it was hard that I’ve done so much for nothing. 

The time for graduation was coming closer and emmy’s boyfriend broke up with her. 

A few weeks later we got close again and I developed feelings for her again. One day after school, I went up to her and told her that I had feelings for her and I really liked her. Emmy told me that she doesn’t know what to say and she’s probably not going to be in a relationship since she recently got into a breakup. And I understood that so I just let time pass. 
Emmy later on in about a week she posted on her story of some other guy in her dm’s calling her beautiful or whatever and she was in love with that guy. That hurt I’m not going to lie, I was also texting her but seeing that made me feel more of a clown and a simp. 

Summer passed, I went to the concert with Ash but only as friends and now Ash left to a different state for college. 

Emmy still didn’t have a boyfriend so I decided to give it another shot. 
I started seeing her and visiting her at her music class since I was cool with the teacher. I brought her food and just attention in general. One day after school I was walking her to where she was getting picked up, and I asked her if she was talking to anyone or is interested in anyone. She told me that she was going to focus on herself and she’s not interested in any relationships. 

A week later she got into a relationship with a completely different guy. and just wow okay then. 

I started to realize that I was the biggest idiot/clown ever. 

Now recently not long ago, her newer boyfriend broke up with her. And she moved on to a newerrr boyfriend which was one of her coworkers like 2 weeks later. 

Then for some reason Emmy and her coworker broke up. 

Now closer to the present. I went to go see her and a couple of friends at one of their competitions for cheerleading. Emmy was really, really close to me and hugging/holding me all the time and I hate to admit it but that made me feel loved and I developed some feelings for her again. I really hate myself because after typing all of that I just realized how much I’m doing and just hurting myself more. 

Now today in the present. I don’t know what to do. I got feelings for Emmy but from what happened to the past I just don’t want to risk it anymore and to get hurt again. She’s a senior now and I’m a freshman in college but I hate how I got feelings for her and I want to tell her but a lot happened. Any advice? And thank you a lot if you read all of this.",25Jan2020,1

First off y'all are going to have to forgive me for my grammar and/or spelling.\\

Im not a good story teller nor the smartest person in the world. im going to try and make a long story short. Ive been in love with this woman for 10 years give or take. My head is so far up my ass for this woman that its affected anyone else ive tryed to be with. Im by no means a child (28M). I have a great job. The kinda job that i dont have to look at my bank account when I buy something. Anyway me and this woman have been ""friends"" for 10 or so years. dated once when we was younger. But she prefers girls to guys. But thats no the point. She knows how i feel. She knows i love her. She knows I cant get over her. Ive tryed to see other girls. But I cant seem to have the same feelings for anyone else. Here lately She just moved back into the state. The first friend she moved in with kicked her out for not having a job yet nor a car. So i got her a car and let her move into one of my spare bed rooms all rent free until she can get back on her feet. Its not the money im bitching about. Its the sleepless nights with me in my head. Its the depression that keeps me awake. I feel like I need a good cry but I just cant seem to do it. This isnt a matter of lust or anything. Weve hooked up a number of times. I just truly believe shes my soul mate and ill do anything for her. I mean right as I type this I gave her my space heater because my house heater shit the bed and itll be tomorrow before i can get the relay to fix it. I cant even type this out without my head getting dizzy and my thoughts all over the place. I was raised in a very oil school was. Men dont cry. Men dont show emotions. Men suffer in silence. I just dont know how to handle these emotions. The only way i know how to handle it is to just sit here in silence and suffer. Im not going to kick her out. All this makes me feel is like im not good enough. I just dont understand it. I have a great job. no debt other than my cars. Im not a good awful looking guy. I can fix just about anything. I just dont know what to do other than suffer. Im in love with her but i dont think shes in love with me just ""loves me""",25Jan2020,1
371,"long story short, I had such a good bond with a certain someone, never had a bond as good as I did with them. at the end of our friendship, I gradually got feelings for her, told her and turns out she was talking to someone. she ended up dating that person and we just parted ways. it's only until now I've found out that it was actually me who left her. I want to send a message or something trying to rekindle the friendship, because I miss her. but I'm pretty sure she's also broken up with that person and I don't want it too seem like I'm just trying another attempt to get with her",25Jan2020,1
372,"This story originates a year ago, when I lived in Belarus, with dreams of coming to Poland to study. I was very interested in learning Polish, because I really liked it very much, so I often hung up in different applications for language exchange. There I met her, and let her be called Justyna.

And I met Justyna in a very interesting way. That day, I was with my family in Bialystok, where, as always, I watched who is in the area. There were not many people, but I added those whom I found, however I did not communicate with any of them.

After a couple of months, when I already returned home, to Belarus, some stranger wrote to me on Snapchat. It turned out that it was Justyna, and our conversation began to develop rapidly, and very easily. Already on the same day, we began to correspond almost non-stop. She was a very interesting conversationalist for me, and apparently I was for her.

Over time, we were getting closer and closer, and talked very openly. I remember how we corresponded at night, and ... then all I wanted was to get on a plane and fly to her as soon as possible, I really wanted to see her.

I knew that after \~ six months I would come to Poland and study and live there permanently, when suddenly, in the summer, a few months before this event, she seemed to begin to distance herself.

I don’t know what happened, but one day, she wrote to me: ""We're not that close anymore."" I did not understand what was happening, but we continued communication. However .. it was no longer the same as before. Everything was somehow strained and superficial.

We no longer corresponded non-stop as before, but after a couple of months, communication was reduced to a couple of messages per day.

Now I live in Poland, but still very far away (I am in the north, she is in the south). I really still have hope, because on the anniversary of our acquaintance, I wrote her a long message, with all those experiences, in response to which, she replied that she did not even suspect that she was so important to me. Then, during the week, we really talked the same way as once upon a time. Guys, you would only see me, I was the happiest person on earth. However, after a couple of weeks it faded again.

I still want to come to her, maybe it will light the fire again. But I do not know how to return to the former communication. I really value her, appreciate her, but I feel as though she doesn’t need me at all.

375,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Over the last few years, my intrusive thoughts have become extremely concerning. I hate the constant racing thoughts. I make a conscious effort to redirect my energy, but I wish I didn’t have to do that in the first place.

I live, work, and socialize in a very diverse environment. My boss is Middle Eastern and we provide our services to a very wide scope of people, and my friends are mostly LGBT. I have an incredible amount of respect for my boss and what I do, our customers don’t piss me off any more than yours do, and my friends are all good people. 

I can’t stop the racial and homophobic slurs that pop into my head when I’m in public or listening to the radio. Certain songs come one and my immediate though is, “Why are black women so obnoxious?” I’ll meet with my friends at a bar and see a trans woman and think, “They look ridiculous.” My inner monologue is disgusting.

My frustration is that I don’t actually have a problem with these people. I have so much respect for my boss, my closest friend is gay, and my ex-best friend is black (we simply grew apart after high school)- hell, I’m a lesbian. At work, I go above and beyond to help everyone, but the moment I start listening to the news I can’t help but to generalize an entire race/religion/sexuality based on one person’s actions. 

I’m disgusted with myself and I want the thoughts to stop. I don’t feel or act this way

I want to shut off that part of my brain, but I don’t know how. What should I do?",25Jan2020,1

378,"One of my high school friends is getting married and our circle from the time is meeting up in a few weeks to celebrate before the wedding. As no one is throwing this bride to be a bachelorette party, I somehow got it into my head that we're responsible for that.

Problem is not one of the other girls seems to. I'm trying to throw ideas left and right but not only are they all pretty much not responsive, non of them seem to be willing to spend any money.

I realize we've gotten distant since high school, I realize they have their lives. What I don't understand is how they are willing to spend 30 euro on a dress for the wedding but not give a cent to help with the bachelorettes before.

379,"So just to get that away at the beginning, english is my second language so please have mercy when there are mistakes in this text.

Yesterday at a party my friend (let’s call him M) asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I didn’t expect that at all so my answer was pretty dumb. I said that I’m sorry but I actually had a crush on somebody else, and thinking back I should have said something else because I felt like shit the whole night and thought about it over and over. The guy I have a crush on (let’s say H) has a girlfriend tho and she is my friend (not like a super close friend but we get along quite well), she doesn’t know that I like her boyfriend of course.
So I actually never thought about having a relationship with M and thinking about the situation all night made me not knowing if there could me more between us. I don’t know what to do, should I go on a date with M to see if it would be possible? I actually lost almost all my hope in a relationship with H because he is in one already. So I thought about maybe asking M if he would be still interested in me and going on a date with me. But if I realize after the date that I really don’t have any romantic feelings for M I would have to tell him again that I would prefer us just being friends and I would feel like absolute shit again.

I hope someone can help me because I really don’t know what to do and I think it would be good to hear different opinions on that.

380,"Myself (27M). This evening my roommate (28m) had someone new over, I was in my room when they came over, and when they were leaving, I was in the common area. This person did not introduce themselves and left okay whatever. After the person had left, I asked if it was one of my roommate's friend, I had briefly met, my roommate got super defensive. A few minutes later, I knocked on my roommate's door because I wanted to know who had come over. My roommate says that this friend does not want to be identified, merely giving me his first name and nothing else, which seems so strange to me. I have had four roommates in the last couple of years, and they have had multiple people over when I am around, not one of them has refused to be identified; it sketches me out, to be honest. Is this person a drug dealer, criminal? Who doesn't introduce themselves to people's whose home they come into and requires secrecy about their identity?  
I am also the landlord, so this doubly makes me uncomfortable from the social strangeness of the situation and secondly in wanting to make sure my place stays safe. Am I overreacting to this situation? I feel very uncomfortable with people coming into my home who refuse to introduce themselves or be identified. My roommate is a new tenant to complicate things further. It is not building my trust in them.

What should I do?",25Jan2020,1
381,"I've made it five months since my anxiety has flared up to the point where i had to resort to r/advice so cheers to that. As the title says I am unsure on what to do next. I do not know if I should transfer colleges to a new school or if i'm simply going through a rough patch. Fair warning it will probably end up as a fairly long account of all the details. This is partly because I want to be thorough but also because I feel typing it all out will be good for me to sort my own thoughts out. I will try to omit my own current bias but disclaimer I currently am sitting on a heap of anxiety that is pushing me in a certain direction. So I hope you will consider reading through all this, I know it's a lot, but I really need the advice.

I (19M) am a freshman in his second semester at a university in the U.S. capital of Washington D.C. I go to a private school. I am a business management major. I was born and and have always lived in New England. All of my family lives five hours from where I go to school now. With the school being private it has a fairly large tuition. I am lucky enough to have received generous grants and financial aid so that I only have to pay roughly half the tuition. After some family contribution, I have some sizable yet not necessarily unmanageable student loans. It's not the worst but not the greatest either in terms of price. 

I choose my school for several reasons. Up towards the top of the reasons is that I am a legacy student  here. I have several Aunts, Uncles, and even a grandparent who attended this university. While maybe this would seem like a positive because I could get more money off my tuition, that was not really my thinking. As a person who likes their decisions to be validated, having the school already be tried and true among my family was a big plus. I had (still have to an extent) a big fear of choosing the wrong school. That is why I liked the appeal of the family connection so much.  Another reason was because I love D.C. It truly is an amazing city and my personal favorite in all of America. The city is one of the biggest pluses the university had going for it and still has going for it today. Between those two and the money working out enough that is what really committed me to the school. I thought that no matter what i'd learn to love my school and in a way I have but I also feel that sometimes the shoe just doesn't fit. 

The business program at my school is fairly young having only really been developed in the past three years. It is decent and has many great connections. It will not turn heads like Harvard would but its decent enough. I am genuinely interested in business and while I've been taking many general classes I have found them fairly uninteresting and not challenging. It is not the worst although is ""decent enough"" really worth the price tag? 

The main problems I can't seem to shake are in my social life, as I'm sure many other people in my situation are the same about that. Going into school in August I only knew two people from high school. They both did not attend my high school as they are both girls and I went to an all male school. One is a close friend who I have known for a long time yet never really hung out with too much before. The other is my ex girlfriend. Before you drag me through the mud with the whole ""Never go to college with your high school girlfriend"" and all that, which I do probably deserve some of, I explored and select this university before she had any interest and subsequently picked it too. I admit that at the time I though it would all be good but of course it wasn't. We broke up the summer before coming to college. I mainly avoid her on campus.

As for my close friend from home, she has become my best friend and closest ally here. She is the person I go to with anything on my mind and who I usually try to hangout with. She is very close to her two roommates. Those three girls are the closest friends I have here. I know lots of people on campus but only a few are friends and even fewer are close enough friends who would actually hangout with me. A ton of the time it feels like the girls are my only friends. I'm super glad to have them but at the same time it's kind of sad. Coming from an all male school where the empathizes was always on brotherhood, my lack of guy friends kind of stings worse. I get along with my roommate quite well but we are also very different. He is not someone I find myself hanging out with outside of the dorm room. He plays a a lot of PlayStation and keeps to himself. I guess it's better than a horrible roommate who I hate but I wouldn't call us best buddies either.

After a couple weeks into first semester I tried to remedy my lack of guy friends by joining a sport. (I won't say which sport for privacy's sake.) I was hopeful for more new friends and to keep me healthy, The later proved more successful in the long run. I did make good friends quickly with the other guys on the team. We went out together and ate meals together. The fall season was busy but overall a very good time for me as the sport kept me busy, I had tons of teammate friends as well as my girls to keep me real, and my classes were going smooth. It was great until the fall season ended. When that left so did my invites to go out and eat meals with them. They all still are great friends but I was very much excluded and left behind. I am still on the team and still love the sport but now my relationships with my teammates are pretty much just limited to interactions in the gym or at practices. I do sometimes feel as though I missed my opportunity to make friends early in the year because I was too busy with my teammates. 

Most days if i'm not at classes or in the gym or at my part time (cause D.C. is a really fuckin expensive place to live) i'm in my room. I take almost all of my meals to go and just eat them in my dorm by myself. The activities on campus do not interest me at all nor do I  have motivation to try and get involved. While some people are introverted and this is normal behavior, I am certainly not. I am an extrovert who gains energy off of other people's energy. I thrive when i'm with others and I love enjoying time and laughs in groups of people. Here, however, I feel like i'm being forced to be something i'm not. 

The last important detail is my family. Of all the schools and potential universities I looked at after high school all of them were in a two hour radius at most of my home. That is all except one, the one that I choose here in Washington D.C. I am glad to be out of the house although I have always relied on my family for support. Last semester I could only go home for Thanksgiving and winter break. This semester because of my sport I won't be able to go home until the summer with the exception of maybe a random weekend. I love them a lot and not having them near has really thrown me off. I do not think it is homesickness as I've experienced that before. It is more just and uneasy feeling and an unsettling one inside me further solidifying my loneliness. 

So there you have it. I genuinely do not know what to do and my anxiety about the whole situation rises everyday. The thought of transferring is extremely scary and daunting to me but I also feel trapped here at my current school. If you read this far I thank you so much and humbly ask for what you think I should do.",25Jan2020,1
382,"I'm sorry if this is long and boring but it have been almost 4 years of brewing now.. 

I am in a friend group of 4 girls, we have a common interest and been travelling a lot together. We all live far apart so we don't see each other every week and one live in another country. Let's call her S. S is the youngest in our group. We all have some mental problems, but hers are more severe. She do have a form of autism and body dysphoria  and she reacts to small things around her. I am the more ""normal"" I only have panic attacks and depression, but we all suffer with some sort of mental thing. 
It started with small things, with S freaking out when travelling and we had to take care of her. It was okay at first, but got quite annoyed when I asked her if she was thirsty or hungry and she says no, 30 min later she would pass out or get sick because she didn't got something to drink or eat. It was hard for me, as we felt we had to force her to eat or drink, but I managed because it was only a small thing in a mass of positive things. 

Sadly I just felt it got worse and worse. I had my breaking point 2 years ago, we had been on a trip to Paris, she told us that she was nervous to have her medication in her luggage so she didn't bring it, so the weekend was a mess. It culminated in a line where we kept asking her if she needed a break and she kept saying no, and with me looking away for 2 min to turn around to have her passing out on the floor, I felt horrible because I felt like I had pushed her to pass out, even though she kept saying no to sitting down. I was crushed and felt judged by everyone around me. Was even told to take better care of her. 
I was feeling horrible and had to talk with the other girls about it. I didn't tell S about my thoughts as she normally freaked out and would cry and it wouldn't have helped me anyway, may have been a bad choice?

A few weeks later S was helping at an event, me and one of the other girls only attended sunday so she spent friday and Saturday alone at the event. She was telling us how hard and busy it was, but we couldn't help as she was a volunteer and we were attendees. She ends Sunday with passing out and we only realise she has passed out when we walk pass her on the floor, no one told us and needed to call an ambulance to get a check up. My other friend is in the ambulance, where S tells the workers that she feel some signs when she passes out (she tells us they came out of nowhere) I felt again super bad, I sat at the curb by the ambulance, as only one person was allowed in, crying and feeling bad because I had people consoling me, and I was feeling egotistical, I had massive panic attacks and tried to be normal after, to not upset S, was a toll on me. We had to leave her the day after to travel home by bus, she with plane, someone from the volunteer group that knew S promised to help her to the airport, and while we where in the bus we got told she had passed out at the gate and was banned to fly until the next day. I started to freak out in the bus and felt horrible and I have refused to travel with her since. She haven't been travelling either, I think she realised this was serious.
It took me a while, but I finally told her how I felt and it made her feel super horrible and I made her cry, and was told after she tried to kill herself. 
I am still not comfortable to travel with her, i don't even want to really be around her. I barely answer in the group chat we have as I feel so shitty but also tired of feeling like this.

So please help me with advice, should I just try to move on? Forget my feelings and try building a friendship up again, she seems to have moved on. Or again try talking to her? I am just afraid to make her more unstable, she have been messing with a horrible boyfriend that we tried to warn her about.

TA acct for obvious reasons. i highly, highly doubt it will happen, but stranger things have been known to: if you are reading this and realize we know each other, please do not reach out. not to me, not to my loved ones. thank you. 

i can’t really pinpoint where it started. my mom paints a picture of me as a happy child and i suppose i remember it that way for the most part, despite dealing with a bit more than what i suppose the “average” child deals with.  specifically, being born out of wedlock and spending a good chunk of my first decade being tugged back and forth between my poor mother who was so terrified of losing the only source of love she’d known in her life (me) that it was fucking her up even worse, and my father’s terrifying, every-new-jersey-stereotype-at-once family in an extremely vicious custody battle that ended not due to a victory by either party, but rather, a technicality: my father was found, naked, in a motel room in hoboken, with a needle in his arm. the needle had previously contained heroin, and he was no longer alive. two months later, the september 11th attacks happened, and between these two traumatic and emotionally draining incidents, my mother made the executive decision that once the school year was finished it was time to leave the new york metro area. she meant well, she always did, but it certainly wasn’t what i wanted, and it became one of the major contributing factors in what would eventually blossom into a profound case of clinical depression. 

i’m not gonna bore you guys with my whole life story. what i will say is, it most certainly has not always been easy, but it could also be worse. at the current moment, i am unemployed because i recently quit the job i had spent the last year at, because i felt it wasn’t the right path for me. i have a loving, handsome boyfriend, who i’ve been with for 3.5 years now and if all goes well will hopefully end up marrying. he is very supportive of my condition, and in general has a very good sense of providing for a family. i don’t know how he puts up with me and i do not feel like i deserve it. i’ve got this dog who looks at me with the most adoring eyes of any creature on earth, sleeps next to me in bed every night, and greets me at the door every time i come home; generally, no matter how overall depressed i am feeling at any given time, her presence makes it almost physically impossible to not perk up a little bit, if not moreso. most of our time together is spent with her snuggled up under a blanket with me. my mother is still alive, still supportive, and married my stepdad, a special education teacher who is also very supportive and wants to see me succeed in life. shockingly, although i have succeeded in alienating some once-close friends due to my rapidly escalating self-destructive tendencies, there are still a lot of people out there who care about me, who enjoy my company, who want to spend time with me. and perhaps the term “pipe dream” may be more accurate, but i do have hopes and goals that i would like to achieve. 

and yet: none of that “matters.” i wish there was a way to say it that didn’t sound so callously ungrateful. i WANT it to matter, desperately. i’ve felt this way for so long at this point that i don’t even know if i have ever not felt this way. 

it’s been 10 years since i’ve gotten as far into planning a suicide as even writing a note. i know i’m not an immediate risk. but ever since my birthday a few days ago, whenever it comes up in conversation, or it pops into my head and i remember that i turned 27, there’s just this voice that’s like, “this year’s the year, gotta make it happen.” 

so reddit: what do i do? how do i handle this? obviously i need to talk to someone. thankfully as of Jan 1 i now have medical coverage and will be finding someone to talk to, but i’m not quite sure of a) what kind of person (therapist, counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc) is the best to go talk to, and b) how exactly to explain this so i don’t get put on a 72 hour hold because they think i’m an immediate danger to myself (i’m really, really not).

386,"Two days ago, I went out at 6pm to get some groceries and pizza. I wore a backpack to put the groceries in so I could hold my pizza and get to my phone easily since I was skipping through songs while walking home.
I’m walking home probably by 7:20ish or something and I decided I’m going to take the faster route through like the less populated streets. When I realized a guy in his car was acting weird, I thought he was going to turning so he was creeping up the street and staring at me when I looked at him directly I realized he was staring at me. He then asks if I want a ride home, I say no and immediately regret wearing slides to go to get groceries and pizza, go around the back of his car and I speed up to try to get home. 
I drop my speed since I’m not athletic and saw that he drove off. But then I hear “get in the car” and “im just trying to give you a ride home,” and I’m like fuck I start running poorly in slides and I scream “no, please leave me alone.” like one does. He drives faster to catch up to me, I stop and take off my shoes (super smart idea huh) which prompts him to get out of his car towards me walking again bc I’m slow as shit and not trying to drop my pizza bc I have great priorities. I say fuck it hold the pizza against my chest and start hauling ass, somehow I had the actually smart idea turn up into a more populated street while screaming.  Leading me to tackle one of three high school boys who stopped probably bc they heard me. At that time I’m crying really hard &amp; not breathing correctly from running so fast and helped me up. I think seeing the boys made the guy drive up towards the school. 
I want to say although I had my phone in my hands, I don’t know why I didn’t think to call the police but I did call my sister twice &amp; literally the smart decision I had was to turn up into a more populated street and honestly at that moment I wasn’t thinking. I didn’t think or see anything. I just knew I had to run.
My friend brought up the fact that he might have done it because he thought I was a high school student (I’m 18) have since I was wearing the backpack &amp; the pizza place I came from is next to high school. So the route I’d be taking is one kids who got out of clubs late would be taking since I was originally on the main roads.
I’ve been thinking that I should probably go to the high school tomorrow and tell the high school that there’s some guy who might be trying to get girls into his car, even if I don’t know if this is a one time thing. It’s the same thing with the police report. But I don’t have much information, like I know he’s Hispanic as some of our exchange happened in Spanish. His hair was straight and a bit long, he had tan or brown skin. I can’t tell you anything about the car other than a possible shape and it’s older. I don’t know if I’d be able to pick the guy out of a line up. I was too afraid that my mind blanked out, I don’t even remember his license plate. Also from the moment I started running to the moment I bumped into the high school boys was probably 6-7 minutes and I don’t know if that’s enough time to make a big deal out of something like this.",25Jan2020,1
387,"My insecurities have lost control and I just can't think positively anymore. I even stayed home from school thursday and friday because I was so sad. I ordered some clothes and they are coming today, and I'm not looking forward to it at all because I'm sure they'll look bad anyway. Also my step mom and step brother who's 0,5 a year younger than me are moving in this year, and next year we will be moving to a completely different town, 12,5 km away. It's like a bunch of strangers or friends are moving in with us. It just doesn't feel right. I do like them, but I'm scared that if they live here I feel like I'm a guest in my own house. Like I'm having a sleepover in my own house. And I don't look forward to moving at all either. I have lived in this house for ten years.

My mom is working on getting me into therapy where I can go once a week.

390,"So I literally just found this out about 15 minutes ago. My step mum called me to tell me because he would get too upset to call me himself. 

What I need advice on his how to talk to him. My dad and I have a weird relationship. He was a massively controlling dickhead for most of my childhood and teenage years. While he always provided for me and sent me to a good school, he was emotionally manipulative. There was no custody agreement and mum always made sure he could see me and spend time with me. So if he wanted me to spend the night at his place then he'd usually just ask me. However it wasn't really asking, as I found out the hard way that saying no, for whatever reason (was sick, just plain old didn't feel like spending a night not at home, etc) would cause him to become moody and start insulting me, calling me ungrateful etc. So every time I was asked to stay at his place for the night it was always a yes. Because of this, we don't have the normal, best friend type of relationship I've seen my friends have with their dad's because I honestly still resent him and he's never once acknowledged that he was a dickhead during my childhood. (He's one of those people that is always right in an argument and will never say sorry). I'd honestly love to be best friends with him and I know he sees me as his best friend but I just can't do it. I can't take the plunge and throw all the resentment away. If he called and said hey I'm in town (we live in towns a few hours away) wanna go to the pub and get a drink. I'd say no and come up with an excuse why I can't. Because I just don't want to hang out with him. But I kinda do at the same time? If that makes sense. 

 I love him but I'm not the best at expressing my feelings towards either one of my parents. I only ever say ""I love you"" to them when they say it at the end of a phone call. I just tried calling him to talk and he didn't answer. I wanted to leave a voice message to let him know I love him and that I know he will pull through this. But I couldn't. And I just hung up without leaving a message. I can't even bring myself to text him to say it either. And this has nothing to do with the tumour either. I wouldn't ever do that to either mum or dad no matter what because that's just not me.

I guess it's a pretty long shot asking if anyone has a similar situation that they can draw on for advice but anything would help. I know he'll be expecting me to say all the right supportive things to him but I just don't know if I can so I need some advice on how to deal with that.

Thanks.",25Jan2020,1

I met a boy 2 months ago while traveling. We had two dates at the time, even had sex. We don’t live in the same country, but we kept talking for about a month until I came back (last time I was here he made me promise I would come back). Well I did. Four days ago we went out, had dinner, nice conversation. We came back to my place, stuff happened. Well, we were cuddling and he started asking about what I was looking for. I told him I wasn’t looking for anything, but I do like him a lot. He said he liked me back, but he couldn’t be in a relationship because he’s not mature enough and he’s not ready for one, had a heartbreak a few years ago and doesn’t want to feel that again, and it’s bad timing and if this happened in another time, he’d ask me to be his girlfriend. Not gonna lie, it broke my heart. Way more than I expected to. Apparently I was looking for something serious from him, and I haven’t realized until that point. He doesn’t strike me as liar, actually I consider him to be a pretty honest man. He says he still wants to hang out because he likes me a lot and likes spending time with me, but we can’t have sex anymore, because that’ll make us attached. 
I don’t know what to think. I’m meeting him again next week to talk about this again. 
I need a male perspective. Is there something I should do? Did he realized he likes me and got scared? Was I played?

407," Long story short, Japanese was compulsory at school and I ended up liking it and getting really good at it. Then uni Japanese was horrible and I quit. The thing is, despite my best efforts I’ve never really developed an interest in the culture/media (no I do not like anime, sorry), my only Japanese friend speaks fluent English and I don’t plan to ever live or work there. If I continue, it’ll probably just be for the sake of finishing off something I’ve spent thousands of hours of my life on, and because it bothers me that I just can’t use it like I used to be able to. It was a major part of my identity in high school, but not really something I actively chose. Looking back, the amount of time I spent on it (4-5 hours a day) was an avoidance strategy since I had some mental issues at the time. I’m thinking that maybe if I start doing it on my own terms I can get at least some joy out of it, but is it worth it if it’s never going to be really useful to me? 

The other option would be to start learning Chinese, which I’ve wanted to do for years but never had the discipline to maintain. 40% of my campus is Chinese-speaking so it’s about 100x more useful.

408,"I have dealt with severe depression for multiple years. This caused me to “drop out” of freshman year of high school because I could not get my self out of bed. I jumped through a few schools before I ended up at my current school, for my junior year.

I used to go to a high school with a pretty prestigious reputation, while only being a public school, they were very strong in academics and sports with very good funding.

The other schools I switched too, were quite the opposite. They were terrible schools, bad reputations, bad academics. I was embarrassed that I went to them.

So, when I went to my new school, people asked me what school I transferred from, my mind defaulted to the prestigious school with a good reputation. I told them I had been at that school for sophomore and freshman year before transferring, this is a lie. I was barely even there for half of freshman year. 

This lie kept having more lies added onto it as I kept trying to protect the one lie, and I dug myself into more and more of a hole. Now I want to try and get myself out.

I have created very close bonds with this group and even began a romantic relationship with one of them. I feel like it’s wrong to have not told them the truth yet, and I feel as if I need to. The guilt is killing me.

This past October I finally confessed to my Muslim parents I no longer believe in God. I was 16 at the time but am now 17. These past couple months have been hell. We fight and argue so frequently I decided to tell them I reverted back to Islam. I know it's a lie and lying is wrong but I felt as though if I wanted to keep a roof over my head it would be smarter and safer to keep them happy until I become financially stable enough to take care of myself. However its beginning to take a toll on my mental health.

I feel as though I am living a double life. I have not been wearing my hijab (headscarf) for almost 5 months without their knowledge (or so I thought). The constant gaslighting and degradation in my household is enough to make anyone sick, initially I dealt with it by rebelling (albeit privately it made me feel better). Lying has become second nature. A few days ago I overheard a conversation regarding me at a family gathering, detailing how they know **exactly** where I go and who I'm with at all times and how they thought I was stupid and naive if I genuinely thought I could outsmart them. The conversation went on to how they were planning to send me 'back' to our home country. A few weeks prior my mum had mentioned a holiday this upcoming summer and I have now come to the conclusion that this 'visit' back home would be disguised as a holiday to convince me to go only to be left there against my will.

I believe I am being followed and they are also keeping tabs on my social media. I feel as though I am becoming a very paranoid individual and I resent my family for not being normal. I envy my friends. I regret being honest with my parents and wish I'd kept my lack of faith a secret. I'm torn between running away or sucking it up and dealing with it. Either way, I feel less like myself everyday.

I know this doesn't have one easy, quick-fix answer but I'm feeling very unhappy and bitter. I do not like the person I'm becoming. I feel vindictive towards my family. Any pointers to deal with a toxic family that bring out the worst in you would be highly appreciated.

Started a new contract a few weeks ago (I work in an industry where we all do around 6 month contracts then move on to the next one so it won't be permanent).

Basically, had to get a job done in a hurry -  The project was already a day behind because my manager failed to mention a key requirement of the project but said that ""we had all explained this to you"", which was rubbish, so I was being extra careful to make sure I got all the details. He then got more and more irate with me, finally slamming his hands on the table, getting in my face and just repeating the same instruction to the effect of ""just get it done"".

I told him that he didn't need to keep repeating the same things at me because I am listening, I'm just trying to get all the information.

He then yelled at me saying ""You know what, I do have to keep repeating myself because your not fucking listening!""

Now I know that on paper this just looks like a bad day at the office but I really didn't know how to deal with it. The whole experience overwhelmed me. It made me feel like utter shit, I almost started hyperventilating, ended up having a small cry later and when I went to bed that evening. It made me question my whole life (I've worked really hard to have my dream job and now this is it?) and even considered chucking myself off the tall building next door (have had suicidal thoughts since I was a teen and am now in 30s, I've learnt to cope with them pretty well). I literally felt about 6 years old.  I couldn't even communicate with my wife about it when I got home for fear of breaking down in front of her.

It is inevitable that this kind of thing will happen again so:
a) How to I stick up for myself without escalating the situation? 
b) How do I prevent these feelings?

I've always tried to be a good person, do the right thing and be there for friends if they need me, I've tried my best to be the best version of me I could be.

I live in a rather large city with my own apparment and days go by just fine (*most of the time*). The day job is something I am not too shabby at and it pays the bills, though I don't see myself working this job for the next couple of years. My general goal in life has been to create something that will improve the world we live in by at least a tiny bit. So that once I inevitably leave this world it is in a bit of a better state than I found it in.  (*Really general, I know...*)

I planed to achieve this by either creating my own company or joining a start-up that shares similar beliefs. During my studies I told myself that I would have to wait until I am done so that I have a basis of qualification. Yet now that I have been done for half a year I haven't advanced a single step towards my overarching goal. During weekdays I feel too occupied by my job (*don't have much spare time*) and on weekends its hard to motivate myself to work on this. With the flipside being that relaxing isn't much easier since it makes me feel like I am wasting my time not thinking about ways to realize my own goals.

I've thought about changing industries to switch to one that is closer related to my hobbies in a way that my dayjob then might bring me more fullfillment and not make me feel aimless. Like a lot of people I've found gaming to be extrmely enjoyable and I've even dabbled my toes in video game development (which in times of unity etc. doesn't really mean much). From what I have read though it isn't an industry that directly welcomes newbies (*requiring 2-3 years experience a lot of the time*).

I guess what I am asking is wheather someone has experience in converting aimlessness into drive by figuring out what personal goals actually translate to. I don't really know what way to focus and what will bring me forward / what I should prioritise. Like rather getting into a new industry with the hope of achieving more fullfillment or reducing work hours to try and free time for more brainstorming on how to achieve life-time goals.

**TL;DR**: At the end of the day I guess I am not sure what exactly I want from life and would love tips / methods on how to find that out for myself.

Looking forward to any replies and want to wish you a happy weekend!

Kindest regards.",25Jan2020,1
420,"I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course.

Around two weeks ago I (f20) made a post about a guy (m21) I met whilst in my mother's hometown, I was staying with his family. I thought he was really great and wanted to hang out with him (he lives in my city, he was staying with his family) I asked for advice on what I should do, or how I should see if he wants to catch up.... And I did! He said he's really keen to hang out and then he asked me what I'd been up to since I got back, sounds stupid but it's a big victory for me! I never ask people to hang out because I am too anxious. I think we are getting a drink next week!!",25Jan2020,1

I guess we’re internet friends? We call and stuff and when he’s great, he’s great and he can be so sweet and we honestly vibe so well.

But I’m uncomfortable and all of this makes me feel like he doesn’t care abt me, he only really talks to me properly when he wants me to send something. but when we FaceTime he’s fine and we’ll talk abt random stuff. 

Should I block him? I know he has issues and that’ll really hurt him. But I know if I say no to him he won’t get it at all and get angry, I don’t want to. If I just straight up block him I know I’ll be hurt too, because like I said he isn’t all bad. But it’s just got to a breaking point. 

Last night I finally told him I have really bad anxiety and he asked me why and I said I’m just really bad with people and it’s really hard sometimes, he left me on read and that hurt, the next message he sent (today) was telling me he was horny lmao 

He also seems very manipulative and makes me feel bad about everything I do or say

It seems like he really only wants to talk to me to get stuff, what should I do? I really don’t know

I didn’t keep it short, oops
he might see this

Tl;dr: I think a guy i care about only talks to me for nudes, it makes me uncomfortable, as I’m underage and generally aren’t into that. I can’t say no or he’ll make me feel bad abt it but I care about him, what should I do??",25Jan2020,1
426,"Today I was scrolling through my dad's recent app purchases on my phone to look for an app I purchased on his account when I was a kid (felt like a nice nostalgia fix). I saw that he had downloaded multiple things such as Ashley Madison and various private messaging apps over the past few weeks.

After hours of contemplating, I think that the best thing for me to do is confront him considering that they are recent downloads, and the likelihood of him actually having done anything yet is slim. The problem is, I am second guessing whether this is the best course of action - I have read on other posts similar that this sort of issue is none of my business, and that it is best I stay out of it. If i were, however, to stay out of it, I feel like I would have immense guilt because if something did happen that was preventable, I would surely pin it on myself. Whereas if I confronted him and he was in fact going to cheat, I would potentially avoid a lot of heartbreak for my mother (who is going through a lot at the moment, and something like this would kill her).

So I am torn between the fact that it is none of my business, and the guilt I would feel if I said nothing.

I want to be able to rely on myself because I don't seem to do that much. Be that confident person I know I can be professorially and personally.

* Feeling that I have to always prove myself as a friend
* Feeling guilt that I might have out grown my friends
* Not being the family member that I wish to be
* Caring about things that I have no control over
* Letting problems interfere with my crafts as an artist
* Self-hate because I can't seem to stand up fro myself for things that I strongly disagree because I'm scared of losing that person as friend
* Wanting to branch out but feeling stuck
* Fear of being a bad friend because I'm Trying to be the best artist

434,"I'm 27, have a really good job that I've worked at for five years with a great boss. In the last semester of my masters and graduate in May. I got married last year and she's the best wife a guy could ask for. Decent but smaller friend group since college, engaging church on weekends and I'm in decent shape and enjoy outdoors stuff. My question is this, I feel like nothing ever really gets me super excited or that I never feel fulfilled as I picture it in my head. I'm not a sad person or a downer and I'm super happy with how my life is.... and yet I feel like I've never found my purpose... I'd like to become a manager in higher education or private sector IT and use my skills and knowledge I've acquired. I want to buy a house and have kids in the next five years. My wife and I have plans on trips to take. Yet I feel like I'm sleepwalking through life because nothing is as fulfilling or exciting as I think it should be. I'll occasionally buy stuff I don't need and then wonder why I did it (not too often). I'm a go-getter and want to be really good at everything I do and to everyone I know. One example is I'll buy books that look interesting and I love the topics, but I never feel like sitting down to enjoy them. A lot of this I realize sounds like depression and maybe to some extent it is, but it's more to me like I don't know what brought me here or what to do with my time... I have hobbies like reading, walking, podcasts on sports, business, leadership, and video games, I love to fish, etc... My wife and I also have a ton of the same interests so that's always been good too. I'd bet 9/10 people would say you've got everything going for you. 

Yet... here I am posting this haha. Does anybody have suggestions for how to fix what I'm feeling/thoughts? I've felt this way since the late teenage years. Thanks.

435,"ok so, I think this all started with my mum, I think she loves me but I also think there's a part of her that hates me, my father cheated on my mum while she was pregnant with me and got another woman pregnant 3 months into my mothers pregnancy, this lead to my mother moving to the other side of the country alone because in her smallish town everyone knew everyone somehow, and she told me it would've driven her crazy to stay there, so we move to the big city, eventually somehow we end up in one of the nicest lower class Burroughs in the city, through primary school we were apparently really close 'Best friends' or something but during my last year of primary school an incident happened were I could've lost my life, so we moved again to another very small town right outside of the this city.

here's where our relationship went left, as soon as I started trying to become independent, we were at each other's throats, constantly fighting, I was ""grounded"" for like years(e.g. no phone no internet ect), it got too the point where I thought ""she can't take anything else from me I might aswell do whatever I want"", so I would occasionally go to the parties, my gf gave me her old phone, and I dont know why she stuck with me because my mum literally made her out to be some devil, my mum is so confusing, the worst part about it was if I got bad grades if I was a minute late for my stupid curfew (school finshed at 3 pm I had to be home by 4 pm) doesn't matter if the bus is late, it got physical, let me just clarify I've never hit my mum and I never will, eventually she stopped ""beating"" me when I got tired of her shit and taller lol, id just parry or block or dodge or something, anyway I feel like ive gone one massive tangent now but, what I really want to know is.

just too clarify (not once has my mother apologized to me in her words, all of our problems have arisen from me not following her instructions, that's the type of person I'm dealing with)

im 21 at university right now and I cant stand to be around people, just because I'm always treated differently, I occationally meet up with aquintences, because I guess I feel the need too occatioanlly but, it doesn't matter where or who im with, im always the butt of the joke, im always getting picked on and for my sanity, I just think its best if I dont have to deal with anyone, I can honestly say my mental health has improved so much since cutting the few people I had in my life, but I still want those conncections, I want real realtionships with people, but everyone just seems so fickle litterally everyone, I dont understand what makes me so different from everyone else, all I really have to go off is my personality type is INTJ and thats rare or something, but I try too not read too much into things like that, more than anything I wish I had atleast two reliable trustworthy people but im always the 3rd if someone had to be sacrificed for what ever reason it would be me.

how do I deal with this? it just feels like I've been thrown around and taken the piss out of by everyone so much, yet a part of me still wants to connect with people, even though, the relationship will fall through, this makes me want to throw up as I'm typing it but I need to connect with people on a deeper level, but it seems like no one else does?

My thought is i should tell him to do it himself because i feel like he needs to be able to do these insignificant actions (which do not feel insignificant to him, i know) and i am not doing him a favor by always doing it for him. I have social anxiety as well and have been working on mine, i joined a really social student association from my university and it was HELL for more than a year but now i can look people in the eye when they talk to me/talk to them or say hi without nearly having a stroke. 

I know every person is different and the fact that i had some autonomy and was able to take the step of working on my anxiety by myself may show that mine isn't as sever as his but it still feels... wrong(?) to see him struggle so much with such things

438,"(Had this problem since around November time)

He has a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Graphics Card.

It was working fine until his Card got an update &amp; after the update the screen is now only filled about 75% with a thick black ridge of screen surrounding on all four sides the usable computer screen.

When it first did this &amp; I couldn't get any joy with trying to update it via GeForce Experience or even Device Manager I simply performed a System Restore a couple of days back. This worked, but he had to now avoid accepting any updates. Before games would boot up an update notification would pop up saying he would have to update and after he'd selected it a second time it did the same thing with the weird crop and not allowing games to be played. I then System Restored his PC once more and told him he has to deny those notifications now. However even though he heeded my advice the card automatically updated overnight one day and to make matters worse System Restore options had disappeared, so this was/is no longer an option I have to provide a quick fix to this problem.

So ever since then I've been trying to find solutions, including deleting &amp; reinstalling the Card, updating via GeForoce Experience &amp; Device Manager and even rebooting his whole PC. in Device Manager the Card is flagged with the Error Code ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"". However nothing that has been suggested from simply searching this Error Code has worked.

What makes this even more frustrating is that it is not a faulty monitor as when the PC boots up all the PCs loading pages are full screen, right up until it comes to the login page.

I’ve been married for a little over one year, we’ve been together for just over two. We got married right after our one year anniversary. I’m 22 and female, he’s 23 and male. I’m going to start this by saying I know I shouldn’t have gone through his phone. But, we both often use each other’s phones and know each other’s passwords. I was on his phone and he got a text from a woman we’ll call Ginger. They have been talking for a few days and have apparently met on an app to make new friends. Cool, okay, makes sense. Making friends as an adult is hard. I have had Bumble for trying to make friends (they have a friend option called Bumble BFF) so I have no issue with that. But on my account I made it explicitly clear I’m in a monogamous marriage and am strictly looking for friends. On this app he doesn’t mention me at all, and he has been talking to others (male and female) in a seemingly flirtatious way? In particular, this Ginger woman he’s been speaking to has said ‘oh by the way I have a boyfriend’ and he just said it was fine and hoped that her boyfriend didn’t mind if they talked. He didn’t even say’ it’s fine, I’m married anyway.’ Earlier in the conversation they talked about polyamory and adding another person to couples and whatnot and while my husband didn’t really say much on the topic, from what I could tell he wasn’t opposed to it either. In other conversations he’s been having that I glanced at with others, he mentions he’s bi, which I’m aware of. We both are. But he’s told multiple people in these conversations he’s mainly attracted to men and being with a woman is just easier. That really hurt my feelings if I’m honest. I also know he still talks to an ex of his but brushed it off when I asked about it months ago and said she’s a lesbian now apparently so it doesn’t matter if they talk. I’m just so very confused and I don’t know what to do moving forward. Do I try and forget? Because he really is the love of my life.

449,"
I have tried to reach out to them on this issue several times 9 months ago they just started to flat out ignore me. The suit involves defamation of character, intentional infliction of emotional distress and harassment.

The thing is if we just sat down tried to talk about this then we would be fine and could probably resolve it. But communication has broken down entirely, the guy opted to tell me "" enjoy living with yourself"" and cut off all communication when I tried to confront him about his behavior. He has opted for the silent treatment for 9 months. Now I'm nursing the wounds and am realizing there are legitimate financial, emotional and psychological damages for his behavior.

The dilemma is, when he's not being a douche, he can be a half decent dude and if he addressed the behavior and apologized, ideally I would have liked to remain friends with the guy. 
I'm worried that if I pursue civil charges that the relationship might be gone forever but then it already might be. But at the same time I feel deliberately disrespected he refuses to admit any wrongdoing or show any accountability for his behavior and it seems would rather opt not to be friends than to show any accountability and there are legitimate financial damages. Not quite sure what to do. ... has anybody had to sue a former friend or associate? How did it turn out?",25Jan2020,1

Hello

I’m dating a girl since six months, it is one of the most beautiful person I have ever met. 

It was love at first sight for both of us, excellent relationship, same view on life, excellent sex life. 

She is younger than me 25 vs 33. 

One days she told me she had a one night stand with a coworker. Somebody that I know but not a friend of mine. 

I told her that I don’t want to know her past since I apply the don’t ask don’t tell philosophy. 

She told me she wants to tell me about. So I listened. 

She told me they exchanged numbers, had a drink the next day and they went to her flat to have sex. She told me that she didn’t contact him again after that. 

I had the feeling that something was off with this story. 

And one day I snooped trough her phone ( I know bad behavior)

I found out that in fact she sent him a text the next morning to know if they will meet again. The guy didn’t answer for 2 days so she was upset and told him that if he didn’t want to continue with her he should have told her. The guy answered that they can meet again and she never gave answer. 

I also found out that she told her friends that she wants to see him again, that it is ok if tu si only for sex. 

We told about it and she told me that the guy was a trophy and that he was bad in bed, that the sex was bad, that he was a bastard and rough with her. He wanted to have sex without condom she denied. 

So if I look at her actions it is clear for me she is lying me. 

But how can I be sure. Lying is not a behavior that I accept in a LTR. 

And how to know the truth ?

Thanks",25Jan2020,1

462,"I have ordered something from asos.com and was supposed to be ""Delivered on or before"" 10th of January, needed it for an event on the 14th, but never got the items.  
Shipped from UK, to a country located in Europe (not in the EU), got free delivery because I've spent a certain amount of money. 

Asked for help at least 2 times, they told me to wait every time and to contact them on X date - which I did. All up until yesterday (24th/25th January) when they asked me if I want a refund (didn't ask for refund at any point prior, just asked for help, as they said they would ""chase it up"") or to get re-sent the items. Since there's a sale right now I figured I can order again for a lower price + I don't need most of the items since the event passed.

\- I asked what happens if the order arrives and said I would like a refund. Before answering my first question they said the refund has been requested.  
\- So I asked AGAIN what happens if the items arrive at some point, then they responded with ""You have to return them back or you can keep them (however this could effect you If similar incidents occur). "" - which would be great if they provided the free returns, which they don't!  
\- Then I asked ""But then I would have to pay for the return?"" they responded ""Yes you would If you choose to return it.""  
\- Then I asked can I reject the order so I don't have to pay for the shipping, as it's very expensive to ship from where I live (which is somewhere in Europe, but not UK) - to which they said that yes I can.  
\- Then asked ""if they deliver it without me being able to reject it"", ""can I pay for the items again insead?"" and they responded with ""If the still deliver it and no one is in you can keep it or return the parcel.""  
\-Asking, again, ""What do you mean I can keep it, can I pay for it again?"" and they said ""No , as the refund has already been put through. If the order gets delivered next week you can keep it (May effect your account ) or you can return it . It's completely up to you.""  
\- I thanked them and closed the chat.

My question is, what can I do if the order is delivered, what am I obligated to do, both morally or legally?

Very much stressed out by this, already had 3 panic attacks since the conversation with the customer service. They took and held my money, left me with no outfit for the occasion, wasted my time and if I don't want a penalty (not sure if legal or not) I am supposed to pay for the items to ship back to them? That means I get nothing from them except them holding my money for more than a month and I have to pay them for it? I asked if the refund can be canceled - waiting for the response.",25Jan2020,1

465,"So a bit of backstory.

So you see, starting from when I was a senior in high school all the way through my sophomore year of college, I'd be on skype calls with my relatively large group friends late into the night every day (back before discord was a thing). Pretty much every night I'd fall asleep in the middle of these calls, regardless of how loud everyone else on the call was.

Fast-foward towards the middle of this, the summer before my sophomore year of college, and all of a sudden my sleeping meds ""stopped"" working. For clarification, I have a number of mental health problems that either exacerbate my insomnia or cause it, I'm not sure which. I'd been on this medication for years, 0.1 milligrams of Clonodine, and up until that point it worked perfectly.

Well, I say don't work, but since then that medication and all the other sleep meds we've experimented with that don't work when I'm alone works perfectly when I'm with a group of people. It's like bam, I took it while I'm not by myself and now I'm suddenly on the verge of passing out! And it has to be more than just one other person usually. I'm pretty sure somehow through falling asleep on those calls with my friends consistently for so long I accidentally trained my brain or something, I can't think of any other explanation as to why the same medication that I take when I'm alone barely works, but when I'm around people knocks me out like I've taken a horse tranquilizer.

I'm 23 now, and obviously the problem isn't going away on its own at this point. Any advice or suggestions on how to go about fixing this would be greatly appreciated, I'm really tired of this",25Jan2020,1

470,"My mother started using antidepressants a year ago, the starting dosage was rather small. Not much different from the regular doses. I should probably mention that she is a certified gynecologist with an MBBS degree. Anyhow she got more and more dependant on the drugs as time went on until at one point she overdosed and was bed ridden for a couple of days. The symptoms were severe Oedema, lethargy, stupor and prolonged sleep. The final stages are coma and death. We realized she must be on something and my father being a surgeon himself figured out what she overdosed on. It was a medicine by the name of **Tramadol**, father threatened her with divorce just so she would stop taking these or at least tell us what her ""regular daily"" dosage was, so we could design a plan to help her taper them off. But she didn't tell us shit. The country I live in doesn't really have proper rehabilitation centers for such cases so we're on our own.
I asked her why she wouldn't tell him the actual dose? If you're ashamed or scared he might hurt you then just tell me, I promise I'll sort it out and he won't hurt you. Yet once again I did not get a response.

With the help of her brother we got her to admit that yes she was in fact addicted to the medication and needed help. We devised a plan to taper it off one tablet at a time. She initially claimed she only took one per day despite my father and her brother's disbelief since both are doctors and know well the amount of dose required to cause the symptoms seen in her.
Regardless she persisted and after 3 weeks of this ""plan"" she again bought a ton of the medicine and stashed it, father found out and is furious. I can't manage to calm him down every single fucking time when mother won't cooperate. I don't want my family to crumble, I have siblings too young to bear this shit. But she won't listen to me even after all this. We can't always monitor her due to her job, but we've tried almost everything that came to mind.
If any of you have advice to give, please take some time and type it out. I will forever be grateful.

475,"Throwaway 

Almost 17, am a transgender male 

Obviously none of this would be intentional but I was possibly referred to as slightly abusive and now I’m wondering if I am and how to just stop because that’s honestly not the person I want to be, I’ve wondered before but I always pushed that thought away and just tried to work on myself. I don’t want to be a bad person.




So here are some things making me wonder if I’m abusive:
-I’m really paranoid, like all the time about not being liked and stuff by my friends, this causes me to overstep boundaries but in the new year I’ve gotten a lot better at it, understanding that I don’t have to talk 24/7
-struggles with boundaries have included sending too many texts and stuff
-if I’m being totally honest with myself, I have been manipulative, saying stuff about having a bad day or feeling shitty about things 
-being angry or going off on people, but I recently stopped this in the new year I think
-being really unstable, I try not to be and have been improving on this but I definitely feel like everything has to be “perfect” to feel 100% ok
-sometimes I feel like I don’t know how to be content with my life and like I’m always trying to find problems. I mean consciously I want to be happy but unconsciously there’s always a problem and I don’t really know how to tolerate distress
-I was told by my friend that they (one person) were afraid of telling me things because of how I might react, I was appalled to hear this though and that’s why I started wanting to change in a big way
-said friend and I have had a lot of arguments and stuff and they’re honestly all my fault in one way or another

I do have a very strong history of self harm and probably 9(?) suicide attempts

Efforts I’ve made to work on myself 
-identifying things I need to work on
-using dbt skills, writing out a protocol for when I want act a certain way, I don’t always follow it but I am trying
-having a journal where I track my use of each skill at the end of the day and rate it
-constantly asking if my friend is comfortable with certain things 
-

Reasons I’ve had more trouble slipping up recently, not that it fully justifies it:
-have been extremely tired bc of illness
-friend who is also my crush getting into a relationship after I thought they were into me

Ways I’ve slipped up recently:
-Making a comment about my friend talking too much about their love life and then complaining about it (it isn’t actually that much I was just really in a bad mood)
-randomly told friend to shut up a few times and then started apologizing, again bc of relationship stuff

I think I may lose my friend because of this because he isn’t talking to me

**Background Information** -

(Information about me) - I'm a junior in high school. I'm interested in Worldbuilding, Psychology, and Philosophy. I run cross country and track, and I'm also a member of my school's prestigious show choir. I've been told time and time again that I'm incredibly intelligent, but I have a hard time focusing, am easily bored, and lack discipline (one of the powers I hope to acquire through stoicism). I'm an ENTP (if that helps), and I'm eithwr an enneagram 5 or 7.

(My History with My Girlfriend) - 
- We First Met Last Year in November. She's also a member of show choir, and we went with some mutual friends to see a movie together
- We hung out with that same group of friends a few more times, and in December, she had our mutual friend ask if I was interested in her. Now, I had already kinda assumed she had a crush on me, but I didn't really feel anything for her.  I didn't know that our mutual friend would show her the texts (he promised not to), but he did (I caught him showing her at lunch) and it really hurt her. 
- Later, after the group hung out a few more times, I started to consider dating her.
- Finally, I made my move, and we started dating. I didn't have very strong feelings for her at first, but I hadn't dated anyone yet, so I figured I could use the experience.
- After a month, I broke up with her. I just figured we weren't compatible, and there were girls out there better for me. However, after a few days, the pain, which I didn't expect to feel so much of, led me to get back with her.
- We talked and worked to better understand each other, and we eventually got back together officially two weeks later.
- We then dated for over two more months until she broke up with me on the first day of summer break. Now, I had honestly planned to break up with her sometime over the summer, but I didn't expect her to break up with me. It hadn't even occurred to me.
- That summer was the most painful period of my life. Everyday was a struggle, fighting my pain. Many of my hobbies became stale. Many of my friends were unable to hangout very often, and overall, life sucked. I did, however, grow due to delving into philosophy and working to develop empathy.
- My (now) ex, however, only struggled for about a week or two until she was living life. She was hanging out with friends all the time, and she looked amazing. Her skin cleared up, she got a new haircut, and she was rocking her new tan. 
- Once school finally started, I hoped that life would get better. Sadly, that wasn't the case. Day after day, life was still a struggle. The mornings tended to feel amazing, but after lunch, I wouldn't talk to anyone, and I was incredibly depressed. I definitely had more friends than ever before, and hung out frequently outside of school. Still, the pain remained.
- My ex, on the otherhand, seemed to be living her best life. She'd occasionally say something about wanting to just be friends again, and she always seemed so happy. She also became super popular. I would later find out that she was pretty depressed underneath all this.
- I should also add that I considered myself demisexual starting in September. Maybe, I am. Maybe, I'm not. But the label helped soothe the pain. I could only get off while thinking about my ex, and despite not being the most conventionally attractive girl, I always saw her as the hottest girl in the room.
- It surprised me when I got the text. It was october 21. She told me how much she missed me and how much it hurt to see me everyday. I, most likely pretty foolishly, decided to start talking to her.
- We talked for a little over a month before we began dating. I often tried to use weird methods or questions to try and help fix things, but she said I ended up seeming like a therapist rather than a lover. I always doubted that she really loved me. I believed that she thought she did, but I didn't think she'd really be there for me for that long.
- Finally, we started dating in late November. Since then, life has been pretty crazy.
- Month 1 - We started doing pretty sexual things for the first time. Everything but actual sex pretty much. We also enjoyed a lot of time with one another. I still had frequent doubts and thoughts about how this relationship is doomed to end and I should probably end it.
- Month 2 - Tomorrow will mark two months back together, and it will also mark the anniversary of when we really started first talking to one another. We've continued the sexual stuff (but not as much due to lack of time), and we've become even more comfortable around one another. I've met much of her family, and they all like me. She also has met much of mine.

**Essentially** - I've dated a girl on and off for about a year now, and I don't know what to do. I know it won't last, but this is just high school, and I'm scared of the pain and the risk of losing many of our mutual friends.

**My Current Thoughts** - We're going to breakup eventually, that's a fact. I don't see myself marrying this girl. Still, she's always on my mind, and she can kill or revive my mood with a single phrase. Should I stay with her for now? Should I try to slowly depend less on her for happiness? Should I enjoy time her during my teenage years? Should I wait until I feel ready? Will I ever feel ready? Or Should I breakup with her now? Risk losing friends and being forced into a whole new world of pain, but eventually rising from the torment, perhaps as a better person and a better stoic. Could forcing myself into the pain make me a better person in the long run?

I don't know what I want to hear or do. All I know, is I want to be more confident in an answer to my many questions.

I want to thank all of you so much for giving me your time! I appreciate any advice, even if it may hurt. As long as it's helpful and truthful, I'm grateful for it!

The only school that is accredited in my state is on the other side of the state and very expensive so going there is not an option. I just don’t know whether switching to an accredited computer science program would give me the proper training to then gateway into cybersecurity.  I plan on permanently moving after graduating. The state I plan on moving to has 5 school I could get an accredited cybersecurity degree from. My current plan would be to go and finish a computer science bachelors and then once I move states, go to an accredited school for cybersecurity there.

I was on a ""teens"" Instagram thread on /b/, so I posted nudes of some girls I found online (wasn't underaged) and on 4chan. Later, in 2 minutes, when I tried to post a reply, I got this message from my ban verification:

You have been permanently banned from all boards for the following reason: 

Posting, requesting, or advertising child pornography is strictly forbidden, and against the law.

Your ban was filed on January 25, 2020. This ban will not expire. 

According to our server, your IP is: -------------. The name you were posting with was Anonymous.

Please check back in 3 days when you may appeal your ban.

I'm really confused, because none of the girls were underaged (if they were, then they were clearly old enough to be mistaked for 18)... I even reverse searched all the images, and they were all found on surface websites such as Tumblr and Reddit, which are far more strict about CP (even mentioning it can get you banned there). Kind of worried, and i'm pretty sure what I posted wasn't CP.

So - what is my likelihood of getting an appeal? Also, should I expect the FBI to be breaking down my door at 5:00AM and having me locked up in a van and interrogated and tortured?",25Jan2020,1

I have a feeling I am the problem in this situation because it happens with different people (all of my friends), I am the only constant here. Nevertheless, I know I am able to cultivate beautiful, deep relationships, but apparently only with people I fall in love with.

494," About a month ago, before Christmas, I was suddenly banned from a private political discussion group on accounts that I've posted multiple screenshots on imgur of a user I've been disagreeing with. I wasn't contacted by any of the admins about my banning or my accusation. After 5 days I found out from a member that I have on my friends list that I was no longer a member and I was publicly accused of doxxing for some reason.

Their main reason is that the likes from comments correlated with my likes and that's why they made this connection. However, likes can easily be given or taken and Photoshop can do wonderful things sometimes. It's easy to replace a ""liked"" text with bold like as it was a screenshot from your account.

They've also linked me with another member of the group that they say I was trying to frame which I've never had a discussion with or commented on that person's posts.

I'll post the conversation that I've had with the member I'm friends with and hope you'll give me some helpful advice in this case since anyone can find me on Linkedin or contact my friends or employers on FB and tell them that I'm doxxing people without me having any defense in this.

i'm 26F, i work in a 90% male company, and not in my home country. I talk a lot with my co workers and i realized tonight that I can t really bond with them. They have lunch with me and talk with me, but eventually when they do something out of work they never invite me (they do invite maybe other girls). I have occasionaly organized something and a lot of people have come, but still i don t get invited by them.
I spoke about it with my bf, (works with us) ans he told me that no one hates me or anything, and maybe those things get organized when i am not there, so i miss the moment. But he also told me that I a different person around them, almost ""annoyed by them"". 

I thought about it and I try probably too much. I don t bully anyone, but i often make complains about the company and put myself in a very protective way.

I have to say, i never had a male friendship in my life, also because when i was in high school I was bullied by a lot of them. Later i could go out, and have them in my group of people, but i always felt i coudnt really bond with them.

My mom has said that she’s not gonna do anything for her anymore because why should she, and that just didn’t sit well with me at all. My mom went out and bought me mcdonald’s, as well as her friends daughter mcdonald’s, but not my sister and the more I think about it, the more I just wanna leave.

I don't have a girlfriend (i had one but i broke up with her for some personal reasons,this was in 2017). And I'm virgin, never even had my first kiss lol, dependent on my parents for my expenses, and due to this course I have only few friends left.

I don't even know if I want to do this course although i really worked hard and I'm 90% sure I'm clearing this time.  I want to travel and I'm having a deep interest in japan. My course is not even recognised in japan although i can work a finance job there with this qualification and some experience. 

I still have to put 3-4 years to complete this course and get my license of practice before i can start earning anything serious.

Wakeup at 10 am
Use reddit youtube Netflix
Eat food 
Sleep in afternoon
Wakeup at 6 pm
Goto gym till 8 pm
Dinner 
Again use phone and then sleep at 3 am


Today is 25 th January and my results will be out on 3rd Feb. I'm scared af tbh, my parents are having a lot of expectations from me this time.

498,"For the past 3 or so months, I have often tried to call and text my best friend, but am always left unanswered. We’ve been friends for around 6 years and she’s never been very good at responding. It sucks because we go to different schools and I never see her, but I don’t blame her, especially this year because i’m sure having ADHD and being a senior in high school is no simple task. After 2 months of trying to talk to her (nov-dec, asking how she was, how her christmas went etc.) she finally texted me back on January 2nd, she didn’t really formally apologize, but i didn’t expect her to as this was sort of a one off thing that hadn’t happened (to this degree) before. She posted on social media talking about how she’s been working on her college essay and that since it was finally done she’d be more active again. We chatted for a bit and i didn’t think anything of it. When i tried to talk to her the next day she went silent again. I tried again the day before my birthday just to see if i’d be able to get a hold of her, but to no avail. Yesterday was the 24th- four days after my birthday, so I called her but she didn’t answer so I texted her “you kinda suck rn” and left it at that. I know it was immature it just hurt to have her miss my birthday. I woke up today to see that she texted me at 2 AM saying that she’s sorry, and the way she’s been acting (“hermit mode” is what she called it) is more than kinda sucky... She told me it’s something she’ll be working on in therapy, and she’s going to try and make an effort to be a better friend and keep in touch. I don’t know how to respond cause I feel like i’ll want to instantly forgive her, as she is my best friend... obligatory i’m on mobile so sorry for any format/spelling issues.

So when we first started dating she had mentioned that she was a cam girl, but I didn’t think much of it, she was a single mom and needed money. I’m no saint myself so I never judged. But go forward a couple months and I found an old video her ex sent her before we started dating, of them having sex, it wasn’t that had bothered me as much as the fact of they where using a big ( I mean BIG) dildo.. I was petrified, mixed emotions.. I had gotten over that for the most part, until yesterday when I was looking for a phone charger in the back of her car. And opening a shoe box to find 4 dildos all very big and gerthy.. I’m averaged size guy, I’ve always done well in bed. But seeing those just destroyed my self esteem. I can’t imagine how I can compete or anything with those. And at the same time I’m kinda sicked out. I understand she’s had a kid but at the same time I feel disturbed.

I’ve talked to my family about changing my shifts but there isn’t really many options besides after school fridays for three hours. I want to work at least six hours every week because if I don’t I wouldn’t be making that much money. 

Not to mention, I didn’t think I was prepared for another job after I worked for my dad and had a panic attack. I told my family that but they all insisted I get a job for college and stuff. Sometimes when I try to vent to them they just remind me how many hours they worked when they were kids. Once I tried to talk to my sister and she just snapped at me. And I feel bad like it’s the same thing every week and Ik I’m getting on there nerves. I feel like I’ll be disappointing everyone if I quit. My dad says that he thinks I should but before now he has basically been saying the opposite.

I'm not actively trying to lose any weight. I do count calories and eat 1450-1500 calories everyday and allow myself to have 2000 once a week. I workout 3-4X a week (cardio, pilates bodyweight stuff). I've always been eating and working out this way and have never been losing weight THIS quickly.

Banana

Kiwi

Protein Bar

Oats with peanut butter powder or hemp protein with some honey and chia seeds

Everything resolved for the most part, although it was terribly strained and stressful anytime we would all be together. 

We saw my mom and her family for the holidays, but I haven’t spoken to my mother since the end of December. I reached out in December and every time we would talk I felt like I would be manipulated or made to feel guilty for my behavior.

Or she said I was using my child as a pawn when we didn’t see her for two months following the initial huge blow up).

I feel a lot of guilt for not reaching out, but also have been waiting for her to reach out.

528,"Never felt so betrayed in my whole life. 
Ok so this is kinda a long one but I promise it at least won't be boring. My best friend since 2008 has essentially chose his boy toy over me. That's not so much what has me messed up right now, it's the fact he lied to me and did exactly what he said he wouldn't. Ever since highschool he'd had a way of just shitting on his friendships for relationships, even so far as to tell me I couldn't fuck a girl because HE didn't like her and me and him being bros I respected that (bros before hoes and all). He's been in a situation where he was homeless and I convinced my mom who didn't like him pretty much the moment she met him, to let him live with us (no small task) for about 18months, I spent countless hours, literally his entire work schedule for at least two months, helping raise his puppy by sitting in his car with him while he was at work (the second time he ended up homeless but living out of his car) and that's not to mention all the other times did something I didn't feel comfortable with for the sake of our friendship. 


Recently I moved up here from the south to a major city and found myself homeless (that's a whole long story and to be honest it also starts with me thinking he'd pull through with what he said) and the situation has gotten to the point where I can either stay here and struggle yet be happy (life up here is hard but has so much potential) or go back home and help my grandma (who's dying of cancer). I don't have faith in my friend since his relationship, here's just a bit of the drama 


I'm not allowed to talk if he's on the phone with him ; and 100% of the time when we hang out he will spend at least 80% of that time on the phone with him and I'm not allowed to talk for hours just so they can do the stupid ""I love you more, awwwo, you're the cutie, bork, etc"" bs 


He's mom OD'd and is trying to guilt trip my friend into moving in with them 


The person he was living with before she snapped and pulled a knife on him, has been calling his bf mom and trying to start more drama 


The day he went to meet them (they met online from a furry site) he dropped me off at a Starbucks and said ""I'll be back in like three hours"" and just straight up didn't come back until the next day. Mind you this was after we just took a 22hr trip to NYC to get the car, slept outside overnight because of bank issues, and I had cold and he just figured it would be ok for me to sleep outside again with a cold because was ""too drunk"" to drive because he wanted to be drunk for their first fuck / meet 


He's ditched me at one of his friends house who we were meant to hang out with, for 8hrs, because he just ""had"" to take that phone call... For EIGHT GOD DAMN HOURS 


And recently like I said he ditched me after we made plans to not have me be homeless (we had to go to storage and to finish converting the jeep so we could both sleep in it) didn't call me, text, discord, or even REPLY to anything I sent him for THREE DAYS, forcing me to sleep out in the snow, if I didn't get paid / also borrow money from my brother Id STILL be sleeping outside in the snow three days later. When he FINALLY decided it was worth replying to me, he goes ""I'm not ghosting you"". Excuse me what?! We make plans to NOT have me sleep in the snow, you blow those off, drive SIX HOURS to see your bf, make stupid Twitter videos of you howling like a bunch of jackasses at 1am, then two days after that you reply to wed text on a sat yet that's not ghosting!? 
I've told him multiple times he's gotta stop treating me this way or we won't be friends and this time I put my foot down about it and he goes ""good luck"" and that's that. 
Good luck. 12yrs and all I get is a ""good luck"" after all the shit we've been through, all the legal issues, road trips, deaths, etc all I get is ""good luck"". 


I've never been this hurt before, not when 6 of my ""friends"" stabbed men in the back to ruin my last relationship out of selfish spite, not after the sexual assaults I've been through, not even losing a friend to heroine, has hurt as much as that ""good luck"". I legitimately want to an hero but the only thing keeping from offing myself is spite but damn if it ain't looking like an attractive option right now, homeless despite work, grandma dying of cancer, and my best friend throw me away like nothing more than used trash. 


I should note that I've been walking him through his relationships, his last one was super toxic and it drained me just maintain, this one is worse because he wrapped around his bf finger because his bf is 17 and he's 28 so he would probably kill me if he had to just to keep that part a secret because he's constantly freaked out he's going to get a ""have a seat"" despite his bf parents both being ok with it. 


I don't know if I should stick here, struggle but actually have a life worth living (this city 100% shits on my last one and I wouldn't want to move back to the south for good) or do I give up, go back home, help my family, and give up on my own happiness (there is no happiness in the south)


Tl; dr: My best friend since 2008 who I've bent over backwards for and moved to a new city with has ghosted me multiple times in very serious ways putting my physical health at risk at least twice, lying to me, and then basically saying ""Good luck"" as last text after ghosting me for three days (causing me to have to sleep outside in the snow). I can either struggle to be happy where I am or be nothing where my family is from.",25Jan2020,1

As of a week ago I told her that I no longer could comply and that she needed to compromise. She basically told me that if I loved her it shouldn't be a problem.  She got pissed and stormed out back to her house taking all her stuff. She then calls a couple days later and said she set up a counseling session of which I agreed to let someone tell me I was being unreasonable.  Well I didn't make it that far and broke up with her on the phone. 
She told me I ruined her life and bamboozled her, and was a bad boyfriend she also wants me to sign over a 5 day cruise in March to her cause her 84 year old father is going. I paid $1800 for this..should I give it or not.

He works 5 days a week for about 10 hours each day and my mum also works on average 5 days a week 10 hours a day. My mum will come home from work and still do housework, cooking, cleaning whereas my dad will not do anything but he acts like he does absolutely everything for the household and berates my mum if she doesn't do enough. 

Today was the tipping point for me because me and my mum went to a university application day before we left we left a couple dishes. As we came back he was very aggressive and angry towards my mum over the fact that he had to come home and do a couple dishes. He also complained about the amount of washing there was to do even though he didn't do any of the washing. My parents argued and my step dad caused my mum to break down and cry. It feels as though anything we do for him is never enough and he does not even try to help out.

538,"hi all! thank you for taking the time to read this. i am open to all advice! please dont be shy! 

my boyfriend and i just moved into our first apartment on wednesday, we have a deaf, 3 year old boxer. he is super friendly and sweet with all people and dogs. when we had moved in, the lease manager made it very clear that there was no breed/weight restriction (which is great for us as our dog is close to 80lbs lol) but they need to be people and dog friendly so that nobody in the building is at risk for harm and that she also needs to meet the dog personally prior to moving in. We really appreciated that as our boxer is a rescue and has been attacked before, so we wanted to make sure this would be a good environment for him. 

this morning i went to walk him and as i walked outside, there was another woman with her dog roughly about the same size as mine. my dog immediately growled at him which is not like him at all. i apologized to the other lady and said that it was unlike him and he is probably upset im making him go out in the rain, she said it was fine and that she understood. My dog quickly did his business and we went back into the building to go back to our apartment. well this woman was still in the hallway where the elevator is holding a bunch of plates, bowls &amp; other items. I hit the button to call the elevator, i noticed her and had apologized again about my dogs behavior. she then said that she was sorry because her dog is not dog friendly. Immediately after that her dog began to dart towards mine and growl. luckily, they were both leashed and the elevator opened just in time i said its okay, and quickly got on. I could tell my dog was shaken up a little because he was shaking and immediately sat inbetween my
legs. i pet him a lot to calm him and down and was fine by the time we reached our floor. 

i mentioned this to my boyfriend when i got back into our apartment and he believes we should tell the lease manager as she might be in violation of the buildings rules. however, i am conflicted. i don’t want to purposely evict someone or make them give up their dog, but its not really safe for then other dogs who are living in this complex either. 

am i being overly dramatic? should i tell the lease manager? are there any other options/suggestions from someone who has been in a similar situation? please help!

The other day knowing he is in the dumps I sent him about 7 text most on different topics. This was throughout the day as he is now awake nights and sleeps during the day. These were an attempt to try and get him out of the house or talk about something to get his mind off things. Later he texted me saying he was going to block me cause he has stuff he needs to figure out and just doesn't want to talk. Insuring me that it isn't my fault and it is 100% him.

When I got home I went straight to bed, but my mind kept racing about the work day, obligations and life problems. I tried my best to fall asleep and I ended up just laying in bed tossing and turning not being able to. I tried meditating but as soon as I let my mind wander I couldn’t help myself from thinking about my stresses. Around 6am I felt like garbage and I just began to feel myself drift away, but knowing I had work so soon meant I couldn’t fall asleep. I called out in the most appropriate way, sending a email then calling my work. I feel guilty because insomnia does not feel like a good reason to call out, but I have a 35 minute commute so I was worried about falling asleep behind the wheel, especially after work.

He said during that interview that he would switch me to part time, and that it wouldnt be a problem. So recently since ive started school, he said he wouldnt be able to switch me as it wouldnt work out with any openings he has, and so i prepared and submitted a resignation letter as my school is my priority at this time. He begged me to stay, and even said he was making a custom position just for me to apply to because “im such an assett to the company”. So now comes today and i happened to see him and he said sorry but anyone can apply to the position and that an employee with more seniority over me will get the spot if they apply.

570,"This is in California. 

TL;DR: Our neighbors may be housing homeless people in their yard, and illegally growing/selling marijuana. They throw loud parties, do personal construction, play music, and scream that they're going to kill each-other until midnight and sometimes beyond. For the first time in 5 years, we politely asked them at around 11pm to not do loud construction, as it's getting late, and the response they gave was to put a pile of dog shit on our porch over night. (We don't have a dog, as you may have guessed.) 

We called the Police, but asked if we could report this anonymously as we're scared, and we were told they can't do anything if we don't give our names. So we're wondering if there is anything we can do with the information we have? Is there a department we can call about the illegally built structures in their yard that people are living in? I think there are people living in trailers, that I really doubt they have a permit for? I know people have called the cops on them for noise complaints in the past. We're just worried, these people don't seem reasonable. Is it even possible to report something anonymously anymore?

Before someone suggests that we're shitty neighbors; we're all physically disabled shut-ins that spend upwards of 14+ hours a day on our computers with headphones. The most noise we make is walking over gravel to our cars.",25Jan2020,1

579,"I am a highschool student who started experimenting with LSD and Shrooms maybe 5 months ago or so. I have only taken Shrooms once, and LSD 5 times I think. I have been trying higher doses every time I tried LSD, starting with 175 micro grams, and increasing by 175 every single time. 

Yesterday afternoon after school got out, I took 700 micrograms of LSD, which was my highest dose ever. I was with friends the whole time, and was generally fine until we got in a car to go find a place to have dinner. I was the only one under the influence, and I sat silently in the back seat. If anyone has taken LSD before, you know that you can pretty easily get lost in your thoughts if you are doing nothing / not talking to anyone. My very high dose of LSD I guess made this worse, and when we were driving apparently I randomly jumped out and went up to people and started talking to them, then ran off. 

I only remember parts of what happened, but I do remember legitimately believing that whatever I thought would happen in real life, so I attempted to literally walk through walls or get into houses. I walked into a store and spoke jibberish to everyone in the store, and they all looked very concerned but I just ran out soon after as I was legitimately on autopilot, I couldn't stop myself or anything. My friend called me and told me that I was saying that I killed someone and that I was an orc or something insane like that, and I vaguely remember trying to live out different lives in my head or something like that, I am not quite sure and it is hard to explain as I don't remember much. I vaguely remember walking around the busy street trying to get into moving cars, and standing in front of cars and blocking traffic on a VERY busy, fast road, where I could have easily died. I lost all sense of normalcy or reason and just went bat shit insane. I also went into people's property (like backyards) and was banging on walls and screaming randomly, while talking jibberish the whole time. 

I was found by police later that evening and they sorrounded me and looked very concerned. I somehow ended up on the ground with my arm above my head and an officer sitting on top of me, and I was loaded onto the back of an ambulance with my whole body restrained. At this point, I was still on ""autopilot"" and screamed and wrenched for the whole ride to try and get out. I was taken to a hospital. When I sat in the hospital for a few minutes, i started to regain my senses and I guess there was a point when I started acting somewhat normal again, as I was able to talk to a doctor and ask to be unrestrained, which he did once I was able to actually speak English instead of jibberish or whatever I was saying before. 

I have not spoken to my dad since he picked me up from the hospital, and we drove home in silence and I went straight to bed. I feel deeply unsettled by the situation and extremely emberrased. I legitimately could not control myself or what I was doing at all, and I walked through the downtown area next to my highschool on a busy Friday and I do not know what I did or where I went, I have no memory. I cost my parents thousands of dollars because of the ambulance and hospital bills, and also disobeyed my parents by continually taking Schedule 1 drugs. 

 I am sitting in my room and I can hear him out there. I have cried many times and feel so terrible and sorry about the whole situation. Every other time I've taken these drugs it has been perfectly fine and I have been 100% in control of my actions. I don't understand how a 25% increase in dosage from my last experience with the drug caused me to go from being in full control to literally having zero control and going insane. 

I want to make it up to my dad, and know that I will be punished severely for this. I do not know how severely as my parents have never caught me for taking any type of drug or anything before, and I have never had any previous experience with cops / really breaking any rules in general. I just enjoyed recreationally taking LSD with my friends and I tried to do it as safely as I could by slowly Incrementally upping my dosage to experience stronger LSD trips and making sure I was with friends the whole time. 

How do I approach this situation? How do I talk to him? I did not intend for any of this to happen at all in the least bit and I don't really even know what I did. I do not think I will tell him every part of the story as it already happened and it may just make things worse, but I do need to tell him about my psychosis. I intend to work to pay for any money I caused them to pay, but what else is there for me to do / say if anything? Thank you. I understand this is my fault and I made poor decisions, and the state I was in has pretty much terrified me enough that I don't think I will ever use LSD again.",25Jan2020,1

I need something to do and some extra money is always nice, so I’ve been thinking about getting a second job, do you guys have any suggestions?

The parking lot has been essentially my only job, I worked as a dishwasher for a little while at the same restaurant, but I’m terrible at that sort of thing TBH and got moved over to the parking lot fairly early on. I briefly tried another restaurant for a day since my Dad wanted me too, but I just couldn’t keep up. Different responsibilities at that restaurant but the principles were about the same. That kind of industry is definitely too fast paced for me, and I greatly prefer having the fixed time to leave (though if needed I’m fine with staying a bit after). But I didn’t mind being a buser when I’ve been asked to help with that a couple times, and I think I did a fine job with it. Still, would rather work in a different area.

I like talking to and helping people in the parking lot. Also not standing for hours on end is nice, but I’m sure I can get used to it over time if needed.

Is there any jobs that’d allow me to work 4 hourish shifts for a few days in a week, or am I asking too much without the experience needed? Or just any industry suggestions to look into would be great! Or just something else productive to use all this time for?",25Jan2020,1

596,"TL;DR at the end

Hello, so I'm not sure where I should ask this so I'm going to go ahead and ask it here. My friend last night was extremely drunk (finished a handle last night with 2 other people while drinking the majority of it.) and was smoking as well. She and I are close friends and she's my best friend and it was the first time I had ever seen her like this and when I asked my other friends about her last night, they said they had never seen her this fucked up before and it really worried me. She was saying a couple of things I never knew before or things I had suspicions on but never fully knew the whole depth of it and it just worried me because I don't want her to fuck up her life or get addicted to anything.

Anyway, we were all having a little kickback and a friend's house last night and she and two other people were the only drunk people last night. I asked how they would get a ride home and they said they had one but the person they were getting a ride from was someone who had a terrible reputation. He's known to have fucked 40 people, have a list of people he wants to go after, and almost practically raped someone before (this was over a year ago though). I was not okay with this but I also wasn't comfortable pushing her to get a ride with me because I offered and she said she had one already. I talked to 3 other of my friends last night and they 100% agreed with me which was extremely reassuring. 

We ended up convincing 2 of them to get a ride with me back to their house which led to my friend having to get a ride with me. My friend is friends with this really sketch person and I'm just not sure how I should voice my concerns because I already have before. I was told that I shouldn't bring it up unless she brings it up, but she says nothing will ever happen between her and the guy but I just don't see it because I know he's trying to get with her and the things I've heard from this dude are crazy and disgusting. I'm just really glad that the people I talked to last night and everyone agreed with me and said It was good that I was concerned and doing this for my friend. I'm just seeing her later today and not sure how I should talk to her about it if it ever comes up. I definitely want to let her know to be careful more with the drinking and smoking and I want to let her know I'm here and to be more careful overall but I don't think she'll react well to it because of past experience.

I just thought I would ask for some advice on how to deal with this better next time or how to let her know I care and everything because I want her to realize it. If this isn't the right place to ask, then please direct me to a better subreddit :).

**TL;DR: I saw a friend get hammered last night and smoke and it was the first time. She's a friend with an extremely shady guy and a tool who offered to take her home, but I did instead. How do I deal with this better in the future or let her know my concerns without sounding weird? It kind of hurt that she did not talk to me about a ride in the first place when she knew I would be there.**",25Jan2020,1

Changed school and friend circles. My then Girlfriend left me for unexplained reasons for another guy.

•Later situation: I was bedridden for almost 7 months and after several physiotherapy sessions i started walking with a limp. Had occasional back aches. I used to be really confident and extrovert. Due to the visible limp i was asked in public by many what happened and out of embarrassment i lied every time. Slowly and surely i avoided all possible interactions and even if i started talking to someone i feared they would eventually ask me what happened. Mostly i stayed at home . More embarrassing was when people who KNEW what REALLY happened asked me WHY i did what i did. These questions hit me like bullets. In every family gatherings i used try my best to walk smartly across the room and sit somewhere till everyone left. I despised all the ""friends"" i had in my earlier school as none of them came to even see me once in the hospital which was a stone's throw from the school. In my new school i avoided all sorts of close friendships. All were mere acquaintances for me. I never really trusted anyone much thereafter.

A) i am in college rn away from home and have SERIOUS confidence issues. Whenever i face a mildly challenging conversation or conflict even with a classmate, i feel he/she is dominating me somehow. I feel myself going into a protective shield in myself where i hear people talk shit to my face (playfully) but i kinda talk back to them in my mind staring blankly at them at that moment.
B) i feel like i have to please everyone around me and even the slightest indication of disappointment in someone that COULD have been caused by me kinda tears me apart and i constantly think how to make things right even when they are perfectly fine.
C) People's opinions matter a lot to me even when they should not. I know they shouldnt but still i cant get over the feeling of getting everyone's approval.
D) i cant say NO to anyone's face even when i want with all my heart, to say so.
E) Browse thru reddit and instagram for ""motivational"" shit, but all is in vain. I can't seem to regain my confidence.
F) I do and say things mostly emotionally.

It's to the point where she is on camera with her 4 year old daughter talking about me as if I am some sort of mythical creature that is going to save them from their situation. What should I say this woman? I have ignored her for years and I feel somewhat responsible for not speaking up sooner. She has not directly visited me or anything either. Just YouTube and Facebook live videos. Occasion messages.

607,"Most online ""guides"" are just teaching you how to overcome the fear of public speaking, but I have no problems speaking out loud in front of a big group of people. But I have the problem of saying jokes :(

 I think I can be a pretty funny guy when I'm alone with my close friends without much effort but when I'm in a new group of people or a large group, my brain automatically goes like this: Oh shit I need to be funny in order for them to like me. And as a result, the jokes that come are either pretty weak (in my mind I can tell) and those that I think is funny, would often come out weak because of the lack of confidence put into executing them. It's been troubling me the whole of my life, is there a way to solve this?",25Jan2020,1

609,"in August last year I started talking to someone I met on a dating site. He messaged first and the talking moved to text as I didn’t like the format on the site. As we were getting to know each other I realised I wasn’t interested in forming a relationship with this person so I let them know in the kindest way I could. He didn’t take this well and threatened to hurt himself if I didn’t give him a chance. Initially I said ok just to get him to calm down because I was scared. A few days later he messaged again pleading for another chance, I said no, he threatened to kill himself. Said he was going to a location and I had 5 minutes to give him a decision (I.e date him or not) and if I said no he would jump or run into traffic. He said he’d call me and if I missed the call he would die and it would all be my fault. I ignored these messages. I then got a text from his phone, he pretended he was a police officer saying “__ has been hit by a car do you know this person” (come on, the police don’t text) I have trauma with the police and he knows this. The next day he tried to apologise again, I made it clear this was not ok and I was not going to speak to him anymore. He then said he’d find out where I lived and drive around my town/wait outside my house until I spoke to him. I blocked all contact, searched his name on every social media and blocked it. Well he attempted contact again. He wants another chance, thinks he deserves an explanation of why I won’t talk to him. I don’t know how to make it clear that I don’t want to know him? but ignoring him doesn’t seem to work and neither does being firm.  It’s getting to a point where I’m concerned for my safety 

TL;DR Man from dating site didn’t handle rejection well, threatened me and now wants to talk again",25Jan2020,1

612,"a little history about us first: we’ve been friends since the beginning of 2016 and this year i’m 17 (female) and he’s 18 (male). we’ve been through so much together, but in late 2018 we had beef but reconciled in march 2019. it was his fault and he didn’t do much to seek forgiveness. there was even this one time he told me he was gonna meet me outside my school after it was over at 2 but i waited for half an hour and texted him asking why he wasn’t there. he didn’t reply till 5. i gave in and forgave him after a few months. then we were really close again until we had another fight in may. this time it was on me and i was literally blocked on 7 apps. (copyrighting that phrase, might put it on a t shirt one day) eventually, he forgave me after 4 months. we were finally happy. i could definitely go into more detail, because the entire ordeal was absolutely hilarious, but i shan’t here.

he claims that i’m his best friend... but i don’t feel like he cares all that much. we don’t go to the same school, so obviously we have different groups of friends. i’m gonna call him neil from here on. neil also has this group of cosplay gamer friends who i have nothing in common with. he talks to them everyday. as in, not a single day goes by without them talking to each other. whereas he never talks to me anymore, claiming that he’s too busy with school. he also never asks to hang out. yet, i see him with his cosplay group pretty much almost every weekend. it hurts a lot, but i don’t really want to sound clingy and silly if i ask him why we don’t talk anymore. i’ve done so quite a few times in the past and it only ever pissed him off. 

i feel pushed aside and neglected. i do understand how hectic his schedule is, i really do. however, neil always seems to be having the time of his life with them, which is VERY OFTEN. i can count the number of times i hung out with him in real life last year with one hand. we live on opposite ends of the island, but singapore isn’t exactly big. a 40 minute train ride separates us, as well as his “hectic schedule.”. 

it’s only going to get worse. i finished secondary school last november and i’m free till april, when my new school starts. that’s when our schedules would be really conflicting... 

neil tells me he loves me, but doesn’t do anything to justify it lol. most of my friends absolutely loathe him with every fibre of their beings, because of what he did in november 2018, and because he became an increasingly shitty friend over time. i do agree, but neil is kinda dumb, to be honest. he doesn’t get social cues sometimes. he actually didn’t get me a birthday present last year because he “didn’t know what to get”. likewise, he claims he doesn’t ask to hang because he “doesn’t know where to go”. 

i don’t want to nag at him anymore, lest it ruin our friendship again. but then again, is it even much of a friendship? i’m at a loss at what to do. even as i type this out he’s hanging with that cosplay group i think. i don’t have anything against them obviously. i just want him to text me once in a while, honestly. the bar isn’t that high. if i’m being brutally honest i actually have more friends than him (ouch i’m sorry neil) but cmon man. best friends or fiends? :(",25Jan2020,1

617,"And it's really frustrating. The reason I don't ask my questions is because I am afraid of being disappointed. But in doing so I always disappoint myself.

It will start with something I am wondering about, but will be to afraid to ask a straight up answer from the person I have a question for. 

Followed up by asking generic questions to try and figure out their thoughts, which doesn't work ofcourse. 

After that I will get slightly frustrated and push more questions because I'm not getting an answer for the thing I don't want to ask straight up front... If I still won't hear an answer to this question I'll get panicked. Then if I don't get a response fast enough I'll get passive aggressive and destructive (emotionally).

It's annoying as hell to all parties involved and just plain dumb. I know this, and I am trying to improve myself. Today I had a situation again, that could have been avoided easily by just asking the friggin question. But no - I had to sit on it for 3 days till I almost got to the point of being panicked. This is when I realized what I was doing and gave a call to the person in question explaining that I was being dumb and wanted to prevent previous situations so I FINALLY asked my question. Doing this avoided my upcoming temper tantrum the day moved on and everything is fine. And it would have been even better if I would have just asked my question in the first place.

This is my biggest flaw, and I want it to stop. What happened today is a huge improvement already, but I'm definitely not there yet. I hate that I do this, but I don't come to the realization I'm doing it until it's too late and I have myself completely worked up (with the exception of the last 2 times, where I managed to de-escalate the situation for myself on time).

It's not cool and no fun for anyone. This only happens with people I'm extremely close to, and its coming from my fear of rejection. 

Although there is some improvement, I'd like to have it resolved sooner rather than later. Does anyone know any distraction methods/tips to ask my question faster, books or other stuff to get over my fear of rejection etc.?",25Jan2020,1

I've learned my behaviour from childhood and when my partner corrects me on something, I don't know if he's manipulating me or I'm just doing my learned behaviour. How do I know what's right?

621,"It’s the same conversation that you probably had with your parents when you’re sad or stressed. 
“You’re too young to be stressed! You can only enjoy life when you’re this young.” 
Then moments later, 
“Why aren’t you studying? Do you have a boyfriend because you can’t at your age. Why do you have a C in one of your classes?” 
I had this conversation just a few minutes ago with my mom. She is a single mother and my sister and I live with her along with her boyfriend. I cry and cry and cry because of it. I love my mother very much. Most of the things I do, I do it for her. But this conversation was one of the worst fights I could ever have because I want to listen to her but it’s impossible. I can’t not cry because I cry almost every night. She asks “Why do you cry?” And I say I don’t know. She says I must know because I don’t cry for no reason. I don’t know if that’s true though because I cry all the time not knowing why. So I guess I’m lying to her. Maybe I do know why I’m sad but I am just hiding it from her? This conversation all started because she asked what do I want to be when I grow up. I said I don’t know. Maybe a nurse since people say I should be a nurse or doctor. I don’t know my interests. I don’t know my plans for life. Keep in mind, i am only 13 years old. I got stressed out and started crying because I realized I’m not prepared. And then she started yelling at me “Why are you crying? You don’t have to be stressed! Just stop it! I was never like this when you were young!” (Actual quotes) After a few minutes (I still didn’t calm down) she told me, “I thought you weren’t going to be a moody teenager.” I told her it can’t be helped and she screamed at me like it was blasphemy! Like it was something that is my choice! 
Anyways, I think I need some advice. How do you deal with a mother like this when this is your actual feelings? When she thinks that being a teenager isn’t hard.

TLDR; I got in a fight with my mom, she pretty much said my feelings don’t matter, I cried (a lot). How do I deal with a mom who doesn’t believe my feelings and thoughts?",25Jan2020,1

I'm not sure how ""normal"", I guess you could say, I am. I'm a nice guy, I feel like I'm somewhat attractive (I really hope), I'm pretty smart (I've gotten straight A's since 3rd grade), I am an active person and I take care of my body, I really just take care of myself and everything I do. 

What confuses me though, is other guys? I'm a straight male, but I don't really look at women like my friends do. They will stop and stare at women for as long as they can, whereas I find someone cute, but I don't stop and fantasise about  them. I apparently flirt a lot, but I dont really notice if I do. I don't really call women hot (tho I sure as heck think so) because I feel like it's almost disrespecting other women. I've also grown up with two sisters and no brothers. I have absolutely no problem talking to girls, whereas my friends are deathly afraid of talking to them. 

Sometimes the way I act and think makes me a little self conscious. All my friends are girl driven and all they do is fantasise hooking up with the hottest girl in school. Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm not as much of a guy as I should be. But I talked to one of my very good friend who is a girl, and she says that that is amazing.

628,"My girlfriend and I (24f/21f) have been together for about 7 months, I am beginning to think she has a drug problem, but I might be overthinking it.    I don't want to control what she does with her body, but at the same time I'm absolutely terrified in case she overdoses one day.    For context, drugs are illegal and heavily frowned-upon in my country, so I apologise if I say anything out of line or anything disrespectful. 

When we first starting dating we both smoked a lot of weed.   She also took MDMA at parties but I didn't think it was that big of a deal, plus she swore to me up and down she knew what she was doing and I had nothing to worry about.   A friend told me to be careful because she used to take a lot of cocaine and would get really aggressive after doing it, but I thought it was just a rumour. 

Things got worse.   She'd use just about all her money on any kind of drug she could get her hands on, apart from heroin, and would take drugs to the point where she'd black out.   I stopped going to parties with her because her friends would have bad trips and start either getting aggressive or having screaming/crying fits.    I have really bad social anxiety and that has caused me numerous panic attacks.   They'd also pressure me into doing drugs with them (not my girlfriend, just her friends) and would really patronise me if I said no.   

She isn't safe about taking drugs either.   She takes a lot of different drugs at the same time (mixes coke + weed+MDMA for example).   I've told her she could die from doing that, but she laughed it off and told me she doesn't care.  It got to a point where someone told me in a panic she was vomiting blood at a party, but she doesn't remember doing that so I don't know if that actually happened.    She goes on 2-day drug binges with her friends almost every single weekend. I never get to know if she's ok during all this, and it honestly rips my guts out, because I'm so scared in case she has overdosed to a point where I struggle to eat or sleep.   She gets horrifically ill afterwards and it kills me seeing her that way.     

I don't know if I'm overthinking all of this because of my anxiety + the culture around drugs in my country of if she genuinely has a problem with drugs.  If she does, I have no idea what I should do.  I don't know how to approach her about it without coming across as controlling or judgemental.   Any advice would be appreciated.",25Jan2020,1
629,"This was removed from legal advice so I decided to try here.

There is a jewelry company that has grown in popularity through Instagram and Facebook that has started to email posters of negative reviews horrible cease and desist letters.  Others have shared that they are also receiving these emails over in r/jewelry. The company claims to be based in California but due to their correspondence and the international shipping fees I was charged( I live in Pennsylvania), that is highly unlikely.

This company deletes negative reviews or finds ways to stifle negative numeric ratings on other sites. Their website advertises lab grown diamonds but myself and others have had our jewelry tested and they are not diamonds. They also shipped me the incorrect product and refused to send what I paid for or issue a refund.  The company has also emailed me asking me to remove negative reviews. 

At this point I just want to be done with this company. I know my reviews were not false, and that this cease and desist is flimsy to say the least but is there anything I can do to both protect myself and get them to leave me alone?

I make about $400 a month through disability, and gain an additional $300 - $700 through pell. I'll also be receiving more money in the future for the duration of my time in college due to military benefits. I don't have my driver's license and I don't own a car.

There's also the issue of income. Once I leave school, two of my three sources of income will disappear meaning I'll have no money unless I find a job ASAP.

My issue I'm running into is this: my possessive mother has had the idea that we move to Texas. Move away from my friends to a new environment for seemingly no reason. I find this idea naseating because I've moved every 4 years for my entire life. It's become harmful to me to know any friends I make will leave in a few years and I can't form any lasting relationships with anyone.

My downstairs neighbor moved in about a year and a half ago and I've never seen her (My husband has, says she's an older lady, probably retired). It's an old building so I can slightly hear the noises of her daily life through the vents like her TV being on or the fan in her bathroom, occasional sounds of vacuuming, and for a few weeks it sounded like she was building shelves or something. Lots of hammering type noise.

She almost never leaves her apartment and seldom has guests, but I think her grandson stayed with her over the summer because I heard lots of video games being played by a younger guy yelling into a headset. Haven't heard him in a few months though. Her assigned parking space never has a car in it, so I don't know if she drives and there's no way to tell if she's out of town 

Anyway, she normally uses her bathroom fan for about 10 minutes in the morning while I'm getting ready for work. I never hear it turn on at any other time. For the past 3 days it has been on constantly, and I haven't heard the ambient noise of her TV through the vent.

641,"My older brother and I usually talk about drinks and parties that we have gone to in our lives. We both have tried several drugs in our life (weed, coke, etc.) but have only done it once and it happened several years ago. We don't smoke weed anymore, and I am pretty sure about it because we share a car and the smell of weed hasn't been anywhere in our house or cars or clothes. We also have no appeal to it, and neither do our friends. 

A couple of days ago, my brother said he drank before his basketball game (he was a college athlete, now he plays on adult teams for fun) and he performed ""better"" than usual. I replied saying that wasn't the best thing to do, but he should be careful not to keep doing that before it turns into a problem. Usually, he laughs about it, but this time he was quiet and walked out of my room very suspiciously. As a younger brother who cares, I told my mom about this situation because he was driving to and from the game by himself. My mom was visibly upset and worried and then told me that my older brother has been drinking a bit more often and that she, too, shares the same concern. 

Yesterday, my mom went into his room to look through his stuff to see if it was actually a problem (my mom has usually done this, and although some may look at it as a breach of our personal privacy, we accept that she does it and have no problem with it). She found bottles of all sizes, small single-shot bottles, medium-sized bottles, and the largest bottles as well. She nearly broke down in tears as it confirmed he might be an alcoholic. The need to hide the bottles from our cabinet of alcohol shows us that he drinks way more than he should. It also explains why some bottles from our cabinet have gone missing, and at an alarming rate. 

How can I help him? I am pretty sure he wouldn't want to go to an AA meeting because he would be embarrassed, and he also doesn't accept he has a drinking problem. After his talk with my mom, he says its to ""help him sleep"" or ""to relieve stress"". He doesn't admit he has any mental health worries or any other signs of might-be depression. He justifies it as the cyclical stress or just disappointment in random non-correlated things. I know that he won't admit things to me, but maybe through my mom. 

TL;DR: I recently discovered my brother might be an alcoholic, but definitely has a drinking problem. I want to try and get him professional help or to an AA meeting, but given his personality, I am somewhat sure he won't want to go. Looking for ways to start a process to help him.",25Jan2020,1

644,"So a best friend of quite a long time stopped talking to me 5 months ago and I’m just trying to understand what exactly happened

For context as to what i’m trying to figure out, after months of thinking, here’s a few things that I deduced, that might have led to this.

1.) I’m a man and she is a woman. Over one summer, we got really close because we were both just at lonely points in our lives, we agreed to a fwb thing for a couple weeks, then we kinda just moved on from it. I then started dating somebody when I got back to college and have been dating this person for a year and a half now. Out of the blue, my friend asks me if I told my partner about our little hook up thing and I said yes and that was the last thing she ever said to me. At this point, my friend had found herself a partner. We “dated” once in high school for a week, which involved making out. We have, however, always shared a pretty intimately platonic friendship. Cuddling and what not, nothing serious. But we have always been real close. We have mostly been single, but whenever she got a boyfriend, I made sure to back off. So has she developed feelings for me since that summer? Or maybe she’s upset that we even had sex in the first place? I can’t see her perspective because it truly felt mutual and it still does. 

2.) Maybe a month prior to her cutting contact with me, she told me that it feels like every conversation we have turns into me talking about myself. I responded with something along the lines of “i’m a busy person now a days because i’m finishing my major and i’m sorry but myself is just all I can afford to think about right now.” At the time, I didn’t really understand where she was coming from because I always listened to her when she vents, when she sends me a meme I send her one back, and when we were texting I thought I was being inviting. Thinking back I didn’t respond to her for a few hours to a day and that maybe would be selfish of me. I think it was dumb of me to respond that way, I should have considered her feelings before considering mine. But, I also just started a relationship that I was investing a lot of time into. There was another time where she showed off her new boyfriend (same one as mentioned previously) and normally I ask about them and what not but that specific time I think I just said some one-off dumb remark to be funny. So i’ve been thinking that maybe i’ve just become toxic for her and I was just dragging her down. Maybe my attitude with her has changed but I truly do not know and i’ve been thinking about this for many months at this point. I suppose we texted less than we normally did but that wasn’t abnormal for us, we always had a certain ebb and flow with our communication. Not in a bad way, just in a “life gets in the way,” way. 

3.) 3 years ago, she had started to become increasingly rude to me, congruently during a period where she had a boyfriend who didn’t like me. Like, genuinely being insulting and rude. I’d ask what concert she’s going to and she’d say something like “just google it, it’s not that hard.” She blocked me on FB (back when I had it) for no discernible reason. She would say mean things to me and what not. After dealing with that behavior for 8 months or so while being endlessly supportive of her, I told myself enough is enough and I messaged her something along the lines of “I cannot handle  being friends with you right now, if this (I listed her behaviors), is how you’re going to treat me. I am sorry that i’m making this decision but you’ve kind of forced my hand. My door is always open and I love and care about you but I am not going to take this anymore.” A few months go by and I suddenly get a text from her saying that she had no idea how to respond and that she was really disappointed with herself and she really snapped out of it once her and her controlling boyfriend broke up. So I said it was okay and she told me no, it wasn’t, she really wanted to be a better friend to me, so then I said that I forgave her, which I did and still do. She accepted that and continued be a good friend and genuinely has continued to be a good friend 2 years later, even right before she stopped talking to me. We spent a lot of time together from then until now. So maybe she still feels guilty over this? Or maybe she thinks i’m a hypocrite because now I started to be a bad friend to her? 

She hasn’t responded to any of the 3 texts I sent her. 2 of them were just innocuous. “Hey what’s up, wanna hang out,” and the one was basically a text saying that I was genuinely sorry that I hadn’t been investing more time in her. No response. That was about 4 months ago. Considering all of this, I truly can’t figure out what happened. Have I become a bad friend to her? Maybe she hasn’t told me that i’m starting to become a bad friend because I kind of shut her down when she told me the whole thing about me talking about myself. I’m really thinking that this is where it stems from that specific exchange, but I also can’t think of any instances where I was being a particularly “bad friend.” Absent, if anything, but it’s not like I never talked to her. I’m just stumped. And hurt. And I’m desperately trying to figure out what I did. We’ve been good friends for more than 5 years and we have shared a lot of life experiences together. I don’t want this to become a thread on her character, I just want to see what other people think about this situation. Do I sound like I was becoming a bad friend? Feel free to ask questions about our friendship if you need more context, maybe that’ll help me think of instances of me being in the wrong.",25Jan2020,1

A bit of background here, I'm 20, currently studying for my exams and trying to finish my degree

I live with my single mom (46) and two brothers, a 4 yo and a 16 yo.

For the last few years he has become extremely dependent on his phone, it's YouTube and animes every waking hour before and after school, he's a bright kid, always been good with mathematics physics and such but it's highschool and his grades on subjects like philosophy are below acceptable but he doesn't do anything about it even though he will fail if he keeps this up.

Today was a bit of a breaking point both for him and my mom, they got in a huge fight while my mom was demanding him to put his phone down and study for his philosophy test that he has next Monday. But he refuses.
My mom has struggled with depression before and this wasn't good for her at all.

Fast forward a bit, he now has no phone and is just laying on his bed, my mom locked herself in her room crying and I just don't know how to deal with any of them. I've tried to reason with him before about his addiction but as any other addict he doesn't think he has a problem. I've comforted my mom but it doesn't seem to matter. They have been like this for the last hour or two.

At this point I'm just thankful my 4yo brother isn't here to witness this mess (he's spending the weekend with **his** dad)

Anyways, has anyone been through anything similar?

649,"Hi. 

Ever since I was little my sister, brother, and Ioved to play games together. Being the middle child, I was often left out in games and never being “player one”. All the time my older sister would insist on being in charge of everything, games, her stuff, etc. If something was hers, it was hers. No one could use it unless it was under her circumstances. If you wanted to borrow an hdmi cord, or a book, or even a charging cord, it had to be under her circumstances. She used to have a “library checkout” for her books, and if you had it for longer than 2 weeks, you never were loaned one again. 
     My parents are strong believers in solving your own problems, so when we had arguments over her lack of trust or control issues they involved them selves when (if) we got physical. My parents have also started to have smaller events, so gifts were in small amounts. So if you got anything at all (for any occasion), it was small. That ended up being our downfall. 
     See my sister received her very own PS4 for Christmas one year. She’s 16 years old now and wanted to be able to own one to take to college. Obviously it was agreed upon that it would be shared if she wasn’t using it, and if she did want to it was hers. But that agreement was quickly thrown out the window about a month after having it.
     A passcode was put on every account so the only way to use it was with one of her remotes and with the passcode that only she has. And if you realized this yet, no one (emphasis on “no one”) knows any of her passcodes and never will. She never trusts me with anything anymore after one time I was using the device while she was unaware. 
    I have never done anything to make her so untrusting of me and it makes me wonder what life will be like if she can’t even trust her family? I’m sure her terrible anxiety plays a part in this, but there’s no excuse, right? My parents would never take away the device she abuses for power, so there’s nothing I can do but hope that maybe she’ll trust me again. But accusing her of being controlling loses everything. Including the trust I never had. 
      If you have any advice please let me know below.

652,"Over the past few years I have been gradually weaning myself off social media apps due to feeling like I spend (waste) so much time in these environments and ultimately end up feeling terrible after each use. I deleted my Instagram a few years ago, my Snapchat one year ago, and finally I would really like to delete my Facebook account. The problem is that I have family members and a few close friends who really like following my posts and will contact me worried if I go more than say a week without posting something. I have been posting primarily my art/paintings over the years to my Facebook and it's been really fun to share and receive feedback, even sell some things. However there have been multiple times when I go incognito for some duration of time, say 1 month, because sometimes I go through artist's block and other times I just don't feel like sharing anything or being on social media. I've noticed that sometimes when I go incognito, people (family, friends, acquaintances) will reach out to me via direct message and ask me if I am okay, why I'm not posting any art, and tell me that they miss seeing it. I got together with my close friend (former coworker) earlier last year and he told me he missed seeing my posts so much and was so sad I deleted my Instagram. I felt a wave of guilt overwhelm my entire body, and I also felt resentful because I wish my friend would be happy for me that I'm taking time away from these addicting platforms to take care of my mental health. He always talks about how he has no friends and no life outside of work and so seeing my art/posts makes him happy. I love this person dearly and this is nice to hear but at the same time I feel like I can't handle people saying those type of things to me because I feel responsible for their wellbeing, when in reality I am the one who needs to be focusing on and working on my happiness/mental health by getting off these addicting platforms.

I feel tremendous guilt at the thought of deleting my Facebook because I would be cutting off visual contact between me and family/friends, but at the same time, my mental health is most precious to me and it needs nurturing these days. All this social media usage has driven me into addiction, anxiety, depression and comparison. I want so badly to cut the ties and be alone with myself, focus on what I need and get to know myself again. I feel like that is when I will flourish most creatively, not when I am posting just for the sake of posting!

But about a week ago I had almost one of the worst nights of my life. I'm not trying to paint myself as the victim because obviously I'm not but two separate horrible things happened that night that I can't even remember that clearly. I am someone who does tend to have somewhat frequent panic attacks (I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety or anything) but I've noticed alcohol makes this worse. Anyways I am at a friends birthday party and start drinking. The last thing I remember is her cake, karaoke and a brief snippet of one of her friends telling me to calm down and breathe. When I woke up the next day I woke up fully clothed and on her bed and I remembered that I started panicking so I apologized and asked her what had happened. She told me my panic attack lasted for an hour and then another for ten minutes and I fell asleep. But they basically babysat me through the entire thing and I felt like I ruined her party. I do a check up on myself and find a total of 27 bruises all over my body including my head and a swollen lip and wrist. I also had a sore throat and a lot of scratches on my neck because I self harm without really meaning to (i cant rlly explain it) when I am having a panic attack. Then I apologize and ask another person that was there while it happened what exactly went down and they told me everything in detail. Including that I started calling him other names, singing to them and I tried kissing him. But I just don't understand. I have a boyfriend and I have never thought about anyone else like that before while with him not to mention that I secretly dislike the person that told me that I tried to kiss them.  So I just don't understand why or how that happened. Of course I immediately called my boyfriend to tell him and for obvious reasons he was upset as he has every right to be. I feel horrible for hurting him the way I did. And even worse that I can't even explain myself because I don't remember anything. And to know that it was something I did disgusts me, it really makes me sick to my stomach. I cant believe I would do that, ever, drunk or not.

I don’t actually want to separate but I do?
A few years ago he became addicted to gaming. (Fortnite) he’s fkn 40+ and I feel like I’m competing with this game constantly.
A few other forgivable quirks and he’s a pretty decent guy but this game has taken him away from me as a partner, lover and for the most part a father too.
He cannot see this. 
We’ve talked about this over and over and there’s been times where he’ll give up the game (for brief periods of time) but he always goes back. 
He would say that I’ve withheld intimacy... I would say how can you want to be intimate with someone who only comes to your bedroom after midnight and only on nights he wants sex. He’ll for the most part fall asleep on the couch and I believe that’s so he doesn’t wake me to alert me to what time he actually finished playing. 
I tried taking control- but that’s never worked. 
I’m at a point where if he doesn’t want to work on this then I cannot be his saviour.
So this morning I said we need to talk about our future and he said he agrees. 
This surprised me because he never wants to. 
So I think he’s over this as much as I am and the best option I think is separation.
So we’ll talk about it then. 
I’m scared. 
I’m not scared of being alone. 
I’m scared of starting again, the hassle with that and working through all the things that keep us connected. House, debt, moving etc

663,My step mom of two years recently spent a night in a jail cell for attacking my dad who is physically disabled. They have since split and are in a custody battle for my 2 year old sister. My dad has done everything to accommodate my step mother to prevent my sister having a strained relationship with her mother. However my step mom can’t let go of her rage to my dad and has done everything in her power to make life difficult for him (most notably slashing his car tires when he just got out of hospital for surgery).  The courts have ordered that she is not allowed near my family except for my auntie when she visits my sister. Yesterday she let slip to my auntie by accident that she has in fact looked into having my dad killed!! Luckily my auntie was having her house decorated and several people also heard this.

I’ve always been a shy person but over the last few months I’ve become a lot more anxious and reclusive. I get nauseous whenever I’m in a trivial social situation such as raising my hand in class or walking to PE and I constantly feel like people are judging me. I’m constantly over analysing people’s gesticulation and expressions to the point where I can’t sleep at night. Even when I’m with my closest friends I feel like my behaviour is being scrutinised. I constantly feel guilty. Intellectually, I know these fears are irrational and that everything is going smoothly but the fears are still there.

682,"So yeah, as the title says! My dad makes like 5000$ a month in salary, my mother makes like 2000$ a month in salary. So they earn a very decent amount in my opinion. They even own a property that we don't live in, but my grandfather has gifted to us, but it's to small for my family so we don't live in it.

I feel like my parents are addicted to buying useless things to our house hold in general. They someway somehow manage to drain all the 7000$ salary every month and have the need to borrow 500$ every month from friends.

They buy groceries like 3-4 times a week for god knows how. And when let's say that they want a washing machine, they make sure to buy the most expensive one for like 2000$. When my dad wants a new phone, he makes sure to buy one for like 1000$

All of that has caused us to living in a small rented apartment and having a 400$ car that barely drives, smashed taillights and a broken exhaust system.

And when i want a new phone because mine is broken, they tell me that they don't have money. By me saying that, I don't mean that they are paying the whole amount. I always pay atleast 50% of the price for it even if it's my birthday. And the phone can't cost more than 600$ tops. So they will help me with 300$ if I am lucky.

Now you are maybe saying that I am spoiled. I am not, infact I pay for 90% of my stuff. But I am just sad on how much money that is being wasted on useless stuff when we don't even have a car that can go through town without everyone looking at us because it's so loud.

I found out he cheated on me while I was pregnant (at least) once with his ex (only a couple weeks into our relationship) and his ex got pregnant as well. Things have been insane, I always used to catch him lying and keeping things from me. He’s very private and won’t let me go through his phone and if I even look over 
his shoulder while he’s texting he gets mad (which is understandable, I mean like PrIvAcY) but he was very open before he cheated on me. While I was pregnant he’s brought up trying to be with both of us and I said no and we got in a huge fight and broke up for a few days. He says he was wrong and he doesn’t still think that but I’m not sure if I believe him. I’ve caught him being with her a lot without telling me(once the same day I gave birth) I guess to help her because she’s pregnant(even though I know they’ve hung out, watched movies, went fishing etc.) which I want to be understandable about but he won’t just tell me and be honest about it. He goes behind my back. We’ve both had our babies now and as far as I know he hasn’t went to see her but I wouldn’t know because I work all day and he doesn’t work so he could be doing anything and he wouldn’t admit it before (I found out myself) so why would he now when I have no way of knowing? I’m trying to put all of my trust in him but it’s so hard. This is all coming back because we were sitting together and a message came up from her and he quickly moved his phone away and I tried to peak and saw he deleted the conversation.

One person who has commissioned me quite a few times is kind of difficult to work with (have been working with them for the past few months) and is constantly looking for a deal. I understand not being able to afford art and stuff, but if that were the case, they just wouldn’t commission me. They are constantly asking for large pieces of work and then surprised when I tell then the price, and is constantly saying they can’t spend more than $20 on things (which is insanely cheap for what she’s expecting of me). But then they’ll commission like 3 works in a row so what was the point of the the $20 budget?? 
I know i should be grateful they want to support me, but i can’t help but feel kind of frustrated and even embarrassed that they’re constantly trying to get me to cut her a deal, do things way too cheap, or expecting special treatment bc they’re a regular customer. I feel embarrassed as if maybe they’re playing me, or my work just isn’t worth its full price. At this point, it doesn’t even feel like they actually want to support me. I even sometimes get the feeling they’re trying to guilt me into lessening the cost, like when they want it rush ordered but can’t afford the late-notice fee, they’ll repeatedly say they’re very worried it won’t get to them in time and they really really want it as soon as possible. 
I currently have a sale for couples commissions for valentine’s day, and after commissioning me twice in a row, they asked if the sale applied to any 2 people, or just couples. When posting about the sale, I originally planned it to be for any two-person commissions, but so far have only done it for actual couples with coupley poses and hearts and stuff. Even though they technically aren’t in the wrong for asking, I can’t help but feel frustated. I want to tell them that the sale is only for couples, because I feel as i’m being taken advantage of. But is that wrong of me? 
Am i being selfish?? Or is she crossing a line??

Okay, so I’m having trouble with my guy friend, I’m 16f and he’s a 17m, and we text occasionally. We’ve been talking since the middle of November. Recently, I’ve been wondering if he may kinda like me. Sometimes he talks about girls, but not a lot. He used to ask me for advice about girls, then stopped. He’s said that I was pretty before, and asked why I was even single. Two weeks ago, he mentioned how we could hang out alone, and go to a movie and trampoline park together. He’s talked about us hanging out a pretty good amount of times now in the past two weeks. He’s even invited me to one of his wrestling matches, but we didn’t get a chance to talk there. I even flirted with him, and he reciprocated it back. I even told him that when we hang out, to make our next hang out a date, and he didn’t deny it, he just said that he’ll be busy with wrestling (wrestling is super busy), so maybe we can hang out in between. But on Thursday, we started flirting over text, and it went a bit far, if you know what I mean,  then the next day, he was kinda like distant. Like in the morning, he told me that he was tired, and that we could text later, so I hit him up last night, and he left me on open twice. The first thing I said was “Hey bro”, then I asked him why he left me on read, but I deleted it on Snapchat. When we did hardcore flirting before, he kinda acted like this too. I’m just confused why he acts like this, he’s usually a respectful guy, and doesn’t strike me as a guy that just wants sex. And on Wednesday, he was being really sweet, and saying that he’d never let me down, and called me pretty.

694,"Dear fellow redditors, I really would appreciate some advice on my situation

In 2017 I ordered Volvo XC90 at one of the official Volvo Dealerships in Russia. Paid 10% deposit of the total car price. Waited for 9 months for the car to be assembled and shipped to Russia. Meanwhile it turned out that the dealership I ordered the car from gone bankrupt. The car was transferred to another Volvo dealership, and I bought it from there. Volvo Cars Russia assured me that they would handle the situation and do their best to prevent any loses (The car arrived right during the shutting down process of that Dealership, so there was a lot of mess and speculations).

It turned out that \~20 people got scummed and about 400k usd were gone. Most of those people were paying 100% deposits in exchange of 10-20% discounts on cars.

As a result ""Volvo Cars Russia"" (Volvo's importer and distributor in Russia) decided to ignore everyone, so Volvo became the only car brand that didn't do anything for their customers (no compensations, no legal advice/presentation in court). On the other hand BMW and Audi gave away cars to deceived clients for a total of about 8 mln usd. ""BMW Group Russia"" and ""Audi Russia"" never got that money from the dealership.

The whole situation was nonsense. Especially in my case, because I bought the most expensive model loaded with options, didn't get huge discounts, had to wait for 9 months, and finally I became a Volvo's customer.

I tried to communicate with VCR asking them to provide a discount equal to the sum of money I lost, so that I can buy one more Volvo car for my mother. Thought of it as a win-win situation for both sides: they woudn't earn much on selling that XC40, but their profits would include maintenance costs, profits from additional equipment and accessories and a happy customer at last. I was even willing to sign NDA because my situation was different from others' - I did not receive huge discounts and I didn't lose much money. They denied.

I also wrote an email to Volvo Sweden and some Swedish Mass Media. Volvo Sweden replied that they had contacted Volvo Russia and asked them to assist/negotiate with me. I contacted Volvo Cars Russia later and they once again told me to gtfo (sorry, i really don't know how to express that kind of attitude in a different way).

Last year I started investing and buying stocks. I wonder if holding some shares of Volvo AB would provide any additional advantage/leverage to handle my situation and to recover the money I lost (\~7-8k euro). Not specifically in terms of plain cash, but maybe some options like extended warranty for the car, winter tires and/or something else.

Any other ideas are very welcome.

If anyone is interested, here are the letters to VCR and to Customers' Experience Department of Volvo Sweden.

I was watching a video of Savannah Montano, and I have no problem with her but she kept trying to look subtly hot in her vlog by making these dumb pouty lips and she has a super stuffy voice which annoys me. So I turned it off. 

Then I clicked this other “leaked” video of some dumb girl from Tik Tok, who was apparently mad at her boyfriend while they were breaking up and she kept saying (in an annoying ass raspy voice) “PuNcH mE iN tHe fUcKiNg FaCe tHeN” “gIvE mE a FuCkInG bLaCk eYe” like shut the fuck up with your annoying self. It literally made me want to punch her in the mouth because of how annoying she sounded.

700,"Sorry if I'm rambling, but I also want to get this off my chest too since I haven't slept well for the 5th night in a row; I've been on a sleep deficit since Monday night for a whole multitude of reasons, but only the last 2 nights have been because of stress.

When my usual post slowed down around Christmas, there were very few positions open, but my agent managed to find something for me, but the only thing was that they dealt with Manufacturer B, but other people who hold a similar job have told me it's the best company to work for (as you'll see below, I'm not convinced), so I accepted it.

This position used the same software I've been using, and most of the general duties and procedures were fairly similar; although the few differences present were fairly profound and was a bit daunting at first, but it wasn't anything I can't handle and I adapted fairly quickly, despite the fact that the person teaching me was going very fast.

The only problem? The coordinator (similar to a supervisor) is a perfectionist, and refuses to believe that I am capable of doing my job, and keeps condescendingly telling me that I don't have the experience that he assumes I don't have... He sends a multitude of texts and/or calls me anywhere from 3-8 times a day (his record is 14), and **incessantly** reminds me on what to do and rehashes lots of common knowledge EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I've tried everything from politely telling him that he doesn't need to remind me and if there are any questions I'll ask him, all the way to losing my patience and telling him off.

When I do call him out on it, whether it's politely telling him that I don't need a reminder and I'll ask him if I need clarification, all the way to losing my patience and telling him off, he instantly gets boisterous and defensive, and refuses to believe me when I say that it'll wind up either making me confused or forgetting even more... Long story short, how my memory retention works is kinda weird; see my TED Talk below.

Sure enough, it did manifest itself yesterday , I've had it up here with those reminders, and I'm VERY sure that this event will only enable him and make him feel compelled to ~~teach me the Goddamned alphabet too~~ keep reminding me about everything. How do I get this to stop for once and for all? Resigning is not an option either; my agent told me there's hardly any other posts available, this is the best money I've made in a long time, and I'm concerned about my reputation since this industry is fairly niche.

Thank you for your help!

**=====My memory retention TED talk=====**

Even ever since I was a kid, I've found that I probably memorize things a weird way, and reminding me too many times actually has the opposite effect... The best way to describe my mind is that it forms an index, then shoves the secondary information (e.g. diagnostic steps, detailed info) into a ZIP File that I'll only unzip if it's needed/relevant. If there are 10 steps and Step 8 changed, I will only need to know what's different about Step 8 so that I can discard, replace, or create a variant (8A, 8B). THAT'S IT... It's the easiest way to commit to long-term memory, and my chances of forgetting it are slim to none.

However, if you try to rehash Steps 1-10 or even 6-10 and sneak in Step 8, chances are I'll be forced pull it from long-term memory to rebuild my index, unzip and repackage the information, and during all this mess, probably inadvertently toss out Step 3 and/or ignore Step 8, but during all this time, only a fragment of it will reenter long-term memory since everything is still floating within short-term memory.",25Jan2020,1
702,"Throwaway because I do not want this in my main account.

For context, I am a 19 years old female and I am studying Medicine. My anatomy teacher (55?M) has always been a nightmare, he shouts at everybody like he is Gordon Ramsey and 90% percent of the class has failed his subject.

Four weeks ago I decided to talk to him in private about an exam and since then he has completely changed around me. He has a nickname for me and he is complimenting me all the time, he has also said some inappropriate stuff to me.

The thing is, even though he is really nice to me (and only to me) he keeps suspending me. I am truly desesperate, he is really unfair with everybody and I do not what to do to pass anatomy. When I confronted him about this, he said that I sould ""work a little harder and and maybe spend more time with him"" to pass.

I am going to his office tomorrow and I am probably going to make out with him or give him a blow job in order to pass.

I know this is wrong, I am not sexually attracted to him, but he does not disgust me or anything.

I don't know if I sould do this or not. Students have tried to take him out of the University (for being unfairly strict) many times before and nothing has worked.

I can start by telling that im on a new country to work. Its been like a month but feeling so lonely already.

Im working for like 15 years. Im 29 currently.

My coworkers keep talkin about having relationships and sex ( calling escorts etc. ) but i dont like that kind a conversations and since i didnt had any experience that makes me horrified too.

709,"I recently went through some trauma with a long time friend, and for a year my group of friends have been neglecting and ignoring my existence. I've reached out to that friend for this whole year and got nothing in return, and in speaking of my experiences with other friends, they've told me that what these people are doing is toxic. I believed it because I didn't know what I did and nobody would tell me. I still don't know really. The things they said and did, and other peoples experiences with this group proved their toxicity. But after talking to my friends roommate recently, I saw the other side to the story, and now it feels as though I was the toxic one. 

I would always try to vent to some of these friends when I was around them, tell them why I was hurting, what I didnt know. And they assumed I was purely 'talking shit' on my other friends. That was never my intent. I just wanted to get the pain off of my chest, and to them they saw it differently. I'm still not sure if what I did was considered toxic, but I feel like they used what I did to mask their own toxicity.

Even so, all I want is to be a good person, never get involved with drama, never be toxic like I potentially was, or like these people are. I want to be a good person, but in order to do that, I need to be able to understand what i am, and what toxicity is, and how i can point it out in my own life, and avoid being that way.

712,"Hello, Reddit  


I'm a 21 year old male in the West coast of Canada and I've been fucking up for quite a bit now. To make a long story short, I've fucked up at university I've been attending for approximately 2 years now and due to absences and multiple failed classes I've been requested to withdraw for minimum 6 months. Upon receiving the notice, I thought it  would be a sign for me to take a break from school and maybe find what I actually want to do. As I am currently living with my parents, when they saw the mail from my school regarding Request to Withdraw and my outstanding balance for the school (final notice) they blew up. They've been always telling me to take more classes and to get my university finished as quick as possible (I understand that they are saying these things in concerns for my future) and when I have been taken a laid back approach to university they were quite unhappy. While my approach to university was an obvious failure, I just wanted to take the foot off the gas pedal and maybe finally find peace within myself as I have had some personal and mental health issues in high school and etc. I've never been able to talk to these things with my parents or anyone due to the culture I was brought up in and my parent's attitude towards such topics. Now currently, they have given me a week to pack my belongings and move out. While it will be very difficult to find a place near my work within week if not impossible, I don't think I can handle my parent's constant barrages and remarks regarding my failures in the past. I understand that I've brought this onto myself and probably deserve the results I've got, but I just wanted some advice from people who may have experienced similar experiences or any advice that can be offered.

714,"Hi y'all. I recently graduated university with a MA in political science. However, I never really wanted to get it I just picked it because I didn't know what I wanted out of life. My peers in grad school were jerks or had nothing in common with me. I went to both grad school and undergrad in the city I grew up and lived at home with my mom. However, I hate where i am in life. I only went to university because my mom heavily encouraged me to do so. Whilst I like some of the course material I found as a commuter student my program had lots of established friend groups and cliques that weren't accepting new members. This includes clubs, which I tried to make friends in but largely failed. Also, most were held in the evening while my classes were almost always in the day. I failed to make friends, I'm a 24 yer old virgin and I think wish I had gone to business school or became a civil engineering technician. I would've dropped out in first year but I didn't have a job and didn't know how I'd pay back the money at the time. Also, I commuted by way of a 50 minute city bus ride to school and back and I hated it and wish I had the money for a car. I went to grad school because I liked my fourth year of university but I regret going to grad school so much.

 I have 4 friends in my life 1 of which I met through my 5 years at university (never had more university friends though i did like some of my classmates). Lastly, I hated that every year I'd find myself in a class full of new people and it was almost impossible to form meaningful relationships with my peers because half the time you'd never see them again. I also felt very outclassed. As a kid I used to be solidly in the middle class but now I'm lower middle class (this stings for me because I didn't think things would get worse financially).

My mom and to an extant my aunt, just think I should consider myself lucky and accomplished for having two degrees. never mind that they mean relatively little to me and remind me of my own interpersonal failings and alienation. I've tried explaining this and it either goes over their heads or they think I'm just whining. My mom went so far as to tell me that I'm just feeling sorry for myself, which really stung. My uncle is better to talk to but he just gives tells me I should try to move on from it (I've tried this for 5 years and it hasn't worked well). It's jut so frustrating that I feel like I wasted my time and I have no idea as to what to do now. Ideally I'd like to take a mental break and start over but I don't have a job atm and I hate retail so much. Also student loans kind of suck. 

I'm considering trying to see a therapist about it. IDK what to do but it's wearing me down so much I'm have trouble focusing on day to day tasks and applying for jobs. I feel like I need to rebuild my self confidence and self-esteem from scratch. Ideally I would do the last 5 years over and go to business school or trained to be a civil engineering technician or something shorter and more practical. I could do more school but I'm mentally burnt out and hate living at home without a car (in a city where everything takes much longer to get to without a car). I'd greatly appreciate any advice on how to get out of this funk.

It's not like I don't have a life. 
I am still in school. I have a job I work on Saturday. I workout. I play musical instruments. I sometimes meet up with friends. 

But after all it just saddens me not feeling the warmth and love of an other woman. 

I want to feel romance, the intimacy. It's a thing I imagine every single day. 

It's bad for me to think about this daily.

I’ve always been an A B student, but when I brought home my report card (all 83s to 88s mind you) my mom flipped out and screamed at me, saying this was unacceptable and that i needed to try harder. My siblings however, are straight B students and my parents congratulate them on their grades, and if they fail, they console them and tell them it’s no big deal.

They keep telling me to “rein it in” and “slow down” when I ask about  job or driving, or anything a normal teenager is allowed to do. 

They’re also so judgmental towards me only. If I wear something they don’t like they’ll make fun of me for it or join my siblings when they do it.

733,"(Apologies for both my English and formatting, English isn't my first language and I'm on mobile, also, pretty long so TLDR at the bottom)

 I(19F) need advice. I bought two tickets to one of my favourite power metal bands at the beginning of February. I don't have metalhead friends but thought I'd maybe find someone to go with in the meantime (I bought the tickets 4 months ago), so I bought two tickets instead of one. However, as you can probably guess, I haven't found anyone. I almost decided to ask my ex because he has been to metal concerts before, but I don't want to because I honestly don't want to remember the concert of one of my favourite bands with him in it. The only thing making me hesitant to go on my own is being a 5'2 woman, this being my first metal concert, and overall being pretty anxious about going to events on my own. 
On one hand I think going on my own would be a great way to bond with myself a little, and to have fun without being dependent on someone else I might not even like but chose to put up with because they are a metalhead.

Also, it's good to do things that expose me to places/events I would normally avoid going to on my own due to anxiety.

On the other hand, there are of course many things that could go wrong especially as a fairly small woman on my own. I haven't been to a metal concert so I wouldn't know what to avoid and when things might be getting bad.

My questions for you people is, do you have any advice on this? Whether it would be fine for me to go on my own? Are there things I should watch out for, things I have to take with me, things I should know about before going? 
I really want to go to this concert but going with people I don't necessarily like just because they are the only metalheads I know, or going alone and possibly putting myself in troubling situations is something I hope to avoid.

740,"Hi r/Advice. I'm posting here because at this point I have no idea what to do. This is a unique situation I've been placed in and I'm worried about this person deeply. Please read the entire post too, as I'll try to give as much background information as possible to help shape the advice you guys can hopefully offer. I'm going to use pseudonyms and vague locations where necessary to protect their privacy. 

I've (25) known Raphael (19) for maybe 8 months now. I met him over Reddit and started a nice friendship; I added him on Steam, got to know him fairly well (at least as well as you can know someone through the veil of online anonymity), and talked to him multiple times a week for the past 8 months. It wasn't until three months into the friendship that Raphael told me he dealt with depression. I had dealt with depression before myself, as I feel many do at one point or another in their lives (to varying degrees, of course). I even spent two years of my undergraduate life as an RA, so talking to people with depression isn't a foreign thing to me. 

Like I said above, Raph is 19 years old. He's in college. But he's in Europe, and I'm in the United States. When he revealed his depression to me I was supportive, but also relieved to find out he was seeing a therapist and was prescribed antidepressants. So aside from the fact he was dealing with depression, everything seemed okay - on a path toward resolution. I made sure to try to be available for him, as someone he could just chat with, relate to, reach out to, and whatever else. Sometimes schedules made it difficult, but I'd try to get back to him within the day. It was the best I felt I could do as someone across the Atlantic, with the only shared connections being Discord, Steam, and Reddit. 

But as the weeks and months passed things seemed to take a turn for the worse. I was never sure but I always had the impression Raph never really had a lot of people to talk with. I never asked directly, however. I didn't want to make him feel bad about it, and I tried to be available for him anyway. About a month and a half to two months ago he explained his suicidal thoughts. It was at this point I asked whether or not his parents knew about his depression, or if he was actually seeing a therapist. It turns out he hasn't told his parents, and he has been seeing a therapist but isn't forthcoming about his feelings with her. Two weeks following this he admitted he's been hurting himself. 

Approaching this has been difficult. I tried to continue with the same approach before - to just be available to him. He messages me fairly regularly, and I check in on him often. But it hasn't provided any improvements. And I'm scared shitless that one day I just won't hear from him at all. 

So this is where I'm at now. I don't know what to do. I know nothing of his life outside of his first name, or his location (I know the country, just not a street or anything like that). I don't know his parents, or any of his friends. I'm afraid to ask for those details because it might alienate him from me (explained below), and lead him to stop talking to me since he'll suspect I'm trying to intervene. Below are some extra details that might provide some insight into his thinking that could help shape what you guys say:

-He won't tell his parents because he's worried about the burden it'll place on them. He said he doesn't want to see them in tears, worried about him, and so on. My counter to this is that if he did pass away his parents would be far more devastated than if he had been forthcoming about his pain. His response is he wouldn't have to see that. 

-His desire to kill himself stems from (to my understanding) the idea that there really isn't anything to look forward to in life. He believes that he'll just end up being a brainless puppet that is basically a wage slave in life. My response to this is that he's young, he can find a profession he's passionate about, and that life is more than just work. It's about the people you meet, the experiences, the nature you see, and all the other beautiful aspects of the little blue marble we occupy in the vastness of space. His response is he doesn't care about any of these things.

-I've told him he should be honest with his therapist, at the very least, because it'll at least be one flesh and blood person he can reach out with and have a candid conversation with (I've said multiple times that having only me online isn't enough, and he should have someone directly in his life available to him as well). But his response is that his therapist would tell his parents and perhaps forcibly hospitalize him. 

-I'm afraid that if I show any desire to intervene he'll cut me off. I'm often left with the impression that I am the only person he reaches out to. The only person he can have an honest conversation about his feelings with. If I were to make an error (if he sees this post, for example) or if I ask for personal details that would be instrumental in finding him through his country's police or some suicide helpline then he'll just shut down and block me. 

-I've told him that reaching out isn't a sign of weakness. And that it isn't selfish to find someone (even myself) to share that burden with. He says that he doesn't want to put that burden on his parents. 

-I've tried getting him to take on more responsibilities in his daily life, like taking care of his dogs more. Having an animal that depends on you could reinvigorate yourself, at least that's how I see it. 

-He recently told me that all of the answers he reads and people give to him are ""predictable."" That he's only talking to me because he wants to see if I come up with something ""new"" in how to deal with the problem. I wasn't really sure how to approach this one. 

-He recently bought a pretty huge amount of OxyContin illegally (at least what I think is a huge amount...I'm not really familiar with the stuff). That sent off big alarms for me (which is mostly why I'm here now) since it's shaping into a refined plan to actually pull it off. A sort of escalation I guess? 

Sorry for the extremely long thread. It morphed into a bit of a rant to get it off my chest, talk to people about this, and see any new and novel ways on how to approach this problem.",25Jan2020,1

I get Cs on most tests and quizzes  from not having the time to study or being too lazy to, but am able to complete all my homework and get As on them. My grades used to be fantastic, but their slowly dropping, and this is the last semester to make it count for college, and I still don’t know how to apply myself more for school.

My parents made lie to my familie and friends for mh burnmarks or my bruises.

They have done a shit ton more fucked up things and have gotten away with because they are lyimg pieces of shit.


I am 19 and I am trying to grow as a person and be independent, but I absolute late listening or doing anything they tell me too. I hate it because of two reasons. 

1. My fucked up past with them
2. Their attitude, for example: they come in my room while I am cleaning it. Tell me to clean up my room. Tell me too clean up my room, belittle me, tell horrible things about appearances, tell me I am worthless and can't be anything. Reminding me of sensitive events from my past. Tell me all kinds of slander about my little brothers and sisters. And as last they threaten me  with physical abuse. 

I hate doing things they tell, Especially when they threaten me. 

Like I said I want to be better and independent without them. They always take pride and praise in things they haven't done. I want to make sure that they have no excuse to say that they were good parents.

He’s never seemed like an “old” dog, and he commonly gets mistaken for being much younger than he is. He’s always been incredibly full of life and energetic so it was easier to forget that his life is so much shorter than mine. I honestly don’t know what to do.

However, there is one person in the group that I really can't seem to like at all, everything she does or says just weirds or annoys the ever living crap out of me for some reason. I've no idea why I am reaction so negatively towards her. My other friends acknowledge her as a part of our group and I have been trying to do the same for God knows how long.

I don't even know how to describe her, imagine if someone tried to impersonate a shy and edgy anime girl who spoke in an unusually slow and mellow voice. She says some very strange and unsettling things as though they would be funny. An example would be her constant death-talk, it's always something like ""I look like I want to kill someone"" or ""I want to die"". I know these things should be red flags to look out for in someone who's depressed or suffers from similar medical illnesses, (which I'm positive she is because I've seen her in the waiting room for the psychiatrist).

To give y'all some insight: He really enjoys talking about feelings. I do not understand that because I always have to consider his feelings, but when my feelings are hurt it doesn't seem like my SO cares. My SO is very used to getting their way. Whenever I question or challenge his way...my SO tends to get offensive. He tends to twist words to make it seem like my fault. As a result, I get very upset. He tends to say things...but later on in the conversation he says he does not mean it. It's very worrisome at time because if i do not stand my ground everything and anything is my fault. To add, he also tends to ""forgot"" what he says to me (when he knows it was not a good thing to say). Also, he also tends to give half truths. It is not ""lying,"" but I do not get the full story. I tend to question myself if this type of behavior is going to harm me or if it's just normal guy behavior. I want it to work this this guy. I truly have a great time with him.

753,"About a year and a half ago I was in a hard time in my life. My best friend couldn’t care less, so I sought support on other people. This is how I started texting her friend we’ll call Jake.

I had never met Jake irl because as I said before I met him from a group chat I was in with my friend. He offered the support that I needed at the time, because he needed support to. We talked about our heartbreaks, our losses, our broken friendships, our insecurities, etc. 

Months went by and we stopped texting each other. I didn’t have much free time nor I had motivation to socialise. The day of his birthday came and I texted him happy birthday.

Jake left me on seen.

A few days later I was like “Hey, is your phone broken or something? You didn’t see my happy birthday message.” He replied going nuts about the situation, saying things such as that I was ignoring him and stuff. He said that how could I, that I was the most important person in his life. Note to say, I did not leave him on seen I just stopped texting him AND he did that as well. I ended up saying sorry so much that he felt bad and “forgave” me.

I kept forcefully texting Jake because I didn’t want him to get mad.

Time went by and he did this weird thing. He added me on his IG’s best friends list and he sumbitted a text that said “I kicked everyone out of my best friends list except of my crush”. I didn’t think much of it. I thought that it was just a chain thing or something like that. I ignored it.

Well, turns out it was not a joke. When I texted him the next day, Jake went nuts again about how I was ignoring him. The fucked up bit is that he was 19 and I was 14. I’ll say that again. He was 19 and he had a crush on a 14 year old who he had never seen irl. Note to say, I looked 14 (no boobs, baby face) and he knew my age. I profusely apologised again and he forgave me, again.

I kept texting him but the conversation just didn’t flow. I tried, but as I’ve said, the conversation didn’t work.

So I decided to stop texting Jake.

I don’t want to ghost no one, I don’t even know if this counts as ghosting. But I’m tired that at this point the friendship seems forced and I just want to be cool with him so he doesn’t spill the beans about something I did.

Does this count as ghosting? Am I overreacting or is it just hella weird?",25Jan2020,1
754,"Hi! This is my first time posting here and i really need some advice about what's going on with my life, sorry if it's too long text and if i make any grammatical mistakes (second language).


[So for some context, I'm a high school student from a Latin American country, i'm really passionated for computers and programming stuff.
-
I study in the local high school program of the university of my state, (the university itself has programs from middle school to the university careers.)  So let's call this school ""LUHS"" [Local University High School]
-
And there's also another really known school that has a campus here in my state, and it's not only famous in the state but in the hole country because of it's prestige. We'll call it ""PUHS"" [Prestigious University High School] ]


So here i am at the LUHS, can't complaint about it at all, has everything a school has to have, it's not perfect but it's OK because sometimes we don't have classes and the hole organization it's a mess itself.

Out if all the classes i take, computation is my favorite, i learned some basic programming stuff and it motivated me to get myself deeper in this whole world of programing, everything is nice except that the only problem is that the whole school is ""Flat"", flat in a sense that it runs everything without Passion and just for the doing.
In the other hand PUHS has programs of ALL kind: Competitions, camps, mental health services... 
Everything that i love to do is there, the only problem here is that PUHS is not cheap, and with that thing only my parents discarded that school choice.

I was scrolling Facebook and saw a post of one of my friends from middle school that choose to attend PUHS, a post were my friend and his group were programming robots with the High School Campus programing team, he knew nothing about programming and there he was programming robots to make them fight, in that moment i felt sad, if i was in that school ni doubt that i would be competing with the programming team all around the country in CTF's and stuff, instead i'm here at LUHS having classes with teachers with no care at all for the class or not having classes at all, toxic ambient along the hallways and no programs to develop ourselves and having to wait until ending high school to study software engineer in order to make things that PUHS students are doing right now and with no programing classes or so in the whole state...

So here i am asking, what can i do to make this feeling go away? How to stop feeling me miserable and ""wasted talent""? Even jealous of all it's going on there...

This year I don't feel comfortable going to visit her because we just had an argument five days ago on my sister's birthday (which effectively ruined her birthday). My Gma's and I's relationship has been very rocky for the past four years every since she had a mental break from going off her meds and holding my sister hostage because she hallucinated some family conspiracy (long story). 

She got better and  I forgave her initially, but between her failing marriage and health, she's become a very bitter and judgy person. She repeatedly makes hurtful comments about my old self-harm scars (though, in her defense, she doesn't know they're self-harm scars because I never felt comfortable telling her) and it seems nothing I ever do academically or otherwise is good enough without warranting criticism.  And because of it, I've become so defensive that I get hostile any time she makes a comment that seems like a slight against me. So our relationship has become a vicious cycle of initial good will and conversation before turning into hostility as we began to have disagreements. I still love her, but we cannot seem to get along for more than 10 minutes at a time.

761,"yes you read that correctly. last night his “ex” (they never really dated just talked/hooked up) gave birth to a baby boy. she apparently didn’t know at all for the whole 9 months that she was pregnant, and had literally zero symptoms not even a bump. i’ve never seen her so i have no clue if she looked slightly pregnant or not. (don’t know how common this is but apparently it’s real¿) she said she’s giving the baby up for adoption which is understandable as they are both in college, had no clue, and she also has a boyfriend now. my boyfriend seems pretty broken up about it and having to give the baby up but knows it’s the right choice. he says he wants to be able to meet the child throughout his life and one day be able to explain why they had to give him up which i totally respect. but i can’t help but be upset because 1- i am currently pregnant with his child 
2- he told me so nonchalantly this morning like it was nothing just some random fact so it threw me off. 
3- i don’t know if i’m truly even allowed to be upset so it’s just confusing me and making me more upset.
i’m not going to tell my mom or anybody in my family for that matter cause i don’t really think it concerns them at all but i’m not really sure who to turn to about how to handle this and my feelings towards the situation. i’m mostly just confused because we are having a bit of a rough patch. hopefully he can come to terms with the adoption and they let him meet the baby and continue to be in his life as he gets older. i just want us both to be happy despite that we’re not on the best terms :((",25Jan2020,1
762,"My freshman year of college I made friends with all the guys living on my floor. We got super close and that was honestly the best part of my freshman year. It was nice having my friends right across the hall from me.
Towards the end of the year, we got our rooming applications for sophomore year (which would be this year) and one of my friends was informed that he had a lot of credit hours, which meant that he had to opportunity to snag a room in the senior suite.
The suites are nice. There’s a living room, kitchen, private bathroom and it holds four people. Everyone at our college is dying to get into these suites their senior year, but since my friend took all AP courses in high school, he got the ultimate hookup as a sophomore. All he had to do was choose three friends to live with him.
So that’s exactly what he did, but I didn’t end up being a part of it. It ended up being him, two other friends from our floor, and a friend who we hung out with a lot but lived in another dorm. Apart of that was my fault, looking back I realize that I should’ve communicated more with them, so I couldn’t be super mad. At the same time though, it would’ve been nice if they had at least offered me a spot before picking the other guy from the different dorm. They’ve been living there since last August, and for the entire year I’ve felt like I was missing out. Like I said, my new friends were my favorite part about freshman year and I loved living so close to them, so it kinda irked me that they didn’t offer me a spot. But who’s to say that I couldn’t visit them and hang out? Yeah I might be a little salty over this whole thing, but we’re still really good friends and we love hanging out. So that’s what I’ve been doing. It’s always super fun being there, but as soon as I leave all I could think about is how much I want to be with them.

Since we’re all sophomores, there’s probably not gonna be any open spots in that suite unless someone decides to move out before their senior year, which is unlikely. So, I’ve been talking with another friend recently about rooming with him next year. I’m super close with him and we’re in a lot of activities together. He’s also friends with everyone in the suite and we’ve all hung out a couple times too. On top of that, he also knows about my struggle with this whole thing and he knows that I’m kinda bitter about it.

Fast forward to yesterday, I’ve just gotten news from my friend in the suite (the one who has all the credits) that two of our friends will be moving out due to personal reasons. That means that there’s gonna be two open spots in that suite! Now, he hasn’t officially offered me the spot, but when he told me the news he worded it in a certain way that made it sound like he wants me to join. On top of that, everyone in that suite knows that I’m dying to join them. And it’s not like it’s a one way street where I want to be there but they don’t want me to. Like I said, we’re still really good friends.

So if he does offer me the spot, of course I’m gonna accept it! The only problem is that I’ve already made plans with my other friend to room with him next year. Again, he knows and understands my struggle with this whole thing and he knows how bad I want to be in that suite. He’s a super nice and down to earth guy and I know he’ll be understanding, but I just don’t know how to tell him. Remember, it’s not 100% confirmed that I’ll be living there, but it’s a super high chance.

770,"Hey everyone, I’m a 20-year-old guy, I’ve never been in a relationship, and I’ve been pretty stressed out about stuff relating to sexuality and arousal, but mostly arousal. Like, I don’t know what sexuality I am, I don’t know what turns me on or gives me an erection. I don’t know what to masturbate, or if I should masturbate to visuals or just nothing. I know, I know, it sounds dumb. “Oh, how don’t you know what your sexuality is or what turns you on. Everybody knows what!” And I think, well yeah, I just don’t know. I could spend hours looking at a computer screen and looking up some “common” stuff that gets people aroused. After those hours, I would look back and say to myself, “well, I learned pretty much nothing.” Just because I get aroused or turned on by something at one time doesn’t mean I will in the future by that same thing. 

It just gets me worried because I don’t know this kind of stuff when I should know it. It’s like I’m looking for a clear-cut answer that seems difficult to find. I thought about putting a lot of time into researching it, like looking inward or something. But it always ends with me still as confused as ever. I always worry about if ill be able to get an erection by looking at certain pictures. Then if I ever do become aroused and get an erection, I just sit there like, “oh, uh, cool. Time to go back and play video games or something.” I just wish that I wasn’t so focused on what gives me an erection, but I guess it’s just because I fear that since I don’t know this kind of stuff, I’m going to end up disappointing someone, not just myself, in the long run. I want to just stop worrying, but I feel if I stop worrying, I’m just going to develop unhealthy habits, such as sitting at a computer all day looking at porn or something, just to get an erection. 

I know it seems that I am putting too much pressure on this stuff, but I just find it so difficult to ignore this. The only thing that I find somewhat consistent is that I get aroused my muscles, like bodybuilders, but that just could be because I’ve been pleasuring myself with that kind of stuff for the past years. Still, I feel like if I don’t try to research stuff about what arouses me on the internet, I would just be avoiding the problem. But if I do try and research stuff, I just end up in a loop of unknowing and uncertainty. Anyways, thanks for reading this, and any advice for what I should do next would be appreciated.

We got onto playing truth or dare - one of the housemates dared me to spank Alice (F20), one of our other housemates who I get on well with. We were both very drunk and much to my surprise Alice agreed to it. We went into the Kitchen away from everyone else and she bent down over my knee I lifted her dress up, pulled her knickers down and spanked her bare bum 5/6 times. I pulled her underwear back up and we went back to the main room with everyone else and carried on drinking for about half an hour before we all called it a night and went to bed.

She went back home home the next day for a family wedding (and is still there) and I'm getting worried as we haven't spoken since. Should I message her just to clear the air/make sure everything is ok between us?

She's an amazing friend and I don't want to have drunkenly ruined that. Any help is much appreciated.

I can't afford to delve into it more through doctors &amp; therapy so I can't say what's going on with me for sure. I do have some medical issues which my doctors for that have explained will have an affect on my mental health, so I know that's part of it.

Always get bad diarrhea the day of. Panic attacks all through out the day. And it wasn’t that bad really it’s gotten much worse.

 It’s been keeping me from getting a job. Now please hear me out, I’m asking you guys to not comment if it’s saying “you’re just lazy” because that’s the only advice I’ve gotten so far. But it really is keeping me from getting a job. I mean I had a job for 3 days and I was a no show person because those 3 days were absolutely terrifying. I would only get 2 hours of sleep each night and spend all day sitting on the couch staring at the wall doing nothing. When I’d try to go to bed my head was racing with thoughts and I’d end up sobbing for hours. Those 3 days felt like a month. My body was completely drained after. 

Now it’s gotten to the point of where I can’t go out to freaking eat. I tried going out with my bf to lunch and I got this utter pit in my stomach that made me feel nauseous, I was shaking, I could barely move, I had to get my food to go and it took me about an hour to calm down once I got home. I can’t even go out to the movies with my mom. We made plans to and I canceled because for some reason my anxiety spikes through the roof when I leave to go do something. 

What I don’t understand though, maybe it’s because I’ve been doing it weekly but I can go to the grocery store just fine. I’m definitely hyper aware of everyone and worried about them looking at me but I don’t get the since of doom. Gas station is ok too. Other than that my body says hell no and shuts into anxiety mode.

786,"My roommates and I are in a very delicate situation where we are paying far far far below market rate for our rental. It’s small, it’s crappy, but it exists. Two of us are recent college graduates actively looking for work but still receiving a little financial support from our parents, it’s not enough to afford to just move. The third roommate is a union construction worker. He makes enough to barely afford rent on his own but the three of us are much more financially comfortable because we share the house. 

Moving would mean doubling or tripling our current rent. We have an excellent relationship with our landlord because the roommate who moved in first totally made over the property and house after the landlord’s crackhead niece and her boyfriend absolutely wrecked it. My college age friend and I have done a lot of landscaping and gardening and little aesthetic projects to improve the property and house too. 

We all want to maintain this very fortunate situation but there is a substantial leak in the roof that we’re kind of at a standoff about. She already raised the rent just a little bit without fixing it but we refused a larger rent increase without the fix. She says she can not afford to fix it without taking out a loan. I believe that this is her only rental income and she just lives off of social security. The roof has been leaking since last winter and she had previously promised to fix it before this winter. Instead, she bought us a new tarp that we had to put up ourselves. 

I’m aware that a leaky roof is probably illegal to not have fixed by the landlord in California, but getting the law involved might cause us to loose our financial advantage. Do any of you have advice on gently encouraging our landlord to help us out here?",25Jan2020,1

It's basically a beauty imperfection although it gets me incredibly frustrated at game controllers at times because I just cannot move the joystick properly at normal sized controllers.

I never realized there was something wrong with my thumbs until about 10 years ago when somebody pointed out on the train (of all places!) that my thumbs look ridiculous and asked what was wrong with them. Ever since them I've been aware of them and noticed people being strange when they notice.

No, those kind of guys I don't want in my life anyway so that's for the better.

So I’m trying to get this new job where my sister works - I passed the interview last Monday.
I was supposed to do online paperwork before my training which is this Monday.
I did not know that the paperwork had a 2 day time limit - and now I have to call my potential future boss and say that I did not complete the paperwork on time and I need a new link.
The 2 day limit ended today.


I’m panicking. My mom AND my sister were like “why didn’t you just do it right when you got the email you idiot” but I didn’t check the email until today.
I feel so bad - I wouldn’t have willingly let the paperwork sit knowing there was a time limit.
My mom also added some salt to my wound saying “This is showing them that you have a bad work ethic already and you haven’t even started working there”


I’m panicking. I took quite a bit of CBD in the hopes that it will help me get some courage to call the job.


I feel really really stupid and my family really didn’t help anything. What I want to do is quit - which is why I’m 22 and have never had any type of job for more than 2 months. I’ve already messed up and I haven’t even started.

Anyway, his friend comes into town, stays a night with us, and then has to go do some local work, and he left his dog behind. Again. Fine. He’s gone all day, we meet up with him for dinner, and then he tells us he is going to the strip club tonight (this was last night) and that he going to stay at a hotel with his friend. So of course we are like... your dog? And he says just let him out it’s not a big deal right? Note- we have to keep his dog locked in one of our rooms because my dog and his play way too rough. So we have to lock his dog in a separate room. So he goes out all night to the strip club, doesn’t come back, his dog is still here. We don’t hear from him until around noon today. He says he has to go do more work, so he doesn’t even come back to check on his dog, feed his dog, ask about his dog, ask us if it’s okay if we keep watching him, etc. 

Now he’s saying he is going out tonight again to a show and won’t be back until after two/three in the morning. So, basically he comes into town, drops his dog off, and leaves. For two days. Now, my boyfriend is getting upset, and his friend is saying that we are being ridiculous and that his dog isn’t a hassle and he is now texting ME telling me that he’s going to sleep in his car tonight with his dog since he’s not welcome there. He’s saying he doesn’t understand why we are upset. 

So, the question is, are we being ridiculous here? Are we doing the right thing by calling him out and saying “Hey, you can’t just drop your dog off here and leave him in a room for two days.” Yes, we have let his dog out and he runs around in the backyard and has fun.

I had one of the save the dates get returned, to one of my most loved relatives. I kept it with me and forgot about it a little bit. I was going to send her an invite and if that came back I would give her a call. Anyway, she ended up texting me about it since some other family members received theirs and I explained to her what had happened. 



She had actually moved, and that's why it sent back. So now I have her new address. The bad part is that she was talking to her sister, who has always treated me very unfairly and I don't like her, and she was wondering where her save the date was. She's not invited to my wedding, and I have a few other family members who aren't invited as well. I didn't know how to explain it to the relative I'm very close with so I came up with a bs excuse like it must've gotten lost in the mail.



I do not want people to come to my wedding who don't like me or have never supported me. I think that's valid, but how could I possibly explain it to other members of my family. (My immediate family is a bit estranged from a lot of our family, so I've really only invited a few of them who've always supported/loved us). 



Also my mother who I am not on the best terms with was given a save the date. She was not given a plus one--mostly because she dates awful men who I do not want at my wedding. Her current boyfriend saw the save the date and was implying that he was going to come. How can I delicately but firmly let my mother know her bf is not going to be coming?

Recently my best friend won an award in what I would describe as a national competition. It was in a topic both him and I were in love with as kids, even before we met each other. I on the other hand, was too busy to enter due to a load of schoolwork, or perhaps I was too lazy, I really don't know. My friend has the same amount of work as me though, due to us both being in school, so I'm inclined to believe that my prior statement of me being busy is just an internal excuse. And so I'm just feeling really disappointed here and kind of sad and maybe kind of jealous, which is pretty selfish and stupid of me considering it was literally my own fault I didn't enter. I think this achievement has done wonders for my best friend's self-confidence and has improved his ability to say no to things he doesn't like and stuff. By all means, this is really really amazing for him and it's so stupid that despite this great turn of events for him, I somehow feel sad about this and am unable to really truly celebrate with him. I'm feel like a horrible and shitty person because of this experience my own selfishness, because of my own mistake to not compete.

798,"Throwaway cause my some family are also on Reddit. TL;DR below. 

Long story short, my dad started physically abusing my mom midway through their relationship. She finally had enough and moved from her home country to the US with all 5 kids. My mom raised all of us by herself in the middle of a really rough neighborhood. She never let up on education and making better lives for ourselves. Most of us have made her proud. Three of us have bachelors degrees, great careers, and started our own families. 

Now, the only encounter I’ve had that I remember with him was when I was 14 years old. We went back to my parents’ home country for a funeral, but my dad heard about us coming through the grapevine. He came to the home where we were staying and assumed since we were living in the US, assumed we were well off. He asked me for money the entire week. Since I was young, I wanted to rekindle the relationship. My mom noticed he’d only call for money and, after a while, told him to stop calling. 

Fast forward 17 years and reaches out to one of my siblings on Facebook. He said he’s cleaned up his life, apologized for being absent, for everything he did to my mom, and everything he’s done to us by proxy. He asked my sibling to give me his number and said I could call if I’d like to talk to him. Now that I’m older, I’m concerned that he’s only reaching out now because he either needs something or is dying (he’s elderly now). I have his phone number, but I don’t know if I should call. Part of me is upset because he waited 31 years to want a relationship and the other part knows that, considering his medical history, this may be my last shot to get to know him. Should I give him a chance and call?

TL; DR: POS absentee dad forced my mom to run to a different country and raise all 5 of their kids on her own. 31 years later, he wants a relationship and asks me to call. Should I?

This person is very troubled and needs serious help since they have mentioned that they will kill themselves multiple times (using ""they"" to keep the gender neutral).

Last night things just got wayy too toxic and they started insulting other people as well and this is where a MOD muted them so they couldn't type anymore. When I woke up I got multiple DMs and people told me that this specific person has done terrible things (killed a dog and a cat) and apparently even sent one of the people on the server pictures of it. 

When another person approached him to calm him down they said that they want to ""kill somebody"" and take revenge  (this person got so much help in general and a lot of positive reinforcement from the members on the server it's not funny anymore) 

This person lives in the USA and this whole story is so fucked up that I don't know what to do, I am living in Europe so I have no idea what to do.

One time I mastered up the courage to talk to him and we were sitting right next to each other as well, as soon as the prof gave us a break he just turned his head over to the other side and starting asking the people next to him about their names? like dude I am literlly 5cm away from you why are you doing this to me ugh

My counselor knows a man who owns a small construction company (has about 5 employees). They remodel houses , build adds ons, build garages, pour driveways, things like that. I want to try to work there but not for pay.

809,"A few months back, I became quite close with this co-worker. We went out a couple of times too (and even kissed once) but she said no ultimately. Long story short, it hit me really hard because I hadn't felt so strongly about someone for a really, really long time.

She moved back to her hometown, and I kind of moved on. She got back together with her ex (one of the reasons she said no to me) and I thought I wouldn't really hear from her again. After a couple of months though, she called me, and she's been in touch ever since. In fact, she's nicer to me than when we were working together. She's opened up so much, which is surprising since she's a shy person and super difficult to talk to. This continues till today. It's like I didn't even know she had this side to her!

At the same time though I can tell that she feels literally no attraction towards me whatsoever, and that its 100% friendship. I am really happy that things worked out for her, but I can't seem to look at her as 'just' a friend. Or maybe I don't want to. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to play that role. I feel a bit shitty about this but that's what it is. 

My way of dealing with this is as follows. I don't actively engage in any conversation with her. Mostly work-related stuff and small talk. I will always be there if she needs any help from me - recently she was going through some anxiety issues and I helped her with that - but that's it. Nothing more. I don't want to be her best friend. Maybe it's my insecurity or something, but I don't want that at all.

I'm in my first year of university, and I can already say it feels like this thing is not for me. I chose it without making too much research on the matter and maybe a little bit in a hurry. Problem is, I didn't have one of those ""gap-years"" that I know are popular in America, and I didn't even have time to figure out what I want yet. I'm thinking to get through the first year, then freeze the studies and get a job. 

Also, while working, I would like to get better on the side of video editing, that being one thing I enjoy doing, and figure out if I can make something out of it.

I'm at that point when I don't really know what to do. If I do actually decide to stop with the uni, my parents would be dissapointed in me (they really want me to finish it), but at the same time I would honestly despise it and probably not do well alltogeher since it's not something I like.

He seemed nice enough but sometimes I’d get the feeling he was looking for more than just a penpal ( I could be wrong though). Anyway, once I got here he was very eager to meet me as soon as possible so I thought it’d be best to meet in person for the first time whilst my sister was still here. After she had left and I started uni here I started falling into old habits with my social anxiety to the point where I couldn’t leave my room. I was missing my classes, I didn’t make any friends as I was hardly at uni and I was putting on weight as I wasn’t active and to anxious to even go to the supermarket so I was just ordering takeout straight to my door. Anyway, it was difficult for me to explain something like this to a near enough stranger. I just ended up not replying to his messages to me rather than explain why I couldn’t meet up with him again. He eventually sent me quite a horrible message which I also ignored but I completely understand why’d he be upset of course. It’s been 4 months since we met face to face and I want to send him a message to just apologise for my rudeness without trying to justify it. I don’t want to really meet up with him gain as I think too much has gone on between us but I’d like him to know that he wasn’t the problem and that I’m deeply sorry for how I treated him.

823,"I met a girl at the beginning of high school, became best of friends, 5 years later when I entered university we started dating. 

After 4 years of dating, we kinda stopped having sex, I felt uncomfortable expressing myself sexually fully. I didn't understand why this was, after a while of thinking she knew something was wrong and I felt I needed to tell her something even though I was confused myself. 
I told her I don't think I was attracted to her anymore. She was devastated, It hurt her hard. But I didn't want to break up, I wanted to figure it out. We were and continue to be such a good couple. We never fight, when we do it's short temper and it's resolved quickly. We truly care about each other and have fun with each other and we have similar plans for our lives.

eventually we decided to go into an open relationship to allow us to explore our sexuality to understand what it is we look for in sex. At first it really helped me, it made me realize that I do find her attractive and the issue may have just been due to boring sex. and I felt like it was helping her. But I was wrong, nothing changed with her. For the next year she still had resentment and anger towards me for what I said.

She eventually told me recently that she doesn't know what it is to mean to be in a relationship if we don't have sex. She feels like we're just friends and doesn't think she wants to date me anymore. We agreed to try couples counseling. And I tried extra hard to do nice things for her and to help her and show her what it means to be a couple. But before we could even get our first couples session in, she broke it off yesterday. 

We still want to be friends and she keeps saying she doesn't want to lose me. And I don't want to lose her. We are so amazing together and she even told me Ive been the best boyfriend she could have asked for. 

Which is why this makes me so confused and upset and seeking what to do. I know I fucked up, I hurt her but I've done everything I can to help her. And I understand why she wants to break it off, because she hasn't been happy and can't find a way to let go and thinks the only way to be happy again is to break it off. It feels so wrong to me that we break up for something like this. We didn't lie to each other, we didn't try to deceive or purposely hurt each other. 

She agreed to go to 1 couples counseling session. She said shell do it for me, if it helps give me closure. I can't help but feel like there is hope, everything has been so good other than what I said that it can't possible be over. Am I just fooling myself? Should I just accept this and try to move on.

My brother told me he wasn’t speaking with her, because I asked him not to and so did our parents, but he lied. 
I was upset and confronted him. He told me he was dating her because he planned to break up with her, which would break her heart. This was to get back at her for how she was treating me. I didn’t understand how he could do that, but he told me that he didn’t feel guilty and he “didn’t think of her as human” while he was doing that to her. 
They broke up. She wasn’t upset, because it didn’t even last a day. I told him to break up with her, and he did that day. 
He told me he was done with her, but I saw that he’s been texting her still. 
I’m upset with him for lying to me, and I feel like I can’t face my “friend,” knowing what she’s doing behind my back. I don’t know if now he genuinely likes her now.

827,"Hey Reddit,

I have this problem with music. I love to hear music and I'm a very musical guy aswell, so I think I enjoy parts of songs other people don't enjoy that much. But the thing is I just can't find a type of music I specifically like and no song gets me catched for a long period of time.

So basically I choose my music not by genre but by liking. This fucks me up because as I said, usually songs don't catch me that long and by that I need to find songs I like very often, my playlists gets updated daily. But as I have no specific genre I like it's hard to find a new song to add to my playlist I really like every second day again.

I've tried a website which adds songs kinda equal to a song I like. This worked but after I've heard the playlist I didn't enjoy hearing it again.

Lately I've gotten into more alternative music and I started liking music from I See Stars, the song Murder Mitten was the first song in ages that I really heard for a full month without losing the enjoyment. I've tried other songs from the genre and they don't appeal to me at all. Even weirder a really mainstream chart song from Germany whose genre I usually don't hear at all got me really catched and I couldn't stop thinking of it. How can this be? Do I have a specific kind of judgement I don't know about that decides which music/sounds I like?

If anybody can help me with that or even has the same problem I'm looking forward to get some answers!

To start I think I should mention that I was heavily sheltered as a child resulting in me not given the opportunity to gain any social whatsoever and hating being in the outside world.

In recent years I have gotten better and I do have friends that i cherish dearly but it’s like I have this mental block that stops me from actually living and doing what I love to do.

I cherish people’s opinions far too much and most of my actions are based on if people would like it or not which I hate but can’t seem to get myself out of

835,"So, to cut a long story short, I’m getting annoyed at 2 of my friends who are in different situations but equally pissing me off... all 3 of us have been really close friends for the last 5 years and “good” friends totalling probably 10-12 years between us, but as we’ve got older we moved away from our larger group of friends, (as most people do) and we became a closer 3.
However, over the last year or so a lot has changed and I’m becoming increasingly annoyed with them both.

Friend A: he recently got engaged to a bit of a turd person, of whom the other friend (friend B well cover shorty...) and his partner think is a turd person too, she’s an egotistical, narcissistic kind of turd. He absolutely prioritises her over EVERYTHING - to the extent that we can’t even organise anything with him months down the line if its on a weekend because that’s their time. EVEN IF HE DOESNT ACTUALLY HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED WITH HER!
He only ever asks to do anything with us if she’s made plans for herself, leaving him free - pathetic? He does make an effort on occasions to organise socials, but we haven’t always made a great effort because we don’t want to spend time with her - ideally just him, but he’s always trying to do group things.

Friend B: The most frustrating, never has been massive on organising things, usually is the person that RSVPs - which might sound insecure - but I have wondered previously if myself and friend A didn’t organise anything, would he ever make the effort? It’s become increasingly difficult to make plans with him over recent times, now to the point where I’ve asked 2-3 times about specific plans/ideas and he’s not even getting back to me anymore - just letting my plans float past him. Numerous times I’ve said to myself “I’m not bothering again” but always end up doing because I’m not into grudges, life’s too short for all that... but I may have gotten to the end of my tether now.
I get he doesn’t want to go out for meals and drinking because he has just had a baby who’s now 7 months old, not that recent... I appreciate his life is hectic and this is a very stressful time, my girlfriend and me have a 14 month old ourselves - so we get it, it’s hard work!
But on the flip side - this is annoying as we have very similar situations now, new dads, new adventures maybe?? so we should actually have more opportunity to do things together like coffee and playdates. Or even just relaxing away from the bars, just “lads” time playing video games and pizza. Nope.

What has set me off tonight is: friend A has asked if next week I could make it to his birthday night meal and drinks (annoying in itself because he STILL doesn’t understand the logistics of us needing time to organise child minders/book time off work for things?) - friend B and his partner are going and not only does it feel like we’ve been invited last, but friend B gave strong impressions he didn’t want to sacrifice sleep and relaxation time going out drinking recently. So this has tipped me over the edge that they’re both going!

We were supposed to be getting together next Sunday - the day after friend A and B are going for this meal/drinks, I have a sneaking suspicion they’re going to forget about it completely and I’m going to say something a little unsavoury that will put the nail in the coffin.
I’m very sure they’ve no idea how pissed off I am.

838,"So to give context and set the scene...Met a guy at a fair 15 years ago, there was a spark, kept in contact through MSN (LOL) and speaking on the phone pretty regularly for years, he was like my internet bestie who I was pretty much in love with but we never saw each other. I remember one day finding out my school was playing his school at football and he was in the team, i waited after school for hours, did my hair make up just for one glimpse of him in real life, all I got was 'oh hey Blu' and he walked past me with his friends. Eventually he goes in the airforce, we'd still communicate regularly(Facebook was around at this point) and speak on the phone. All my relationships had sort of failed to compare at that point. Whenever I heard he was on leave, I'd drop my plans to meet him, again I remember going to a bar by myself to meet him, just for him to ignore me all night. (I was young and in love is my excuse for the desperateness...) 
One time, we went on a night out together and he stayed at mine, little things happened and I confessed my feelings after and he said he didn't know how he felt about me. Next day, he refused my offer of a lift and walked like 15miles home instead because 'he had to think'...I thought right this is it....Nope. I got into another shitty relationship and we sort of had a break then for a few months. Flash forward to ending of that relationship, went out with some friends, ran into him, invite him back to mine for a 'catch up' and he says his friend has to come. Long story short, him and his friend tried to get me to have a threesome so that was great...at that point, my obsession understandably started to wane. 
Now around age 21 and out of a toxic relationship, I decide to move to Australia for a change and end up staying for 3years (amazing time, lots of memories), spoke to him maybe once or twice, he was in a long term relationship for most of this time.
A few weeks after returning home, I'm swiping on Tinder when who should come up but good old him. Of course, I swipe right, send him a wtf are you doing on here message and just like that we are back in our old rountie of now whatsapping 24/7 as besties, giving each other dating advise etc. One night, I get a call and he's crying, like proper bawling as some girl broke his heart and asks me to pick him up as he doesn't want to go home and I just fall back into old routine and go straight to him pick him up and bring him to mine, we talk all night, have a cuddle but when he tried to take it further said I cant do it if it's going to be a one night thing, if he wanted to make something more of it, I would try but not if he was going to use me. So nothing happened, next day he got a taxi and that was it. So we spoke less and less until it had been a couple of years...And then, last year who do I get a text from saying he'd been thinking about me(fyi he is now in a relationship with the one who made him cry and living with his mrs) and it involved me injuring him in the penis (who texts someone that?!) And we end up falling into a conversation as before but this time, he now tells me he really liked me all along, treated me like shit because of that and didn't know how to handle his feelings and wishes he could go back in time and do things completely different and that he was sorry for everything, I pointed out he was drunk, he admitted it but said he would still feel the same in the morning. I told him it is what it is and he agreed but wished it wasn't. 
The 13 year old me is just cheering with joy as he's finally admitted having feelings for me all along.
The 28 year old me is just smug af right now. 
Now fast forward 6months, we've been texting on and off quite abit and it's made me realise I have missed him as we were so close for so long and my fiancee works away 60% of time and we dont really have that banterous relationship I do with the other but I think I'm developing feelings and I'm not sure what to do about it as I dont want to cut him out again but I also dont want to hurt my fiance. Just sort of want some outside people to tell me if I'm being an idiot

842,"TL:DR at the bottom.

So lately, I've been going through a lot lately. I have a crush on my best friend, (and have had for the last 5-6 months), and she recently got into a relationship. No one's ever had a crush on me (I'm in my freshman year of high school), and all my friends are getting into relationship or getting dates to the dance (which is in.. ah... two hours). Unsurprisingly, I don't have a date and that's been making me think that I'm an unloveable person or that I'm one of those people who are always single but give the best advice and are better off as friends other than significant others and that hurts me immensely to think about. I'm also short-ish (5'7"") and having no one ever have a crush on me just makes me feel like shit. I'm not attractive either, but everyone seems to fall for other people and hearing about them makes me jealous but I know it's right to give them the right advice and not sway my advice based on my own biases/opinions. For instance, the hardest thing I had to do this year was convincing one of my other friends to ask my best friend to a date (the same best friend who I currently have a crush on and previously denied me). They got together and I couldn't help but feel super jealous and tired of feeling this way for months on end. People don't usually try to get to know me because I give off a weird kid vibe or a quiet vibe when I don't try to. The only reason my best friend and I started talking was because we did the same fall sport and we have several classes together. I want to get closer to the other people in my grade as well, but I don't know how to go about it since a lot of people have their own friend groups and don't stray away from them often. I hate that I gave a shitty first impression and I just don't like where I am right now. 

TL:DR: I don't like how I'm unattractive and not in a relationship and I want to talk to more people.",25Jan2020,1
843,"I am wondering if there's a reason for it and if I can do something to fix it because it's affecting my relationships.

It feels like someone talking for a longer period of time stresses me out a lot basically. My heart rate goes up too.

I'll use my best friend as an example. When we're talking to each other, and she gets really excited about a subject and talks 10,15, 20 minutes about something I not only zone out but also get restless, as if I have to move, change how I'm sitting, get up etc. I literally can't understand what she's saying anymore. I look at her and see her talk but unless I concentrate very hard on every word, I don't understand the meaning of it. I can focus a bit more when I move around then. It's a  really weird feeling. I'm not bored with what she's saying.

If the conversation is mostly equally weighted - as in, both me and the other person talk an equal-ish amount of time, or even if I get a chance to speak every few minutes - focusing is much easier and I don't get as stressed out.

This happens with almost everyone I know. It's the worst with my boyfriend because he changes subjects lightning-fast sometimes and it physically makes me dizzy. Like, the room starts actually spinning on top of me being stressed out.

I don't understand why this keeps happening. I'm not bored at all by what's being said, and  I desperately want to listen/understand but I just can't do it ...

Does anyone know why this happens and how I can fix it?",25Jan2020,1

I believe that I have had this problems since my childhood and teenage years and this hasn't gotten better for me since. I don't know what is causing me to have poor listening skills. I think it's because I'm getting too comfortable of what I am doing and my for my internal mood not wanting to change my own thoughts in situations I am in. I can be told to do something about 7 and 8 times repeated from someone and still cannot do it right after being told so many times. I know most people my age already do something right after 1 to 2 times after being repeated to do something or a task. Background information about me, I am 20 years old female with Autism and ADHD. I believe that my problem with not being able to properly listen is impacting me while I am working, with family, and with school too. I am a patient person and do not get frustrated easily. I do keep a positive attitude in the environments I am in but I am so worried now that my poor listening skills is going to be a hinderance for me to succeed in the real working world in the future. I don't burst out that easily either and good with keeping my unpleasant moods to myself. I wonder if any of you guys have had problems with what I am facing with listening. It's most of verbal stuff that I do not listen to and sometimes, I have to ask people about 2 to 3 times to repeat something for me and then they keep getting frustrated that I keep asking them to and get upset at me. I am trying to figure out what really is wrong with me and how I can fix and improve my listening skills. I feel like I am listening passively most of the time which is why all these problems are occurring to me. People constantly tell me that, ""You have to listen"" and I admit that I am doing it all the time by re-asking what they are saying if I do not get it on the first try. Sometimes, I did not fully hear what people are trying to say because they have accents or do not clearly try to phrase things to me. I do politely ask people to repeat things to me, but it becomes a problem when I ask too many times. I just need help at this moment because this is the biggest problem I am experiencing in life right now. What can poor listening skills from me lead to in the future for me as a person? Would poor listening skills limit the opportunities I have than people who are excellent at listening? People keep telling me that I do not listening and I just cannot fully understand it myself honestly. I just need realistic advice from people that truly are understand what I am going through right now and can relate towards my experiences. I am not here to rant or anything like that.

I have been fostering for a while. I have this kid, let's call him Jake, who has been trough a lot, he has made some horrible mistakes in the past which have led him to juvenile facilities several times and now foster care. He is only 15 years old.

He is really nice, really sweet, but he is having a hard time, he can not forgive himself for what he has done in the past and most part of society may never forgive him as well.

He gets horribly nervous when he does something wrong, he is always trying to be a good person. He has anxiety and PTSD.

He hates himself and thinks he is undeserving of love. 

He is in therapy, 4 days a week, but it does not really seem to help.

I tell him that I love him, because I do, but I can not comfort him properly because some of the things he has done are almost unforgivable and I can't lie about that.

He has been self-harming for ages now, long before I met him, we are working on that.

Recently I found some written papers in one of his school notebooks. I couldn't help reading it. He talked about how he would love to be another person for only a day and how much he wants to die and disappear.

855,"I'm not sure if it's because of some underlying disorder or trauma I have, but I have never been able to benefit from venting and so I've always denied, repressed, and compartmentalized things that hurt until it explodes and I spend about a week unable to leave my bed, crying, not eating, and struggling with suicidal ideation. 

But here's the shitty part—if I try to vent and talk about it before it boils over, I still wind up doing that.

I try journaling to release the pressure and even try to analyze my problems, but all it does is shine a light on elements of my reality that I cannot change (a lot of it has to do with other people around me or external circumstances weighing on me that I can't easily control or fight back against—it's not to say that I don't fight back. I do. But it's like paying off a credit card debt at 80$/mo when you rack up 60-70$/mo in interest. The debt is, metaphorically, my external problem and the interest are all the other elements of my life that either cannot go away or are constantly being resurrected in my life by people around me.

I know that healing is a long process that can take years in some people—I don't expect to be healed of my problems instantly.

However, I've noted a pattern that no matter what, venting leads to what I can only imagine is an inappropriate response. Being able to talk about it with someone who cares shouldn't trigger an emotional blackout that leaves me inconsolable for days at a time. It shouldn't be the same consequence whether I vent it out now, in a safe place, or vent it later, alone, after repressing it too long. The consequence is the same and nothing feels healed. In fact, I feel I only wind up alienating myself from those who care about me even further.

The only ""hint"" at what's going on that I can think of comes from a counselor I saw when I was fifteen or so, who said something like... people have a ""box"" that they store their emotions/memories/stresses in and they're able to close that box and lock it when necessary. They're able to open it, empty it, and close it again. But he told me that my box is broken and when it opens, I can't shut it. I can't remember what further discussion we had about it because due to life problems at the time, my counseling sessions were cut short. Elsewhere, I heard a similar notion connected to the suggestion that being unable to close that box has to do with severe childhood trauma (which I do have.)

Can anyone maybe suggest what someone should try to do to mitigate the blast radius when working through their problems when they have a ""broken box"" like this? For what it's worth, if it relates to this, I do have confirmed ADHD (inattentive) and depression/anxiety disorders. Both I've had basically as far back as I can remember (like I said, I had a very traumatic early childhood, maybe even infancy. My mother was incredibly violent and my dad wasn't as present as he could have been. Literally up to my eyes in childhood trauma.)

&amp;#x200B;

**And disclaimer**—yes, I do plan on enrolling with an actual counselor and no, I am not seeking advice to be used in place of actual medical advice. I'm simply asking if anyone else knows what this sort of situation looks like either from anecdotal experience or study in the psychology field. Any and all answers are maximum appreciated.",25Jan2020,1

Was hoping to get some advice about a weird situation. 
I live with 2 roommates, I’m a 24(f) living with a 23(f) and a 27(m) 
Recently our male roommate has been on coke, adderall, and zanex for days at a time 
When we all moved in together, we were all under the impression that drugs weren’t a part of any of our lives. 
He’s increasingly gotten lazier, forgets to lock our front door, and is constantly taking our food without asking 
Also, he has some really sketchy characters as friends and I’m not exactly comfortable with his dealer or his using friends knowing where we live. I think I’m not overreacting. 
I don’t know if we can just kick him out since we are on a lease or who to contact about it 
I did try to reach out to him that he’s not what we imagined as a roommate. When we met, he seemed so motivated and hard working, but it was kind of just a front.

# (On a throwaway)

Okay, this is gonna be pretty long and complicated but I'll do my best.

So I'm in a relationship with this amazing guy, we've been dating for about a year and a half. He's really really cute, funny, tall. You know, he's got it all. We click, and I feel comfy around him. We've been through a lot together and I've had some of my happiest times with him. We keep talking about our life together, marriage, kids, all that.

But something is off. As much as I care for him and enjoy his company, I keep thinking about ending the relationship. I have no good reason to do so as he's everything I've ever wanted in a partner and more. But I don't think I want to settle down yet. I'm in college, and as selfish and mean as it sounds, I don't want to be tied down. I don't think I'm ready for the commitment he needs. But I do not know why I'm not. If he's perfect, why cant I just be happy? But I don't think I could bear making him so sad/upset by breaking up. He doesn't really have many friends, and I'm his main support system. I don't want to just pull the rug out from under his feet like that. He's so kind and trusts and loves me so much. He doesn't deserve to be hurt like this. But I'm not completely happy in the relationship and I think he might know it.

They make sure all my technology is away from us before the physical abuse begins so i can not document any of it in any way. 

They have burned me, choked me, hit me, kicked me and more. You are probably thinking, just call the police, well I did once and told them what has been happening over the phone with the abuse and mistreatment. about 10 minutes later 4-6 cops came to my house, checked me for marks and bruises where there were none because my parents tend to try and not leave any. The police left after my parents told them that i was being a typical teenage girl and overreacting and they would never do such a thing. I have told friends and more importantly my school counselor, principle, and teachers. The school ended up calling my parents who of course denied it, and in the end i ended up getting recommended a psychiatrist.

870,"So for school we’re doing something called the Student vs Staff challenge and me and a couple really close friends got together for it.

Friend 1 (who we’ll call Kirt) started harassing friend 2 (who we’ll call John) while me and my other friend (we’ll call her Kita) watched. I warned Kirt multiple times that if he kept insulting John then he would be kicked but he wouldn’t listen. I finally made a group chat with just me, Kita, and John and told them not to tell Kirt. I named the chat: “Sane Ones” because Kirt was acting insane at the time. This was a BIG mistake. John got mad (even though I made the group chat for him because Kirt kept calling him names like “punk” and “the kid that will shoot up our school”). He started calling me toxic and I started crying during the entire thing and kept typing stuff like “what’s wrong with me” and other gems like “I want to fall into a pit and die” while he was yelling at me in full caps. I understand I am a terrible person and this is what I get so no need to bring this up in the comments.

I told John I was very sorry and I asked him to forgive me and he hasn’t replied in an hour. I need help. Can someone please give me advice?",25Jan2020,1
