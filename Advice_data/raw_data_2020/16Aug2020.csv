2,"Amongst my friends, family, acquaintances and everyone I know I am looked down upon.
No one respects me, when I speak everyone just acts like I never said anything, when I ask to play or hangout I am declined, everyone leaves me out of activities, I am not valued, I am looked down upon and it’s depressing and sad,

It is difficult for me to explain but I have had enough, I am sick of being available, I am done with pleasing everyone, seeking there validation, pleasing them only to gain what? Nothing,

I need to stand up for myself, love myself, Value myself and not be this little boy that everyone sees me as. 

I plan on just not taking anyone’s bullshit anymore, I’m not going to ask them to hang out, I’m not going to joke around all the time, I’m not going to be free with them, I’m just going to cancel them out. 

I want to be more professional, I want to be more mature but the way I’m treated by others around me I’ve always been stuck in this little boy personality and image, any advice?",16Aug2020,1
3,"My parents don't get along well these days. They just can't talk to each other peacefully, and they are always fighting about things, from finances to my grades to their parents. It's really frustrating to hear them fight, and they just seem to have anger issues or they just can't stand each other. I understand that my parents disagree on things and want things to go their own way, but I don't see why they can't peacefully negotiate things.

The other thing is that they constantly find fault with each other. My mom sometimes forgets to do the laundry at night or forgets to pick up something at the grocery store every once in a while. I think it's forgivable and easily remedied, but my dad makes a big deal out of these things. He calls her inconsiderate. My mom normally just goes down and does the laundry or go to the store if my dad insists that she does it immediately. But he is still furious about it. He probably is a perfectionist or something.

The other thing is that my dad annoys my mom non-stop. When they are doing the taxes or something, my mom is usually doing all the work, while my dad just slouches by, not helping at all, while he drinks chocolate milk straight out of the carton and rips nasty burps and stinky farts. Then at night, my dad sings super loud in bed, and my dad sometimes has to smack him in the face with a pillow. That still doesn't stop him, and he sings even louder, and I can't even sleep because of it. He sings off-pitch. Every single morning, I hear my mom lecture my dad for his annoying habits, and he just says that he is stressed out and needs a break every single time as his excuse.

The worst part about it is that my dad has disgusting habits. For example, we'd be waiting in a restaurant or something, and my dad just sticks his hands down his pants. Every stares at him angrily, and he isn't even aware, and he continues doing it. My mom first asks him to stop being vulgar, but he ignores her. Then she literally grabs his wrist and pulls it out his pants, but he just slaps her hand and then puts his hand back down his pants. Another weird thing my dad does is spend too much time in the shower. He spends around 30 minutes in there, and he toots about a hundred farts each time he's in there. I don't even know what he eats that makes him so gassy. And then he also throws his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor and leaves the shower head on when he comes out.",16Aug2020,1
4,"I’ve been with my current boyfriend going on 4 years and this year during quarantine I met a guy through here when I was feeling a bit lonely and it felt like an instant connection. We’ve continued talking for the last 5 months and the more we talk the more I feel drawn to him, I love my boyfriend dearly but I feel horrible for having these feelings for another guy, I keep telling myself to suppress the feelings to just continue the friendship but at times we just connect like I’ve always dreamt of connecting with someone if that makes sense. I don’t know I feel lost. Any advice would be appreciate or anyone that felt something similar before.",16Aug2020,1
5,"I (then 18f) was sexually assaulted by my then boyfriend (then 19m) 4.5 years ago. I will spare you the dirty details, but I will tell you that we had agreed to keep our clothes on before the assault happened, but he went underneath of mine twice. The first time, I told him to stop and asked him why he did that. He told me that it was an accident and said that it wouldn’t happen again. I, being naive, believed him, but he did it again the same day. When I confronted him, he started crying and begged for me to forgive him and told me that he loved me. I was extremely angry and upset, but I didn’t have a label for what happened. I had never been in a relationship, sexual or otherwise, so I again believed him. I continued to date him for another six months.

Two years later, I learned a lot more about sexual assault, and that is when I recognized that what happened to me as an assault. I decided, 4.5 years after the assault, that I don’t want to press charges against him, but since I am a writer, I want to write an article about what happened to me (no details, just in general what happened). iI have yet to decide whether or not I want to include his first name in the article. 

Here’s where I need the advice: I told my family for the first time about the sexual assault this week. They were shocked and agreed that what he did was wrong, but they do not think that I should write an article about it. They said that writing about this subject might keep me from getting a job in the future and that it might start legal trouble. My sister said that I need to unfriend all of her boyfriend’s family on Facebook if I’m going to share the article to my Facebook account because she doesn’t want them to know. I don’t want this to be a dirty little secret anymore, but I also don’t want backlash from my family. Please help. What should I do?",16Aug2020,1
6,"I don't know if this is more of an r/OffMyChest or what. But this is something I struggle with every day, and I'm just not sure what to do about it.

So I'm a software developer, I work from home, I make just under $100k/yr. My girlfriend (of 5 years) makes probably around $60k/yr. I would consider our combined income to be pretty good by most standards.

I would say we're relatively good about finances, were careful with our spending. We don't splurge on ridiculous things, we drive dependable and practical cars, etc.

I've been saving as much as I possibly can to buy a house some day... But after years of saving, I ""only"" have $60k saved up... Which is not a small amount of money by any means... But when it comes to down payments on houses in California... That's just the tip of the iceberg it seems. Not to mention all the other costs that go along with owning a home, and moving in, and furnishing, etc.

Houses in California keep going up more and more in price... And for someone my age, it's going to be years before I save up enough to have an affordable mortgage... My girlfriend keeps suggesting that we should move to another state, and she shows me houses on Zillow in states like Montana, etc... And for half the price of a California house... You get twice the square footage, 5 times the land, and it's a beautiful house. I would consider some of these to be my dream home... And they're within an affordable range for us.

The problem is, my entire family lives in southern California. My parents are getting older... Approaching their 70s. And I would miss being close to them and my siblings/their family. Prior to meeting my girlfriend, I spent a TON of time with my family, every weekend I slept at my brother's house and hung out with my nieces and nephews and stuff. But once I was in a committed long term relationship, I don't really do that anymore. I still see them from time to time... But it's probably around 5-6 times a year... As opposed to every weekend before.

So because of that, my girlfriend always rebuttals my excuse about not wanting to leave my family in California by pointing out how I rarely ever see them. She doesn't do it in a mean way, because she's just pointing out the truth.

Also... Her family lives in California as well, but we don't see them very often because they live in central California area. But she doesn't seem to be bothered about the idea of moving to another state.

I guess I just don't know if my reason for not wanting to leave is selfish. Or if I should be more open to the idea of moving.

It just drives me crazy that two people making a combined $160k/yr have to even consider the thought of moving to another state just to buy a house that isn't 700sqft 1bed 1ba 1 car garage for $600k lol.",16Aug2020,1
8,"I don’t really know how to go about this.

This person is someone I use to date for a short time, we didn’t last due to a few reasons that took her a few weeks to finally come clean about. Due to her not being transparent about everything when she first ended things, it left a bitter taste in my mouth.

 I also never said how I truly felt and was very honest after we last spoke to each other

This wasn’t something I think she liked to hear, that she wasn’t all this and that, was said in a nice way but no one wants to hear it I guess.

Few weeks go by and I apologise, this is around the start of lockdown here in the UK.

She appreciates it and we try friends, as well she was working on a project with me during lockdown so I had to make sure we were on good terms so it wasn’t a ball ache to work together.

After the project was done I blocked her on Instagram and Facebook. This was

 A) because I felt disrespect a couple times after the apology, small things but I see that as something that can grow bigger 

B) it would be an “out of mind” type mentality, was already not watching her stories but felt I was going out my way and doing half measures (Mike taught me to never do a half measure)

C) she moved back home where lockdown was no longer happening and she is a very attractive, personable and flirty girl, who is bi, so I didn’t want to be in lockdown seeing her get with people or have that in my mind

D) she need to earn my friendship and I don’t like to be taken for granted or feel like there in an imbalance of giving/receiving affection

However reconnecting with a uni friend of mine that’s also friends with her, she mentioned briefly “u know so and so knows u blocked her, she genuinely wanted to be friends you know” this made me feel off and I don’t like grudges.

I feel my stubbornness has gotten in the way and now I feel so happy single and just grown over lockdown, this feels petty and want to reconnect, but my question is how and also if she will want to reconnect?

Thank you to anyone that reads or responds :)",16Aug2020,1
9,"I’m 19 and in college. When I started my second semester of college in January I remember not being as happy as I was during the first semester. Since then everything has gone downhill.

I don’t care about anything anymore. I’ve lost motivation for doing homework. I feel like I’m too dumb for the major. I used to love baking and reading and don’t even do that anymore. Everything is a chore for me. I can’t concentrate on my homework for more than 10mins and end up letting everything pile up to the last minute and rush to finish it.

I used to love going to work, but it hurts every minute is struggle. I feel like every bit of my soul is being pulled  away every second in there. Being around people is draining to me.

I hate everything I once loved. I just want to stay in bed a listen to music and waste away.

Throwaway because my friends know my main.

So i don’t know what to do anymore. My adoptive mom wants to talk to my therapist and control what i can say to them and when i can talk to them. She wants to be in control of what she feels is worthy of talking about to my therapist. She blames me for being depressed and that i don’t know how bad depression really is and says she has had real depression. She says i’m disrespectful when i don’t feel like waking up because i feel like there’s no point, or when i don’t shower. She will constantly say how i have it so easy and that i can’t be depressed and that i’m just making it up. She will smack me with a open palm when she thinks i’ve been disrespectful or that i’m being rebellious. I have a dog and he’s the first thing i’ve grown attached to in years. Everyone in my household wants to get rid of him because they don’t want him. I’m the only one who takes care of him, i feed him, take him on walks, the only person who will even take him outside to use the bathroom. and because i’m the only one who takes him out. If i’m not paying 100% attention to him when he’s at the door to go out he will go and poop in the basement. I have to clean it up. My older step brother will just let him poop inside and doesn’t care if he sees that he needs to go. i bring that up because i will put him up for bed when i go to sleep he will get him out and have him out but does nothing to feed or just take care of him. My mom says when i was raped that it’s my fault and that because i was drunk i was okay with it. they wouldn’t press charges and just told me to suck it up basically. i’ve tried to kill my self twice since that happened. She thinks i tried to kill my self for attention and the reason i cut is because i’m trying to get back at her. They blame me for not being able to retire when they closed to adopt me when i was 3 when they were in there early 50s. if they see me crud they tell me to man up and that i have no reason to cry. My dad try’s to tell me i can’t get upset with my mom because of how much she works and that i should just forgive her for everything she has done or will do to me. They say if i go to the school and say anything that i’m a horrible person because they try there best. They will call me fat and say i need to lose weight while they will not cook home food and if i don’t want fast food i’m just going to go hungry for the night. 

There’s so much more but i could only get this done before i can get out of the shower and i will answer any questions as soon as i’m alone.",16Aug2020,1
12,"My partner and I have long been good friends, and I always knew their single father to be unreasonable. Partner lives with their father for various reasons, almost all of which are to benefit the father. I knew the father had ignored my partner’s coming out as trans and still misgenders them to this day, I knew the father was rude and insulting to my partner, and I knew he was demanding. He has repeatedly sent my partner out to run errands during the pandemic, and made it blatantly clear his only concern is for his own health. (I recognize the flawed logic considering they live together, the father does not.) More recently, I learned he still tries to ground my partner.

Since my partner and I started dating, my partner’s first very serious relationship and my second, things have escalated. The father will only acknowledge that we are romantically involved if we make a strong point of bringing it up. He puts in a lot of effort to keep us apart, and it doesn’t seem to be homophobia - since I’m female and my partner is dfab. 

No, he’s said he doesn’t think I should come before him in my partner’s life, and is clearly upset whenever my partner spends time at my place or I spend time there. He even criticizes my partner for talking on the phone to me. He has said he enjoys my company when I listen to him talk, so it seems he just wants the attention - on both my partner’s part and my part - to be on him. If we are together (or apart and it’s just my partner) and not entirely focused on him, he gets upset.

Please keep in mind that we (me and my partner) are in our very late 20s and early 30s, respectively. 

Is this normal? How do I cope? I love my partner. They are caring, attentive, respectful, and just a delight. Breaking up is not an option. But I feel we are both emotionally at risk when their father is involved.",16Aug2020,1
13,"I have a 16 year old cat who I adopted almost 5 years ago, with the idea that he would have a peaceful place to live out the rest of his life. Unfortunately it hasn’t exactly turned out that way, as I have a younger sister who simply cannot leave him alone (she’s 14). 

She barely leaves him alone when he is sleeping, and she will even go as far as to search the house when she cannot find him. He often will find a hidden spot from her, but he is usually found. Even when he is sleeping in other peoples rooms she will take him away. I worry that this could be hurting him. Even when he has been sick in the middle of the night she will wake up to simply try and pet him and get in his face. She will even use large amounts of treats to lure him to her, even though he tries to stay away from her. 

As well as her horrible attitude towards him, she is incredibly rough with him, often picking him up every time he enters a room, and dropping him from heights after he wants to be let go. My parents have desperately tried to stop her from being so rough, but as they are out the house most the time she gets away with it. She will even get violent if she is t with the cat; and she has gone as far as spraining my arm twice by trying to get to him, as I tried to let my cat be alone. 

Unfortunately, she has become worse; and we have had to take my cat to the vet due to back problems and sprained  muscles, which we believe has come from her. 

I know my cat is old, and may not have many years left, but I simply want the best for him. Any advice would be very appreciated.",16Aug2020,1
14,"So the other day my[18m] dad [50ish] asked me to help him on his emails and stuff and I saw an email that he bought an iPhone 11 and it was to some woman on the other side of the US. I asked him who he got it for and he got nervous and didn’t say anything and I knew he was hiding something but I was too uncomfortable to confront him.

I opened his email on my computer later and did some research on the address he bought the phone to and no woman of that name lives there so I thought he’s being catfished. I also saw he ordered an Apple credit card (the new one that came out) and I think it might be related to the phone.

Long, terribly writen and worded summery. On mobile at night.

This has been one of my worst experience in my life. My grandfather has been suffering from cancer (brain tumors but I forgot what variant) for some time. We where expecting his death but not that soon. The doctors said he still had 3 more months. Basically while eating he chocked on the food and that led up to his heart stopping and eventually dieyig. At the time we where on holiday (The restrictions where getting lifted so no breaking quarantine) and soon as we heard of the news we started to drive home. While driving my dad (Grandfathers son) he started to feel bad. At the time it was ok but after we arrived home and got into bed his temperature increased. Next day he  went to the doctor and he said he probably has COVID (later his COVID test also came positive) and immediately started medication . Because of that I am quarantined also. My dad has been a gigantic mess. He is usually the strong family man who works hard and never goes down. But after these events he is broken man. Not going out of the bed and crying. I totally understand him and want to be with him but I can’t . My mother also got tested and her first test was negative but she started to show symptoms. So she is also isolated. I feel alone. Sure I have my friends I can call but it doesn’t feel the same and in the and I still feel like a garbage. My grandfather and I where very close ( I am the only grandchild) and use to spend every Friday together after school and now he is gone. Today I spend 4 hours to find a video of him talking( we have over 2000 pictures but no videos) and crying. That’s not healthy and I don’t know how to cope with the loss.

It started when i left on a vacation and was gone three weekends in a row, so I didn't see them for almost a month. They split into two almost and I have been ignored by each one. Recently most of them went on a trip up to someones condo and left me without an invite. Today the ones that stayed back all went on a trip together as well. Neither group told me about anything and they are inviting new people to go instead of me, and I have been here with them for almost a year.

The first time my boyfriend opened the breaker box to fix the issue, but the second time when I opened the box I saw the **""arc fault"" light lit up** under the switch for the living room lights. I put in a maintenance request on 08/13 since I know faulting can cause fires, and some quick googling of the issue made it seem like a pretty serious hazard.

My complex is only handling ""urgent"" maintenance issues which includes electrical hazards, but I figured they should want to take care of this since I potentially could burn down the whole complex if I kept trying to turn on these lights. Well I checked my maintenance request submission today and it says it was ""completed"" yesterday (08/14). I was in my apartment all of yesterday and no one entered.

Like I said, my brother has been through some pretty horrible things and it’s really screwed up his mental health. Being said, he’s a literal teenager and is still too afraid to stay home by himself while everyone is at work (everyone but him - he’s not old enough to work just yet) for even two hours. Like, have a full on panic attack scared. Meaning I’m recently 18 and wanting to work mornings only and do school in the day so I have evenings and nights to do whatever, but I can’t because he’s absolutely terrified to be alone. My work and my aunts work are both 10 minutes away and both of our neighbors see my family as their family and he knows this. There’s times I need to leave and go to Walmart but he throws a fit about being pulled off his PlayStation but refuses to stay home, so I’m essentially stuck babysitting 24/7 because he refuses to stay home alone for even five minutes (our grandpa lives 5 minutes away, and he won’t even stay home 15 minutes by himself when my aunt and I have to go there). Not to mention, when my aunt and uncle get into arguments (not bad ones, typical married couple arguments) he absolutely FLIPS. Pulls himself into a panic attack and cries - when my aunt and uncle do all they can to keep it away from me and him, but he stands and listens and that’s when his anxiety gets out of whack. It’s difficult because we just lost our mom and older brother within 10months of e/o and our dad hasn’t been involved in his life so I don’t know if those could be factors, though he’s been like this for AGES. since he walk and talk basically. I’m at a loss and even though we do everything to reassure everything is okay, he just panics so badly and I honestly just want to have a life of my own where I don’t tell my friends my teenage brother is too afraid to stay alone while we go out for dinner and a movie, or having my job and school suffer because of this.",16Aug2020,1

37,"My daughter just turned four and is now making up stories about her Dad that she has never met. When I was pregnant, I found out he was an addict and ever since he has spiralled out of control even more. Full-blown into crack, meth and pills.   
I am a parent that plans for the long-term...so, I do not lie to her and we talk about her Dad all of the time. I try and keep it age-appropriate such as he has made some silly decisions, he's sick and all that. I obviously am not going to tell her that her Dad is a crack head but she is very intelligent and asks what he's sick of and if he has a cold, flu or virus (which is why silly decisions came into play). I also tell her we can talk about it whenever she wants, I show her pictures of him holding her the day she was born and we talk about what he was like for as long as she keeps the conversation going.   
She definitely is sad about the situation, but I continue to tell her it is not her fault...and that I am sad too but, she has the skills to get through this and I am here to support her.   
However, lately, she reallllllly has been making up stories about him. Like that he's not around because he has the coronavirus and things they have done together. Or just things he's involved in.   
I mean, I am not going to lie to my child.... I tell him he was not there, or that is not the case. Sometimes, it really feels like I am crushing her soul (over it quickly and forgets). I am not sure what else to more to tell her or why she's making up these simple, silly stories....  
I know I/she needs to talk to a professional... but I am not in a financial position to do so. I just do not know if I am telling her not enough, or too much, or what steps to take next. She really is so smart...and I am terrified in answering her in a damaging way. Any advice on how to deal with this?",16Aug2020,1
38,"For the past two weeks all I can think about is love. Just innocent love. Having someone there to be with. I’ve never been in a relationship and don’t have any friends, and I feel like I have all this love to give but no one to give it to.

Before anyone says I should love myself and all that — I do. I just feel like I’m at this point in my life where I’m ready to fall in love and be with someone. I want to share experiences with someone as opposed to going through them alone and just be there to understand and support them through their life.

I used to reject the idea of being a housewife but lately I find myself cooking meals for myself alone in the kitchen, wishing there would be someone sitting at the dinner table to share them with, or when I wake up in the morning and there’s no one there to be with but myself in the mirror, I’d wish I had someone to share my morning with.

So, this girl and I have been dating about 2 months, talking about four (again... I know it's quick for me to be like this...), I definitely have strong feelings for her, but I feel that bleeds into a bit of unhealthy obsession. For example, she's currently on a mini-vacation with some family friends so we aren't talking too much since she's busy. However, she still uses Facebook and Insta a good bit while not texting me back for hours, which is obviously no big deal. But in those moments I get weirdly obsessive and feel like she isn't texting me back because she doesn't want to talk to me. Since she started this vacation I find myself checking her ""last active"" on Insta and FB, checking the likes on her Twitter page to see if she's liking tweets while not texting me back, stuff like that. If she does use these things without texting me back, I get really upset and depressed. I never take it out on her, I just kind of hold it in. It's all out of paranoia and insecurity but I hate it, and I don't want to be this way.

I also never want to hold it in to the point I get mad and blow up at her over something that is objectively no big deal. I feel weirdly empty when we aren't talking, and it's hard for me to focus on literally anything else. I'm not nearly as busy as she is, and she's very independent so she can handle her own stuff and then me on top of it all. However, I feel I'm very dependent on her and when we don't talk a lot I'm too distracted thinking about her to work much, to watch TV, to play games. I don't want to ruin this relationship being like this, but I don't know what to do. I practically never double text or anything like that, unless it's really important. My obsession is mostly focused in my own head and it hasn't really transferred into how I treat her.

Please, I could really use some advice on how to stop acting like this. I don't want to be obsessive, I want to have a healthy relationship and be the kind of boyfriend she deserves to have; I want her to be able to have her own life and things to do without feeling like she has to talk to me 24/7. I just don't know what to do to get past this and it's really putting a strain on my mental and emotional state.

TL;DR: I feel obsessed with my girlfriend and feel really bad when she is busy. I check on her socials to see her activity, and I hate it. How do I get better and less obsessive?",16Aug2020,1

Being in my parent's house this long (because of COVID) has been mentally exhausting. I am very particular about my room and get severe anxiety attacks when it is clear someone has come in my room, but that doesn't stop them. My parents use politically incorrect language that offends me. I am extremely liberal and no one else in my family is. They try to antagonize me about it. They expect me to drop plans last minute to help out, but get pissed the second I don't get something done right away. I have a generalized anxiety disorder and disordered eating and they aren't very sensitive to those subjects either. I am in constant mental pain.

But they pay for everything almost and I do appreciate that. It just almost isn't worth it anymore. I am in between jobs because of COVID (I am hopefully getting a new one soon, I am waiting on one more phone call so fingers crossed) so I do not have money to move out. I at most have about 6 grand (maybe more in saving bonds) to my name. I don't know what to do.

I feel like I sound ungrateful. They are supporting me, I am not being physically abused or harmed, but I cannot take the constant ""my house my rules logic"". They would never kick me out or abandon me. I just literally cannot take it.

50,"I got expelled from my university recently for violating their sexual misconduct policy due to events from more than a year ago. I don't want to get into the details of it but I've used the toxic relationship that led to such tumult as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and grow far beyond the damaged and mentally ill individual I was at the time. I want to be honest, approachable, and good to others I meet in my future including significant others.

I'm attending a new school in the fall and inevitably when I tell them I'm a transfer and they ask why I transferred, I'm going to have an internal conflict. The best solution I've thought of thus far is to tell half-truths, such as that my previous school was an unhealthy environment for me and didn't allow me to thrive (actually true). However, it would be far more dodgy to say that I got expelled for sexual misconduct and I don't feel that this mistake in my past defines who I am today. Regardless, I want to be an honest individual and not hide from my past, so it really makes me wonder what the right way to approach this is. It is my right to decide what I should reveal from my personal life, but I also don't want to mislead. I feel that in an ideal world, I can share anything as long as I show how I've learned from it and shown consistent improvement and they would understand, but in reality such a revelation would scare most people away right off the bat. As of now, the way I see it is I would use the half-truth to start out with and then, if after months/years of knowing that person I trust them to know the truth of my past actions and how I dealt with it, I would sit them down and explain the full story.",16Aug2020,1

due to first going to different universities and then covid i haven’t seen them much at all this year, only a couple times to social distance. i’ve asked repeatedly over the past few weeks if anyone is free but have had no luck due to work, family obligations, being in diff cities etc. i didn’t hold this against them bc i totally understood but i think it was clear that i was sounding needy and desperate from my texts (i know it is not someone’s fault for not noticing signs of depression). this week things got so bad that i was considering suicide. i ended up in the hospital under an involuntary hold and was just released today. 
when i was hospitalized i told my friends because i just needed people to talk to outside of my family. my family is very supportive as well but i know my situation is traumatic for them.

53,"I 24F grew up in an ultra religious (98% my dad) family with 9 siblings. I moved out last year at the age of 23 and have since come to the realization that I was mistreated throughout my childhood. 

I became a 3rd parent to my younger siblings while my older sister managed my dad, my mom was always submissive to my dad and rarely went against what he said or commanded.

I was homeschooled and isolated from people he didn't agree with and dealt with deep personal issues like self-harm and wanting to die.

Right before I moved out I always agreed with what he said according to the Bible and his views on life which went from ""skydiving is a dangerous hobby"" to ""we have to convert everyone because they are all going to hell, especially the homosexuals and gays"". 

For years I went with it until I discovered I was bisexual.

Now that I'm an adult I realize now how messed up it was and am now bitter, not angry, against my father and want him to leave me alone; I feel very little for him.

I don't think I can ever give up my faith, but at the same time I don't know what to believe.

Last night I checked up to see where we are and she told me there are still things I do that makes her uncomfortable. When I asked what things, she just described a lot of casual stuff that I do. Like if someone says, “I watched this new show!” I would casually say, “Oh! Katheryn and I watched that. It’s good!”.

I feel absolutely gutted. I was already guilty about the fact that I hurt her, but now the fact that I’m still hurting her by just being alive and being her friend is so painful. I know I should give her some space and she is probably just frustrated, as our relationship has required some work, but I feel so terrible. I don’t know how to forgive myself if she hasn’t forgiven me.

I’ve been working so hard to turn myself around and make things better, but she told me she doesn’t know if we will be able to be as close as we once were.

TL;DR: I have a kickass high paying job, but  sexist dudes are holding me back and limiting my potential by refusing to follow my lead. Thinking about saying fuck it and taking an easier job for way less $$$. What do?

**Here is my dilemma.** I have a 6 figure job that could turn into a $300,000 job within 2 to 3  years - but I’m struggling to get male subordinates to follow my lead and treat me with baseline respect to the point I almost don’t want to go down this path anymore.

I’m feeling very burnt and frustrated, and I’m deliberating on just take an easier job for a steep pay cut so I don’t have to work with these people - moving back to the countryside, and having a simpler life. OR going balls to the wall and staying long enough to fund starting my own company (though I have a feeling I’d face some if the same challenges I face now). 

**More detail:**

I really do work my ass off, I’m an MBA, I do the jobs and make the decisions others don’t want to, my life is all about my work and as result I have helped my company grow about 10X over. I come from a family of high school dropouts and have hustled for a decade to get to this point. 

The company’s owners seem eternally grateful to me, and have *tripled* my salary in 4 years - I already know I’m about to get another huge raise - I used to feel like all of my efforts in life were finally blossoming. Furthermore, I like my job and am good at what I do - if it weren’t for sexism, I still wouldn’t know where my ceiling is.

Problem is, the company has grown to the point we need a few layers of management vs. just me. I’m a female in my 20s, when I started this job I was offered $40,000. The managers we’ve hired are all notably older men... starting at 80,000 - $120,000, and the pride that seems to come with that... one of them even makes a little more than me and had the balls to complain to me about his compensation.

I’ve gone through 3 of them in 3 years... The same thing with all of them - I recognize I’m the common denominator here but godammit if every one of these bastards didn’t just blatantly refuse to do what I tasked them with, and even try to offload their “administrative” work back onto me or their female coworkers... “your just so good with spreadsheets” is a bullshit excuse. We could be light years of progress from where we are now if it weren’t for this.

Despite me having the most experience and education in this field, and despite my fairly successful track record - the last two have been hell bent on “big picture” focus, and refused to roll up their sleeves to solve day to day problems. They want to conduct long, drawn out meetings where they mostly just socialize and talk in abstract, “what if” type terms. These meetings result in action items nearly 0% of the time. 

The one I’m working with now *blatantly* disrespects me, and has gone as far as to tell his department that I am not his boss! He is so much drama, I could give you a hundred examples of his transgressions.  

The owner won’t fire them for some inexplicable reason, but he does demote them and give them projects so I don’t have to deal with them so much. They keep their current salary, and it’s been discussed and recognized that they are basically just sucking the company’s teet and we are in agreement that it would be ideal if they quit.

**I want advice on how I might right this wayward ship, or if I should even keep trying. (Or a job offer, if you can supply a woke workplace!)**

*Before you give advice, know what I already do:*

- I am a nice person, I don’t really like being the boss just for the sake of being a boss, if that makes sense. I’m not a bitch (maybe that’s the problem?) I’ve had many people tell me at this point that I am the best boss they’ve ever had, so I’m pretty sure I’m not deluding myself on this point.
- I’ve focused on using firm language and hard deadlines to leave no room for interpretation on what needs accomplished 
- I’ve “straight-talked” to flat ask what it would take from me to help them accomplish tasks
- I lead by example and do most of the hard work myself. I work the most overtime. I’ll never ask anyone to do something I would not
- I’ve talked to the owner and he understands the problem. I have not told him I might quit and really never want to pull that card - I would rather work somewhere else then work at a place where I have to resort to those tactics

85,"This is kind of a 2 part question. so i guess ill start by saying that i am a male and im 22. for many

years it has been my life dream to race cars, and ive been slowly working towards this goal. ive

had my project car for about 2 years, and just got a truck to be able to take the car to tracks. there

are no race tracks in my state so i have to travel to make my dreams a reality. so this is where the

next part comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl almost a year and a half ago. about 6 months later we began to develop a relationship.

when we started seeing each other she was nearly 2 months pregnant, and also already had 2

girls. i dont have any problems with dating someone with kids, but i want to have at least 1 of my

own at some point. for her entire pregnancy we got very close to each other.  we would spend the

night with each other 4 or 5 nights a week every week since we started seeing each other. on top

of that every day while i was at work we would talk over the phone for 6+ hours. we were

essentially always together and if we weren't we were talking over the phone. before giving birth

she was talking about getting her tubes tied, and i would never give her my opinion. i didnt want

her to know my thoughts about it because i didnt want to persuade her decision on something

that important. when it finally came time for her to have the baby she decided to get the surgery

done. when we talked on the phone afterwords me she was crying talking about how she

regretted getting it done. as far as i know she still has no idea i didnt want her to get it done. thus

far i always thought

i wouldn't be able to stay with her if she got it done because i could never have my own child. but i

decided to try and see if her and her children would be enough for me because i loved her so

much. but after a while i realized that no matter what, my opinion was biased because of how in

love i was. i eventually had to tell her that i wouldn't be able to make our relationship work. it took

me 20 minutes to say those words through tears and whimpers. i physically couldn't tell her. she

still has no idea the reasons, all i want is a second chance to better explain that having a kid of my

own was very important, as well as that continuing a relationship with her would mean i would

have to change my goals from my racing dream to raising a family. its been 2 months and shes

rejected every attempt to try to talk to her. i look at my car and my truck, and i dont even care

about them when they used to be my biggest achievements.

For those who dont understand why i cant just be with her and still pursue my racing dream its all

financial. 80% of my income goes into my car. i dont buy anything for myself, i live off the cheapest

food i can get and only eat once a day. for years ive been making every sacrifice to chase my

dreams. but i threw away the girl of my dreams for it, and this is the biggest regret i have. but now

i dont know what to do with myself, ive been in the most depressed state i have ever been in. i had

to give my gun to a friend because i dont trust myself with it when im drinking, and thats a lot

right now. i guess i just want to know if im an idiot for thinking racing is more important than

having a future with someone",16Aug2020,1

91,"In short, I enjoy living a fast paced lifestyle. I’ve always been a social partier who never liked wasting his time. I went to a really good school, studied hard but partied harder. I was not smart with my sex life and ended up getting my girlfriend pregnant, but we stuck with the hardships and had a wonderful beautiful baby girl.

Life was tough, but I kept pushing through especially within my career to do everything I can to come out ahead. In my line of work though, you need to always be looking at the next step in order to remain competitive. I worked my ass off during this time. I also maintained a party life with the child which sound shitty, but I kept it to one day a weekend only and when my SO and child were asleep. The only thing I sacrificed was a good night sleep but in my eyes, this kept me balanced.

I worked my way up, got a fucking fantastic job at the moment, bought my new house, and am overall making a name for myself in the family and career world however I still party and enjoy my fair share of uppers quite often. I’m wondering if one can achieve a safe balance with this lifestyle or if it always ends in self destruction over time. I hate to say it, but the uppers (adderall and the occasional weekend cocaine) give me life and let me kill it at my job. But I’m afraid this is not a long term solution 

I’m wondering if anyone else has been in this situation? I work with pretty much all geniuses and over achievers, so being in this intense mindset is what you need to come out on top - it’s just sometimes caffeine does not cut it

For this entire month I didn’t leave my house. I didn’t shower. I didn’t change clothes. 

I lost 8 lbs because I wasn’t eating much food. I had my sweatshirt hood on the entire time. For the entire month my waist length hair was sitting in my hood getting tangled beyond belief. 

I tried getting it un-matted myself. It didn’t work. A few of my friends tried attacking it and got nowhere after three hours. I’m surprised no combs got stuck in there. 

I really don’t want to go to the salon because I think they might tell me I have to shave it off due to how bad it’s gotten. 

I know for a fact that my hair is one of the only things that give me confidence and if I had to shave it off I would probably have another depressive episode, maybe longer or worse than this one.

96,"So I recently left my religion (Islam). I left my religion because I felt like I was just following it to please my parents and my life was being limited. I am 25/M and have never kissed or had sex with a girl. I’ve never been to a party. During my uni days I was approached by cute girls on multiple occasions and also invited to parties but I always rejected these opportunities in order to follow my religious beliefs. 

Now that’s I’ve decided to leave the religion I honestly feel stuck. A lot of experiences that I am lacking my friends and people generally have already experienced long ago. A lot of people get these experiences started at 15 and I’m 25. 

I honestly don’t know how to go about this cause most of my friends aren’t into this new type of life style that I want to live and I don’t have any experiences to make me confident in pursuing this new way.

Just to give you some background I’ve lived a pretty hard life so far I. I have 3 older brothers that were born with terminal diseases. 1 passed away few years ago and 2 are actively deteriorating. My dad left and so I never had a mentor in life. Since the age of 12 I have been the main person helping them out my brothers. A lot of my focus has been on taking care of them and not focusing on working on myself through self improvement. I had a language and learning disorder since grade 1-7 but I over came both and will be applying to medical school this year. I’m sure these traumatic past experiences limit me also in some ways. 

I’ve been told that I am good looking and  can hold a conversation (I often talk about too much deep stuff tho). I am in shape also. 


So my question is how should I go about pursing and establishing this new life I want. I was thinking of hiring a high end escort to help me gain confidence in the bed room. What do you think of that? I’m not sure maybe I’ll regret this later on but I think this might be needed cause the last few dates I went on became strange. For instance, I found it hard to even sexualize a conversation with a girl, which stems from my lack of experience in the bed room. So those dates basically became me being a friend with them. I don’t want that lol! 

Also how should I go about getting party friends? I go to the gym often, play street ball, hang out with friends but basically we do the same stuff I am trying not to include in my life anymore. I’ve lived such a boring life so far and feel stuck. 

Pl don’t think of this post as a self pity rant. I am feeling stuck and would like to improve and move on with life.",16Aug2020,1
97,"So im now 27 i smoke alot of pot, cant hold down a job, cant stand being around other people with my level of anxiety and seem to push people away by stealing and lying. (I've never stolen for drugs)

So when i was 7yo to 10yp my mums best friends son raped me near weekly which i never told my mum at that point

Then when i was 10 my mum met a new man who we'll call james. James hated men he had 3 daughters. He used to beat me for ridiculously small things. I once accidentally dropped a roll of loo roll in the loo and he gave me a black eye and bust my lip open. Id get a beat nearly weekly often being sent to bed with no food or water. On the weekends and after school we had to help him with his job. ( he was a tree surgeon/limberjack so we just picked up wood and burnt it or loaded it on a truck.) 

This carried on till i was 13 and he found a picture in my room of a hunk in underwear  so thought i was gay (i am)
 Anyway my mother decided she wouldn't leave him and lut me in foster care. She left him 6 years ago maybe less and we attempted a relationship. Ive tried to tell her about my rape and she just not wanting to listen. ""I dont want to hear this"" she'll say and walk out the room. I WANT to forgive my mum and have a mum but i can't. I have so much anger and dislike over so many things about her. Like putting me in care, never stopping james from beating me or even listening to my rape. 

I don't know what to do. I pretty much just ignore most her messages or give bland responses. Am i being petty?

98,"I know this probably isn't the right sub for this but idk what to do or where to post, it's a bit long but I'd really appreciate any help I could get.

So.. I have been going through a rough few months, and one of the things that has helped me cope a bit is music. On the last 4-ish years I have been getting into metal, I used to only listen to rock, hard rock and classical mostly, as well as bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot and Sabaton. Then, in 2016 I started listening to stuff like Metallica and Iron Maiden, and gradually I started listening more and more to metal to the point where ~80-90% of all the music I hear is metal.

Now, of course you have the more accessible sub-genres like classical metal, NWOBHM, thrash, power, metalcore and nu metal, which are the ones I listen to most, and I love them.

And then there's extreme metal. Its main, ""canon"" sub-genres are death and black, and here is where my relationship crisis with metal music stems from. I generally don't like black metal, but as far as Death Metal goes, I either love it or hate it. I love Melodic Death metal bands like Amon Amarth and Arch Enemy, and tech bands like Gojira and Death. But on the other hand there are brutal death metal and blackened death metal bands. I have never seen anything with such profoundly disturbing, disgusting and horrifying themes like these genres, especially brutal death.

You see, the bands I like, even death metal ones like Gojira, Amon Amarth and Death's later albums have a heavy, rough and chaotic sound and growly vocals. And I really like it. That isn't the issue at all.

The issue is lyrics, themes and the album covers. Tech/Melodic death bands' ones are mostly normal, sometimes philosophical, like Gojira's, other times telling a story, e.g. about Norse mythology, like Amon Amarth. I cannot separate the lyrics and the general theme of a song from it. Even if I can't understand what they're saying, you can automatically grasp, or sometimes infer, the general meaning and/or message of the song to some degree, which is usually easy enough that I do it pretty much without even thinking about it. The album covers also play a huge role in this as they depict their general theme.

But here's a problem: I am very sensitive to disturbing or horror-like stuff. If I watch horror movies, my next 3 ish days are absolutely ruined. I won't sleep, I'll be extremely unproductive, unmotivated, anxious and down. And the same goes for these songs, which imo have themes that are a lot more disturbing, such as cannibalism, necrophilia, rape, torture, mutilation and pedophilia, to name a few, often combined. And even though I like the sound of some bands like Behemoth, I can't listen to them because of the lyrics and dark themes. Hell, even Slayer makes me feel uneasy.

But that's not even the tip of the iceberg. I listen to a lot of music - mostly metal - and it's all fine and enjoyable until I see a meme on r/MetalMemes and in the comment section people are talking about how much they like ""Infant Annihilator"". And how they used to like only the stuff I like but now mostly listen to bands like these. Other times Spotify recommends a song by say, Cannibal Corpse, and it has the same effect, even if I skip it asap.

Now, I don't know why, but just the name of those bands makes my skin crawl. Then someone names one of their songs and my day is over. It's like a trigger, only there are no memories to be triggered, my brain creates them and then obsesses over them as if those were real, and my anxiety goes through the roof.

This is what happened today. It's 10:48 PM now and I still haven't gotten over a single thread that I saw on Reddit at like, 3 pm. I have been thinking about this song and this band all day, I have no peace, I can't do anything anymore, everything I do or think about just goes back to those horrifying names, the disturbing thoughts that this causes. I feel like I'm getting PTSD because this has happened so many times and is becoming so frequent and everytime it's like I am the victim or at least a witness of the brutality they describe, and it just won't get out of my head. It won't. I want to cry and puke everytime I think about it and I think about it all day. I think I am losing - or rather have already lost - my mind.

I really don't know what to do. Music is one of the very few things depression still hasn't taken away from me, it's one of the few pleasures I still have in life, one of the few things that doesn't feel bland and boring. But now I can't listen to any music - because music reminds me of metal which leads to this. In fact, I don't even need to listen to music to have these disturbing thoughts. They don't leave my head at all.

(P.S.)

To make matters worse, one of the few things I used to say to myself and that helped me get a tiny bit better is that I don't like that kind of music and in fact I loathe it. But today I saw a post where plenty of people were talking about how they started off like me, only liking the more ""normal"" stuff but then slowly started listening to more extreme sub-genres by starting with more accessible bands. And my anxiety convinces me that I will absolutely 100% no doubt follow the same path and will eventually become one of them. And that makes it even worse, and even harder for me to go back to listening to my beloved metal as I fear I am ""fulfilling the prophecy"", so to speak.

(\P.S.)

Thank you very much for reading this if you have, and please if you have any advice it will be very welcomed. I feel like I'm on the verge of insanity and I need help, desperately.",16Aug2020,1
99,"Ill try to explain this as best I can I went to spend around a week at my mothers house which my sister also lives. my sister is disrespectful and my mom and her get in constant verbal fights and arguments not to say my moms perfect but she doesn't deserve half of the disrespect my sister gives to her but in the end they have a decent relationship. 

I brought my licence to practice driving around with my mom this was alright the first few times until we drive with my sister in the back spewing out constant comments in a rather rude way saying I should do this or that and it just annoys me and my mom but I let it go and dont make it a big deal. then 2 days later the second last day I stay we go driving around just to practice and my sister wont stop saying all these comments. Again its like shes looking for anything thing to make a fuss over I find that when she gets mad and tells you to do something about it if you do as she says to try to please her she gets even more mad about you trying to resolve the problem she had in the first place   like its impossible to please her and then she says something that just sits with me and makes me sad angry or annoyed im just trying my best. 

Then she says more stuff my mom and her get in an argument and then I pull over and say im done and get my mom to drive the rest of the way home. This just leads to my sister getting mad at my mom for defending me and blames our mom for getting her upset previously and says thats why shes in a bad mood and saying all that stuff. We arrive home and I dont say anything im just really upset and annoyed and honestly want to go home. I sit on a balcony with my mom and im just bummed out not talking much sounding really upset and just stuck in my own head with all these thoughts.

My mom starts to make a really nice dinner and she asks whats wrong and I just say honestly I just want to go home. She trys to talk me into staying saying like maybe we can all sit down and talk and resolve this issue which im against because I know my sister will just get super defensive and walk away or something or it would just turn into another argument but my mom says if I really want to go home she will drive me as she doesn't want me to spend my time being miserable. 

I think about it and end up saying il stay and I planned on trying to cheer myself up later on. Just as I say that a minute later my sister starts up another argument for no reason and gets mad at my mom for simply answering a question in a certain tone of voice. After this I was beyond annoyed with all their arguing and just said fuck it told my mom I want to go home and then grabbed my stuff and walked out the door and waited in the car without another word. 

My mom apoligizes for upsetting me and trys to talk to me about what happend and see if we can fix the problem and im all upset and just telling her I just want to go home. The car ride was quiet and she ended up crying a little when driving me home and this made me feel like shit like im being all moody and not explaining my issue my mom thinks she did something wrong and apologizes when I get home I say goodbye to my mom but the second I step indoors alone I hit the ground and cry so hard like im weeping on the floor feeling like shit for a good hour. I reflect on the issue realizing I was being petty and in a bad mood being rude to my mom myself and feel bad for just walking out to the car without a word and making her stop dinner to drive me home. After I got up I messaged my mom a simple im sorry and we talked breifly with her apologizing for the both of them upsetting me. 

TLDR: I spent the week at my moms she and my sister constantly argue that and my sister got on my nerves and I handled the situation extremely poorly and feel guilty for walking out and going home. 

I feel cold and just hate myself for the way I acted and handled the situation I now have no motivation to do anything and feel like no matter what I do right now I wont be happy Im just lost and want to feel better and dont know how to go about the entire thing and want any advice you may have.

also sorry for the post being hard to read im typing quite fast and also venting a little in the process.",16Aug2020,1

My sisters all depend on my dad but 3 years ago I got a job so I could help here and there and relive a burden. I always helped by sneaking money to my mom and not my dad so he wouldn’t take it the wrong way. A week ago, I gave him $100 for the electricity bill. Bc it’s high in the summer bc of Ac. My older sister had the dryer on for hours running the same cycle and like clockwork, my dad got mad. She told him I said she could use the dryer. But I had only said they could use it..not run the same cycle for hours. My dad, who had just gotten home from a 15 hour shift got mad. Threw in my face that I gave him a mealy $100 and thought I had authority. He’s always built me up telling me I do have authority. That I was his right hand.

I find myself thinking about some particular things a lot. One part of me thinks that it’s ok to move on. I know there’s nothing I can do, I know what I did was wrong and I made decisions made on impulses that no longer represent me, I know I’ve struggled with a lot of things and as a result I made mistakes, as long as I don’t repeat them and strive to be a better person I should be good, as long as I prove to myself that I’m ashamed of the bad things that I’ve done it should all be good. 


Another part of me thinks I’m disgusting, irredeemable and have to deal with that for the rest of my life. I’m the problem and I’m the worst thing to have ever happened to myself. I should be consumed by guilt forever.

103,"I know, from the title, it sounds like whining. Read on and maybe you can relate, and if not, please do offer your time to another advice-seeker and scroll past me. 

Online, it seems that I can't avoid personal negative attacks. Have you experienced this? You comment on a YouTube video, it strikes a lot of people and they like it- and then someone will reply to you that your comment was attention seeking. 

Despite good intentions and an authentic approach, someone always comes around to tear you down and make you feel like you had some kind of devious or disengenuous intent behind your words. 

Even on my local NextDoor app, with no anonymity to hide behind, people raise their pitchforks at anyone with a differing opinion. You'd think that sort of environment would help people hear each other out, have patience, and discuss civilly? Yet it seems no less polarized. 

Here on reddit it seems to depend on the community. Smaller niche communities tend to connect on their shared focal point and from what I have experienced, they are informative and helpful to those who aren't fully up to speed. Some subs I have seen though, comments are hugely sweeping generalizations and quick judgments with little context to go off of. 

For those who have interacted with communities and faced a hateful response seemingly out of nowhere, how do you pick yourself up from it? Should I just have thicker skin and ignore the oddball hyper-judgemental type? Does it bother anyone else? Do you have a method of your own to restore your faith in humanity and confidence in yourself? 

I have low self esteem if it wasn't painfully obvious (I apologize), so whilst the vast majority of people online I come across are genuinely kind, I can't help but feel bad that a few people see me like I'm an awful person. They don't know me in real life and they'll never encounter me in person but it still just gets under my skin. If you have struggled with this irrational feeling, please share your journey.

Thanks all for your advice and time.",16Aug2020,1

105,"I am a 26 year old male living with my elder sister and brother in law for almost a year now. I was diagnosed with cancer last year and because of chemo and everything I was just too weak and needed support. My parents dont live in the same country so I really have no one to fall back on but my elder sister. Unfortunately cancer has not gone and I am still under treatment. The new treatment is very mild as compared to chemo and normally I do feel healthy. I have always been very active and athletic so this just adds to that.

Recently my sister has started to become very abusive towards me. Last night she flat out said that if you want further treatment to be done, look for another place. I dont understand I never asked her for any favour, I am very independent and can normally go by without her help. But I feel like she thinks I am a burden. I have been crying since yesterday. How can a sister say that to her own little brother, who is already going through so much. My parents live in another country and they feel helpless towards me! My brother in law on the other hand is an angel. If it weren’t up to him, my sister would have kicked me out a year ago. I used to have a good job but I have been on disability since my diagnosis. I do get money from disability but I live in newyork and it is expensive. I do have enough I think to make ends meet. 

I want to move out because I dont want more insults and I would be in a better state of mind. My parents although feel like I should be with someone and they feel safe that way. I had a few cases of passing out during my initial days of treatment and since then my parents have always been very scared that I might pass out with no one around. I have tried to give my sister some rent but she refuses, saying that if you want to give rent, rent out a place. I am scared, I feel like she will kick me out any day for nowhere for me to go. I am still under treatment and nurse comes home every week, so that just adds to my fear. Should I move out? Will I be able to manage?

He was upset that I was using them and suggest I use them only 30 % while the other half I just don't use them. I said using filters made me smile and happy. So I wanted to comply with demands but also make myself happy by using stupid filters. So I said how about 50-50 but hes upset and gives me the cold shoulder and sometimes doesn't even respond. When we first started talking about it he said i was selfish because he's done so much for me and that he just wanted to see me real face. He reasoning is that we don't call/video call as much. I'm dealing with doctor appointments and ect for extreme depression and anxiety as well as dealing with extreme family issues and internet issues so I told him I won't be able to call as much anymore.

My other friends and I all hang out with her and her fiancee, let's call him Jake, at least once a month. We're more friends with Angela than Jake, but they're both great people and we enjoy their company. At work the other day, Angela and I were out for a smoke and she told me that Jake and her have been having issues and she's been thinking about breaking it off (possibly temporarily) and without getting into it, she has some pretty solid reasons for wanting this. Fast forward to today, I asked her about it. She says he's been much more close to her and trying to change some of the issues they were having. Then she bursts out that she cheated on him with the neighbor the night before. I was not judgmental about it (as I've not only been cheated on, but I did cheat on someone back in my highschool days), but I gathered the information that helped me to understand her scenario better. It didn't justify it to me, but it's not my life. I basically told her that she should tell him, sooner than later, and that this has likely eliminated any chance of them fixing the relationship. I also gave her advice from my past experiences and told her that before she sees this neighbor again, Jake needs to know and you need to break up. She said she would tell him eventually, but this makes me concerned that she might not, or maybe she'll wait a month. I really don't know. Anyways, now I feel as though I'm in a spot where I could just keep my mouth shut and let it go, or I could tell Jake about it somehow. I feel as though he deserves to know and I know I would want to know, but Angela may never forgive me if I do. Any advice on the subject is greatly appreciated.

I am currently debating getting the new Xbox that is coming out soon or upgrading the gaming PC that I have now. Below I am going to drop the specs for my PC in case I need to upgrade more than the graphics card and then below that I am going to do a pro list for each console as far as I know now. If you do give some advice or help me out that would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

PC Specs:

* Motherboard: MSI H270 PC MATE
* Graphics Card: Geforce GTX 1060
* Processor: Intel i5 core
* RAM: 16gb 
* Power Supply: EVGA Supernova 650 G2

&amp;#x200B;

PRO LIST FOR XBOX SERIES X

* Play all games with my friends (who use xbox and will be buying the console)
* Halo Infinite
* Familiar with xbox (7 years)
* Ability to play on xbox and use my PC separately for watching videos and streams and looking stuff up
* Cheaper
* Satisfaction of unboxing a brand new console

&amp;#x200B;

PRO LIST FOR PC

* Way better for streaming (graphics card allows me to play in 1080p even though I have 4k monitor on my xbox, only way to fix it is to pay $300 on a ridiculous graphics card, for PC I wouldn't need a graphics card at all)
* Everything I need in one device
* Less cables (by not having a second console)
* Ability to play with keyboard and mouse OR controller
* WAY more games
* Ability to customize graphics

&amp;#x200B;

I am really trying to get into streaming so it would be really nice to be able to play in 4k or whatever but I have used Xbox for so long it will be tough to just stop using the console that I grew up playing and have played daily ever since. Whether you know a lot or a little about gaming I would love any opinions or feedback. Thank you so much for all of the help in advance :) Ill be back in an hour to check and reply to comments.

Sad day because he is the coolest dude and I really enjoy working with him.

 I have always had a sneaking suspicion that I am severely underpaid in comparison to my male counterparts. Before I go into it, I always have wonderful reviews, I have never received a complaint about my work or workmanship.. my boss always is saying things like ""this is soooo cool,"" or ""wow, we have really stepped up our marketing!""... that being said, I was talking to the gentleman that was hired to cover me while I was out.. while we were discussing a project he worked on, i just blurted out ""if you feel comfortable answering this question, please do. If not, no worries at all. But, how much did you get paid when you worked for us?""

His answer rocked my world. They were paying him almost DOUBLE what I get paid. I know it isnt because of experience or capability.. because we both have the same skillset.. like we shared video files and both worked on the same projects together... I have 10 years experience as well... and he was about to get hired on full time at the same rate they were paying him as a temp.

If I was getting paid what my company deemed the job to be valued at, then we wouldnt be losing our home. 

Side note: the gentleman that temped for us didnt even cover all of my tasks.. I had to still play catch up when I got back from medical leave.

Anyways, i know i wrote a novel... but if you made it this far, can you give me any advice on how to approach the issue in conversation without coming across accusatory, because the VP I am speaking to goes on the defensive a lot of he feels threatened. 

And is it appropriate for me to ask for back pay from the time I returned to work?? 

Please help!",16Aug2020,1

133,"Context: (It's really long I know, but please at least skim it because there's a lot of details that play in. Thanks)

So last year my best friend (Let's call him Tom) started vaping to, as he said, cope with the stress of high school senior year (which, to be fair, was quite stressful). He didn't do it much, if fact I never saw him do it, so I wasn't too concerned. He also didn't use nicotine. He quit a little while later, but picked it up again this year because of, again in his words, stress from quarantine, and started using nicotine. He also has been doing it much more often, several times per hour (sometimes 5-10, but it depends), at least in front of me. He also started smoking cigars, but very rarely (around once a month), which doesn't concern me much. Also, he drinks occasionally (maybe once a week), but never gets drunk or buzzed.

I've talked with Tom about it and shared my concerns, but he said he's not worried and doesn't intend to quit. He also got somewhat annoyed and defensive, saying he's an adult and that it's his choice, which to be fair is true.

I've recently discussed this with some people in our mutual friend group (aged M16-M19) and they share similar concerns and feel that Tom has been rather careless with his health recently (he also had/has a caffeine/sugar addiction from drinking 1-3 energy drinks a day, but is thankfully slowing down on those). I talked with one of the friends and he feels that a group discussion with Tom may work best since Tom has brushed off individual concerns.

But personally I'm very worried for Tom since he's become somewhat careless recently. It really feels like he's changed in the past two years, especially since his several-year relationship breakup in March of this year. He's a damn good guy, and to be honest the best friend I could've asked for, and we both intend to be good friends til the day we die, but I'm worried for his health and it hurts me to see him risking it like this. I'm also worried for his health down the road, and I would seriously hate to see him suffer long-term effects later in life. I'm also worried (though am not sure if it's even a valid concern) that his increased carelessness could lead to other things, like cigarettes, alcoholism, drugs, etc., though that might just be my mind expecting the worst.

Before I ask my questions I just want to state that I'm really not sure how to feel here, whether I'm being too much like a parent, or should be concerned for Tom in this way. Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I would feel terrible seeing him hurt later in life from this. Maybe I'm even being selfish in not wanting to feel bad if he gets hurt. I honestly don't know.

Questions:

So, what should I do? Am I overreacting, and I should let it go and try not to let it bother me? Should I talk to him about it and be completely honest with how I feel, even though last time it didn't do anything? (although last time I wasn't being too straightforward and didn't say exactly how I felt) Or maybe try the group discussion with our friends? Again, I'm honestly not sure with which path to take.

TL;DR: my best friend of 5 years has a nicotine addiction with no intention of stopping, even though myself and several of my friends have expressed our concerns. I would hate to see him suffer long-term effects later in life from this if he continues. How can I/we approach him and express our concerns while being respectful?

Seriously, thanks for reading and thanks for the help y'all. This has been on my mind a lot recently and not knowing what to do has been frustrating, to say the least.",16Aug2020,1

135,"So my girlfriend has kissed an ex friend with benefits, what do I do? Let’s start from the beginning, we started the night going for a meal (me my girlfriend and another friend) whilst we were out we see a group of my girlfriends friends a mix of girls and guys and the old friends with benefits all who are in relationships. Me and my friend decide to call it a night and leave my girlfriend with her friends i drive my friend home then i go home. Later that night a get a call saying I’m at this location can you pick me up at this time, I was like sure that’s fine I arrived at the location 5 minutes early and see my girlfriend and her ex friends with benefits arguing so obviously I get out the car and say what the fuck is going on?! He acts all pally and tries to give me a handshake obviously I’m like fuck that, just thinking he’s drunk and that then he tried to get in my car to get a lift home! I tell him to piss off and as he is leaving he shouts yeah well i fucked your girlfriend and my girlfriend goes no you didn’t. I calmly get in the car and before we even leave my girlfriend say he kissed me and immediately i get out the car start walking towards the direction he went in i didn’t even turn off the car, she starts crying i go back to the car turn off the engine and she pleads me not to get in a fight, instead i drive her and myself home (we live together). Once home I say tell me everything that happened? So she proceeds to say how he got into a fight with one of his friends (long standing beef) so he pulled my girlfriend away to have a chat about the argument (weird! Especially as she has always said she dislikes him) they go on a little walk around the corner from where I was picking her up and sit on a bench where he was inappropriately touching her on the knee and saying how do you know when you’ve found the one (hes in a relationship) then kisses her and she says she kissed back before pushing him away then they argued saying why did you do that we are both in relationship you are no better than (friend) you just did that, then I arrived.... 
what do I do? She’s always been against cheating? Is kissing cheating? We have been together for 2 years and there hasn’t been any issues until now, now everything has changed, maybe for the better I don’t know? How do i tell the friends with benefits girlfriend? Because i am 100% telling her. I feel like I might be able to forgive but I will never forget and that would play on my mind every time she’d go out, the lack of trust would just eat me up inside.

140,"Quick disclaimer - I know the way I'm worrying about this is problematic in that it implies being trans is a bad thing, and I am sorry for that, I really am. I don't know how else to express this worry, but I am honestly sorry for offending.

I'm a black, darkskinned woman, and I'm very tall for a girl (5""11). I have always been insecure over my height and feeling masculine compared to other girls, especially when I was in school. I was always the only black girl in my class, and I felt like a huge ugly beast all the time, compared to the cute petite white girls around me who would always have boys interested in them, while none ever even looked at me.

My voice is also slightly deeper than most girls. Its not too deep, nobody has ever said anything about it to me, but I have always wished it was higher. I also have an adam's apple, which I only recently found out most women don't have (dumb, I know). I was also made fun of a lot in the past for having no boobs or ass to speak of, and people would call me flat or a pancake. My boobs have grown now I'm older, but they're still pretty small and I don't have much shape overall, I'm just tall and lanky. All of this has led to me feeling masculine growing up, which I hated a lot, I'm very much a girly girl.

In the past couple of years though, I feel like I've started to grow into my looks more. I went from never ever getting compliments to when I was 17 and working at a supermarket, I would get compliments from customers almost every single day, telling me I look like a model and how beautiful I am. It was such a 180 from how my life was growing up, I didn't internalize the compliments at first. It would happen more and more, and I started to get hit on by guys randomly and I began to realise I wasn't as ugly as I was when I was younger, and that being tall isn't necessarily bad. I got signed as a model late last year, and over the past six months I've felt comfortable/confident in how I look for the first time in my life.

So the thing that started this insecurity - a couple of weeks ago, the rapper Megan thee Stallion was shot in the feet by Tory Lanez, and in all the ensuing drama a lot of people in the black community started bringing up the old rumour that Meg is transgender, and Tory shot her because he found out she has a dick. Its really childish and dumb, but there were a couple viral tweet about it, and if you look on the comments on the instagram page 'theshaderoom' whenever Meg is posted, all the comments will talk about how she's secretly a man, and they'll get thousands of likes. I've stepped away from all social media because of this issue, but sadly the thoughts are already stuck in my head. 

Meg is the same height as me, and is way more 'feminine' looking than me given she's known for having big boobs and a butt, so I started worrying that I may look transgender too, and that people think I look like a man. 

I was really worried about it the first few days, and started having panic attacks about my adam's apple, amd my voice, and worrying if even my boyfriend may have secretly thought this. We've been together a year and I love him a lot, I felt so worried he somehow had this same thought and would end up not being attracted to me anymore. I went really quiet for a few days over text/calls, which isn't like me, so he came over one day and made me tell him what was wrong. I regret it now, but I told him my insecurity over worrying I look like I'm trans, and he told me he doesn't think that, and that I'm beautiful and should stop worrying. He spent the whole day trying to cheer me up and make me feel confident, and I thought it worked.

That was three weeks ago. I still can't stop thinking about it. Every time I look in the mirror I think about it, I spend more time thinking about it than I do anything else. I've cried over it so much, any picture I've ever taken I look at it and analyse if I look like a man. Every time I speak I'm worried about my voice and whether the other person is thinking about how deep it is. 

Even though my boyfriend dismissed the idea, I'm still worrying that he's thinking about it. We spend the sams amount of time together, and still initiates sex often, even more if anything, so I know I shouldn't worry but I still am. Even if he's not thinking about it, or secretly suspicious that I am trans, I've become so wrapped up in a worry that I can't even talk to him about because if I do, I'll just be replanting it in his head, when I want him to forget. If I tell him how obsessively I think about this I'm pretty sure he will believe I actually am hiding something. I think about this even in the middle of sex with him, I hate it.

If the issue was just about my boyfriend, I would end things and sort my own brain out, but even outside of him I still worry about this so so much. I never feel good anymore. I don't know how I'll ever escape this besides killing myself, I'm stuck as me forever, and I can't get this thought out of my brain, I'm trying so hard to.

I know the first responses given to me will be 1) call a suicide hotline 2) go to therapy. I've called suicide hotlines many times, as I've been generally depressed for years, but they personally don't help me and they feel pointless for me. In terms of therapy, I've been trying to get into it for while. I've moved three times in the past few years for a number of reasons, and every time I register with a new doctor and register for therapy, I get put on these long waiting lists, always at least six months, and then I never even get in. I'm currently still on the waiting list for one, though I expressed suicidal thoughts. I really do want to go to therapy, if I had the money I would do private therapy tomorrow but I'm very poor, waiting for free therapy is all I can do rn.

I don't know what to do, I miss my life before this took over. I don't want to think about this or worry about it anymore. I don't understand how I can feel so awful about this when I know I was born a woman, but I do. If anyone can advise me anything, any exercises I can use to stop thinking about this every second, please tell me.",16Aug2020,1

Almost every-time we talk she mentions something sexual. I'm a bit of a goober nerd... I usually never talk about cats or sex lol.

Today, we she invited me to lunch and she was talking to me about another coworker who was trying to have a three some with her and her friend during a christmas party and how he makes her uncomfortable.

Um, other times she has told me to never get a girlfriend pregnant etc.

159,"First time poster/redditor. Really hoping for some insight, thanks in advance!

I (30f)work for a state government office. Due to Covid everything has been upside down. One of my coworkers (also 30f) was relocated to a different office about 45 minutes away. Coworker (CW) has been asking our supervisor (older f) several times a week when she can come back and why she can’t be working in her home office. CW hadn’t ever gotten a straight answer, so she finally went to HR and asked what to do and was told “follow the chain of command.” So, coworker emailed our supervisors supervisor (SSV), and advised our immediate supervisor (SV) what she was doing. 

Our SV said it was ok, but don’t be surprised if people get pissed off that she’s asking questions. (What?!) I was at my desk when SSV called SV to ask about the email CW sent. SV basically threw CW under the bus to SSV, saying things like “I told her to be patient” and “she annoys me so much with this” (never had mentioned that frustration before) and “I don’t know why she won’t get over it” and other fairly harsh comments. I was very surprised because I’ve never heard SV talk about one of her employees that way. 

So far I have kept my mouth shut. However, in three weeks I will be starting a new position and be free of that office. There are a LOT of negative issues there, especially for a state office, but that is it’s own post. My CW and I are close friends outside of work, and I know she is also not happy there, but is struggling whether to stay or go. I feel if she knew what our SV said, that would help in her decision process. 

So, I’m wondering, should I tell my CW what was said? Is it my place as a coworker and/or as a friend? I am leaving because of the toxicity in the office, and I’m just wondering if she should have the whole picture to decide if she should do the same?

PS: our HR system is pretty much useless. We have to go through a long, complicated, exhausting process just to file a complaint and have an investigation started, and there is typically no resolution other than the employee that started things to end up in another position somehow.",16Aug2020,1
160,"Hello guys,

So I am gonna try to keep this as short as possible. So I was in a class and had a crush on a dude my sophomore year of university and he was a senior so he graduated and I never got a chance to talk to him, ask for his # or his social media bc I was shy (also a pretty crowded music class). So I kinda forgot about it until about a month ago I found his Instagram in recommended section since 2 ppl I know follow him… being me I didn’t follow him with my personal account but I followed him with my friend’s photography account (that doesn’t have my name or anything) bc I was nosy…. He doesn’t seem too much of a social media guy but it seems like he posts sometimes….

So my birthday is coming up so I was thinking about gathering up the guts to follow him on my personal, sending him a message basically saying I had a crush on you, I think ur cute, wanna go on a date… but the more I think about it I feel like he would be creeped out saying “how this person found me on insta?” or “who is this girl never talked to her” or something like that and idk how to approach messaging him and a good way of saying what I want to say… ☹

Also recently I went through his insta again and two new girls followed him and seem to be liking all his pics so my soul is a little bit crushed …. since I know his insta handle is pretty private and he doesn’t just randomly add anyone ☹

So I am here to ask for help on whats a good non creepy way to do this? Any example / advice would help haha as I am nervous…. I wouldn’t say this is my first time telling a guy I like him but usually I would be friends with them first or know them better… but this time its super new and scary to me….

And then there’s an extended group that we hang out with at school with 4 other people. Everyone is close friends but not everyone is best friends with each other if that makes sense. Our group of 6 used to be best friends but now I feel like everyone coupled up except for me and this one other girl but she has left our school now so I guess it’s just me. At first I felt fine with this because I do have close friends outside of these people, but they are separate friend groups that I do different things with. I also get to see them less because they live in a different area. I love them but because of where we live I hang out with them less than I can and less than they hang out with each other so in that group sometimes I am also left out. The people I hang out most with are the initial people I was talking about I can’t help but feel excluded because like I said everyone coupled up and I feel like I am just floating between pairs most of the time unless I am with one of them alone. So now I’m just in a state of confusion because I don’t feel like I belong anywhere, I’m just drifting around to whichever group is available at the time and I don’t know how to cope with it because I have such intense feelings of missing out. When they hang out and don’t invite me maybe because it’s last minute or maybe because they just didn’t think to invite, it makes me feel so sad and worthless. What I am trying to hold on to is that in less than a year I will graduate and be able to make new friends that maybe I will fit more with. But I’m just scared that I will keep this role as a “floater” and never feel like I truly belong.",16Aug2020,1
162,"I'm having a hard time at work lately. I'm not sure how to proceed.

Part of my issue is I am the yes-person at work. Give me all the work and all the things! I will take it! This has landed me with a lot of my boss's work to the point where I wonder what my boss does all day.

There have always been problems with this position: some micromanaging, extremely high expectations, no excuses allowed, spoken to like a child, boss takes credit for my work, I have been told before I was no longer allowed to send emails to certain people and those emails must go to my boss to look over and send, etc. There have been a few other things here and there I disagree with like obvious narcissism, nepotism, favoritism, racism and sexism. My boss constantly breaks his own rules, and all of the above is ok so long as it is my boss doing it.

There was recently an incident where my company laid people off due to Covid. My name was on the list to get chopped because no one knows what I do for the company, they think it is all my boss's work. I was supposedly saved from getting chopped, but now I am feeling extremely unwanted. I was told I was lucky I still have a job. It felt like a way to put me in my place.

Since then my boss has asked other people on my team to train in some of my duties, so I know he was afraid if I left he would not have been able to do my work and the whole thing would have fallen apart, at least for a while.

Now another department has asked my department to do a few tasks that are not our responsibility, and are outside the scope of our knowledge and understanding. Normally I would be all over it and excited, but after everything that's gone on I think I am tired, burnt out, and ready to move on to another company. I don't want any more work. I can't do any more work. I don't have it in me. I feel like I'm on the edge of a nervous breakdown. On top of it all this new task is not in my scope; I don't have the title, compensation, authority, or understanding of the task to complete it, and I wasn't going to receive any of those things.

I told my boss I felt like this new task was setting me up to fail and I don't want any part in it. I was told I was lucky to have a job, I was told a lot of people don't have work and it is very hard to find a job right now, and that I will be doing the task.

I've applied to other jobs, however even though I have a lot of the managerial skills from my time doing my boss's work, I don't have the title, so I am not even being considered for management positions. I am being sent tons of lateral move jobs from different websites, but I don't think I have any more left to give to this type of work. I have been applying, however most of the time I get sent rejection emails or no response at all.

I am exhausted, feel completely helpless, and am starting to get extremely depressed from failing so much. I don't know what to do.",16Aug2020,1

what I need advice is (other than perhaps your opinions on the whole idea overall) is also if I should put my face on it or not, and how edgy and politically incorrect should I go.

166,"I (25F) was alone for most of my life. As a kid, I only hung out with friends on special occasions (once every few months). Aside from that, I spent most of my time alone. The solitude extended for most of my life. High school and college had a lot more social opportunities, but, I still was at peace being alone. On days off, I'd just wake up and decide what I wanted to do that day and I'd do it. At times I had moments of loneliness, but because I had never really had anyone, it was more of a yearning for something I wasn't familiar with. As I started casually dating it got harder to be alone but even then, I could always find peace in my solitude. All of the guys I casually dated were kind of flaky with very inconsistent communication, so I never relied on them being there, Because of how my life has gone, I developed a lot of independence. I started a job where I had to travel all over the country by myself. And this only gave me a stronger independence and peace with being by myself. 

This was all the case until I started seriously seeing someone for the first time in my life. He's an incredible person who gives me plenty of regular attention. It's nothing like I've ever had before. At this point, we have a pretty set routine for communication. And having someone want to talk to me so regularly, has been the most meaningful development in my life. But, everyone has busy days and the days where he has a lot going on and I don't hear from him until later, etc., really get to me. Of course this is 100% a me problem, so I don't bring this to his attention because he's doing nothing wrong. This issue isn't a relationship issue. It's an issue with the fact that I no longer know how to handle moments of solitude. On weekends where there's no one around, I have multiple breakdowns. Time spent by myself without communication with others is becoming unbearable. I'm constantly wondering how I thrived in solitude before, and now I can't take several hours of it without just weeping. I don't know how to spend time alone (this also applies to when my roommate isn't around). It's gotten to a point where so far this year, I've taken 0 days off of work, because it's better for my mental health if I'm at work instead of home by myself.

I'm sure this is something I should look into therapy for, but I guess I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice for how to become comfortable with solitude again. It's really getting to me that it's gotten to this point.",16Aug2020,1

171,"I apologize in advance for my long post; I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

About ten years ago, in college, I committed a crime involving property damage.

I can't get into the details of it here; the incident was serious enough that information about it can be found on the internet, and I don't want to risk drawing attention to it by getting too specific. For the purposes of this post it's probably enough to mention that

(1)  No one has ever suspected me of having done the thing;

(2)  If I were ever to come forward, my livelihood and reputation would be ruined forever;

(3)  The victim -- that is to say, the owner of the property -- is, maybe surprisingly, an old friend whom I love dearly.

I stress this last part, because it is only due to my relationship to this person (let's call them N) that I find myself in my current situation.

After the incident I briefly considered coming forward, but decided against it. (I suspected I would never be forgiven; also, I didn't want to go to prison.) Instead, I made a deliberate choice to start drifting away from N. This took some effort on my part, because N and I were at the time \*very\* close; but eventually I disappeared completely from N's life and started getting on with my life.

So far I have had no trouble keeping quiet about the incident to everyone else. I am an introverted and callous person.

&amp;#x200B;

But recently, N has reappeared in my life. (N is close with other members of my family, and some events in the family have brought us together again.) Now N wants to get to know me again: catching up on time spent apart, etc.

It would be easy for me to drift away, just like last time, only this time I'm not sure what to do.",16Aug2020,1

174,"Hey everyone. I need some advice on my current situation. First I’ll give you all some background on myself currently, let you all know what I’m thinking, and then ask some questions. 

I am a 21 year old male who lives in the United States. I am senior at university and will be graduating this fall with a business degree. As of right now that is where I plan to stop my education. My current job offers tuition reimbursement so if I had a legitimate reason to go back I wouldn’t be opposed to it. Last week I started at an office job working fraud claims for a large financial institution. Before that I worked for two years at a grocery store doing just general service. 

Socially I have no friends. I’ve always talked to people in high school and when college was in person but kind of took it for granted. Now that I won’t be going back to school in person, I have no “friends.” I have been able to recognize this though, and plan to try and build connections once the world opens up. I want to start volunteering at an animal shelter, and think that will be a good way to meet people with a similar personality. I also want to go to the gym. Going to the gym I think will let me meet people who are mentally strong and also improve my own confidence once I see results (pretty skinny right now). Thankfully right now, I have a very secure and supportive family. This includes both of my parents, my sister and her boyfriend, and my grandparents. These are literally the only phone numbers I have on my phone, but it is a really solid foundation of love that I am extremely grateful for. 

Late I’ve been very sad. I have probably cried more in the past month then I have in multiple years combined. I am constantly worrying about the future. This includes but is not limited to retiring, losing my loved ones, finding a the right career, self fulfillment, finding friends, and finding love. These are all things that I have fairly negative thoughts about most days, and am actively trying not to feel this way about. 

One thing I noticed about myself is I actively look for a direct result from my actions. What I mean by that is I love in school when I get to work on an assignment, turn it in, and instantly see my grade online. That feeling is something I think I like because it lets me know I’m doing the right thing. Does anyone have a way to feel like this as an adult?

Also, the topic of fulfillment is a real touchy one for me. I want to feel like I made life better for others and I had a purpose. I know my parents love me and they always tell me how proud they are, but I know eventually they will be gone and I don’t want to be left with a job I hate and be alone. I want to know once I retire I served a greater purpose. What makes you all feel fulfilled? 

How do you all not feel alone? Or how do you not feel upset when you are alone? As I mentioned earlier, I used to see and interact with people every day in school, and that allowed me to enjoy my time alone. But now that I’m feeling more alone, I don’t like it. I know I’m not really alone, but once I graduate university this fall I will begin the process of moving out from my parents’ house and will then need to meet others. I know I can still visit them, and I plan to, but I really don’t want to be upset and by myself when I come home everyday. 

Lastly, extreme negative thoughts. I think to myself during the day many things I know I shouldn’t even worry about. For example, I think about what if I can’t retire and die poor. My parents have taught me good financial practices and I’m getting my degree, but this is something that actively holds space in my mind. I also wonder what if I don’t ever find a partner. Who will take care of me when I need it? I’m terrified of the future uncertainty. How do you all avoid or cope with these thoughts?

I have talked to my parents many times about how I’m feeling and they are very supportive. I have also reached out to my sisters bf who is about 5 years older than me and he has given me some good advice. I have also scheduled an appointment with a mental health expert to talk more about my feelings next weekend, and if it helps I’ll continue to go. I would just like to hear some advice from others on what I could do to be a happier, more mentally healthy person.

My friend has been in a relationship with this guy for 3 going on 4 years now. Based on the time you might assume that it is a healthy, stable and loving relationship. WRONG. She complains to me all the time about how unhappy she is, at one point I got annoyed and told her to never tell me about her issues with him again (call me a bad friend but hear me out) . 

My logic was: If he makes you unhappy, why not just break up with him? I asked her that all the time and never got a clear response, until one day she was complaining to me and I just snapped (I was  dealing with my own issues, work , college the usual). After that day she didn’t utter a word to me about him. 

Several months later, I found out that the reason she wouldn’t break up with him is because every time she tries to end the relationship, he threatens to expose her by sending her nudes to her conservative parents (and other people). I was shocked, I confronted her about it and she broke down in tears. It’s now been a year since I found out and they’re still together. She still complains to me, I have no other solution for her other than , break up with him and be free, if she gets exposed then maybe that’s just something she’ll have to live with.

184,"I'm a college student aged 21. Seven weeks ago, my mom decided that she didn't want me to stay at home if I decide to return to work on campus. With COVID and all, she didn't think it would be fair for me to risk their health just to go back to work. If I decided to go back to work at any point, which I did, I couldn't come back home. Even when I move into my dorm, I cannot work any job if I want to move back home during the breaks. My mom was expecting me to not work AT ALL until this is over. I couldn't do that and chose to find somewhere else to stay. I have been living with my GF and her three roommates for the past seven weeks. School starts back in nine days, and it's time for me to move into my dorm. My mom is making it extremely difficult for me to retrieve my things. 

Initially, our lease was coming to an end. and we were supposed to be moving out of our house. During the time of us preparing to move out, she said I would have to wear a mask and gloves while moving my things. We ended up not having to move (cheaper rent was offered), but now I'm running into an issue. My mom is telling me that I'm not allowed to come inside to pack my things. I thought I would still be able to wear my face mask and gloves to move my things but no. She says that she will FaceTime me and I can tell her what all I need and she'll put it outside into the garage for me to get. She doesn't want me walking back and forth through the house moving my belongings. 

I wouldn't be opposed to this idea if my things were already packed. Before I left to go stay with my GF, I started packing some of my things but not everything. I do NOT want my mom packing or going through my things. My mom is the kind of person that will throw all of your things into a big trash bag and tell you good luck. I don't know how to handle this situation. If I let her move it, my things will either come back to me damaged, mishandled, or even completely missing. I could also try and plead my case, but I doubt it would work. I'm not going to lie to you guys. I am afraid of my mom. Growing up she was financially, verbally, and emotionally abusive. 

I'm afraid to have anyone get involved out of fear of her retaliating against me. She has all of my identification documents (SSC, Birth certificate, etc.). My main bank account is a teen checking account linked to her bank account. She has complete access to all of my money. I tried to open a separate college checking account this month, but the bank couldn't verify my information. They said it could be due to a freeze on my credit report that only she knows the code to. I now have to go through her for the documents to open a new account. She also told me that I couldn't have my car while staying with my GF. This means that my GF has had to drive me everywhere. She has had to leave work 10-15 minutes early just to get me to work at a decent time. I feel so bad, and I've been crying nonstop because of how frustrating things are. 

What would you do in my situation and how would you handle it?",16Aug2020,1

I’m 25 and my kids father (34 m) and I have been split up for going on two years. We have two children together Ana (10 year old girl) and Robert (2 year old boy). Recently he has become more involved with his children which is great. My kids love going over their fathers house and seeing their fathers side of the family. He recently (about 4 months ago) got a girlfriend. He currently lives with his parents and already moved his girlfriend in his parents home. 

My kids only go over their fathers house about once a week and stay overnight. Their grandparents have a big pool and yard. I live in a small house in the city and with quarantine there is not much for them to do here. I have asked many times if my kids can go over their grandparents to swim with their cousins. I have been told no because his girlfriend lives there now and he’s not ready for them to meet the kids. Which I think is unfair to my children. Why move someone into your house if you aren’t ready for them to meet your children?

I’m at the end of my rope with this situation because there is an entire family vacation planned where my children’s father, his girlfriend, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins will be staying under one roof at the beach. My children were the only ones not invited! I understand not inviting my 2 year old because it would be an entire week without me and he’s heavily attached to me. But my daughter is 10 and deserves to go on a vacation with her family! 

I have tried to bend over backwards so my children can go on this vacation. I told them I’d stay at the beach too at a separate hotel and he can get the kids half the time at the beach and I can get them the other half of the time. Spending 100s of dollars of my own money so my children don’t feel like outsiders in their own family. Since he’s not ready for the kids to meet his girlfriend I said she can drive down a few days later (it’s about 2 1/2 hours away from their house) but he wasn’t having that. 

Finally he told me that my oldest can go as lounge as she is okay with being around his girlfriend. I told my daughter about the entire vacation and she agreed to meet his girlfriend and was excited to go. Then he literally got mad at me for putting him in the position where I “forced them to meet” and said he’s not going. So now my daughter doesn’t even get to go. Now his entire family who I was extremely close to is mad at me for “ruining their family vacation”. Am I wrong here? I don’t feel like I am, I am extremely hurt that out of the 10 grandchildren my kids were the only ones not thought of and that his entire family and him are putting his girlfriend ahead of my innocent children.

Hi, I think I might have Borderline Personality Disorder, and I honestly don’t know what to do.
I think I’ve had all the symptoms since I was 14/15 :depression; intense and uncontrollable anger without reason; weird relationships with everyone in my life (they are either the best people in the world or the worst and only want to make me suffer); I constantly fear that the people I love will abandon me and I often create scenarios in my head where they leave as a form of training for when they will actually leave, also every time I meet someone I immediately pinpoint what is going to tear us apart like I already know it will happen ; I have a very chaotic sense of identity, either I am god or the worst piece of sh*t on this planet, this applies both morally and physically (some days I honestly don’t know what I look like); I get really upset (again creating scenarios in which i fight or get abandoned) over minor things like friends not answering text or boyfriend being “””different””” than usual. 
I don’t know what to do, I can’t go to a psychologist because my mother would never pay for it (I’m 22 and study all day), and even if I could what do I say “ hello I think I have this disorder”?!? Is it something you can do?! 
In September a psychological center in my town will offer three free meetings with a specialist for people who need psychological assistance, i would like to go there and hear what they think I can do but I’m scared as shit to go there and waste their time (I often feel like that my situation is not that bad and that there is no need to be so worried). 
Can someone help me figure out what to say once I get there? Or give me any advice or stop my rambling if you think i am overreacting?

196,"Okay, first of I’m not pregnant. But my mom (43) is. She is really excited about having another baby, but here’s the thing: 

Both my parents were never emotionally available for me, especially since I got I to puberty. The way they raised me made me into an anxious, arrogant, ignorant and all around bad person. I don’t want the same for my little brother.

He will be born at around 20th October, and the only one who has even bought clothes to begin is, was me. I spent all I had for him, and even though my mom liked the stuff, she didn’t even thank me for it..

In the end I think they would do a decent job with the baby, but I already know that I will have to look after him every day. Especially when he gets older.

I’m physically tired lol was moving furniture all day and it’s so fucking hot lol at least I’m done with that, need to take a break and do computer work before calling it haha 

Well I haven’t gotten East yet, I was secretly hoping you were going to tell me how it is first lol at the school there’s tons of books and I just randomly grabbed A Handmaid’s Tale! 

It’s crazy how the heat impacts performance - the difference between running in the day as opposed to at night, is literally night and day 😝  omg when the heart rate gets that high, feels like you’re dying lol that happens to me and it’s not like I’m breaking records either; running can make me feel so out of shape sometimes lol  I like running at night not just because it’s easier but something about it is cool knowing while everyone else is taking it easy, I’m still getting after it, or it’s more private, not distracted by scenery! Although lately I’ve been doing the bare ass minimum lol I’m still working on that whole balance thing haha 

Omg that’s awful!! Are you going to be okay?! I am sure talking about it over the phone would be easier to explain but ah that’s awful! That’s criminal by the company or whoever is doing that crap!

In that time I constantly argued with my mother for her choices and my father would come home an hour not say a single word to me and leave. I heard rumors he met with someone constantly parked at some apartment and has been cheating on my mother for a few months prior. He blocked me on social media and my number for a while. My mother would ignore my advice and just drink and constantly tried to get him home. A physical altercation happened between my mother, brother, and me (no one was harmed just some shoving) I hold it against my mother because it was her doing and hold it against my father more because had he been present it wouldn't have happened. After the midway point I was just constantly arguing with everyone and left the house for hours (work and a nearby trail made the time fly). These past few months has caused me to lose respect for both my parents, have little to no communication with my brother, and I'm sorta on talking terms with my sister. Now my parents are back together as if nothing happened and want me to call and sit down and talk to them like I normally would. I feel detached from everyone and frankly couldn't care less what they say or do now. I don't think I'm ready to just forget what they did. Thoughts?

203,"I was a barista for a local business and made super good tips and better money than anyone I know my age.  I'm in college (21yo) and I work full time but I honestly loved my job. I was really proud of our product and our brand and I really liked my work environment. Then COVID happened. We were out of work for a month then I was on FMLA for 23 days after suffering 3rd degree burns to my leg and feet. That happened April 19th and my burns just finished closing up. I was back to work with some restrictions for about a month. Then 3 weeks ago they laid off 75% of their employees, keeping only 4. This was a huge restaurant that would average 25k in sales on a Saturday and now we were making less than $5k on Saturdays. We were all making practically nothing. 


They encouraged us to reapply when things pick back up and one of the girls they decided to keep put in her two weeks shortly after they laid everyone off. I saw they reposted my position so I reapplied. I was the longest standing non manager employee. They didn't even reject me. I found out today they hired some random person. They didn't even send me a rejection email. Aldi wouldn't even hire me.



 I applied to literally 100 jobs then got hired as a remote contact tracer at about 75% of my former wage ($12/hr). I'm just really hurt that they hired some random person after how hard I worked their. I worked 14 hour shifts with no breaks when times were tough and we couldn't find any employees. I was there when the restaurant opened in the first place. It was all so exciting and I really cared about that place which sounds dumb. 



It's not that I'm not excited about this job. It's just that everything seems so uncertain. I was hoping I could save enough so that when I transfer to a 4 year university I could do an internship or something to get experience so I can get into a good grad school or masters program. Idk how I'm going to be able to save much now making so much less. I am already really frugal and eat out max once a week dont spend on anything etc. 



I've struggled with depression since I was 8 and I know I've been getting better. But 2 weeks ago when they told me I didn't have to come back to the wound care clinic I felt nothing. I should've been happy that all the pain and struggle was over and I got so lucky, my foot was totally numb for weeks after I was burned but my nerve function has totally returned and I have no issues with my muscles or the scar tissue pulling at my toes. I got lucky. I really did. And I'm starting to feel better about everything slowly. But I'm so anxious and afraid for the future. I was homeless for a few months at 18 but I still stayed in college and struggled to pay tuition when my dad refused to sign my FAFSA and now I'm here and idk how I will finish my bachelors let alone get my masters or Ph.D like I want to. I've been on the Dean's list for 3 semesters and I volunteer at my school but the financial aid office for the school in my area wont even respond to my emails anymore.

I had a conversation when I was thinking of doing a social distancing activity earlier today  (I cancelled after speaking to her) and asked for open and honest communication between us.

208,"[TL;DR: basically a very toxic guy who has a lot of concerning traits]

There is this guy I met at a party, there were a LOT of red flags, but I figured it was cuz we were all a bit drunk and it was fine, so we became friends and it was fine, at first. he immediately started to dump all of his problems on me, I wanted to help so I listened, but it started to really take a toll on my mental health, because I would try my best to help him but it was super hard because he asked for advice but would refuse to listen to it. So that was really tough already, but then I started to notice other bigger red flags. 

he would get this weird obsession with a girl, and I mean not just a crush, a creepy OBSESSION after just a couple of days of knowing her, he would constantly check when she was last active on Snapchat or Instagram, and he would get super pissed if she didn't answer his texts or Snapchats when she was active on other social media, not just annoyed, straight up ready to drive to her house, he also has pretty much stalked her on snap maps and shown up at the same restaurant because she was there and acted like it was a coincidence, I was genuinely shocked that he was doing this, and when I told him that his behavior was unhealthy and he needs to stop and that if she doesn't like him, stalking her isn't going to change anything. 

he also doesn't understand what it's like to have a job, his family is very rich and he doesn't need to work, so he doesn't understand or respect my work schedule at all. I'll be working and he will start calling my phone. I'll text him and say I can't pick up because I'm at work and ask what he needs, in case it's an emergency or something, he'll respond with something like ""lol I'm just bored, entertain me."" and start to blow my phone up and continuously call me and FaceTime me. I tried to explain to him that he can't keep doing that because I get in trouble. He laughed it off and continued to do it. also he expects me to call in sick like 20 minutes before my shift because he wants to hang out. and doesn't get it when I tell him I can't just call in sick every time I don't feel like working, because that is just rude and awful to everyone else who has to cover for me. 

he constantly says creepy stuff to me about my body, and he's ""jokingly"" said he would kidnap and f*ck me if he could, and when I got mad he said it was a compliment. I've toldhim to stop and he ignored it. I get that he thinks it's a compliment, but it just isn't something that's funny in any situation, also I feel like, number one you shouldn't say that to anyone for any reason, and number two, if anyone asks you to stop doing or saying something that makes them uncomfortable and isn't smiling or laughing he should stop, I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive or if I'm overreacting. 

I know this is a really trivial problem but I really need advice on how to cut him off. It's getting to a point where I get extremely anxious when I see his name and I have started to completely avoid social media just to avoid him.

He keeps trying to call me and I really just don't feel comfortable talking to him at all, should I just risk it and block him on everything? I just feel bad because I know his problems are valid and that he also deserves to have someone listen to him, am I being selfish if I cut him off?",16Aug2020,1

i’m just alone, and everything is getting really hard. i threw my life away and didn’t keep those who mattered close to me. i made so many mistakes that i can’t take back. looking back on it all is so hard and it makes me feel like complete shit. it’s making me cry now as i type this. 

i’m not sure what to do. part of me wants to end it, the other part of me wants to prove to myself i can be happy again just as a challenge.  i’ve tried getting therapists but i’ve never been able to talk to them like i should. i’ve tried countless meds, none of them worked. 

i just honestly don’t know how to move forward when things are constantly getting worse. it’s like i’m falling in an endless pit and even if i do manage to stop myself from falling it’ll be years before i claw myself out.

213,"The lady next door adopted a chihuahua-dachshund mix three or four years ago and it has been barking since. I'm literally growing up to a dog barking next door and I haven't gotten used to it. I'm not kidding, it barks from 9am to 9pm on most days and NON STOP too. There have been many times where a family member has been sick or is studying, and the dog barks its head off for twenty minutes at a time and this causes frustration every single time.

The lady wanted to adopt this type of dog because she said it's really cute. She obviously researched the dog because she is very particular about it, so she must have known that this mixed dog is very yappy, high energy, and aggressive. It even bit one of her tenants once and she blamed it on the tenant for walking through the back lane. 

We've tried to speak to the neighbour many, many times over the course of the few years the dog has been here. We suggested doggy training, but she said she doesn't have the time. We suggested muzzles, even gave her good brands to try out and she told us it's animal abuse. It has jumped over a fence and into our yard and was barking in my face once (I cried on the spot and the lady said ""I'm so sorry, he's just like that""). We tried to tell the woman that it's not dog abuse to put a muzzle on your dog while training it. not to bring other stuff into this topic, but she's the type of person who brings her own trash in multiple bags to public trash cans near bus stops because she thinks it stinks up her own trashcan. (She does this every week).

 I'm so sick of this owner being so selfish. If she can't train her dog, why did she get it? I'm literally scared of this dog biting me because every time I come home from an activity, the dog runs out of the house and barks at me at the fence, occasionally jumping over it to bark and snarl at my feet. 

Today my mom tried to talk to her about the dog again. The woman blamed it on my mom and said she's too sensitive and everyone else in the neighbourhood doesn't care. (The neighbours do care, we're all sick and tired and we all talked to her at some point about her dog). Then she blamed the behavior on the fact that the dog is a rescue and probably very traumatized and she's offering the best home it will ever have. 

Two years ago someone was called to investigate and the dog was COMPLETELY SILENT the entire visit, so nothing was found. The authorities don't want to visit again. What can we do about this? How do I shove some sense into this selfish woman???",16Aug2020,1

216,"Two years ago, my (13F) sister (Lily) was a stillbirth, it was absolutely shocking and painful for everyone. Her birthday was supposed to be on May 10th, 2018.

Flash forward to today, me and mom had a screaming match. My friend was over and I got mad at my mom for being drunk/arguing with my step dad on the phone in front of her. It got pretty intense, she eventually burst into tears and yelled ""you remind me of Lily every time you yell like that! This is why she's not fucking here!!"" before slamming the door to her bedroom. I nearly cried but didn't until my friend's mom picked her.

Anyway, after my sister's death, my mom started drinking alot and started getting pissed at me for small things. (once she straight up slapped me for literally ""staring at her the wrong way"") But I thought she was just depressed over my sister's death, I didn't know she actually blamed me for it. 

Back in 2018, I had something really traumatic happen to me that year (Literally right around the time of stillbirth) and it put my entire family through a lot of stress. Until they found what happened and who caused it, I would take my anger out on them and scream/pick fights with them because I don't know how else to handle that I was feeling. I think the stress of this is what caused her to miscarriage.I still feel really guilty but I see a therapist twice a month who flat out told me that it wasn't my fault.

218,"Sorry for the needlessly verbose title, I am an 18 year old heading off to college, and thus far my life has really sucked. I lived with an extremely abusive mother which resulted in me being suicidal/not having a social life for all of high school. Add this to the fact that I went to a very affluent private school, and I have spent pretty much my entire life in a bubble. I never hung out with a single person outside of school in HS or MS (wasn't allowed), and just feel like something has been stolen from me that I can't get back.

I am going to a top 10 liberal arts college which, while very good, is very small, affluent, and feels like a continuation of the same group of people I have spent my life around.

Even if its kind of cringey I really just want to have the teenage edgy phase I was never allowed to have, and learn to skate or smoke behind a parking lot.

219,"My girlfriend is just way too emotional. I have to use kiddie gloves everytime I even talk to her. If I ever speak in an unhappy tone, even if I'm annoyed or just tired, she'll get pouty and won't talk to me until I apologize even if she's in the wrong. 

For example, today she told me she wanted to come over to hang out so I cleared my schedule and got ready to go pick her up. For the next 6 hours though, she just kept on telling me that she would just be a couple minutes more. Finally she told me that she was too scared to leave her room bc she was anxious of interacting with all her roommates that were outside in the living room. I certainly understand being social anxious bc I can be the same sometimes too and I bet that she didn't want to tell me bc she might've felt a bit ashamed to say, but not communicating and keeping me on hold for 6 hours is a shitty thing to do. When she told me that, I told her I wished that she had told me sooner bc I was j waiting forever, but she got upset and pouty and wouldn't really say anything until I just told her to get ready for bed and I would do the same and then hung up.

Her behavior is always like this: self-absorbed, immature, and wayyy too easily hurt. It's really starting to bother me bc I have to put all my stuff on hold to appease her and try to comfort her. How do I deal with this? It would be impossible for me to try to talk to her about this bc she'd burst into tears.

And there are other people that can handle these things.   I just got the positive test yesterday.    Not only would I be endangering other employees but I have to handle customers property as well.  How big a deal is this?",16Aug2020,1
221,"So I think I have Aphantasia. Aphantasia is where you can't visualize things properly in your mind. I don't see nothing, but it's not very clear... like I feel like I can imagine it, but not see it fully. I didn't realise this was a thing until about 10-30 minutes ago.

I can see things really clearly in my mind when I'm asleep, but when I'm awake, it's really only half there. It's really hard to describe.

One of my favourite things to do to pass time is daydream. I love daydreaming, and, I'm about to expose myself, but I sort of make up scenarios in my head that I play out, and pretend I'm a part of... like... roleplaying... but in my head??? For example, one thing I've been doing recently is pretending I'm a streamer on a platform like Twitch. I guess I just do this to feel some sort of human connection when I feel lonely (which is more often now that we're back in level 3 (I'm in Auckland)).

I've looked it up and it seems like there might be something you can do to improve your visualization. It's called Image Streaming, and apparently you have to say what you see after you rub your eyes, or close your eyes after looking at a bright light aloud. You have to do it for like, 10-30 minutes a day or whatever, and after a few days apparently you start to see results. I'm a little bit sceptical, and I don't really want to say things aloud (even though you have to for this method to work, supposedly) because I live with other people, and I'm really self-conscious about them hearing me when I do things like speaking or singing etc.

I have now convinced myself I have Aphantasia, and it's making me really nervous and upset, because I like to believe I'm a creative person.

I really don't know what I should do. Should I just try Image Streaming and see what works??? Or just accept it??? What should I do?

Side note: I can create imaginary scenarios from pieces of given information like a book reasonably ok. It can take a minute, but once I'm there it seems alright... I think it might just seem worse because I'm trying so hard to visualize things?

Do I have Aphantasia? Honestly, I'd like to give you a definitive answer, but I simply don't know.",16Aug2020,1

225,"Today I just finished my university program where I earned two undergraduate degrees (mathematics and business) in 5 years. I gained alot of internship experiences at great companies, and built a good path for myself career wise and academically. I'm even doing post grad and have work lined up too.

Yet, part of me still thinks I failed. I never made finding a boyfriend a priority since I wanted to invest in my career/academics. And now that I'm at this spot where it sort of feels like it should now be something I should be looking at, I feel like I failed. Everyone around me and at my age (23f) seems to be in a relationship or have gotten engaged so I'm starting to get in the ""i'll never find a bae"" mindset even though I've tried dating shortly last year.

226,"Idk if I'm taking this too seriously or not, but here we go. I was hanging out downtown with my friend. We were goofing off, poking each other, playfully slapping each others hands, legs, etc. It's pretty normal for us to show platonic physical affection. And then out of nowhere they like- touched my crotch for half a second. At the time I didn't even think anything of it. I didn't feel uncomfortable. I didn't feel violated. They didn't mention anything about it afterwards. We spent the rest of the time goofing off downtown. 

Then right after I got home I sort of remembered what had happened. And for background information, I'm a CSA survivor. So because of that past c h i l d h o o d t r a u m a, a part of me is worried that this person was being p r e d a t o r y. But it's also entirely possible that they didn't mean to do that at all and was just trying to grab my leg or something. They have never done anything like this or exhibited any predatory behavior before. There haven't been any red flags before this, and we've been extremely close friends for about a year now. 

It's also possible that they may have impulsively decided to do that thinking it would be funny. They can be very impulsive and not think things through sometimes, but it's never led to anything like this before. 

They've never expressed any sexual interest in me. In fact this person identifies as asexual. I don't think they were trying to like- take advantage of me sexually or anything. But if it wasn't an accident (and it may have been), then why did they do it? If they did that bc they thought it would be funny or something, even if I didn't personally feel violated by it, what if they later went and did that to someone else ""as a joke"" and that person *did* feel violated by it?

I think I should just talk to my friend about this and ask why that happened. But idk how to even start that conversation. If it was an accident, good. I can move on with peace of mind. If they thought it was funny, I will tell them that even if they didn't mean harm, it was uuuuh kind of *yikes* to just do that out of nowhere, and I will ask them to never do that again. And if they do it again I will drop them. I genuinely do not believe that they did this out of sexual interest. Even my paranoid brain doesn't see that as something they would ever do. That was just- not the vibe at all that I got from the situation, and they've never once given me that vibe in any situation. But no matter what it was, I just need to know.

As much as I want to write it off and ignore it, the 
t r a u m a t i z e d part of my brain cannot write it off without an explanation. Even though I find it highly unlikely that this person is a predator, I wouldn't want to ignore a possible red flag for years only to later find out that they actually were. Even if it's such a low possibility. So I do need answers in order to feel fully comfortable. I just don't know how to initiate a conversation like that. 

I was hesitant to put this on reddit bc reddit has a tendency of instantly declaring people as toxic and predatory often with missing context. But I guess I'm desperate enough for advice.

Oh and for context we are both high school students around the same age.",16Aug2020,1
227,"Hi im 16 and I have been obese my whole life! 2019 I decided to change and made huge improvements during quarantine. I used to be at a all time high 260 and now I weigh 198 still heavy but it’s progress.

Here’s how this story starts. Meet my friend for 4+ years A. A is a great person we share the same interest and we have fun whenever we hang out. Because of quarantine I felt alone and after some texting I said I might as well shoot my shot because I have nothing to lose. 

I confessed but she sadly didn’t feel the same way. I at the time was pretty happy because it was the first time that I confessed my feelings.

Over time tho the rejection made me feel sad. I never get angry over rejection because I feel like people don’t owe you a thing. But this one hurt me because I began questioning myself wether I was good looking enough. The truth is I like how I look. Im a solid 7 in my book. But for her I could be a 3. Everyone is different.

The thing is tho rejection from approaching does not hurt at all but because she was my best friend this just keeps hurting. Sadder part is that I did not fall in love because of her looks. I felt like we were compatible and we would be able to grow together.

We are just friends now and whenever we hang out with the gang I kinda feel bad for telling how I felt but I never try to show it. The thought of someone else with her just hurts me. But it shouldn’t!!!

I really love that girl. I really do. I cry sometimes when I  feel like im not enough. I only think about her at night because during the day I actually go out and do stuff like playing soccer or working out to make me feel fulfilled. 

I don’t know im just a teen trying to have a relationship and get my life together. It’s really sad that I have been rejected. But I know that confessing to a long time friend is a no no from now on. 

I truly believe I am enough and that I will find someone but this just hurts man. Idkw feel free to give me any advice! Also I don’t plan to “win her over” because I can’t! Just to be clear we’re just friends.",16Aug2020,1
228,I am pretty much completely against this behaviour but he insists and his dad will freak if he finds out. What should I do?,16Aug2020,1
230,"Hi guys, so I don’t know really where to start. For as long as I could remember, my dad has had a temper. It’s not usually something you can see coming, a switch just flips and suddenly it’s a fight or flight situation. When I was little I would get grounded for literally anything, and my mom would not get involved but instead try and calm me down. This went on for years, but my dad would tell me he loves me after a few days of me being terrified of him, so I would just believe it. We’ve had the cops show up because of him a few times, but anytime someone presses charges on him they drop it. Ultimately being on my dads good side is better than being on his bad side. 
He’s the provider for the house, making a pretty good salary working for UPS. But he uses money as a Hail Mary so essentially he doesn’t think he should be help accountable for his actions because he buys people things, or he owns expensive items. 
My senior year of high school he kicked me out a few different times, one resulted in me transferring schools a few months before graduation and living with my sister. Then I went to college, lived in the dorms for about a semester.. I was bullied heavily because I have anxiety that kind of distorts how I perceive interactions with people. So my father of course came to the rescue and paid for an apartment for me. It was okay for a while because i didn’t see or speak to him on the regular. But when COVID hit, my lease was up. So instead of renewing my lease I moved back in thinking things would be different. It was okay for awhile. 
So when things went south, it really just wasn’t a surprise for me. I was picking him up from a rental car place and everything was okay at first. I asked how his week at work was, we talked about getting my brother to stop staying up late, the usual. Then the song “DGAF” by the All-American Rejects came on my playlist. He turned off my radio and began to yell at me, saying he wasn’t going to listen to my bullshit. I turned back on my radio and changed the song. The new song was “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” by Set it Off. He then turned off my radio again and started to hit my hands. After arguing a little bit, I stopped at a red light and he ripped the keys out of the ignition of my car and made me switch seats. Then we’re driving and he is still arguing with me and calling me names such as “a stupid little bitch” and threatening to hit me. I told him if he lays a hand on me, I will call the police. As we get to another light he taunted me to call the police as one was across the street in oncoming traffic. Obviously I didn’t call because I was scared. He’d already tried and threatened to hit me. He said if the police were called all they would do is tell me to respect my father. 
We turn onto another road, arguing continues, and then he starts to hit me in the head. When I get away he pulls across two lanes to the side of the road and makes me get out and leaves me in a pretty bad part of our neighborhood. By myself. 
I came back later that night to get a few things because I had decided I’m moving out to stay with a friend. He yelled and screamed for me to get out of his house and that he never wants to see me again. He chased me out of the house. Now my mom just brings me things, because it’s kinda an unspoken truth that im no longer welcome. 
I filed a police report yesterday. This isn’t the first time he’s hit me, my siblings, or anyone. This isn’t his first time having the police called on him. Immediately after the officer came to talk to him he disabled my phone number, knowing if they can’t reach me they’ll close the case. I finally got my phone turned on today and I will be reaching out to the police to let them know I’m following through with pressing charges. My mom is helping me when she can by bringing me my clothes and driving me places when my dad isn’t around. I don’t have a car or a roof to call my own. I have like $1000 to my name. I have a dog (and I’m not getting rid of him.. the only thing keeping me going is my dog).
I just want to get some advice on how to pick up and move on. I’m a senior in college, I have roughly 4 classes left before I receive my bachelors degree in Forensics. I’m 20 years old. I’m doing this by myself. I don’t know what I’m doing or where to start. I have a  job at an elementary school that doesn’t pay nearly enough to live. I have a job interview next week. 
Any advice, words of encouragement, anything is appreciated really. I need help.",16Aug2020,1

I would try and communicate with her about the issue but I'm way to afraid to tell litterly anyone ik about me being possibly bi. What should I do.

232,"i thought i’d never have to resort to coming to reddit to talk about my loneliness but here i am lol. i’m an 18 year old male who’s fairly social, always trying to stay in shape and working. anyways, i’ve been pretty lonely for a majority of my teens, but one thing that recently has been taking a toll on me is my stupid ass decision making. 
  
i say that because i’ve had the chance to build a relationship with a friend of a friend and eventually started dating her, however the mutual between us had gotten jealous and took advantage of my past feelings for her and i fell for the trap, in turn made out with her when we had gotten drunk at a party one night. when i awoke the next morning i told my s/o immediately because i felt mad fucking guilty for everything.

and here i am now about 2 months later after the incident alone with my thoughts. i apologized time and time again and cut ties with the mutual and there’s obviously a positive difference in my life without her, but i honestly miss my ex. i always tend to think about her and i just can’t move on. she was the first female willing to give me the opportunity in the last 5-6 years. like i said, i’ve been facing loneliness for quite a while and it’s such a heavy emotional toll on my mental state mixed with other demons. i just want to be in the right state of mind again cause everything is honestly collapsing on me now aside from this struggle i speak of.

I want an attractive , smart and caring women , but it seems i was sucked in by the devil. 

Tonight i asked this girl , why do u behave like this, why is the first thing you do when you get mad at me is post naked pics on the internet, her reply was “you know what you signed up for” 

Its so hard for me to leave cause i love her , feel like i need to be slapped hard in my face and a wake up call. 

But im done. Like women are hard to talk to im scared of being alone . Losing the place i live in , and so much more. Im gonna start looking for my own place. 

But i cant take this. Her fucking around on ne, screwing other guys.

I know most of u are thinking why havent u left. Its so hard guys when u share a place to live and u have so much to lose it almost feels easier to stay with that perosn ,

235,"So this guy, an older friend of my boyfriend, met me through a D&amp;D campaign hosted and GM by my boyfriend. After the first session he [privately messaged me](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/351909445678137344/744415371045634120/image0.png) 

Context: I am a bird lady in the campaign and Mary is another player 


So upon hearing this and feeling uncomfortable, I brought it up to my boyfriend who said [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/351909445678137344/744415921812275270/image0.png)

So therefore I didn’t block him at that moment. However he is 25 and I’m 17 so like ahhhhh weird. We kept talking and it’s been casual for a while. We mainly talked about our lives and art until I started getting more messages that made me feel weird such as [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/592575101707485194/744072139774099556/image0.png)

237,"I don’t know what to do about this.

Here’s some context:

I’ve spent the last few years through some rough stuff. My family has had trouble with money for a good while now, and it’s been building up resentment inside of me the fact of having to go through poverty. When I was around 15-16 things were fine, but ever since like 4 years ago everything has gone downhill. I’ve also had two cats die and my grandma too. 

I used to live in Spain til 2015 and I felt with a sense of purpose. Didn’t have too many friends there, but I felt like it was the perfect context for my own personal development. I had to move back to Mexico (where I was born) because of money. 

I ended up losing two years of school because of some problems with the fact that there are differences in the documents related to middle school, which is 4 years in Spain but 3 in Mexico. 

Ever since I came, I have felt completely out of context. I don’t identify with the culture, I don’t like the people in general.. etc I even feel quite angry at how the context is here. Everything about this country pisses me off.

I have felt like time has gone too fast. Like everything has lost meaning in a way. Maybe it’s maturing, but nothing feels new or special. I have relied solely on trying to become self disciplined and better myself to have hope about things. 

My parents are also divorced, and through maturing I’ve come to see that they’re not as great as I thought they were when I was a child. I feel hostile towards them sometimes. It might not be intentional, but I’ve had days where I have felt hungry and couldn’t do anything about it, and yet my parents have told me to be grateful and have got really angry at me for complaining. 

I’ve had some issues with my dad. He’s had an affair with a girl that’s like 24 and he’s 57. Honestly I find it kinda disturbing. It really annoys me to hear how he talks to her and constantly gets into arguments. It feels like he’s just being dumb for staying with someone immature. I cant help but think that, maybe I am projecting. I fully respect any decision he does though, it’s none of my business. I also take issue with him having argued with me in a way that has felt like blackmail sometimes. My mom has been well off for like two years now and I was with her for like 1 year cause my campus was near her house and he would constantly say that he didn’t want to feel abandoned. It feels manipulative. Anyway, I’ve been living with him for 6 months now, because I want to be honest and have integrity. I have no interest in being with whomever has the most money. That would be disgusting. I only am here because I get along better with my dad. I don’t care if things are very uptight with money, although I will say it irritates me often to live in such a depressing place. 

Going into my twenties, I’ve tried to become more emotionally mature. I fell in love with some girl I shouldn’t have fallen for last year, and I had one of the most excruciatingly painful experiences in my emotional life. She toyed with me for months on end until I saw her snogging some other guy. I completely cut all ties from that point. I still think about her sometimes. I think I had fallen for her really hard by the point I realized she was only toying with my feelings. She was very manipulative and would lie about having things with other guys, which she did. I think I’ve become quite avoidant in my attachment style because of it. I always kinda was since childhood, but I think it only accentuated it further. Girls aren’t even fun to talk to anymore. I just lose interest.


I’ve also thought seriously about getting my first job, getting money for myself and helping my family. 

Anyways, because of these reasons I feel constantly in a bad mood. When I’m alone I feel just fine. I’m an introvert, so I feel okay, but when it comes to talking to anybody in my family I feel irritated and usually try to say the least amount of words possible and cut conversations short. I don’t know why. Especially as of late, I’ve felt particularly angry. I’ve ended up kicking, breaking and hitting furniture or other things. I don’t know, I feel like anger is taking over me at times. I feel so fucking livid when I think about how life has been, how poverty has felt, when I think about my dad and his gf, when I think about my shitty classmates and the fact that I don’t belong in this country.",16Aug2020,1

239,"So i (f16) live half time with each of my parents. They split up about 6 years ago now, however it was a very messy breakup and it hit my dad especially hard, to the point where I can remember him constantly drinking and even talking about suicide at one point. I was (gratefully) shielded from a lot of what happened, but my older sister saw a lot more and it affected her quite a bit. Anyways, within the next 2 years he actually healed a lot and really came back around. He hardly drank, he was getting out a lot, doing well, and had a new girlfriend. And that's how it went for about the next 3 years, up until around the beginning of this year. His girlfriend, who up until this time had been friendly and all over great, slowly became more and more shut out to the point where she completely ignores him and ghosts him for weeks and weeks. My dad has opened up to me about this a bit, and he doesn't understand why as there was no fight or anything. It largely started as a response to staying indoors due to covid and not wanting to see him/come over, however after months the situation just got worse. I understand that isn't something I should've done nor had any right to do, but in reading texts between them it's heartbreaking because he sends paragraphs and invites her over, wants to just chat, etc., and she leaves him on read every time to the point where there is no contact for weeks/a month. 

In response to this, my dad has basically relapsed to how he was with the divorce with my mother. He works very early mornings, and on work nights he's alright, but every night that he doesn't, he's blackout drunk. Every time. He drinks alone on the couch and passes out there, and I have to guide/carry him to his bed. He has some friends who come visit or that he goes for drinks with, however they've even commented to me about being frustrated because when they drink with him, he's always passed out early in the night, and it doesn't seem like they're taking any notice or care to an issue here. This has also affected his relationship with my sister, who doesn't come by anymore and won't talk to him, living full time with my mom now, and she refuses to help me or do anything, saying it's not her fault or problem. For the first time in my life now, when she talks about him, she calls him by his first name, not Dad. 
It hurts me to see him like this because it really feels like I'm the only one here. His girlfriend is not a girlfriend anymore, but she won't break up with him, and he won't break up with her because he still loves her, and it kills me to see. He's reverted to the exact same way he was 6 years ago, and it's something I never wanted to see again. He's abusing alcohol, and often when he has nothing to do he just goes for long walks alone (not to mention, he spends half the time that I'm not around living completely alone). When I go with him, he doesn't say anything. I'm really scared that he's depressed again and potentially suicidal and I have no idea what to do. I can't see an end to this situation, because I've tried bringing up the alcohol but he denies that he has a problem. He's not perfect, but I love him more than almost anyone. He came around so far a few years ago, and he's a good guy. In a lot of ways he's always been someone I look up to, and it hurts me so much to see him like this and be the only one here, and yet powerless. I tried talking to my grandma (his mom), and one of his best friends since childhood, but they both live hours away and I don't have a way to contact the friend.

241,"Just as a disclaimer, I know I’m the asshole in this situation, even though it can be a combined effort between us (U20M + U20F) to ensure this doesn’t happen. I want to hear advice from Reddit on how I can help myself be better, and how I can help myself out of this strong depression where I can’t really ask anyone I know for help.

I am in an intimate relationship with my girlfriend, and we have sex fairly often as of the New Year. We are healthy in how often we do it alongside other things, and are very happy together and always have been over these couple years. However, there have been three occasions where after the fact, she has a bit of a breakdown and we talk about how I could/should be using a condom sometimes. It should be noted she also takes Birth Control daily at the same scheduled time, which is an excellent contraceptive. I try to put myself in a situation where I have easy access to a condom, but find myself in tough situations where I’d lose my ability to do it if I had to run and grab one.

Today was a bad day. The day that I realized what I’ve done, and really understand how important it is that I make a change. I realize that I should have come to this conclusion a lot sooner, especially with how on-top of things I always am in my everyday life, but it didn’t really click until I realized how extremely important this is (we are both just under 20). We both had an extreme breakdown because she forgot her pill at home, and should have taken it at the time we finished intercourse. I know it doesn’t effect her hormone levels today at that time, but birth control isn’t perfectly 100% effective and she and I both know we don’t want to take that chance. 

I promised her that it will be on my mind always now, which is true. I’ll never forget today, it almost feels like I lost her even though she only left my house and didn’t actually break up or get angry. I said I will not use my part if I don’t have one to access, and if there is one, I will always use it from now forward. I always lose my drive when I wear one, which is what upsets me a lot, and I don’t know what I can do about it to make sure we still have a good time while I have one, but I need to make sure I’m smarter because I know how hard it is and can put myself in her shoes with this one.

What I ask from readers is a few things. What can I do to better myself? How can I be sure and catch myself being dumb? How can I help how upset I am that I’ve done this?

242,Hi I need advice I think I have POCD I’m not sure I need advice because sometimes I have memories of thinking that I did something wrong where for example I think it’ll make me think like I flirted with underage child or something like that where I haven’t and when I keep thinking about that memory in my head like obsessing over it then and this is how I honestly god feel but it’ll feel like doubts almost like wondering did I do it or maybe I didn’t and I get triggered easily when watching videos about pedofiles like a unwanted thought would come into my head it’ll make me think like I did something wrong with underage child but when I obess over it it’ll feel like doubts I’m not sure what to do I think it’s my ocd I’m just not sure  does anyone else have these thoughts in there head like I’ll get groinal response I just wanna say and clairfiy and I never hurt or touched a underage child and have no urge to I just need advice I been on setraline but does anyone think it’s my ocd and is anyone else going through it,16Aug2020,1
243,"Like the title says, I am way too competitive, especially with the stupidest things. When I play card games, board games, co-op video games... I am only having fun if I am winning. I can't handle smack talk from my ""opponents"" (normally family members or my wife). I dont dish it out normally myself.

My wife and I have had that talk where I need to just get out of my own head and enjoy the moment rather than the game, but for whatever reason it is nearly impossible for me to enjoy playing games unless I am winning.  After our last talk, I said I was done playing games if it was going to hurt/embarass her the way I do when I get that way. However, she does not want that option.

It happened again tonight, and I feel terrible after the fact... I really want to stop being this way.

What should I do? Do I need to just cut multiplayer games cold turkey? Has anybody else had this issue, and if so, what mechanism have worked to change that attitude?",16Aug2020,1
244,"I've always wanted to work with animals. It's my dream. I'm only 16 so I've got some time to figure stuff out but I cant help but worry. My dream is to be a zookeeper or dolphin trainer, but they dont really get paid well. I want to live a comfortable life. I have what you'd call suicide tendencies and have mental breakdowns quite often so I'm not sure how well I'd hold up as an adult. I made a promise to myself years ago that I'd only work a job with animals. I wouldn't be able to find motivation if I didnt.  My parents are constantly telling me that I shouldn't be a zookeeper, if I'm not a zookeeper than what can I be? I sure as hell am not going to put animals down as a living, I'd probably explode if I was a vet! So that leaves me with the question of what to do?  Most jobs with animals dont get paid well. I'm depressed as is and probably wouldn't survive working somewhere without animals. The real question is do you fulfill your dream and risk living in poverty and not being able to find a job or go down a stable career path to ensure you have money and risk becoming super depressed.",16Aug2020,1

246,"I don't know. She had just gotten off work (retail) and we were talking about stuff. She was really upset that mom had mistreated her this morning and we got onto the topic of how mom is really bad about discounting our life/career choices.

I'm a graphic designer and I've been saving up to move out. things are going pretty well, but mom discounts it all the time. saying that she doesn't see a dime from it so I'm just wasting my time.

I was trying to relate to my sister but she responded by saying I should just get a retail job. This caught me off gaurd since she seemed to supportive up until this point. 

I was trying to dessern what her motives were for saying that and she said, ""well if you want me to get into it-""

""no, please stop. I don't have the strength to hear whatever you're going tp say right now.""

she seemed annoyed by that and said, ""well, okay then. I'm gonna go to bed."" 

Is that it? statt saying that, and then walk away? I just don't know how to feel about this. 

I deal with some severe mental health issues. depression, anxiety, Purely Obsessional OCD. I was starting to reach the end of a really bad episode this week and feel better to work again. after this conversation I'm in a spiral. 

It feels like a rug has been pulled from under me. like the person who has been so supportive of my career choice is suddenly turning her back on me. I don't know exactly what she wanted to say but I can guess and it's not good. I feel alone. 

I'm disassociating really bad. I'm not sure what to do next. I know that I need to embrace uncertainty and all that but I just feel like a useless, uneventful, pile of shit without a hope for a future.

I need help but I have noone to turn to.",16Aug2020,1
247,"My brother and I are very close in age but do not have a close relationship at all. We always argue when we have a conversation. AnywAy we’re complete opposites. 

He used to fit in really well with my sister and I but then he started hanging out with some friends who were not good influences and he completely stopped hanging around us. His friends have a dark viewpoint on life and that has rubbed off on my brother. 

My brother graduated in 2019 and he has yet to have a job and does nothing except lay in the bed at my mom’s house. He finally decided he was going into the Air Force because my mom told him he needed to find a job or he had to do something because he could no longer lay in bed all day. 

So he left last Sunday to go to MEPS and they were flying from there to basic training. He got to basic training Tuesday. Friday he called my mom and told her he hurt his foot running and was in the medical unit/hospital/whatever it’s called. Saturday (today) he called mom and told her that he actually tried to kill himself and he’s being held in a psych ward for 72 hours and then he’ll be sent him. 

In the past he has expressed to my sister that he was depressed, and she told him to go see a therapist. my mom was offering to pay and wanted to help. But he has never attempted to kill himself. He’s never been motivated to do anything with his life. He didn’t really want to go to the Air Force either. 

I’m curious as to how to handle the situation. I’m not sure if he genuinely attempted to hurt himself or if he just wanted to get out of basic training. I understand that either way there is something wrong mentally to even act like you wanted to hurt yourself. But no one at the base has contacted my mom. He didn’t give her any details on how it happened. 

She can’t just let him go back to doing what he was doing and he is going to see a therapist. But how can we not baby him? I know depression is real but laying in the bed all day and not working cannot be a solution. And how can we tell if he was actually trying to hurt himself. He has never wanted to do anything in life. 

I also don’t know how we can leave him home alone all the time. My mom has to work and I’m in college but also have to work. How can we know he won’t hurt himself again if it was a serious attempt? 

*sorry if I sounded insensitive in any way but I’ve never had to deal with a situation like this.",16Aug2020,1
248,"My grandmother has battled cancer for nearly half of a decade. Multiple Myeloma has taken over her happiness, her life, and now is going to be the death of her. I have a strong connection with her because I, (F 19,) have spent my whole life with her. Throughout childhood she taught me how to read, and write. She accepted me for all of my flaws &amp; my sexualtity. It's weird to think about how quickly things have escalated. Just a day before she was admitted into the hospital, we were smiling and laughing together. I didn't know that the meal we had was going to be our last.   


So basically, she woke up with a high fever. A little over a hundred and three. She experienced Delirium, and it took many hours of convincing her to go to the hospital. She's a Gemini, so naturally stubborn as hell, lol. My Aunt was able to get her into the hospital. Now, this whole time my mom was relaying this info over the phone, since I had pulled an all nighter and was crashing late. (Poor habit of mine, I know.) She was admitted into the ER by that night, and brought into a room by the next afternoon.   


Days later, I built the courage to see her. I have a really big fear of hospitals, since I've had a history of poor mental health that's lead to two suicide attempts. But, I know that seeing my grandmother was important, and I saw her. ...I don't think I should have. The best way I could describe it was that she felt, and looked, like death. Her skin was cold, and the worst part was that she didn't remember me. She yelled at me as if I were a nurse. I told her how much I loved her, and that she'd be with her mother, friends, dog...she's a survivor. I hope the information settled, because my grandmother deserves to know that. She's the sweetest woman I ever met...and I love her. Seeing her so weak, so sad. The bleakness of the hospital room. I couldn't be there for long. I left the room after about an hour, unable to stop crying. After I saw my mom I basically crashed into her. Sobbing... Change for a young adult is scary enough, but I've never dealt with grief as heavy as this.   


Since I've seen her, she's had multiple small strokes, and can experience a large one at any moment. According to my mom she's calm, though confused. She's being moved to a place that's more comfortable, less of a hospital setting and more homey. I forgot the name of it.   


I don't know how to cope with this. I've been picking at my skin a lot more, and my intrusive thoughts have been more intense. I'm not suicidal. I have an amazing girlfriend, and for the first time my family seems to be genuinely bonding. I'm just scared of pushing them out of my life. I can't isolate. Right now I have medication, but no access to therapy.   


**Do any of you have healthy ways/methods of coping with grief?**  


TL/DR: My grandmother is dying, and didn't remember me during my final visit with her. I'm struggling with my mental health, and I'm not sure how to cope with losing the person who's raised, accepted, and loved me through thick and thin.",16Aug2020,1
249,"So I got a a chihuahua for my birthday when I was 12 and he happened to be pretty timid, shy and sometimes aggressive. He hides under stuff and runs away from ppl a lot. Nowadays he’s opened up to me and my grandma but still runs away and hides. My mom had bought a couch a while ago and I just realized that he had scabs on his back and I assumed it was from going under our couch. Looking at it now, there were staples on the bottom of it for some reason but me and my mom later took them off. He still goes under there messing up his back tho. I talked to my mom about getting a new couch and she said she plans on getting a new couch but idk when. I’m not gonna rush her tho. 

I thought of the idea of plugging the bottom of the couch with blankets but we don’t really have enough also my dog still might get under there anyway.",16Aug2020,1

251,"So a couple of weeks ago I made plans with some friends to go out to send one of my friends off for her trip.   
The one going on vacation (We'll call her ABC) was being weird the entire day when I was talking to her, saying she's hungover, her stomach hurts, she's feeling tired etc. Anyway, she cancels at the last minute. I told her straight up afterwards, if she wasn't feeling it, she should just let me know in advance so I don't waste time trying set things up for the night. She agrees, says she's sorry and says we'll go again when she comes back from her trip.

Fair enough, I was annoyed but things happens. I wasn't gonna let ABC cancelling (Despite this outing being planned for her) ruin our night. So I tell my other friend (Who we'll call XYZ) who was supposed to come in our groupchat that plans are still on for later at night.

XYZ does not respond to the messages or even check them. I call her, her phone goes straight to voicemail. Now im really annoyed. Cancelling is one thing but to completely ghost on me is on a whole different level of disrespect. I end up going bowling with one of my other friends and that was the night.  


I ended up not talking to XYZ for a couple of days, I figured if she wants to talk to me, she'll come. A couple days pass, she says hi in the groupchat. Knowing that she wasn't gonna address what had happened i sent her a DM asked her what happened that night and that my friend and I were waiting on her. I told her the same as I did to ABC: ""If you're going to cancel, that's fine. Shit happens. At least let me know next time so people don't wait on you.""  
She proceeds to say that she had spoken to ABC already on that day and knew she was cancelling so she assumed that plans were cancelled so she decided to stay home. I did not like that reason at all, but I let it slide, this is the first time she's ever done something like this, she's usually pretty consistent. She also says that in the future we can plan our outings better., and to be fair, the plans were done very poorly and last minute since we were trying to figure out where we wanted to go and at what time.  


Anyway, a couple weeks pass, I hadn't seen XYZ since then and ABC is gone on her trip. I suggest to hang out with some friends in our groupchat. No one's available except for XYZ. XYZ says she's down. Plans are done properly. Time and location were set.  
A couple hours before we're supposed to meet up, I get a message on the groupchat saying: "" This is so weird. I'm still drunk from last night, it's 10 in the morning and I still haven't slept yet"". Now I knew what this was from the get-go but I played dumb and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Once it was time to call her to tell her I was on the way, to no surprise, she doesnt answer. Great, she's flaked twice in a row now, without ever actually telling me anything. I just have to assume these things.

A few hours pass, and she goes on the groupchat saying she's awake now and asks what everyone is up to. No ""Sorry"". Nothing.   
And the thing about this is that, no one else in the groupchat was coming to begin with. It was just her, a friend of mine who is not in the groupchat, and me who were going. Now this did not sit right with me at all. She couldn't give me the decency of giving me a call back when she knows I already called earlier or send me a DM. Perhaps she was hoping that I'd have to act like nothing happened since there are other people in the conversation.

I left her on read.  I wasn't going berate her to begin with, but im not having a personal conversation in a group chat. I haven't spoken to her since, I dont think it's my duty to look for an explanation anymore. She knows what she did.

Now the reason why I come here is that I'm a very anxious person. I overthink everything and I'll find ways to blame myself. I feel like I reserved the right to be angry, but maybe leaving her on read wasn't the best idea? Is it too passive aggressive? I care about XYZ a lot, she's really a great friend usually, and its unlike her to do something like this. The anxious side of me is saying that she's doing this on purpose to push me away. Its been a couple days now and I still havent heard from her. Should I just let her come when she's ready to or do i do what I did last time and try to clear the air?",16Aug2020,1

The environment in that school is absolutely toxic, and if you aren’t an A student, you’re considered a failure or looked down upon. (basically my school is a bunch of rich bitches) anyhow, the school itself is already too much stress on me, but now i have the standardized testing coming up, my mother is pestering me to do drivers ed, i need to start practicing for my sports season, i have 3 books, 2 essays, and a biology experiment to complete in 12 days before school starts, that i am trying to get my volunteer hours for school, and on top of that i’m very concerned as my father and grandfather are sick. my friendship/relationship situation is shitty as well, and although i do confess my issues to people sometimes, i don’t feel like anyone really cares. 

anyways, enough with that rant. my issue is how to deal with stress and overwhelming feelings. I often get so overwhelmed that i crawl in bed and hide from responsibilities instead of doing anything at all. I really need to get my shit this year as i’m going into junior year, and it’s an important year for me. does anybody have any ideas for balancing your stress that won’t take up too much time? or how i can quit procrastinating and start doing the things i need to do.

257,"My mom &amp; I lived with a roommate that was an alcoholic (he hid it previously). A little under a month ago, the roommate and my mom got into an altercation. While I was on the phone with 911, he threatened to kill her. He was in jail for 72 hours then was released on bond/bail. Four days after being released, he was rearrested for aggravated stalking &amp; violating the no contact order. He was released on August 13 after being in jail for 18 days. 

I know I definitely need therapy because of this, but I’m currently uninsured (I’ve been trying to get it back for a few months). I do fully plan on seeking therapy once it’s reinstated. 

How can I deal with the anxiety from the PTSD? I don’t have panic attacks or anxiety attacks, but my body definitely prepares for fight or flight mode as soon as something reminds me of the situation (usually slamming doors or someone having loud footsteps). I keep thinking I hear him inside the house then my mind automatically jumps to thinking that he’s coming to “finish off” my mom and I &amp; especially think he’s going to shoot us (don’t know why my mind goes to guns... he doesn’t own one). 

I know in my conscious mind that my fears are relatively irrational but it’s still so frustrating to get put so on edge that I end up zoning out of conversations because I’m so paranoid and start paying attention to sounds that may hint at his presence. The sounds the house makes while settling is enough on its own to give me palpitations (which isn’t good because I have tachycardia). And it’s a 20 year old mobile home, so it’s settling somewhere almost constantly.

259,"Hi all, I’ve been dating my boyfriend (24M) for 4 years and we’ve lived together for about a year now. We’re both pretty introverted, spend most of our time together alone, and live in the suburbs of a small city. 

The problem is I feel like I’m boring him. He’s from a small rural town and has always dreamed of living in a city where he can walk to the grocery store and restaurants, and be near people our age and make friends. That all sounds lovely in theory, but I lived in the DC area for 4 years at college and it completely turned me off to the idea of being near a city again. 

I also don’t like going out very much because I’m so deeply uncomfortable around people- even if I’m not interacting with them. I always assumed my introversion caused me to hate going out, but I feel like I should at least want to do basic things like going to shops or a cool bar (obv not during covid). I lived a more people-centered life in college before I met him, but always needed to be very drunk to enjoy going out and being with groups of people. 

The thought of being near people makes me feel weird and sad, but it brings him so much joy. I feel like I hold him back because I don’t know how to have fun. He jokingly calls me 80 years old sometimes because I like crafts and the library and I never really want to go anywhere, which kills me inside. I even bore myself because I can’t bring myself to get up and go anywhere new or do anything at all. I’m depressed and have been on medication for the last year, but I’m sadly still just as unwilling to do anything normal people find enjoyable (like just leaving the house). 

Does anyone have any tips on how to enjoy going out when it’s not something you usually like? Or maybe any idea on why I feel this way about doing basic young people things?",16Aug2020,1

262,"My SO cheated on her ex. He said that her boyfriend prevented her from seeing other people, gotten mad over the most mundane things, and was abusive of her, the reason she cheated because she wanted to break up but her boyfriend threatened her and made bad remarks about her, made her cry in front of her parents, her parents didn't want to make them break-up.

She fell in love with another guy because of how toxic her relationship was but when I told her that ""Everyone makes mistakes."" She remarked ""I don't think that was a mistake"" which I don't know if it is a red flag. Anyways, the guy that she fell in love with also didn't amount to much and they broke up.

265,"It seems like my negative interactions outweigh positive interactions I have with people. Between having an emotionally abusive father and not being the sharpest socially growing up, I find every single poor interaction i’ve had with people to be a scar. Being made fun of, treated condescendingly, generally being the lesser black sheep. It happens time and time again and lately i’ve been individually remembering dozens and dozens of things that have happened. To be honest it’s making me even emotionally weaker than usual.

If i’m quiet i’m quiet, if i’m social i’m weird or annoy people. That’s the gist of my school years. There’s a lot of other dumb shit that’s happened with peers, teachers, even friends, but that’s the main thing. It seems like i’m better off sewing my mouth shut because it seems to get me resentment and trouble I don’t see with others.

I’ve gotten better in a lot of ways. I’m a lot more socially self aware and I’m alright at talking to people. Towards the end of high school I wasn’t nearly as disliked as in elementary or middle school. 2 years ago you could tell me I’d get my first GF and first kiss and I wouldn’t believe you. I was even a bit of a “cool kid” too. I’m doing something right, but poor interactions in which somebody is demeaning, condescending, minimal, or anything like that, makes me feel nothing short of awful. I really do feel like an unnecessary, problematic person when these things happen or I think about them. Like i’m a broken cog in the machine but everyone else works fine.

I’m in therapy, and i’m making steps towards building a better life for myself. I don’t mean for this to be a pity party, but rather a simple request for advice.

Here’s the pertinent questions:

Is it normal to be able to remember literal dozens of shit interactions you’ve had with people?
Do these things happen to everyone and I’m just overthinking, or do I really need to learn to fit in?",16Aug2020,1

I’m not trying to come from a bad place all I’m saying is god forbid if something does happen who is that going to ultimately fall on if my brother has a kid. My parents. I don’t want them hurt in this and I know my brother is not responsible enough right now to be having a kid. Not passing judgement on anyone in particular I just know my family situation and what it would do to my parents. My parents had me not knowing their life situation but that was 28 years ago almost in a different time.

267,"I(f21) thought I was ready to be a mom as I have a stable income, relationship of five years and a really good support system so my partner and I had a discussion about starting a family and we both agreed that it was a good idea but now that it’s a real possibility I’m full of self doubt and freaking out!

268,"My boyfriend(ex) and I were in a relationship for 3 years. We have seen all highs and lows together. Now we have realized we can’t continue together due to various factors but we are more friends than a couple so we are moving on from our relationship as a couple to more of like best friends! 

Problem is all of our mutual friends are actually my only social circle. He is an extrovert and I am the complete opposite of him. I feel that even though I consider our friends as my friends too but they think of me as his girlfriend only. We haven’t told anyone about this yet and everyone still thinks we are together as a couple. I raised this concern with him and spoke to him how I feel uncomfortable approaching other people and kind of got no friend circle, so if I end up being left out  I won’t have any social circle at all. Considering the situation he suggested me to lead conversations and take initiatives of making friends. He can make a friend out of an Uber pool ride and the thought of anyone feeling it difficult to make friends is alien to him. 

What should I do? I am scared of being left out alone and it is tough moving on if everyone else treats me like his girlfriend. I am really confused. Please any suggestions for the situation or ideas on how to make friends would be helpful! 

Thank you for reading this far :)",16Aug2020,1

272,"First time poster, however, have lurked on this sub for a while and figured it’d be a decent place to get advice.

I have this group of friends that I’ve known for over a decade, we all use to hang out quite frequently, however, now being in our mid 20s the circle has changed, meaning it just got smaller. I went through some shit in my teens, basically cut off all contact from my long term mates due to mental health issues and didn’t speak or socialise for a year. When my mental state had cleared, I returned to the group and had heard they spread shocking rumours about me. They apologised but after that I always had a thought in the back of my head to never trust them again.

After all the mental shit ended, I made the decision to continually improve myself, wether that be physically/mentally etc and let the results speak itself. I am a firm believer that your mental state reflects the outcomes of situations around you. Therefore I told myself to fuck the opinions of others and my so called friends and just be confident with who I am. Now I am the only one out of my scene that goes to uni, keeps fit, has unorthodox hobbies that generate income, have unorthodox interests that I’m confident about, work in a good job industry etc. 

In the last year I’ve noticed my mates become extremely opinionated about me, normally weighing on the negative aspect. For instance, if I post something it’s automatically thinking that I’m boasting about it. Or if something positive happens to me it’s like they’re not happy about it. Weird thing is I predicted all this behaviour but only now is it becoming clearly apparent. As I said I’m confident about who I am and I have unorthodox interests, but they’ve known me for over a decade and the past couple of months I’ve noticed an increase in highly narcissistic opinions about me as well as exclusion. 

Weird thing is, I’m perfectly fine with all this as I feel the problem is within themselves, there outlook towards me. Happy to cut them off as I became extremely solo after all the mental health stuff and I expected it, however, it’ll be weird. I grew up with these guys, shared so many memories etc but now I just feel they’re toxic. What are people’s thoughts?",16Aug2020,1

274,"It seems like my negative interactions outweigh positive interactions I have with people. Between having an emotionally abusive father and not being the sharpest socially growing up, I find every single poor interaction i’ve had with people to be a scar. Being made fun of, treated condescendingly, generally being the lesser black sheep. It happens time and time again and lately i’ve been individually remembering dozens and dozens of things that have happened. To be honest it’s making me even emotionally weaker than usual.

If i’m quiet i’m quiet, if i’m social i’m weird or annoy people. That’s the gist of my school years. There’s a lot of other dumb shit that’s happened with peers, teachers, even friends, but that’s the main thing. It seems like i’m better off sewing my mouth shut because it seems to get me resentment and trouble I don’t see with others.

I’ve gotten better in a lot of ways. I’m a lot more socially self aware and I’m alright at talking to people. Towards the end of high school I wasn’t nearly as disliked as in elementary or middle school. 2 years ago you could tell me I’d get my first GF and first kiss and I wouldn’t believe you. I was even a bit of a “cool kid” too. I’m doing something right, but poor interactions in which somebody is demeaning, condescending, minimal, or anything like that, makes me feel nothing short of awful. I really do feel like an unnecessary, problematic person when these things happen or I think about them. Like i’m a broken cog in the machine but everyone else works fine.

I’m in therapy, and i’m making steps towards building a better life for myself. I don’t mean for this to be a pity party, but rather a simple request for advice.

Here’s the pertinent questions:

Is it normal to be able to remember literal dozens of shit interactions you’ve had with people?
Do these things happen to everyone and I’m just overthinking, or do I really need to learn to fit in?",16Aug2020,1

A couple of days after the incident, I apologized to my mom over the incident. However, an apology does not make up for my past actions. Thankfully, my mom recovered from the pain after the incident.

If someone had called the police, I know I would have been arrested for domestic violence. In reality, the police never intervened. This dark story still haunts me to this day. I still feel regret and that my life feels like a failure. I know this past event will harm in the future as it will lock me out of most good jobs. Because of that, I am a failure in life and I am doomed to suffering all because of anger taking control of me when I was 18. I have no future. I don't know what do when I can't get a job because of this, and I can't get over the emotions and regret that came from the event. I just don't know what to do.

277,"hello, so I am going to college next year and in order to get good housing there it is best to apply early, and so I am sending in my application next week. However this means I need a roommate that does the same.

Originally I really wanted to room with my best friend as of now, blakely. but she is not really as adamant about applying and school as i am and i’m worried that she’s not gonna get in or she’ll get waitlisted meaning all of the good rooms won’t be available anymore. so i decided to ask a girl i am friends with (harper) and she is super organized and we are similar so i thought we would be good room mates. but little did i know there is another girl i am friends with named sarah that wanted to room with her but i had no idea that she even wanted to room with her 

One thing that i completely forgot about was that my friend danna decided to stay instate for college and i guess we had talked about rooming together at one point in the past and i didn’t think about that when i asked harper to room with me. 

then Danny texted me today saying that sarah said i didn’t want to room with her anymore because i would rather room with harper instead which is not true i just forgot she was also staying instate for college since a lot of my other friends are going out of state. 

so in essence i have no idea who to room with with out hurting anyone’s feelings and i know this seems like a very stupid and juvenile thing to be stressing out about but i just really need some advice on what i should do.",16Aug2020,1

279,"My parents have been married nearly 25 years and I think they’ve fallen out of love with each other.

Recently (in last few years), they argue more than ever. It always starts with bickering and then turns in to a proper argument in which my Mum will not then speak to my Dad for a few hours/days. I would say this happens at least 3 times a week. 

I love my Mum more than anything, but she can be very spiteful when she angry about something. She will say things she doesn’t mean and in a tone which naturally upsets people. On the flip of this, my Dad is relatively chill - he will say his piece and then be okay again but he has been hold grudges for longer as well these last few months. I don’t think Lockdown was beneficial to them in all honesty.

Some days, it’s like when I was a kid again and they’re laughing and joking and everything else. But then some days, I can’t handle being anywhere except my room with all the tension in the house. (I am currently in the process of saving up for my own place.)

I am very close to both my Mum and my Dad so they will both confide in me things. Recently on a shopping trip with my Dad, he just slipped it in to conversation he was sick of her talking to him like shite all the time whilst later in the day, my Mum told me she was sick of his condescending attitude. It’s gets to me sometimes, I want to be there for them but I’m not sure I can handle much longer having comments from either side about the other.

Me and my siblings are all grown up so we would all understand if they parted ways, I personally don’t think they ever will. I just need some advice on how to tell them this isn’t fair on myself, my brothers or theirselves. Please.

TL;DR They argue. Silent treatments. Sly comments to myself about the other. How do I tell them it’s not good for them?",16Aug2020,1
280,"I inherited a house not long ago and plan to sell it, shortterm because I can no longer afford it due to covid and longterm because I don't want to live in that location anyway. I initially planned on moving in with my grandmother shortterm (under a year), which would save me a lot of money. I'm very close with my family and talk to them most days of the week. The problem though is that my grandmother- as well as my whole family- are very paranoid in nature and either discourage me from things or never give any support:

\- my grandmother got irritated and complained a lot when I went gluten free to see if it would help my [skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/). We weren't even living together and the diet change would not affect her one bit.

\- she would also constantly complain about my last couple years of high school. She often says, ""I'm SO glad you're done with school! That was so stressful!"" Even though all she did was drive me to school one morning a week and write the check for my tuition using the school funds my mother already left behind for me. 

\- Me and a friend decided to take a vacation to San Francisco a couple years ago, as well as to see how we liked the place as a potential city to live in (my family didn't know this part). We did lots of research, visited/drove through different neighborhoods, talked with a few locals. She moved to Cali and I've since stayed behind. 

My whole family freaked. They were angry and crying with each other over the phone, saying verbatim that I ""might as well commit suicide"" because San Francisco is so dangerous. My grandmother was pressured to prevent me from going somehow, like to sabotage the vacation. Sure enough, my friend and I didn't stay out after dark, kept away from the sketchy parts of the city, and practiced street smarts, among other things. We were perfectly fine and had a great time.

\- When I was in high school, my white church-going boyfriend got so much love from my family. When I started dating my half-Indian boyfriend at 18, however, crickets... I think one of them might've even done an illegal background check on him because they perceived him as ""sketchy.""

Anyway, I worry that if I moved in with my grandmother, it would emotionally be 10x harder whenever I decide to move out of state. I'm thinking that living slightly farther away and continuing to live on my own could (hopefully) provide some emotional distance between me and the rest of the family. After the ordeal I went through from going on a vacation, I can't imagine the ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" (lol) if I told them I'm moving out of state. But at the same time I would be spending quite a bit of money until I found a job. Plus one of the main reasons I would be living on my own in the same town anyway is just as a ""transition"" for my family's sake since my goal is to move out of state entirely. 

Another issue is that since my family is always ridiculing the slightest change in my life, I often fear that my future plans are ridiculous. I honestly have no idea if my future plans are sound and wise, a little risky but doable, or out-right reckless because of my family. Because no matter what I decide they will perceive it as reckless anyway. I'd love it if I could PM someone about my future plans.",16Aug2020,1
281,"A month and a half ago, I landed my dream job. I was so excited to start, everyone is lovely, and I honestly love going to work every day. 

I haven’t had any major hiccups, and for being only a month and a half on the job, I believe I’m doing very well and learning very fast. I haven’t recieved any major negative feedback, I’m always early for my shifts, and I consider myself a work-a-holic, so I always put in 100%.

Today, my co worker (23M) who is also my boss’s best friend, approached me and told me that my boss was planning on firing me as soon as my 90 days probation was about to be done (Where I live, whenever you start a new job, you have a 90 day probation period, where they can terminate you without notice, and you can also quit without notice). The problem is, I have no idea why my boss would want to fire me. Especially since his best friend is constantly hours late for his shifts, and never reprimanded. 

How can I navigate this situation. I’ve been a top performer at every job I’ve ever had, so being told that I am about to get fired is world shattering. Do I confront my boss? I love my job and would do anything to keep it. I also need my job since I live independently and I have bills and rent to pay. I left a very secure job to work for my new company, and I was very clear I was not looking for temporary work. 

Another issue is that it isn’t just me he’s wanting to fire, it’s also another girl who has been working there for longer than he has. In my opinion, she’s great at her job and super awesome. She’s way better than I am, so that makes the situation even more confusing, especially since we are the only 2 girls currently working under him.

I’m also not sure if his best friend is telling the truth or just trying to stir the pot. I’m honestly shaking because it’s so hard to find work right now and my position at my old job is already filled. Any help and advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

tl;dr: found out from a co worker that my boss wants to fire me and another worker for no apparent reason and is only holding off because we’re short staffed. I’m not sure how to navigate the situation. Should I talk to him? About what?",16Aug2020,1

304,"Yeh well my parents fight all the time, my dad gets overwhelmed by anger and tries to shut my mum up by saying shit like ITS DONE, THIS PROVES IT, IT'S OVER, EVERYONE TO THEIR OWN WAY NOW, and it's super unnecessary and toxic. Like my mum only wants to communicate but my dad gets so overwhelmed so quickly and escapes it all the time through rage. Anways, he also has been going through a knee injury and other personal matters that he never talks about and bottles it up, makes him a super toxic person and we have tried to be understanding but is that enough of a reason to just be a shit person to others???? 

Anyways my main concern right now is my brother. He is 28 years old, he has been unemployed for 5 years. I always asked my parents to take him to a psychiatrist cuz he shows signs of mild autism? (Im no expert). He is very fixated on solving things using his own logic and methods (admirable sometimes ngl) and he has a very unique way of understanding things. He has always been an introvert and believes that autism is a lie told my the government just to make more money cuz its not genetic. He has a lot of focusing issues and processes things slowly, his response time is slower than the average person so when you call his name, there is a 5-7 second delay.. etc. etc. 
We were sitting at the table when my parents were yelling at each other in another room. I was telling him that what they need is either to talk things out or just get divorced cuz it's not healthy for them or us.(I'm 21 btw, just putting this out there lol) he then tells me ""no no no (head tilt back) we need to be a family"" then I'm like ""but you can't force two people to be together, that's selfish"" then he goes on by explaining how he would rather not have any mum or dad if they are going to get divorced. And he is really trying to keep things together, he is trying to diffuse the situations but it's not really doing anything. I feel bad for him. He is very uncomfortable with the situation. I am too but I've gotten used to it and at this point I just want their happiness. I said that to him too but now he is saying ""they will get over this obstacle, they aren't quitters"" but that is super unhealthy if you're paired up with someone that is just so toxic. 

How do I express this to my brother? He is super stubborn about accepting that divorce isn't always a bad thing!",16Aug2020,1

306,"I’ve lived in my apartment for two years now and it’s had an old/musty smell from day one. I suspect it is coming from the carpet, specifically in my bedroom. The first week I moved in I called the apartment manager to come look at it. They showed up with the maintenance guy and they both claimed to not smell anything and even said my apartment was cleaner smelling than most. Whatever. After that I did everything I could to get the smell out myself. I sprinkled baking soda all over and let it sit for 24 hours. Did this multiple times, it did nothing. I opened all windows and turned on all my fans to try and air out the apartment. I did a deep clean, mopped floors, vacuumed, sanitized everything. Didn’t help. All my furniture was brand new, so I knew the smell wasn’t coming from anything I owned. I searched everywhere for mold and could not find any. I even bought an ozone generator and ran it in my apartment. Still, nothing. To this day I still smell the musty smell. It’s not as apparent and I mostly only notice it in my bedroom. I keep all doors open, open windows frequently, vacuum/clean multiple times a week. It’s still there and still bothers me.

Coronavirus and racism towards Asians
BLM due to racist cops against black people
Wars between countries 
Beirut explosion
Stupid racist jokes followed by “just a joke” 
Public fights 
My own realization that I’ve always been passive when it come to racism directed at me. 
Cultural appropriation 
Discrimination against women
Discrimination against lgbt
Parents thinking they’re always right and have too much pride to apologize t their own children.

Now that I list it out... maybe it’s mainly because of racism. And I’m aware it always existed but maybe it finally hit me as to how hard it impacts my life. Sometimes I feel like there’s no hope for the human race and were all better off dead.

314,"  My brother and father are alike. Not just by appearance but mentally as well.

They do not have any hobies or interests, all they do is smoke, play games on phone, watch tv.
I have never seen them self initiate anything.
They do bare minimum when it comes to cleaning and cooking.

For example the other day I asked my brother to go out with a dog to which he agreed, when the time came to take the dog out he was lying in bed and i asked him

''Are you going?''
Yes he replied.

Hour had past by this point and you could hear frustration in my voice.

''Are you going to take the dog out or not?''
Then he reluctantly got up and took her for a 15 min walk. (Keep in mind we live in an apartment so we have to take her out.)

I do realize that most of the time my approach to them, especially my brother, is wrong but I can't help myself then to feel frustrated with them when they don't want to simple household things on their own, why do I have to keep reminding them to do the simple stuff.

To be fair, my room also has some great spaces for Silverfish to potentially hide. In my 7 or so years living here, I never ever saw a Silverfish bug. That was until about 3-4 weeks ago. 

Right on my wall near my bed I saw an adult Silverfish. I am a huge comic book/book collector and my collection means the world to me. Luckily before seeing the adult Silverfish, I put my books in plastic containers. Weirdly enough, I only ever became concerned about Silverfish a few months prior to actually seeing one! I guess I brought it into the universe. Anyway, I instantly knew the adult could mean trouble. My dad is not big on me drastically tampering with my room, so I didn’t buy anything to destroy them until I was sure I have a problem. Well...I have a problem. Just a few minutes ago I was blessed with seeing a “young” Silverfish on my TV stand. Young Silverfish are usually small. So I can pretty much assume that adult on my wall laid some eggs.

317,"I’ve posted this elsewhere too and its ultimately because I really don’t know what to do..


A little context for my mental health at the moment of posting.

Hi, I’m currently super stressed and going through an entire week of insomnia, (takes me 3-4 hours to fall asleep if at all at night, and its inconsistent and i dont enter REM) I can nap during the day but try not to because I keep trying to fix my Circadian rhythm. I dont use my phone before bed and its blue light is off by the time the sun is set, i meditate before bed and i normally take prescribed sleep medication (the over the counter remedies weren’t working, my psychiatrist prescribed me) but i refused to be dependent on them so I wouldn’t take them more than 3 times a week. The past week even if I took it I would not be able to fall asleep like physiologically I won’t respond, so I think my body has built an immunity. I am currently going through an episode of depression and can barely find energy or reason to do anything worth while, i’ve stopped reading frequently and can hardly find motivation to study (im in First year Uni doing health and med Sci)

Now to my son, Cosmo. He is a loveable cute little character and i’ve had him and raised him since he was 9 weeks, I even saw him several times while he was still with his mother. He hasn’t ever acted like this but since yesterday he woke up from a nap like super frightened he jumped up and ran into the wall suddenly, at first i laughed and cuddled him bc it was FKING HILARIOUS, but then he went to use his litter box and he must’ve knocked the dome on the way out bc it fell and he jumped and ran away from it, i laughed and put it back on.

I came home later that night to his stool on my bed, and he peed too. I had to clean my bedsheets again this morning bc he peed on it again (i was keeping an eye in him and reassuring him he could use the litter box, i even took the dome off so he could feel more comfortable without fear of it falling again, especially bc i knew it was normally the time of the morning he went pee, i turned away for two seconds and he’d peed on my bed again) since yesterday he has been super skitty and freaked out by any sudden movements, he wont use his litter box and didn’t eat his food until i served it, walked over to him comforted him and reassured him that it was ok. Physiologically from what I can see he looks perfectly healthy, last vet check was relatively recent and nothing was wrong, he has been neutered and is currently just under 2 years old. I’m trying to be patient and let him be more comfortable with the litter box and everything again but I’m so stressed, sleep deprived and worried. He’s never been like this and if I was a stranger and saw him like this I wouldn’t even second guess if someone told me he had been kicked and abused as a kitten, but thats just not the case, and its so out of character. I’ve googled and everything and nothing applies, he has been using this litter box and litter for over a year, its been in the same spot, i haven’t made any major changes to his diet, housing layout or anything, I play with him frequently (unfortunately where we live he is not allowed to roam outside freely so I make sure to give him enough stimuli indoors as I can, another thing, he won’t play as much and is almost hesitant to play at the moment too), i’m not the only one who has noticed this sudden drastic change in his body language. My roommate even said how scared and jumpy he is, and we cant make any sudden movements without him just absolutely freaking out (not in the playful, “i have so much energy” kinda way either)

I’m so worried and I don’t know who else to ask, I don’t have the money for the Vet atm and really just hope I’m over reacting but does anyone know if this has happened to them, could it be my fault? 

Tl;dr: I’m fucky in the brain, haven’t entered REM for a week and my Son (cat, 1.5yrs) won’t use his litter box and is scared of the slightest noises or movements, and no he hasn’t been attacked or abused in the past or present:(( pls help even if its just your own experiences",16Aug2020,1

320,"Do you ever fully move on from a major regret? In the same way that you might do something cringey when younger but later can see it was dumb? Does this happen with major regrets that affect years of your life?

Last year I transferred colleges back to my home state. I was eager to leave my home state as a freshman, but in late freshman year I was having major anxiety attacks that made me decide to transfer to my state college. (Part of the problem was that I didn't know anything about mental health at the time and did not know how to get treatment. Because of this, I thought the uni was the problem). 

I spent a year in the college at my home state and was not thrilled about it. I managed to apply for and receive a scholarship deferral which would have allowed me to return to my original college. I was really happy once I received this news and it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. However, COVID happened and my original college was in a hotspot for most of the summer. Because of this, I decided to stay at my state college. However, now the cases per day number has been lowering significantly but I am stuck in my home state still.

I really regret this whole series of events. I feel ashamed to talk about it and regret leaving a good school with good resources and my fencing team as well.

At the same time, I don't want to just move on from it and pretend like it didn't happen. I want to make amends for it or do something that I can point to and say ""This is what made it worth it."" But I just don't know what that would be.",16Aug2020,1

So I went abroad as soon as I could leave. My relationship with my parents improved since, but it is not that great and we don't really talk much.

She said it was his business and she doesn't want to get involved, he should figure out what to do by himself. So it is really his kid and he is paying him some money and visiting him sometimes. 

Now he only called me to tell me all of that because S2 found out about the kid. And S2 was angry. S2 demanded them to tell me. Otherwise they would never have told me anything (kid was already in his teens!). This is the part that really upsets me. S1 thinks the kid is not part of the family and none of our business.

Now it’s August and she is going out on multiple first dates (she’s been on 4 this month already), going out with all sorts of friends, hanging out with their friends, and at one point even brought home a group of people I didn’t know.

First of all, she has bad manners, she burps after drinking beer and farts all the time. While it was all laugh and giggle in our group, if she was doing it on a date all the time, I would be a bit annoyed. She did mention that she gets bloating, so why hold it. I agree with this. She’s a bit of a country girl so she doesn’t care. 


She does have a very sexy body. Slim blonde with a nice golden tan. She was teasing me during festival and she was laughing that I had a bonner. She makes me really horny and we nearly had sex during festival but she passed out first and I got the alcohol poisoning. 
We agreed that we should hang out sometime. 


She does club drugs on a regular basis. I do club drugs like once in a while in a festival but she does it nearly every weekend. Smokes weed all the time. I don’t smoke. She did mention that if she met the right boyfriend she would get more serious. 



The reason why I’m starting to like her is because when a few of my friends saw her, they immediately told me that this slim blonde is really attractive.

333,"Don't know how to explain this. I'm pretty deaf in one ear, and hear okay in the other. However, it makes it hard to hear people when they speak low, or when people have naturally deep voices. It makes a baby crying right next to me sound like they're in the distance. 

I hid that I'm hard of hearing from my current job for about four months. But my hearing took a nosedive, and suddenly I was that girl who never knows what's going on. I work at a preschool. Parents were angry at me because I wasn't hearing their instructions. 

I told my boss I'm hard of hearing. I became ""the deaf girl who never knows what's going on"". I have a few co-workers who are friends, and they'd help after I told them. One even told off a parent who was ready to punch me in the nose because I didn't hear her over the sound of the faucet I was using. 

My boss likes that I teach the kids sign language (especially those still learning to speak), and that they're essentially growing up with someone who is differently abled from them and learning to adapt naturally. 

However, there's also people talking about me behind my back. People saying I shouldn't be working there because I can't hear, that it makes their job more difficult. I even got written up the other day because I supposedly didn't hear our chef say I couldn't use the microwave at that moment (I later apologized to him, and he assured me apologetically that he'd never said anything like that and admitted I was being bullied by a few of my co-workers and it was an emotional moment). Co-workers get angry when they have to repeat themselves, and go, ""oh, just *forget it*"" and ""you never know anything that's going on!"" in anger. 

So, I wonder if I should hide it at my new job. I've gotten better at lip reading and filling in gaps based on context and intent. I'm great with kids who are non-verbal and learning how to speak, and that's the position I'm up for at this new job.

Before, I did my degree, and just lost interest and before I knew it, started to fail. 

Currently work a shitty 9-5 job to pay for my apartment, just trying to get savings for my first car, but earning at a mind-numbing slow rate.

I’ve already cut expenses, but after bills, I earn about 120ish a week. 

That’s not the issue.

I don’t understand if I try to go back to college, try my luck at a big boy job, or try to get promoted at my job.

I don’t understand if I buy a house, work for the rest of my life to pay it off, or I get some savings, put it in safe investments then go from there.

349,"Hey guys. I’m having a really tough time getting over my friend. (I’m 21F he’s 21M) The pathetic part is that we never even dated. We are in the same friend group and we are all pretty close. 

I have had feelings for him for quite sometime and long story short we have ended up hooking up. The only thing is he said he only wants something casual and not anything serious. And I don’t want to think “oh maybe he’ll change his mind” or whatever, no. No, no, no. 

That hope is RUINING me. It’s to the point where every time my group of friends and I (including him) hangout, I go home crying (no one knows this, it doesn’t come out till I’m alone) Because I just know he doesn’t feel the same way as I do. It’s all just lust for him. 

I can’t stop thinking about him and the what-if and I hate it so much. I want it to end. I want to shut off my feelings. I DONT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY. I just want to move on and get over him! I don’t want to distance myself from the group just because of him. Because to be quite honest they are amazing friends and I want to hangout with them as much as I can.

I don’t want to look for anyone else. I just wanna find a way to shut off romantic feelings for a really long time. I’m so tired of getting hurt. I do focus on myself, and do a lot of thing alone, and have hobbies and all that. It’s just I don’t want to have any feelings anymore.",16Aug2020,1

So i share a house with two people (person A and person B) we split the rent 3 ways and have done for just over a year now, i have known person A for nearly all of my life and is a valued close friend of mine and my family person B is an acquaintance of A He’s an ok person. But over the last 6 months iv come home from work and found the house repeatedly cluttered with takeaway boxes, dirty plates and stinking of weed a few days ago on one of the hottest days of the year i came home from a fishing trip and found a literal WAIST HIGH pile of takeaway boxes and empty cans of drink heaped up against the bins in the kitchen,i will also mention that one of them had left a half empty can of energy drink in the recycling bin which had attracted every ant in the garden to the kitchen needless to say i was pissed at this. Also when person A saw my visible and audible frustration at this situation he said whilst laughing “alright then mate” as if i was being unreasonably angry at finding insects where i prepare my food.   

Now i totally understand that these two didn’t leave there parents houses to have someone younger than them tell them how to keep a place clean but Im tired of asking for the house to be kept in a moderately clean state its not like I’m walking around with white gloves on checking for dust every second but it would just be nice to come home to a house I’m not embarrassed with even my own mother pointed out to person A that the place was a mess and stinks and all he said was “yeah i know its not a massive deal” person B just constantly says “oh i was gunna deal with it tomorrow” i cant do this anymore its making me so unhappy living here i would rather just find my own place and start again at this point.

Heres the problem i have, i have spoken to my estate agent and have been told that this is a difficult one as we have all rented the property as a whole and not as separate rooms we are all jointly and severally liable. I would need to speak to the others to say i am looking to leave and if they wish to find a replacement they need to let the estate agents know and will need to reference the new tenant and then do a whole new tenancy agreement.

Whilst this seems like an easy solution what if i say i want to move out and they refuse to find someone else? Im a stuck here if that happens? I know they would struggle to find a new tenant. I preferably want too stay friends with person A. Im stuck in a moral dilemma of not making them suffer financially by asking them to find someone else to live here and making myself happy by doing it anyway I just cant live in this environment anymore its gross and embarrassing.

So I'm kind of split on something because I'm not sure if I'm getting overly emotional about it or just feeling what I should feel. 

I have a friend. Let's call them K. K and I met last year and really hit it off. We met on a discord server for friends in my area and just talked a lot, hung out, made plans for stuff. You know, friend stuff. 

Then late last year, I started to feel something change. They stopped messaging me, whenever we talked it was pretty short conversation with me starting it almost every time. When we made plans to hang out, and someone else cancelled, they would have a reason to back out. I would just give this to bad luck but it happened a hand full of times in a few months so it felt often. 

I kind of had a freakout at one point and brought this up and they just said it was because they were busy. I took their word on it but idk. Something recently brought those feelings back up again. 

I feel as though if I just didn't initiate anything, we just wouldn't be friends. If it was up to them, I just wouldn't really be a part of their life. Not in a deliberate way like they hate me, but just in a way where they wouldn't really care.

Now, me and my sister were totally okay with them getting a divorce because he was never really around as a father and we were never really that close because he was a shitty person. Plus, ever since I've found out, I have been resenting him more every time I see him, literally everything he does or says pisses me off and also we found some texts of him and one of the mistress(let's call her L, she also has a son and husband btw) planning on getting married and starting a business together(she back out afterwards he told her they might be getting a divorce because she’s a gold digger and literally everybody could see that but him, but I mean, love is blind so) so just knowing that he was willing to risk losing and leaving this family for another woman makes this even more unforgivable(but with that said he is my father and he has provided me with everything I needed, so while ill also be grateful for that I just feel like the love I have for him is becoming more and more conditional and I just can’t tolerate him anymore). Anyways, my mom was worried that the divorce might affect me and my sister so she wanted to wait until after I graduate high school(in 5 years) but she said it was really up to us.

We have had our ups and downs today on whether we should keep it or not and currently we have not any clear decision or leaned to either side. 

I don’t think we should have it for many reasons. 
For one, we don’t have the financial means of supporting a family right now since we both  currently don’t have jobs due to everything going on. We don’t live together. We don’t have a car. We have been struggling to keep our relationship afloat for a little and to be honest I don’t know if I want to stay with her for much longer. Saying all of this makes me feel very selfish but I am just trying to be as honest as possible with myself about all of this. We both are in the process of figuring out our careers and working on them and this would forsure hault all of our current process. 

I have had a difficult time talking to her about why we shouldn’t have it because every time these points arise, she blocks it out what I am saying and gets angry or cries. I understand why should would feel sad about the whole situation but it’s nearly impossible for me to accept having a kid right now.

This is usually just not a big deal as for the past 5 days of the week I just let everything go in 2 minutes and didn't make a fuss or let myself stay upset for to long. But the 6th day of the week she just seemed to make a problem out of nothing and got super mad at me constantly saying rude comments when we were out practicing how to drive.

I dont know why but I just felt really annoyed and upset more than usual so I just pulled the car over and let our mom drive the rest of the way home and then this ended up with her and my mom getting in another argument. When we got back home I just went out on a balcony and sat on my phone not talking really at all my overall tone and whatever was just low and my mom asks whats wrong I just say I honestly want to go home she wanted me to stay saying we can maybe all sit down and talk which would be pointless with my sister and said if I really wanted to go home she would drive me and wanted me to tell her whats wrong but I just said I want to go home. After awhile I just said il stay the night as tomorrows the last day I would be there and planned to cheer up a little later. Just a few minutes after this they get in another stupid argument and I just get ticked off end up saying im going home grab all my stuff walk out and wait for my mom in the car.

During the car ride she apologized for me being upset and wanted to know what got me annoyed I just said everything and that im done driving with them il just practice on my own and the rest of the ride was kinda quiet. When I was almost home she asked what she did to upset my I said nothing she started to tear up and I felt really bad. She took me home we said goodbye.

I dont know why I acted so poorly to the situation I hate the way I handled this but with all the stupid arguments they got into to and the disrespect and attitude my sister has towards our mother just set me off and I couldn't stand to be around my sister anymore. since then I just have felt cold and have no motivation to do anything I feel like no matter what I do I cant be happy right now Ive sent a simple im sorry text and my mother just replied with we are sorry we upset you and said she wished she could resolve the issue but she doesnt know whats wrong as I haven't gone into full detail why im this upset.

My bedroom is only a bit smaller than my new studio, and I keep it clean very easily. My things are organised and put away, the floor is regularly swept and mopped and the shelves are dusted and even wiped down if needed. I like living in tidy places, but the house is quite big and my mother's version of cleaning is putting a paper towel over the cats vomit and just leaving it there. I try to tidy and clean what I can but there's so much to do and it's overwhelming, and then I get exhausted and depressed and anxious and I end up hiding in my room unable to do anything.

My sister came to visit a few weeks back after having moved out for uni 3 years ago, and she was appalled by the state of the house and went on what my mum described as a 'giant manic cleaning spree'. She was literally just trying to clean the house because she didn't want to stay in a place so gross. Once my sister had tidied and organised some of the house, things got a lot easier for me because it wasn't as overwhelming to tidy, but I also can't sweep the floors and do all of the dishes, and vacuum upstairs, and tidy up after my mum and I and the animals, and clean the bathroom and sort out the recycling and the rubbish whenever it needs doing, and clean up the vomit and the urine and the faeces that the animals leave behind. It's a big house, too big for one person to constantly try and keep clean.

I'm in the process of moving out my things and preparing forms for uni and going to leavers parties and final group outings and preparing myself for a huge change, as well as just trying to look after myself physically and mentally. I feel burnt out around my house more than I do when I'm busy with tasks and plans. I'm worried that I'm counting too much on moving out to fix my issues though, and that once I'm not living here, I'll find more reasons to feel bad in my new place. I know I'll be able to keep it clean and organised but I'm scared that the change won't be as positive as I'm expecting it to be, and that I'll get thrown off and won't be able to cope with being at uni because of it. 

My autism causes me to ruminate and obsess a lot and I have no idea what to expect. Has anyone else been able to move out of an overwhelming home and into a more pleasant environment? Was there anything unexpected about the transition? Did it help mentally to be away from the bad habits or did you just end up taking them with you? I'm already working hard to unlearn the habits that I've been taught to which cause stress and negativity. I've stopped drinking, I tidy up my room every day, I practise good hygiene and building up healthy routines. I'm fully willing to work towards helping myself, I just don't know how to help myself anymore. Has anyone experienced a similar situation before?",16Aug2020,1

383,"I'm shaking as I'm writing this and I really just want any sort of advice or reassurance I did the right thing. Earlier today I went to hang out with a male friend at his house. I kept it clear throughout our friendship I wanted nothing beyond a platonic love for eachother. That being said we were very close! We talked about everything and shared intimate details of our lives. That's when he brought up his k!nk... It was the fact that he was aroused by people sleeping. At the time I didn't think much of it, seeing as I trusted him as a friend and as a person to keep me safe if I ever slept near him. We were friends after all! 

That wasn't the case though today. We had come back from about a 5 mile bike ride and I was exhausted, so I decided to take a quick nap while he watched some TV shows. Though after a little bit I was sorta... rustled back into reality when I felt him slide a hand down to my ass. I was confused and half asleep so I barely moved, which I guess confirmed to him that I was 'asleep.' I then felt him climb on top of me. Literally whole body over me, moving slowly, arm on each side of me to keep me in. He's much bigger than me, which only added to the fear I had. That's when my brain finally kickstarted and I finally 'woke up' so to speak. He got off me so quick once he realized I was getting up and smiled at me like nothing happened.... 

I've been thinking about it in the past few hours and I feel disgusted with myself... I sent him these long ass paragraphs stating on how he made me feel and that I didn't feel safe around him anymore. I'm planning on cutting complete contact with him. Is this the right thing to do? Am I doing the right thing cutting him out of my life after he almost forced himself onto me?",16Aug2020,1

386,"I am 5'4 and I started losing my hair when I was 13 and lost it by the time I turned 18. Thankfully due to some hair concealers, I was able to pretend I have hair till i turned 24, after which it stopped working. Also fortunately, I have a nice face and beard so at least I got that going for me.

However, I developed deep depression, anxiety and body dysmorphia in my teenage years which have lasted a very long time. In 2018, I took a year off from work and decided to focus on my anxiety and depression issues. Got back to work last year and I am doing much better since.

I'm an engineer by profession and work at one of the biggest companies in the world. People who look at me from the outside think I'm happy and successful. However, these are the issues I'm trying to fix and would appreciate any advice -

1) I have social anxiety that I hide really well at work. Before presentations, I'm nervous as hell. However, I usually end up presenting well but I hate the anxiety around it. Sometimes my voice shakes and I really want it to stop shaking.

2) I'm just awkward around women who I consider to be pretty. I don't know how to fix this. Like I won't say it's painfully awkward, just some air of awkwardness always and I keep thinking it's because I'm short and they don't like me for it.

3) I want to leave my parents house and move to another city where there are really good work opportunities etc. However, I'm worried that if I move and go through depression again, I may have to quit and start from scratch again in terms of mental health. I don't know if I'll be able to make friends. 

4) I'm bald and I wear a hairpiece now which looks pretty nice. However, I'm worried about approaching women because I don't know how to tell them that I'm wearing a hairpiece. Since I'm short, I'm imagining they would not want to be with someone who is bald + short.

5) I want to come across as an assertive, confident and self assured person at work. The problem is I keep crumbling under pressure sometimes. I don't show it to anyone but stuff like my voice shaking for the first 20 or 30 seconds during a presentation is enough for anyone to realize I'm under pressure. I was being considered for a manager position at work, but I may have messed that up because sometimes I just have a child like demeanor when I feel like I'm under pressure i.e. i talk really fast etc. or sound a little nervous or indecisive - small things like that.

6) I have a lot of old friends who want to meet up with me and message me often but I only keep in touch with just 1 guy. Other than that, I feel absolutely emotionally and mentally drained if I give anyone else my time of the day by meeting up. Maybe that stems from social anxiety. I don't know.

So yeah, just would really appreciate if anyone can help me figure things out. I went for intense therapy for a year in 2018 and that's what helped me come out of my major depression and helped me get back to work. I just know I need to work on myself more now and on other things to reach my full potential.",16Aug2020,1
387,"hello! i’m a 17 y/o teen from canada and i have a really bad procrastination problem. i need help.

**tldr:** if there’s no consequences, i can’t get myself to do it

i wouldn’t say i’m lazy, because if i’d feel like doing something, i try my best to do it well. i don’t start school until september 9th so i have less than a month to get my life together.

My room is currently a big mess. you almost can’t see the floor since half of it is dirty clothes and the other half is clean clothes that i didn’t want to hang up... my bed hasn’t been made in over a week, it’s just a mattress with a fuzzy blanket on top. 

i have no reasons not to clean it, in fact, i really want to. i feel happier when it’s clean, i sleep better, it’s way more functional and i can have clean clothes to wear. i just can’t get myself to do it.

the only thing stopping me from cleaning,  is that i don’t really have to. no one is forcing me to do it, there is no consequences, it’s just more fun to sit around looking at my phone.

enough with my room, this is depressing 

for school, it’s still a big issue. i’m always handing in work at the last minute, starting projects the day before or even not doing my homework if the teachers won’t check it. the difference with school is that if i don’t do it, there is punishment. 

these are just examples of how this affects me the most but i assure you there is much more..

i don’t really know what answers i’m looking to get out of this... um, yeah that’s it i guess.",16Aug2020,1

389,"Ever since I was a little girl, my dream was to be a grownup like everyone else and drive a car. I have always found driving to be fascinating and so exciting. However, dreams and reality are different concepts, and a few weeks ago I started driving school and discovered how different it really was from my expectations. It's really difficult for me to focus in traffic, I get sudden brain freezes and I don't know what to do because I simply freeze in certain situations. I am constantly tense and scared while driving and my driving instructor keeps yelling at me for being terrible at driving which only makes me more terrible at driving. Whenever I'm in an intersection or at crossroad, I die a little internally because of the panic that I feel. I get screamed at a lot, which doesn't help much. This is my 8th time driving and I am not getting any better. I still make awful mistakes and I can't wrap my head around driving for the rest of my life. Every second of it is agony. I cannot understand how people drive everyday, simply sitting in the driver's seat gives me such anxiety that I can't function anymore. And to make it worse, pretty much all my friends and acquaintances have gotten their driver's license at 18 without any difficulties and I'm here at 24 struggling to even motivate myself to continue because I'm just SO bad. 



Can someone please give me some solid advice on how I should proceed? I am thinking of giving up because I suck so badly and I probably won't even make it out of driving school. The thought of it makes me so sad I want to dig a grave and bury myself, but there isn't much I can do about it.

Hey, so I'm 23, its been a year since i graduated and lets just say there is nothing with regards to business that appeals to me.

I am currently in the 12th sub-stage of ET, and I'm going to finish this stage in a few weeks at most. The problem is, I'm not sure if I should continue to EA, or just finish it at ET. You see, I'm fairly proficient in English. I have NEVER gotten a score lower than 85/100 since I first entered school. The lowest I've got is 85/100. That was because of a faulty exam (lots of typos, incorrect question grammar,etc.) and the teacher weren't willing to give an extra score. I mainly speak English in a daily basis, and I also write English essays to sharpen my writing skills frequently.

398,"I got 27 health insurance calls on Friday, and I’m dreading Monday when the call center opens back up. I NEED them to stop this.

399,"To start I know this is ridiculous and rationally what the right thing to do is (which is why I don’t want to talk to my family/friends as they’ve had all this) but if only it was that simple...

So I (32F) met a guy on a dating app last year and we hit it off pretty quick, we went on a few dates and all seemed to be going well....

...the guy was in the army and was based a few hours away but had a house in a local town to me that he came up to every few weekends &amp; when he had time off (this is how we matched with the distance). I went in to it knowing that he would be away a fair bit and if it worked it would be long distance. This was fine for me as I like having my own life and being able to do what I want in an evening. 

Unfortunately after the first couple of dates it was going to be a good month before he has time to come back to the local area due to his schedule. 
Once he went back we talked on the phone &amp; FaceTimed when we could.

During the month that we couldn’t physically meet up we both had a lot going on in personal &amp; work lives. Towards the end of it things started getting a bit patchy in terms of being able to talk/reply to messages. Which I know seems like he was blowing my off and maybe the was but I’d said to him since day one that if he wasn’t interested/had changed his mind to just come out and tell me straight rather than play games, or maybe I was overthinking and he was genuinely busy. 

Eventually we managed to meet up again and he seemed really up for it, it was a tiny bit strange at first but we soon settled back in to it. Unfortunately that week he’s been warned that he was very likely going to have to spend some time stationed abroad but he didn’t have the details then. I told him that it didn’t matter to me as I wanted to at least give it a go and keep getting to know him, he decided that he’d rather leave it as it was so early in the ‘relationship’. 

Now here’s the thing...I have not got over this guy....I have thought about him every day for the past year. I felt comfortable around him which for me is a huge deal and he made me want to be a better person (I have AFRID - which is an eating disorder - he didn’t know but he made me want to actually work on it which I have never done before). I’ve talked to other guys and been on dates but not met anyone yet that can match up. 

I just don’t know what to do...the rational part of my brain tell me that it was never a proper relationship, it might not have worked out and that I need to move on...but the little ‘what if’ part just won’t shut up! I keep wondering whether to message him and ask if he’s ever about and he’s single whether he’d want to go for a drink to catch up if he was possibly interested but it’s been so long. (Disclaimer I did message him during a low point in lockdown, just saying that I hoped he was happy and doing ok. No questions were asked and it would have been an easy message for him to ignore but he did message me back saying it was good to here from me, that he was ok and asking how I was).

I debate wheter or not to leave home for college.
I want to study electrical engineering(after failing to get into med school). The local college is great but I am considering one that is a tad better 500 kilometers away from home.

I studied hard for med school and I am still upset but there is nothing else I can do. My father is still pissed off but I do not care. He is the type that offers you love based on your achievements.
I have been in therapy for some time and my therapist told me that I did not get in simply because I could not study efectively, my brain has been destroyed by the stuff back home. I endured some physical abuse when young but nowadays it's mostly emotional.
(Like having to see your father cheat on your mother)

The college away from home is a tad bit more expensive, given the costs for rent and food. I would like to get away from home but my father is not keen on paying(not that he couldn't afford it)

The college here is great because I would have my stuff and room to retreat to. Plus, they would grant me a scolarship and a grant(I have won a prize in an engineering contest when I was in the 10th grade. I have always liked engineering and even had a small electronics lab with stuff built by me, which I eventually sold because I had to study for the S.A.T)
I could also go abroad(they have great relations with other colleges), but only after the first year

Even today he said to me whilst watching some news saying that the local police academy is recruiting: 
My father: Maybe you should consider this.
I replied:    I would not like that.
My father: You don't know what you want to do anyway.

That messed up my day. Maybe I would be able to keep myself busy enough if I go to local college? He sometimes works long hours and I don't see him all the time but when I do...
Most of my friends left town. If I were to stay I would feel left behind but it would pass. I also don't believe that much in college, it being nothing much than a basis to network and gain knowledge in order to be able to find better work. 

The sad thing is that I never asked for more than was offered to me. I am not pretentious. I am frugal. I do not drink, nor do I snoke. I did nothing wrong to them. I am a quiet individual who minds his own business.
P.S My therapist also said that the tutor my parents got me in order to study for med school is a crappy one that only wants the money. She knows because her son applied to the same med school as me and ran into my tutor when searching for one for his son.

I want to get better and stop crying like a little kid. I really do.

My mum is 5’3.5 and my dad is 5’10.5 and my brother who is going to turn 18 is 6’3 I would really appreciate any opinions on what they think I’ll become. Thank you :)",16Aug2020,1

412,"My gf and I live in the same dorm. (we both have seperate rooms in a big house with 40 rooms) Yesterday I wanted to leave the dorm at around 5 to be at my family's home before diner. She also wanted to go home but had a meeting with someone at 7 in a café. (They organize a camp together) and asked me to stay longer and ride her home after the meeting. She looked a lil sad and tired so I agreed, but told her to not make it too late. She assured me that it wouldn't take too long as the girl she met up with wanted to see a football game at 9.

Now here is the thing:
She went to the café and didn't return after 2 hours, so I messaged her and asked her when she would be back. She responded with: ""I'll be back after the first half"".
I was mad that she decided to watch the game when she knew I wanted to leave. I texted her I wanted to go home and she texted back that I should go without her.

I would have stayed and waited but a lot of her stuff was still in my room and I didn't want to clean it all up and carry it back to hers alone. So at that point I was pissed off and just left, I brought back her laptop but left her other stuff in my room, locking the door. 

Now she's mad at me and giving me the silent treatment. I immediatly felt bad for locking the door as it wasn't necessary since the chance of stuff getting stolen is small. I also could have placed her stuff at the door but I didn't want to carry a whole matress/chair out of the door alone.",16Aug2020,1

You have few interests you would like to pursue as a profitable career.  But it requires you either to be monetarily rich OR be able to risk everything for it such as avoid responsibilities of taking care of your family, chance of not succeeding in that interest...

I (27F) have been friends with this guy (29M) for a few months. I’ve had a crush on him for awhile but in the interest of not wanting to ruin our friendship, i didn’t say anything. Fast forward to a few days ago, I told him that I like him via text (he lives a few hours away) and he hasn’t responded back to me. I feel like an idiot and feel that now our friendship is ruined. I wish he would’ve just responded with “thank you for telling me. I don’t share the same feelings. I’m sorry” so that at least i know what’s up. It’s hurting me more that he’s not say anything :(

Ive been out of Highschool for a couple of years, and I’m just trying to find the right time for things to settle down to move forward in life. But my manager, we will call tam, has been a major asshole for seemingly no reason. I work at a fast food place. My job as a cook is to cook the orders and put them on trays. Their jobs (and my managers) is to bag them. Now we have been severely understaffed, especially with the cooks. We aren’t able to push orders out fast enough when you have me, (working for just under two weeks there) an associate (working just under three weeks there) and someone who started THAT DAY.. to be able to work through rush hour alone. We can’t push out everything when you have two undertrained cooks trying to rush through everything while also trying to teach someone new how to do stuff with no extra pay, working minimum wage. I had been working outside both on my neighbors lawn (he is on vacation and he said he would pay me to do it while he was gone) and mine earlier that day (around 4 hours of work with a 45 minute break afterwards that consisted of taking a shower and getting ready for work) so pulling me and the cooks aside, yelling at us, stopping us while working, to tell us we are being slow, when we have hardly worked there, is just overkill. Now the rules are if someone was there before you, and they want to go on break, they get to go first. My associate didn’t want to ask because she was in a bad mood (she always is) and so I asked if he could take a break so I could later and she responded with getting into my face and saying, with some of the most profound attitude I’ve ever heard “I’ve been here longer than anyone else has today and I havnt taken a break so no one else is.” I just stayed silent and continued my work. About an hour and a half later, a co-worker, who was female (not sure if that has anything to do with it) asked for a break and she responded with the whole being there earlier than everyone else thing “but yeah you can take a break” was tacked on at the end. The co worker said “alright thank you sorry for stepping away for awhile” and tam said “it’s no problem I can fill in for you” I was beyond pissed at this point and wanted to quit right there. I know it sounds childish but I was just beyond pissed at the fact that she has undertrained cooks working rush hour alone, yells at them for being slow, asks us to bag items for them instead of cleaning (cleaning was required to be done to go home) and yelling at us when we asked for breaks. It’s just fucking unacceptable. I’m not sure what to do about it but I’m just fucking livid at the whole situation. Anyway sorry for the rant.",16Aug2020,1
419,"I have a problem where strangers being aggressive towards me, either by saying rude things or sometimes threatening me, really gets under my skin.

I was abused as a kid and being around someone yelling or showing anger at me is really triggering, especially when it feels unjustified.

I’m trying to work on it, but in the meantime I live in NYC and those kinds of interactions are a pretty regular thing just because of the sheer population. 

I always feel like my nervous system just overdrives so much during a confrontation that I can’t adequately stand up for myself. 

I know people say it’s best to just ignore it or not engage, but I see my friends respond to hostile strangers easily in a way that gets them to back off without escalating. 

I’m tired of the feeling of being scared and unsafe lingering for hours after the interaction, and feeling weak because I didn’t stand up for myself. 

On the other hand I don’t want to react inappropriately and make an ass out of myself.

One of my biggest dreams has always been to travel. Now, I will be going to a university that allows me to spend a semester abroad, which I would love to do. However, that will cost a lot of money. I could afford it, but that would mean I no longer will be able to safe up for my future home. 

That is where the problem is, because I want to get out of my parents house as soon as I can. They're not necessarily bad, but it just doesn't match between me and them. Daily fights about small things etc, I really just want to move out to get peace and independence.

Now, when I am very relaxed, for some reason my body decides that, that is the best time to over produce pre-ejaculatory fluid. And as a result i dribble into my underwear, or my bed sheets if im in bed. No arousal, nothing sexy going on it just happens, totally uncontrolable. I dont even need to be super relaxed sometimes either, it just happens. 8 times out of 10 I can feel it happening (unless im asleep). And yeah...

I felt it happen during my massage. But as I was wearing my underwear, and was under some towels I didnt worry about it. She wouldnt have been able to see anything anyway. I got home after and went to the bathroom, I had dribbled rather alot. More than usual. So I cleaned up, changed my underwear and carried on with the rest of my day.

I'm leaving home for college soon. As someone who's grown up with a bunch of siblings, I've never really had to wake myself up, since I had siblings who were getting ready for school at the same time. Consequently, I developed some fairly maladaptive habits. Specifically, I'd stay up late doing homework (or just watching youtube), end up sleeping 2 or 3 hours a night, and only wake up when some family member was screaming at me for the 3rd time.

Obviously, this won't work in college. How can I (a) dissuade myself from staying up late doing homework, (b) dissuade myself from staying up late doing useless bullshit (e.g. youtube videos), and (c) get myself to wake up when I hear an alarm?",16Aug2020,1
425,"A few years ago, I was in a toxic friendship but have learned plenty since. This largely involves detecting toxicity, standing up for myself, and communication; this person's toxicity was fueled by insecurity. This separation was hard on my friend, as they mainly wanted everybody to get along; another thing I have since learned. They were the one to introduce me to the person I'm not sure I want to let into my life.

I could go on about the signs: the infatuation phase and the switch; how we seemed to get along really well, bringing something I needed back in my life; it being hard to get a read on them; potential deviousness behind our backs; fabricating drama. But for simplicity, they stir the pot (push boundaries); something which triggers my past experiences with a previous friend. This is why I think they are toxic. Because of their actions, I got the same shakiness and psychological unease as from my previous, toxic friendship, and wound up phasing out, since it wasn't even a month being around this person.

It's been six months since and I now value getting along, as I had learned from my friend. While I have interpreted this person's actions as being red flags, I fear I have projected past experience onto this person. While I learned how to communicate and stand up for myself, I didn't think this was the best course of action at the time, as they did -- and probably still do -- enjoy stirring the pot, which may have backfired on me. I now wish I had stayed a little longer to get a better read on the situation since I left the moment I felt it was toxic. I was experiencing moderate symptoms of PTSD and felt it was necessary to leave. It was too soon. 

I need to hear from others as I am still dealing with trauma affecting my thoughts. I feel I may be healed to the point where I can be around this person again and reform my opinion and hopefully become friends once more. I have avoided an entire friend group to avoid this person and I would like to go back. I just don't want to get hurt again. Is it worth it?

•We aren’t official official but this guy and I are about to get together (in like 2 weeks). 
• He has this female friend he knows because she is his bestfriends cousin (we will call her Elena) 
•He’s always liked her off and on but she always rejects him, but then she turns around flirts without him and starts giving him all this attention when he’s not single. 
•My boyfriends never really had a serious relationship and even tho we aren’t fully together yet both of us are on the same page that we are in it for the long term (we’ve known eachother for a year/ been really close) 
•By the way we are waiting to get together because I wanted to wait a couple weeks into school to see how stuff goes with Covid. 
•Anyway my question is how I should go about this. Like should I feel super threatened? Am I overreacting? She’s rejected him a ton but the thing that bothers me is that she goes for him now that I’m in the picture. A couple of months ago she blew him off all the time and now she tries to call him once like every day. 
•They don’t hang out much anymore but lately they’ve been trying to see eachother along with his bestfriend, her bestfriend (who so happen to be together) and a couple other dudes and he’s asked me if I care and I say no because I don’t want to take him away from his friend group but it really does kind of bother me. 
•He and his bestfriend have both told me that she really doesn’t like me because she gets jealous. I trust him a lot but I’m scared he’ll catch feelings for her again if she starts flirting even though he’s told me he wouldn’t ever again. 
We are both 17 and a week ago he asked me if I would be ok if he went with them to vacation for the weekend.

 So for context, there is a guy I have been hooking up with. We agreed it would be a FWB thing since the begginig. But one time we had an argument because he did not like me talking about other guys (in the sense of past experiences) . He said he gets jealous but I should not feel special because he gets jealous for everyone, even his female cousins. I apologized and said that I would not do it anymore since he looked hurt.  I never did it again.

 But then, after some days,  he started talking about other girls he is currently trying to seduce and I did not react negatively, I listened to him and also gave him some advice on how to approach them differently. He often disrespects me, telling me his friends think I am a slut and laughingly says that he thinks that too. I get very sad but I dont express it since it is very hard to explain myself to him (got to walk on eggshells because he takes things out of context and gets offended).

 I swear I treat him so good, I pay him compliments very often to lift up his low self esteem, I listen to him every time he has a problem and be there for him. I have spent a lot of time trying to ease his anxiety and we both have seen improvements on him. I know, I should just walk away and leave it at that, but I cannot take it anymore as it has happened with a lot of people.

So I didn’t have any friends apart from 2 people, one lives in California (I’m in the uk) and only gets on at 4AM my time so I didn’t really get to play with him. One day someone messaged me and it was my school friend from years ago and he wanted to play, the following takes place in May 2019, I was big into Fortnite (I know, I know.) back then and it’s my birthday in May, by this point we had been friends for a couple months on Xbox. This is the time the John Wick cosmetics came out and it’s my favourite film so I spent some of my birthday money on it, he said I was dead to him if I didn’t gift him it so I did out of fear he’d stop being my friend, I spent £25 (the rest of my birthday money my family lives on benefits, that’s me, my mum and my sister.) and he stayed my friend and we went on as normal, then he introduced me to my other school friend called Alex for this story. So Alex was nice and were still friends so that’s good, let’s call the other guy Zach, Zach was mean to me (ditching me, insulting me and all that good stuff.) and we remained friends. I told him to get a good game I was playing called rainbow six siege (in February 2020 now) and we played the event together with some Xbox friends I made called rush (he ditched me after I killed him once because he did too, whole other story) and this is the point he started to become homophobic and racist, he’d also make shock value jokes that weren’t even shock value, like r*pe, animal abuse, child abuse, etc. Even after I told him that something to do with the first one and a pedo had affected my family. He’d make jokes like “I r*ped that *n-word* what a f*cking faot” and stuff like that. Later on (about 2 months ago) I asked if we could play ranked together and he said NO *INSERT MY NAME* YOU CANT PLAY WITH ME BECAUSE WELL LOSE YOURE A BOT. So I poked fun at him playing it and not letting me play it with him. He proceeded to say I was harassing him and saying my mental illness was “faked” and “doesn’t actually matter, it doesn’t mean anything” I said “it was just a joke, please don’t say that, POCD ruined my life” he went on a long tangent and I blocked him. Alex said I should unblock him so we can all play normally, I said ok, but he can’t poke fun at my Illness anymore, he said ok and we played more. He started watching the office so I asked the British or the american because I wanted to talk about it with him because I’m a big fan of the american one and he’s watching it too. In the party he said “ INSERT MY NAME asked me what office I was watching yesterday like what you’re so weird, I said “I just thought we could talk about it because it’s a common interest” he said “yeah but every episode is a different story dumb a**” then said “IM WATCHING THE AFRICAN OFFICE, I LIKE THE PART WHERE HIS KNECK GETS KNELT ON!” I said tone down the racism please, it’s been a week since George floyds death, it’s not funny and it never has been or will be. He caused a whole drama about the ranked thing and saying “YOURE HARRASING MEEE!” And blocked me. He said “My mum listens to my Xbox conversations and she thinks that *my name* is horrible. He eventually unblocked me so we started playing again and I asked again if I could play ranked with him since he was playing it with Alex and AGAIN he went on a tangent on how bad I am (even though I’m level 160 and he’s level 90) so I left and blocked him silently.

438,"Oh boy, is this one a doozy. Let me start at the start.

My flatmate left old takeaway containers on the bench. I assumed they were recycling. He wrote a note in all capitals. I replied back with one in all capital's. - Being passive aggressive (yeah i know not the best move) anyway this 30 something year old guy decided that the best move was to come to my room and then threaten me a 22 year old male. I told him to step back he refused then proceeded to grab me and shove me against the door frame so I tried to push back to get him off me. - he then proceeded to push me down onto my bed next to my door and get on top of me in a none fun way and put me in a chokehold and punch me in the face. He eventually got off after some thrashing about on my part, at this point I'm in my back and he's standing on my bed he then decided to kick me in my ribs which I recently broke. Anyway I got up got him to leave after much yelling.

He finally left i called the cops he got formally warned but not charged or taken away. I left for the night. In the morning I made contact with the landlord as the police advised and explained the situation. She hasn't done anything and I can't live here. I tried staying at my mum's but there's no spare room also they only have a little couch so I couldn't really sleep on it. So I had to come back which sucks and I don't want to be around. The flatmate has managed to sway the rest of the flat that I'm the bad guy and that I was out of control.  So basically I've been ostracized in the flat, also I'm just scared being here and now I'm being forced out of my own flat and I can't A) afford it and B) find a place to live at the moment.


So after all of that what i hear to ask is: 
How does one go about setting up their first apartment by themselves?
What kind of costs are in doing that are not directly obvious?
What's the fastest way to save and or make money to get for a bond?
Is there any legal (NZ Laws) way to make his life a living hell?
What are some good coping techniques for dealing with anger and the barely controllable urge to go back over to him with a weapon this time?

439,"Hi!  
I'm a 19 years old boy and I'm turning 20 this December and as the time goes by, I get more anxious and depress. To put it simply, I don't want to grow up; I feel like I'm gonna lose my freedom and that scares me, and most of all, I'm fearful of death. Saying the last part made me anxious and depress as I'm typing this.

I've been having this thought since I was 18 and I reflected upon it as well to figure out what to do. I exercised though admittedly I only do it in once or twice a week. I'm a practitioner of Martial arts as well and I actually enjoyed it because I felt like I could brag about something and that made me happy for a short while, distracted away to such thoughts but in reality, they're just in the back of my mind. While reflecting, I figured that this may have originated from my constant isolation to others. I've always been alone — never had a girlfriend nor consistent friends and was always too afraid to ask for help. Hell, deciding if I should ask in this subreddit took me awhile cause I don't know if this was the right place to ask.

Perhaps I don't have anything to look forward to in life? I don't know.

Bottomline is: I need help and I'm asking for advices on how I can deal with this cause otherwise If  feel like I'm gonna kill myself in the near future if I left it as it is.

TL:DR I don't want to grow up as It felt like I'm gonna lose freedom. Need help to know how I can deal with this.

443," To start off, anxiety's always been a problem I've faced in life but it was always something I was able to cope with. However, in the last 10 days it's had a very strong crippling effect on my mental and physical health.

From Friday last week to Tuesday this week, I have not eaten whatsoever. Anxiety's affected my appetite a lot in the past, but never to an extent where I go multiple days without eating. This is still continuing on and off.

My mental health has been doing very well before all of this happened. Something happened recently outside my control that has caused my anxiety and overthinking to skyrocket. I know it's not my fault, but I blame myself for this thing that happened. Some people deliberately spread lies about me which caused other people I looked up to to change their view on me. I had no opportunity to defend myself and I feel hurt and confused why they treated me so poorly. I'm looking for answers I guess I'll never get.

I was off anti-depressants for a few weeks but went back on them last week due to what's been happening lately. I went to my GP to discuss everything in detail, but he has no help for my anxiety and wants me to wait until my old medication kicks back in (My old medication apparently acts as an anti-anxiety medication too). I started to take CBD oil earlier this week for my severe anxiety. It works, but only when my anxiety is extremely bad.

I rarely overthink, but it's been happening all the time lately. I'm also feeling very weak from not eating, ill, and just physically cold. Can't stand up for longer than a minute or I feel dizzy. I'm honestly even afraid to sleep. Everything gives me anxiety. For the last while I've only showered once a week I've been feeling so down.

My mood is swinging massively. One moment I'm happy, a minute later I'm extremely anxious/sad. I've even been having panic attacks once every couple hours. It's been well over a year since I've last experienced them, but they're swarming me.

I'm going back to college again soon, and I guess I'm worried my anxiety will mess it all up. I'm having counselling but I'm considering stopping it. It's over the phone because of the virus and I don't feel like it's working well for me at all.

It's starting to make me pretty depressed, and I've honestly been crying a lot because of it. I'm thinking of getting hospitalised, but because of Covid I can't have visitors. This alone makes me pretty hesitant to go to a hospital, but I'm still considering it.

Not sure why I'm really writing this post. I feel overwhelmed a bit, this time last month I was feeling incredible, but it's all changed on such short notice. I guess I just feel a bit lost/alone (maybe I want to vent a bit?) and I'm looking for support in any way. I'm not sure what to do to get out of this situation. If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it. Thank you for reading.",16Aug2020,1

TLDR: I'm being asked to earn 270$ as someone who hasn't finished high school due to personal problems with family during a pandemic

I live in the Philippines. I'm not exactly poor, but somewhat in the middle class. I was homeschooled for most of my life which is why I'm not exactly prepared on what to do.

Back in 2017, I ended up stopping my studies because of problems in my house. My Mom wanted to leave my Dad since he wasn't making time for her even though my Father was unemployed at the time. For a year or so, we had to jump around places and when my Mom wanted to annul with my Dad, my Dad did his absolute best to be with her and improve. Thankfully they got back together-- sadly, my situation didn't improve. 

For some reason they stopped helping me with my studies and chose to dump everything I had to do in my school, on me. I had to choose which school I wanted to go to, what I want to do, course, how I'd enroll, etc etc. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what school I was supposed to go to, I just thought my parents had a plan and I should just **trust them**, as you should with your parents.

However, they didn't really relay that to me. They sorta just assumed I knew what to do already and they didn't want anything to do with it. They didn't give me a budget, they didn't sit me down saying

""Hey son, you need to do stuffs on your own now""

Fast-forward to 2020, they actually told me that I need to do my schooling stuffs on my own at around March, where they were absurdly clear about it and threatening to kick me out. (they've been doing that threat since I was 12) I've already had my first job despite not finishing high school. I excel very well in English, something I'm very happy of, so I was hired through a referral by my uncle and was able to have a job for a month, but due to the pandemic and some unfortunate circumstances at work, I was inevitably let go.

Today, they asked me again what I wanted to do in my life, now I knew what I wanted to be. I wanted to be a psychologist, because I wanted to help people, partly also because my siblings and I are not very well off in our mental health with how my parents are-- but with the pandemic going on, and being behind, I couldn't get into a college as much as I wanted.

So my Dad asked me to make 13,000₱ (roughly 260$) by my birthday (December) to show him that I'm not useless for my future. The pandemic is still thriving here and I feel really useless. I excel very well in English, proofreading and writing, but I can't find any job that would help. Additionally, they want to put me back in Grade 10 which should help but I feel mentally ill because of so many things to process.

I need advice. What do I do? What could I possibly do to earn money as someone who hasn't graduated from high school, roughly no experience, in a pandemic? 

For emotional advice if you'd like to give some: Is it okay to feel useless? I've been depressed for a long time because of how my parents treat me. It feels like everything is going through so fast and I knew I should do something but I didn't know what or why. I feel like I should've been to blame even though my parents were the ones supposedly handling my schooling.

I don't know what to do, I feel lost.",16Aug2020,1
448,"My friend (F17) was talking romantically with a girl (F22) for about a month... They met online in a group chat made for girls struggling with eating disorders and connected immediately, the problem is, they weren’t aware of each other’s ages at the time

I watch this relationship develop from the start as my friend told me about her, and they seemed perfect for each other.  My friend was aware that this girl was in college but never asked her for her grade, and it was the girl who realized the fetal error after my friend mentioned the word “high school” in one of their conversations... 

My friend called me pretty embarrassed about the whole ordeal, and they agreed to continue the relationship solely as friends... they had already scheduled their first date however, and (being that they both suffered depression and just needed to see someone amid the virus) decided to keep their plans but go simply as friends... and they ended up having a great time

The problem is that the day was a little too good... and my friend’s feelings for this girl have grown stronger... She knows what’s right and has accepted that she won’t be able to date her until her birthday next summer, but she’s very torn about the advice she’s received from the people closest to her... 

Some of her friends encourage her to stay friends with this girl (some even say go for it and date her, but I don’t agree with this) while others argue to cut off all ties completely... I’m posting this as kind of a favor to her to get an adults perspective, she’s not comfortable enough to talk to her father for various reasons, so for now, reddit looks like option

449,"My first instinct is always to help try and solve their problem. When other people ask for my advice and they happen to tell me a situation I’ve been in before, I can usually help by telling them how I dealt with it when it happened to me. But when it’s something I have never experienced I get confused on what to say. I know I should probably just sit and be a good listener, but even after I listen I have to say something don’t I? Otherwise it will just be awkward silence? I have no idea how to listen and stay quiet after they’re done telling me their story because I want them to feel heard. To me helping them solve their problem reassures that I was listening. What would be the appropriate response?

I have no idea if any of what I said made sense. Hopefully it did but if not then I’m sorry. English is not my first language.",16Aug2020,1
450,"I am the vice-head student councillor (SC) of my high school. There is one head SC (let's call her X) and three vice-heads. The board is structured with four departments, so the other two vice-heads each become in charge of one department while I take charge of two. X's role is to ""oversee the entire board"", but she is not in charge of any department.

Everyone seemed to instinctively understand that this arrangement was natural - because X would have many more responsibilities than either of the three vice-heads, so she could not take charge of any department, not even the one with the lightest workload. I was fine with it too, at the start of our term last year.

But throughout my time working as a department head, as a vice-head, I realised just how absurd it was. With the responsibilities of two departments, I spent almost 3 to 4 hours every day on department work (my school loves to implement countless initiatives to ""spice up student life""; the planning and execution fall onto the SCs' shoulders), whether it was guiding the juniors, working with my batch-mates or liaising with teachers. Coupled with academic work, I usually sleep at around 1-2am on weekdays and wake up at 5am the next day. I used to have many commitments and achievements such as piano, research projects, competitions etc. but I decided to give up so many of them because of my SC duties, since the teachers always approach me and the other vice-heads to organise ad-hoc activities. My grades have always been pretty high, but ever since I became the vice-head they just dropped.

On the other hand, X does next to nothing. For events like Student Leaders' Investiture or Orientation, her official title is ""overall in-charge / IC"". The vice-heads are, again, assigned to lead different organising committees. Yet she called for one meeting each, in the middle of our planning stage, and the meetings were mainly just inter-organising committee updates, and lasted no longer than 30min. We added her into every chat group so she is aware of the progress of every committee, but never has she once offered to help out - even when we desperately needed manpower to do some large-scale packing of items, when we chased our teachers to vet our proposals, when we panicked over meeting calls at night, etc. Instead, she spent her time being involved in other commitments to boost her all-roundedness, like research projects and competitions, and getting achievements.

X is very popular among the school; all her friends love her. Our SC teacher in-charge is her form teacher too, so X's is essentially her favourite student. The only people I have told about this are my family members; I'm too much of a coward to confide in my friends because I don't know if anyone else feels this way, or if I am merely the abnormal jealous one. I lack the guts to tell my teachers about her attitude, because it feels like snitching and feels... wrong. So whenever she makes a speech about being proud of our batch and overcoming all the obstacles together, I do feel like crying. When she receives a prize for the character award that has traditionally gone to every year's head SC, I can't help but question whether past head SCs bore the same attitude she had. I despise myself for thinking this way, I know it's terribly wrong of me to be so skeptical of others' achievements and I want to stop such thoughts. But I just feel like if she had been more passionate about SC work, she could have helped us out when we were really struggling and maybe my life for the past one year could have been slightly better. I just don't feel it is right to only act as a ""symbol"" or the face of the board, of the school; being voted in as the head SC meant a true passion and commitment to serving the school.

Am I just jealous? Maybe... If an interviewer were to choose between a head SC who have had many more achievements and a vice-head who have had fewer achievements for a job, I thought the choice would be obvious. Is it right to think this way? We're ending our term soon and I'm so glad to finally strip myself of these responsibilities. But I feel that while I have learnt many valuable project management skills, this past year has also been filled with regrets. I have also walked away with heavy skepticism of what these leadership positions really mean, and overall just an aversion from leadership in general. How do I resolve myself of such negativity? Would I be in the right if I told the teachers about her attitude? But what can it do, if our term is technically already over?

456,"I'm 22 and currently a Bachelor of Computer Science student at a small university in Germany. I spent most of my ""adult"" life here, have many friends, still live with my parents and can't really complaint much about my life. I'm now facing the situation of having the choice of moving to another city for my Master's degree.

I have a few concerns with this. First off I don't want to leave all my friends behind here and am also scared of not connecting in the new city. Secondly I still don't know the exact field of CS that I'm most interested in. I'm mostly a very open person and like to try out things and generally like to keep my choices widely open.

I still live with my parents here and I don't have a girlfriend, therefore I don't really have much of a reason to move into an own/shared apartment. Financially it doesn't make sense. I feel kind of a bit awkward when telling people that I still live with my parents. I love my family but I also feel like I should start my own life at some point.

I'm in my last semester now writing my thesis and I have spent the last 2 1/2 years working as an iOS/Android Developer for a startup company in the medical field near our university. The last 2 years the company has grown a lot and I feel like a part of it, despite that I'm only a part-time worker.

I'm a bag of mixed feelings right now. If I would switch my location to Berlin (which I'm aiming for) I'd be a small town boy in the metropole of Germany. I'd also give up my friends, family and work place for something unknown. I really enjoy traveling and meeting new people but I've never moved all of me to a new city, and I mostly travel with one friend to keep company.

There's a feeling inside me that tells me that I don't want to settle in this city and I'd still like to see more of the world. Also I'm not a 100% sure what I want from life and where I'll end up. Am I going to pursue a more scientific career or rather inside of the industry? These are all things that I'll probably need to address, are going to address itself with time, in the new city.

When I got to where the car was parked there were a bunch of Polaroids scattered across the ground, all of them were of this girl, in most of them she was naked, in some having sex. I suppose things ended bitterly and the guy threw them there so whoever lives with her ( her family?) and neighbors could see this in the morning. I picked them all up after making sure the guy left so that nobody who shouldn’t see them could see them. I don’t know what to do with them, I certainly don’t want to hold on to them, do I just throw them in the trash? How do I go on about discretely returning them to the girl?

Recently I’ve been wanting to be his friends again.

I’ve been very lonely and barely any of my few friends respond to me besides when we have online classes and by then it’s only 3. I know he’d respond whenever I’d message and I’d feel less lonely. 

In class, because he’s a boy and physically strong, he’d be a sort of protector for me sometimes because I know that some of the boys REALLY don’t like me

Third, it’s just another friend and I only have 5 close friends I actually talk with currently.

But I don’t know if I want to become his friend knowing what he thinks of women and men.  It’s not like the thing with LGBT people, where it’s sort of okay if you disagree with them (idk why it’s okay, people on reddit just say it is) but at least with people like that, they don’t think it should be universal but he genuinely thinks that his way should be enforced.

HOWEVER again, he does think his way should be enforced but he doesn’t tell people to do it. He probably believes that sports isn’t for girls based on what he already thinks, but he doesn’t tell the sporty girl in our class to stop doing it.

I come from a third world Muslim country and I have to say I'm only now starting to accept just how ingrained racism is in the minds of people here. I'm not exaggerating and I'm trying to move past it because sometimes trying to educate someone on why their views are very wrong doesn't work.

I already emailed my boss last week telling her I want to quit and that I would quit before the 19th, but she never responded. I am so tired of working there, so would it be unethical to just stop showing up? I told her in the email that I would continue working through the 19th, but now I don't even want to do that.  I don't want to make things harder for my coworkers, but I hate the job and it is bad for my mental heath.

473,"TL; DR Can I quit this job I started two weeks ago in a letter and leave or should I do it in person?


I have been in therapy for a year recently a few months ago realized I needed out of my career into something a lot less mentally and emotionally demanding than childcare. I have a friend who works as a property manager and she got me a job as a cleaner for them doing move ins, move outs, their office and condos the manage. I have an interview on the Monday, hired in the Tuesday, I started on the Wednesday. (End of July). They told me I would be on my own, but that they would come when I was done in the first few places, sort of walk through with me and tell me what I missed. Okay perfect no problem, I’ve never cleaned professionally but I love to do it, I’m good at it. I get to be alone, listen to my own music. So they send me to an apartment, my first job is a bad one. Lady lived in it for 15 years I swear she never cleaned. Anyways it takes me 11 hours. I text when I’m done asking for them to come through it with me “I’m busy today, will find time later end of week”. So basically since I’ve started I have never been trained, I haven’t had a walk through of a place I’ve cleaned, I haven’t been invited to the staff meeting they had, or introduced to staff that I work with, or ya know in general welcomed on to a team. It’s caused me such severe anxiety that the last place I cleaned I cried the entire time. I did not leave one career to just go to a job to be treated like this. 

I guess what I’m saying is I want to quit. And I want to do it right now. My idea (because I’m an anxiety ridden C-PTSD 28 year old with no self confidence or the ability to stand up for herself and confrontation makes her puke) is to go early in the morning, leave the cleaning supplies, leave my shirts, leave the keys, and leave my letter of resignation. And just be gone. 

Every website I read is like “resign in person, tell the the reason you’re leaving. Don’t be negative” when basically if I have to do that I will probably just cry the entire time and tell them I am too mentally messed up right now to be that independent. And I don’t wanna do that either. 

I could also just call them, tell them I got a better full time paying job and I quit. But that’s lying. Anyways if you made it this far seriously help me.",16Aug2020,1

476,"**TL;DR: haven't talked to friend in two months and should I text her just to check in on her? Or will I look desperate?!**

Hi,(M20)

So I had this friend (F19) and were really good friends. After some time I started to get feelings for her but didn't tell her because of the circumstances and the fear of getting rejected.

Anyways, she started dating some guy and started ghosting me, which I didn't take to well, which resulted in a fight about why she was ghosting me so after the fight we didn't speak to her for a month.

After the month, I texted her again and apologized for my behaviour. And after that we were friends again for a while, and then she started ghosting me again. So I told her everything and asked if she felt the same way and she said that "" I get really confused with my feelings, But I can tell I really like having you around"" which by the face of it is a No. And I told her I couldn't be near her because she was dating someone else, and that there were way too much feelings involved. And so she said for what it was worth she wasn't happy either and that time and space will fix my problem.

It's now been two and a half months and I wanna check in on her!

Some of my friends say that if she really cared about the friendship she would've checked up on and I shouldn't do it because I'll look weak and desperate.

What is your opinion?",16Aug2020,1
477,"I didn’t invite a friend into my bridal party (bridesmaids bridesgrooms) and the groom didn’t invite him to the groomsmen either. We chose not to because we have had situations in the past where I was excited about something and they were careless in their response. 


Perhaps they weren’t meaning to be an asshole to me- but I sure didn’t like it, and we have been friends for about a year or so. I and other friends have explained to this person what comments I don’t like, and they’ve insisted it’s all in my head. So I just keep a comfortable distance and only share with them what I wont be hurt to be even mildly teased for. 
No need to argue more if I don’t think somebody will listen.  A really tough choice for me. 

It sounds like exactly the kind of situation I’d like to quietly avoid while trying on my wedding dress, being indecisive about elements of the wedding, or complaining about family who was making the situation harder than it had to be. 

My Maid of honor also suspected this person might accidentally hurt my feelings and didn’t see any reason to include them beyond an invite and an enthusiasm to party with them. I do like this person as a friend- but not as a best friend. 

BECAUSE, When I am vulnerable to them- it frequently doesn’t work out, which is exactly why I didn’t explicitly think to invite them when I tried on my dress for the first time. 

This person was quite offended that there was a group chat to see all of my planning (people in the wedding party) and they found out because their boyfriend is in the wedding party, who we’ve known for many many years. 

When I explained to them why they weren’t in the wedding party or the group chat- they insisted I meant some sort of ill-will, and that my feelings about their comments were all in my head. 

***And finally, asked to not be invited to the wedding because of this.***

Later, my maid of honor went to reaffirm that this was so I was completely sure I wouldn’t have any judgmental comments during the planning process- and she ALSO suspected this person might pull something like this. 

When I wasn’t the only person saying it- they finally resorted to “I guess I’ll go but I don’t want to if it will ruin her day” which- isn’t something I said. I said your snide judgmental comments upset me. Now- this person is focusing on how “the bride doesn’t want me there ):” which was never true- I just don’t want you in my planning process. 

It feels like this person wants me to put my happy feelings on hold to convince them they’re important enough to me- when really- a wedding is the other way around.

A new girl just moved in so I assumed she was doing her laundry. Until today when I encountered 2 heron addicts using the machines at full capacity, before you say I’m quick to judge my mom was on heron so yes I can spot the signs straight off the back. 

My laundry door has a small padlock on a large glass roller door but the door is quiet heavy and often moves off the roller mechanisms. I really need to do something to stop this from happening. They’ve moved the drier around the room. They’ve walked into my neighbours property and their using her out door chairs for their smoke breaks. I caught one of them today moving my jacket off the clothes line. It’s like they are moving in. It makes me feel sick.

487,"Hi all, my nickname and model alias has been “Rebel” since 2007. I was nick named this back when I was a promo girl/stage dancer in a team of about 8 young women. I resonated with the name because I did “rebel” from my strict religious cult upbringing, and my risqué modeling career has been motivated by my distain for being controlled by organized religion and patriarchal norms of society. 

However, over the years a couple of people (photographers, friends) have told me they thought the nickname “Rebel” implied a political standpoint- and not in a good way... 

Those few times it’s been brought up to me make me wonder how many others make that assumption about my nick name. I have explained my nick name’s origin and also have related it to how Bob Marley titles an album “Rebel Music” which is a vibe and theme I resonate with, not the confederate connotation “rebel”.

488,"So in January of this year I've lost all my friends. Here's a little background on how this came to be:
I live in a fairly small city where rumors spread very fast and people tend to be very judgemental towards one another. I've always had the same group of friends and we were known to be hanging out with each other all the time. There were 4 of us:me, two guys and a girl. I met those two guys in kindergarten and i met the girl in elementary school so we were very close and old friends (10+ years of friendship). Well back in March of 2019 one of the two guys decided we should hang out with some more people and we were all excited about that. We used to go out with all sorts of people all the time and that's how we met another dude who later on hung out with us quiet frequently. We'll call him Karl. So Karl was very extroverted person he was always up for good fun and he liked to party a lot. He introduced me and my three other friends to two girls and another guy. That's where all the chaos began. It was always like 8 of us hanging out all the time and it became too much for everyone too handle. I developed feelings towards one of the girls in the group and to my surprise she also developed feeling for me but Karl decided that he wasn't gonna let me make moves on her and that he was ""in love with her first"". I just got so pissed of because he used to shame me for everything and anything and so i just cut all contact with him. Others weren't so pleased with my decision but they were just minding their own business. Later on i shot my shot and i got in a relationship with that girl, and all of a sudden everyone in the group started teasing me and making fun of me all the time. It's gotten so bad to the point where i used to flat out avoid going out with them. Karl stopped hanging out with us because he used to gossip a lot about everyone and so everyone got mad at him. In December of 2019 is where it all started going down for me. A girl from the group came out and said that i harassed her and that she had bulimia and her parents are in the proces of getting a divorce and that i knew all about it and just harassed her through it all. That's absolutely not true, anyone who knows me knows that I'm a shy person and that i don't like arguing and fighting let alone harassing someone over personal problems,but no one believed what i said. They were all just focused on her all the time and cut all the ties with me. I was in shock that three of my closest friends that I've known since i was very young would betray me like that and i was so sad all the time. There were days where i just couldn't find my way out of the bed. My whole world was broken down and didn't know ehat to do. The only person that stood by me all that time was my girlfriend and they decided to cut tues with her two because she was supporting me. After that they apologized to Karl and they've started hanging out with him. They've gotten fairly popular and they stsrted spreading rumors about me. They told people how i was homophobic because they knew i had a couple of gay friends, they told everyone that i harassed people and that I'm toxic and that they should all just avoid me at all costs. They also started harassing me on social media sending me all kinds of messages and posting stuff about me. It's been nearly 8 months since that all went down and i haven't been able to recover from it. The only person i can talk to and the only person i go out with and hang out with is my girlfriend and I'm so grateful to have her. I just want to be able to feel happiness and joy and give all my love and affection to my girlfriend. Any suggestions on how to deal with this?

I am a female and 23. Met a guy on hinge. He’s 27. He has a college degree and He lives with his parents while he is going to trade school. He lives an hour away from me and originally asked if I was okay with the distance (and I was.) he told me his intentions were seeking a relationship as were mine. he was weirdly sexual at first, I was not sure whether or not I felt okay with this. He and I would have great conversations and then he’d turn it sexual.. he was kind, sweet, funny, caring and would listen to me throughout the day and then became horny at night. I was sometimes okay with it as I was sexually attracted to him but there were moments where I was not feeling it. He bought me a $100 Bluetooth vibrator he could control with an app... which I felt really strange about. he had the coronavirus and I did not get to meet him for 3 weeks.. had to keep rescheduling dates until he was negative for the infection. 

He came to my apartment for a weekend and brought the vibrator in a box. We had sex 4-5 times consensually, it was fun and all but something just didn’t feel right :( like I was being used.. he continued to talk to me and he took me out to lunch, and basically proceeded lead me on for another two weeks. 

He FaceTimed me while he was cumming one time and then all of a sudden He stopped being super sexual.

I tried my best to tell him i would love to try, and he also mentioned beforehand how fridays and the weekends would be for us. He then proceeded to say he didn’t know what was going to happen when we started talking and he was grateful to have met me. Who even was this person, wtf?

504,"I'm an engineer, about to finish a one-year contract, the first job out of university. I asked about a renewal, and they said I have been doing very well, and they really want to keep me until the end of the project (could be 2-3 years). So, they want to give me a contract that finishes at the end of the project, the exact date is TBD. They also said that at this rate, I will be in a more senior position after that.

After seeking some advice, I want to ask about the possibility of a (small) raise, given that I'm making more of a commitment to the company and project. I replied to their (unofficial, initial) notice that my contract will be extended, saying that I definitely want to stay. I also mentioned that I'd like to discuss something regarding the terms of the contract first (I didn't mention anything specific, just that I wanted to discuss something). They are probably going to ask me about this in the next few days.

I am very anxious now, thinking about how I might bring this up when they ask me. More than likely, it will be an online discussion due to current working arrangements. I want to make it clear that it's not a dealbreaker, I will stay even on the same pay, but would like to ask about the possibility of a small raise. How should I word it?

I've graduated (with a high grade) and now have to move on with my life by getting a job but I can't stop fixating on what would have been had I picked that other, better University.
Any advice?",16Aug2020,1

510,"I've been struggling a lot with my best friend drifting away from me over the past year or so. We've know each other for 15 years and I was always the type to focus on one person. So, naturally, I got no one else to talk to about this and was hoping for some advice.

We've been through a lot together, as you do when knowing a person for so long and this person being the only one you really talk to concerning personal topics. I was there when her father left her family, she was there when I was at my lowest, struggling with depression. For about a year and a bit now, she was keeping me on hold. Not responding, not wanting to visit, just a short cut call here and there. And for a few months now she seems to not care anymore. Not even coming up with excuses anymore, just not bothering. This year she didn't even send a birthday message. 

I know, it's normal for people to drift apart, to not wanting to be in someones life anymore. But I really can't cope. I feel so left alone, betrayed and angry. But I also know there's nothing I can do about it. I just... Maybe someone has an advice on how to move on? It's been a year since I knew things would end this way and I still think about it everyday. I just think about what I did do wrong for her to act like this?

513,"This will require some explanation/backstory:

Ended a 6 month relationship in May with a guy with quite the flirtatious past. He was notorious for being the ""player"" type and my silly self still decided it was a good idea to pursue a relationship with him at the time because he was fun to be around and we had good chemistry.

Halfway into the relationship, I noticed little things that started to bother me, like the fact that he was following so many promiscuous IG pages and constantly liking photos of girls who he barely knew (I get it, celebrities are different. I'm really not a controlling bitch, but I have my limits about what's appropriate in a relationship). I advised him that for his career and future as a professional public figure in his field (not in the entertainment industry), maybe it would be better if he didn't follow pages of half-naked girls. He acknowledged ""You're right, I never thought of that. Half of these girls mean nothing to me and some of the girls I met once or twice were definitely troublemakers anyway."" So he unfollowed a bunch, I appreciated his effort, and life went on, until...

Fast forward 2 weeks post-breakup: I was lonely/upset/hurt about the breakup and was so isolated not seeing anyone during quarantine, I decided to scroll YT and IG and and followed a few new guy pages; NONE of them were promiscuous or anything that would make me look ""bad"", and in fact they posted mostly about their professions, which I really admired. Soon after, my ex messages me ""nice to see you trying to get attention from all these new guys. just letting you know one of my exes actually dated 'guy X' and he's not the greatest dude. but if you want i have a lot of mutual friends, i can ask them to hook you guys up."" OBVIOUSLY saying all of this out of spite because of what I ""made"" him do during our relationship. I got so pissed and told him it's absolutely none of his business what I do after our breakup (I could go full on slut-mode and technically it shouldn't matter), and I told him to buzz off and mind his own business. But he kept insisting that I was a hypocrite for making him unfollow so many people that make him look bad, but somehow following and liking these guys with amazing professional careers (who barely show any skin) makes me a hypocrite? None of these guys compare to the breast-showing, basically naked girls that he used to follow...

Hilariously enough after he ""confronted"" me, he decided to re-follow some of the girls he said were ""bad news / trouble"" and started liking their photos again. Disappointing to see him going back to his old ways, but I never spoke out once about it, because I know it's not my place anymore since we're no longer together.

Fast forward AGAIN to just now (2 months post-breakup), I follow another person (again for his inspiring career posts, and I happen to have many close mutual friends who also know him personally) and my ex messages me yet again ""hey just letting you know again haha i have friends that are friends with this ""guy Y"", fyi"". I am utterly shocked that he is doing this to me a second time. I'm so triggered, but also find it amusing that he still keeps track of me so regularly, and that he thinks he still has a say in who I follow or not on social media. 

What's the best way to handle this or what to say back? I've been nothing but cordial to him but this unnecessary BS really makes me want to scream. I’ve hesitated on blocking because I was hoping to still be friends, but perhaps that’s not feasible or possible anymore. Any advice would be appreciated!",16Aug2020,1
514,"I have this really good friend who is a girl and ive had a crush on her for the longest time, since we are both starting the same university in fall she asked me if we could get a place together.
 I was uncertain and I said I would let her know, I know this might seem like every boys dream but the problem is we are just friends, what happens if she finds a boyfriend and invites him back to our place, it would be torture for me. Although I do enjoy the idea of living with her, spending so much time with her, maybe something romantic might happen.
 I'm not sure what to do, if to accept her offer or not, or maybe I should let her know about the feelings I have for her but it could ruin the friendship we have.

515,"Going to keep this as short as possible.

I’ve been working with a company for roughly the past year and a half while doing my studies and its been a good experience so far. I like that it didn’t require a majority of my days, I made a decent amount of money and its something that I enjoy. 

I speak in past tense because COVID fucked the flow of things and the industry is in major strain, as they all are.. This is the wedding industry btw, to avoid any assumptions lol. Anyways, I just finished my Bachelors and now I’m at a crossroad. 

My current boss is in hope of keeping me with the company, however, we all know that COVID will possibly be around for a bit. 

His proposition is to provide a “fair” monthly pay for “training” until the business returns to some form of normalcy and we have regular bookings again. 

*Fair - “enough to keep you comfortable”
*Training - “working together with the team to improve all aspects of the brand”

BUT, I am not allowed to do any type of freelancing outside of this to supplement my monthly income as he wants 110% commitment. He claims that based on his experience no one is ever able to give commitment and freelance because interest becomes blurred. 

This job is cinematography and video editing. Outside of that, I do photography, web design, graphic design, motion graphics and all that jazz.

I think this is ridiculous, selfish and stifling. I feel like I’m being put into a box and I don’t like it.

She's currently the only reason I'm alive and going forward and I don't wanna be annoying to her, even though she says ""it's cute I love talking to you bby"" I still feel like I'm annoying her if not always sometimes and she just feels bad for me, I don't know cause I feel the need to constantly tell her how much she means to me but I also don't want her to leave cause I'm annoying her.

518,"I of course need advice, but it also feels great to put this in words. I have a friend who I have known for about 5 or so years now we met and high school and have been friends ever since. Ever since we’ve met he’s always had a thing of telling crazy stories that almost people can tell are lies, but for some reason all of these years I’ve kind of put that fact aside and just considered it a quirk. (Stupid I know) But recently I’ve gone back on memories and it’s beginning to make me fearful. Let me outline my current situation. I’m currently taking some college courses along with my girlfriend. I essentially live here with her and her parents mostly because it’s convenient for school and being together is nice. However my friend also currently lives here as he is homeless, or so he says and I’m praying is actually true. He’s been living with us for about a year now and everything has become progressively worse. He lies a fuck ton, as I’ve mentioned, he sometimes lies when he doesn’t even need to. He has no job and has never paid my girls parents a single cent. He sometimes goes down to the market to buy ice or soda and what not and I legitimately think that he believes that is sufficient. Anyways, he also had an extremely, oh shall we say shadowy persona and family life. Like I have known the guy for this long and I know so little. He still does the high school please fuck me sad boy aesthetic thing which is highly annoying. I mean Jesus Christ this man spent fafsa money on fucking oni rings. You know the Japanese mask demon dudes? He also smokes cigarettes ( as he is so kind to remind us every fucking second), and has an extremely shallow outlook and personality sometimes. The worst part is, some people just seem to eat it up, like I don’t know man. My girlfriends mother has wanted to confront him about stuff multiple times, but hasn’t due to her non-confrontational personality. She is getting so frustrated. He eats all the food, does the bare minimum chores and duties, does not communicate his plans or status, just barely started to do his own laundry, doesn’t have a job and thought about dropping out of college, and just AAAAAAAAAAAAA. The man even leaves sometimes to stay at his uncles, which like...couldn’t you live there? Like am I missing something here. At this point I’m too afraid to say anything. Like he just has this sort of...circle? I guess? Like I feel if bridges were burned he would do something harmful. And it’s stressing me out. There is also something I forgot to mention, he can’t take criticism. I can’t tell the amount of times I just wanted to sit this dude down with my gf’s mom and talk like adults but you can’t. He is utterly convinced he is the smartest one in the room even though he literally has a learning disability and can barely string together a coherent sentence. (Neither can I as you can see from this rant) but I digress. Like he is so fucking obnoxious when responding to criticism. Like a 13 year old to his parents. My girlfriend and I are at our wits end and although we will most likely have a talk with him at some point, I just need to put this out here. Like I need the armchair motherfuckers to give a diagnosis, and advise me accordingly. I don’t want to believe he is really like this, but just the constant lying, lack of communication, slob lifestyle, shallow outlook, self deprecating sad boi personality, god complex, manipulative tendencies, and lack of critical acceptance, is driving us crazy. Like I shit you not
(and I hate playing the blame game) this man has caused me to gain 100 pounds over the last two years. Because on top of all the bullshit I have to deal with he’s always there just piled on top of it. It irks me to think that not only that he might actually fucking think he’s a conniving genius, but that he actually is taking advantage of my girls goodwill. I mean shit there are days where I deadass think she will murder him but there he is, asleep and snoring on the bedroom floor, ready to get up for a hard day of screaming at call of duty and eating frozen food while me and my girl try to retain whatever sanity we have left. We are honestly so stupid but whatever. There is so much I’m leaving out but this is too long already and jumbled as hell. I just want to be heard tbh, just need to see it in writing.

521,"So I was over at a buddies house to celebrate him and I deploying(not together). We both are married. He ended up being the most fucked up person there  so I went outside to check on him and we had a conversation where he told me he really appreciated me and said I was his best friend and that I was his brother. When that conversation ended we went back inside and I guess he didn’t know I was behind him when I see him join the group of people taking shots and laughing and I saw him grab my wife’s ass. Now I’m shocked at this point so what I do is take a note of it but don’t mention anything and decide to wait for my wife to bring it up to see if she would tell me or keep it a secret. But before all that could happen after 2 minutes or so I see him do it again and wait for some time again which seemed like a million years. Now that time I think was enough for my wife to walk away and tell me but she didn’t. So after a while I tell my wife I need to talk to her and then confront her about it she doesn’t deny it at all she said it’s true so I had no choice but to pull his wife to the side and explain the situation. She’s instantly upset. We left shortly after because it was just so weird and uncomfortable. I’m so confused, I need some advice... what do I do? Should I go back and check him? I’m not the type to talk about things but this might be a we need to sit down and explain to me wtf happened. I think he got enough of physical violence from what I saw when I was leaving from his wife. As for my wife.. I honestly don’t know how to feel, should I be upset over her not telling me during the time I waited and seen how it went down ?

523,"Hi, this post is about something very personal. I would appreciate empathy and understanding rather than negative comments. Also, english is not my first language. 
So, I (22F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been dating since about 4 years. Everything is going well and we are considering moving together/having kids once I finish college. 

In the past months, my boyfriend talked to me about a condition he had when he was a kid. (I’m sorry for not knowing the name of the condition), but his legs were basically flipped backwards and his feet were pointing in the wrong direction (turn 180 degrees). Doctors were surprisingly able to fix his legs when he was a kid and now he walks normally and I could have never tell he had this. 

He also has high blood pressure in his family and very recurrent eye infections and stye which his dad also has. 

I’m studying to work in the medical field, I’m not here to judge people who have genetic conditions. However, I’ve been feeling less envious of having children with him knowing that all of the above are potentially genetic conditions. I’ve even been feeling disgust. 

I feel horrible for thinking this way. I have a good lifestyle, I’m healthy, I’m not superficial and I value people for who they are, not just the outside. Why do I feel like this about my own boyfriend? I honestly feel like I don’t want to have kids anymore and I had a nightmare where I was giving birth to a baby that has both legs flipped in all direction. I am NOT ready to talk about this with him because it will hurt him like HELL. I also feel bad about myself. 

Anyone have ever felt the same towards a partner?

533,"So last Monday I was driving to my boyfriends house and getting off the highway. I was trying to speed up and merge in front of this red SUV it looks like a Fiat or Chrysler. I guess I made him angry that I was trying to merge over and he came around the side of car, got in front of me, slammed on his brakes, but was just being a jerk driver. I decided to just let them go. As we passed each other I kind of gave him a weird glare because I was like what are you doing! Then we both get to the same stop sign and he turned right and I turn right. Very shortly down the road he makes a sharp right hand turn and I continue going straight to go to the dollar store. We end up meeting at a to a stop sign and it was super odd. When I got to the stop sign I noticed there was the same red Chrysler or red Fiat parked right there. I thought since they had arrived before me that I would let them go ahead. After waiting a minute or so the guy get out of the red SUV and started running at the passenger side of my car. I hit my gas so hard I did not know what to do. I ended up waiting in a neighborhood for about 40 minutes until I could find somebody to come and tell me that that car was no longer on the same road.  I tried to call the police but they couldn’t really do anything. They told me the most they could do was report a suspicious person at that little intersection and it could take up to four hours for the patrol car to arrive. I have been trying to let this girl even though it scared me a lot. I’m posting today because I stay over here at my boyfriends quite often and I was driving to the grocery store this morning and I saw a very similar looking car. I feel like paranoia kicks in and I assume they’re going to try to follow me or something. I have no idea what to do. My mind is telling me that obviously if this person got out of their car and was running full force at mine that they wanted to hurt me or confront me.

535,"It's a question as old as time: Where's the balance between my neighbor's (60sM) right to be nude in his own home and my (36F) right to have my blinds open without seeing him in the nude every night?

We live in a courtyard and our units are mirror opposites; we can see through to each other's kitchen, dining room, living room, and bathroom. He leaves every light on when he's home at night and doesn't shut the door to his bathroom when he's using it (so I've seen him defecate, shower, etc.). The entire wall of our living and dining rooms are windows, and because of how they're situated I can see him no matter which living space I'm in. It feels unreasonable that I should have to shut my blinds every time I move to a different room to avoid seeing him naked (which he is all the time, I've not once seen him clothed).

I have no desire to shame him; I'm not sure he's aware that I can fully see him, so I don't believe he's deliberately exposing himself. I do think it would be fair to ask for some small concession, like each of us angling our blinds to block the view. Where do you fall on this?",16Aug2020,1

538,"Hello! 

I’m a 20F and my parents were really upset and questioning to hear that I was going to be a bartender. Said I got a lowlife job, etc. I don’t know what to do. Should I lie about working? Or tell them I got a different job? 

They know I have served since I was 17 so I don’t understand the drastic difference. Any advice would be helpful. Also, it’s bartending at a bowling alley, not even an actual bar/ restaurant",16Aug2020,1
539,"Honestly have no idea where I should post this, I’ve scoured google for advice on this situation but can’t find anything super helpful. If this isn’t the right place to post this, please let me know. So— I bought a computer off a friend. They live with their grandparents and they have had a roach problem that they have been taking care of/ they haven’t seen any roaches in a while. My friend made me aware of this and even took apart the computer and put each individual piece in separate plastic bags for a couple days to see if there were any roaches lingering, and cleaned the case of the computer. They then brought everything back to my house and assembled it here. There seemed to be no roaches. Then, the next day, I found two climbing on top of the desk where i have the computer. I killed them immediately and sprayed roach repellent all over the room, and wrapped the computer up in a big trash bag. I haven’t seen any since then (2 days ago)... I need some advice on whether I should be worried or not? I don’t see any in the computer (I vacuumed it out and cleaned to the best of my ability, and just checked on it an hour ago) but could more be hiding REALLY well? I don’t want to cause an infestation... and i really want to use the computer but I’m scared to take it out of the bag and more will come scurrying out. I’m just sort of panicking at this point.",16Aug2020,1

541,"I tried asking this in another sub, but I didn't get any advice so here I am.

A few months ago I broke up with my girlfriend of a few years. I started dating her when I was still in school and a girlfriend would usually be a female friend that I just started to get closer with. At that point, girls would like me as a person enough to want to continue dating me, regardless of me having ED.

Now that I'm out of school and single, it seems like dating is mainly meeting people online, or maybe at bars, and just going straight to dating. Being older, I also know that sex is significantly more important in a relationship. Since I can't really follow through, I'm not sure how to go about meeting women. I don't want to advertise that I have ED to everyone, but I don't want to waste a woman's time if sex is a deal breaker.",16Aug2020,1
542,"For a long time I've been pretty clear with myself and my family that I'm not going to college. Obviously going to college is good for me, I'll get to know more people, get a good education, qualifications, have more and better job opportunities. But I barely got through highschool alive, went to 4 different schools trying to find ""the right fit"", had to retake a year, it was a miracle that I passed my A Levels. I shouldn't have passed, I got lucky cause of the COVID-19 situation. One of the reasons I didn't apply to any colleges was because I was so sure I was going to fail highschool (due to shitty mental health, laziness, and terrible work ethic (which I still have)) and wouldn't have the grades to get into college. Honestly if it wasn't to make my dad happy I would've dropped out of highschool a long time ago. But the fact that I did pass with grades way above my expectations (3Bs) has started delude me into thinking maybe I can get into and through college. I'm scared I'm forgetting just how much I struggled with my mental health, and in turn my workload throughout highschool since I left in March. I no clue what I would study in college. I like art and design but since taking graphics, photography, and textiles for my A Levels I've realized that taking things I like in school will make me despise the subject. Though there's also not much else I can do since I've been taking these arts subjects for the last 2 years. Now, my dad really REALLY wants me to go to college, it's part of the reason I'm even considering going to college. Imagining how happy and proud I would make him makes my heart feel full, but is that even a realistic thing for me to do? He's willing to pay for everything, which I know is a privilege not many people have, and I am extremely grateful that he's offered this opportunity to me. But I don't want to take it, I don't want to go to and stay in college constantly feeling like I'm just there because I owe it to him since he's paying for it. I don't want it because not having the money to pay for college myself is another reason for me to not go. I really want to be cut off financially from my dad because I'm tired of living life constantly feeling guilty about the choices I make (which I won't change, stubbornness runs in the family) and feeling like I owe him. I've felt so stuck to my family my whole life and I'm tired, everything I do for them, with them, is purely because I believe I owe it to them or are sad attempts at making them happy. Should I start putting myself first? Would that make me feel worse? My original plan after highschool was to move in with a friend in America late August (in which case I would be completely cut off financially from my dad) and find a job as a waitress or something and just take it day by day from there, but due to Corona I've had to postpone which has given me more time to (over)think. I don't have any goals or aspirations, don't know what I want or where I'm going in life. In the back of my mind I think I might want to be cut off from my family so I can feel less guilty if I decide to die. I feel like I would die if I went to college too, I'd just die guilty and waste my dad's money, which could be better spent on my brother instead. I also worry he might be able to blame himself for my actions. But how long will guilt stop me from dying? I should probaby see a therapist but, waiting times for ""stable cases"" are at a median of 62 weeks, and I don't want to use more of my dad's money than I need to anymore... I'm confused. You're probably confused too. Maybe this belongs on r/offmychest instead.",16Aug2020,1
544,"My mom recently got into the habit of listening to music, which I would be fine with, however, she doesn't really use headphones or earbuds. My parents are rather frugal and old-timey, so any attempts to try to get her to buy any type of headphones or earbuds have been met with the argument ""They're too expensive"" or ""They make you deaf."" I feel like this is unfair because whenever I play games or listen to music I always use headphones.

546,"Over the years I have been friends with people who have treated me badly, ranging from off-hand comments, to bullying, to being flat out abusive. I’ve always had depression I’m also waiting to be assessed for several other things. In short, I was one of those vulnerable kids that flew under the radar because I hid it well and grew up at the wrong time. I had somewhat of a breakdown and suddenly ended up in therapy for the last 5 years and I’m a different person now. I’m so much more confident and able to cope with my problems and it’s not perfect but honestly I feel actually happy sometimes and that’s enough for me. 

However, seeing one of the people who hurt me succeed is enough to send me spiralling back into dark thoughts. With the kinds of job I want to go into, it’s a very small, very connected world. Some of my old ‘friends’ are in that world. I’ve done my best to cut them out of my life but they all seem to be advancing and can appear out of nowhere at any time. One has recently appeared in something huge and now everyone even outside of this world is talking about it. It seems to have taken off massively. 

Objectively, they deserve it, they have worked hard to get where they are but I start to blame them for the fact they contributed to my suffering so much. I spiral and get so angry at them and how unfair it is that they get to walk away from the pain they caused me and succeed while I’ve had to struggle to even be functional and that it’s set me back so much.

I don’t want to be like this. I want to be gracious towards them in my mind, to be detached and accept what’s in front of me and move on. It feels impossible, though. 

I feel like a bad person because everyone says to feel happy when someone succeeds. I just can’t with them, though. I don’t want them to keep having this effect on me, even after all these years but the things they said to me in the past, it still sticks in my head and ruins my confidence. I want nothing to do with them, not to see or talk to them again. I want to get over this and move on. How do I deal with this?",16Aug2020,1

He yells at my mom constantly, threatens to leave her, and even drove my sister to depression (Luckily she is ok now). However when he’s not drunk he’s and incredibly caring, funny and intelligent guy. He is always nice to my mother and even bought me a Sega Dreamcast. He donates thousands to charity, and all around is a great guy. So that’s my dilemma. Whenever I talk to him while he’s drunk he wont remember the next day. However when he’s sober, I don't want to ruin the good day and stress him out so he drinks more. Advice?",16Aug2020,1
549,"I downloaded reddit specifically to get this off my chest. I have never told anyone in my life, not even my long-term boyfriend. I am 20 and female. I don't talk to my parents anymore due to a lot of mental and emotional abuse. My dad was very weird my whole childhood. I remember my fourth birthday very clearly, and I remember some things even before that but from that birthday to about age 7-8 I can't remember anything at all. I remember making my mom sleep in bed with me until I fell asleep, it couldn't be my dad it had to be my mom. My dad is an alcoholic and has been for my whole life. He has always done weird things and even as a child I never felt comfortable around him. From age 9 or so to age 18 when I finally got away from him , I'd wake up to him standing over me, watching me. I'd find him going through my stuff, taking money from me. Multiple times I'd catch him passed out in the bathroom or on the floor, with porn playing on his phone. I caught him standing over me a couple times, touching himself while I woke up. Every time I'd catch him doing this stuff, you could tell he knew he got caught and was guilty. From a young age I would masturbate (I didn't know what I was doing, I just knew it felt good) and would actively seek out porn on those pay per view channels where I would just read the descriptions and touch myself, I was doing all this at around age 8-10 which I think is too young to be doing that, let alone knowing what that is. There is a lot more to this story but do you think my dad maybe sexually abused me during this window of time that I don't remember? I will answer any questions. It's really affecting me. I can't have sex without crying and my boyfriend can't even touch my boobs without me having a panic attack. I recently had to go for a pap smear  which I have never had before and I had the worst panic attack ever when I got home and locked myself in a closet and cried for apparently 2 hours straight. I barely remember this. Please answer",16Aug2020,1
550,"I (21m) have BPD and mostly fall into the quiet subtype. I don’t really have any family or friends, I’ve never been in a relationship or even had sex, so obviously I’m pretty lonely, boo fkn hoo. I did have this friend who was the only person I’ve ever shared any of my issues with (but I didn’t share my diagnosis, even with her) and I ended up catching feelings for her but she didn’t feel the same way, can’t blame her either, I’m way too skinny, covered in scars and pretty mentally unstable. So that’s as close as I’ve come to anything relationship adjacent.

I’ve though about joining dating apps in the past but I’ve never done it because I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say about my mental issues. On the one hand, I hate talking about it, especially with strangers and I don’t want girls to think I’m unattractive or not masculine or that I’m oversharing and playing the victim or being needy because I have these issues and I talk about it. On the other hand, I’d feel like I was lying if I didn’t say anything and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time or end up hurting them because I wasn’t upfront about it. I also know that there’s a ton of stigma around BPD and I don’t want to seem like I’m intentionally trying to hide it from someone who might want to avoid people like me for their own reasons.

Maybe I’m too immature and am not ready to even be thinking about it yet, I don’t know. I have been working hard to independently better myself, I quit drinking and drugs in February, self-harm free since June, I went from eating almost nothing to eating 3 good healthy meals a day, working out every day and putting on a bit of muscle and all that good stuff, but I don’t know if it’s enough or if I’m just jumping the gun because I’m lonely. I’m still prone to severe bouts of depression and have heaps of internal anger some days but I don’t know if those will ever fully go away. 

I don’t want to rush into dating before I’m ready just because I’m lonely and feel like I’m so far behind everyone else, but I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life abstaining from it waiting for the day I’m ‘normal’ that realistically, probably won’t happen.

Any advice on dating with mental health issues would be super appreciated.",16Aug2020,1
551,"Alright so I work for a call center. Initially during the interview they told me that it was a call center. Then, on the first day of work they said they were switching to chats. 

So the first few weeks I do chats and then they play the switch up. Apparently they do that to every single training class, the bait and switch, so that was the first red flag that this company wasn’t right. 

I saw one of my coworkers get underpaid her first week on the floor, but I didn’t like her anyway. Second red flag. 

Anyway, I got a hot head and complained about the bait and switch so they moved me to another supervisor but low and behold, they are all in on this, so that didn’t make a difference. I was still taking calls. 

My fingerprint didn’t work on any of their scanners either and it wasn’t until I broke one of their machines that they gave me an alternate way to enter the building. This was after I had gone off on my supervisor and his 2 managers and then was forced to give an apology to his manager. Now I sound like an ass but the fingerprint system didn’t work for me. I complained about it regularly, developed some semi-ok workarounds, etc. 

So some time passes and I get promoted and then get promoted again because I get a lot of positive surveys from customers. That’s great. 

Fast forward a few months and I’m working from home. We all are.

Anyway, they start coming out with one stupid policy after another. You must take a picture of yourself 4 times a day. You must not use sticky notes on your computer. And then they added 80 ways to get everyone fired. There were 2 places to sign off on it but I only signed off on it in one place. 

Ok so rewind a little bit. The job description was never clear but I was one of the people in making the job description more expansive, behind the scenes, but other people seem to have taken my idea and run with it. 

There was one manager who didn’t like me because I wound up calling her a bitch, lazy, etc etc. I developed some training materials for everyone except her team. I had her team blocked out and obviously the saltiness just grew and grew with her so one day I get the news that I’m getting in trouble for putting the customer on a ten minute hold for a call that we didn’t even handle originally when we got the job.

And I like one of the main people who expanded our job description anyway and the bill was too complicated for anyone to figure out period. 

Anyway it’s 5 strikes and you’re out so with this they were trying to give me 4 strikes which is in line with the 80 ways to get you fired but it’s nonsense. I was legit not rude or anything, just a mofo hold. 

So somehow my manager supposedly got it lowered to 3 strikes but I didn’t think that was good enough because there’s too many ways to do a near perfect job and get fired plus I never fully signed off on the rules!

So I call and message a couple people from the top of the company who are pretty rude and unresponsive. And I supposedly got in trouble for that. Well the 2 things put together should mean I’m out of a job but they are supposedly deliberating. I just told them exactly how I felt about everything. 

Anyway, I said my goodbyes cuz I thought I was leaving but I’m not gone yet. This one girl who I trained got a job and she got me the same job in one hour which kinda had me shook. So basically, I was thinking of just trying to work for this bullshit company 4 hours a day on training time where I help people out without taking calls. Would that be a bad idea? It’s what I did before with my first 4 hours of the day anyway.",16Aug2020,1

553,"A few days ago, I had a memory resurface from my childhood that I had completely forgot about for over 20 years (I guess I suppressed it?). It was the memory of my cousin coming forward saying that my dad raped her and my family not believing her. I thought about this and wondered if I was remembering things correctly. I wasn’t sure how to move forward with this information but as a mother, I needed to know for sure in order to keep my child safe. Long story short, I ended up reaching out to my cousin and she confirmed that it did in fact happen. And that it happened repeatedly over a long period of time. She couldn’t remember exactly how old she was but thinks she was either in elementary school or the beginning of middle school. She confirmed that no one believed her and that she was taken to the hospital, only to be told that a rape kit couldn’t be performed and that was the end of it. She told me that she has tried to move on with her life and that being around my dad makes her very uneasy to this day (rightfully so). I contacted my father who didn’t answer my texts or calls. I contacted my mother, who according to my cousin (whom I believe), continues to deny that this ever happened and continues to call my cousin a liar. My mother basically said she didn’t know what happened and that I should talk to my dad. She unfortunately contacted my dad as well and gave him a “heads up” as to the reason I was trying to contact him. My dad texted me this morning and said “The answer to your question is no.” Implying that I was trying to call him to ask him if he did rape my cousin. I don’t need to ask him. I believe my cousin. I do, however, want him to explain his side. Do I even need his side? My dad has always been a good father to me (or so I thought). He was a horrible husband to my mother (physically and mentally abusive). But he never hit me or anything like that. I’m really really struggling with this. Obviously my instinct tells me to cut ties with him and that’s the end of it. I don’t think he will ever admit what he did. I just don’t know what to do.",16Aug2020,1

555,"Hi everyone,

I would like to start by saying that I am very much a creature of habit. Once I get used to a routine or anything really, it is very hard for me to give it up.
Right now there are some big changes happening and I just don't know how to stop feeling sad about all of it.
The first thing is that a guy I have been friends with benefits with is leaving his work place. Right now he is a bartender at a place I am a regular at, have been for well over a year now and he has been there for the most of it. Recently another guy quit his job there and I was very upset about him leaving before he left but don't think much about him anymore so I don't understand why I am being so dramatic about this other guy leaving tommorow. Yes I mean I am involved with him but he has someone else (I know I am terrible because he is cheating on her with me) however he is going to have a much better job and is getting married and he has a child on the way and I am very happy about all of it but I guess waiting for him to leave is giving me a lot of anxiety because it is a big change. 
The second thing is that my boss and I got into an argument nearly 3 weeks ago and he has been mad at me ever since, this past week I have been on vacation so I don't know what I am coming back to and it just feels different going back tommorow and I hate that feeling. I love that job and the people around me so I don't want to have issues with my boss because it just ruins everything (obviously).
I know these might not seem like big changes but to me they really are. The guy from the bar is someone I have been talking to almost every single day for the last year and I really don't have a lot of friends or actually almost any at all outside of that bar so I kind of got attached to him. Sure there is one bartender there left and I love that guy but it is still sad that the other one is leaving. 
Does anyone on here have any ideas how to deal with this kind of stuff? How do I stop feeling miserable? Tje feeling really sucks and no matter how much I try to explain the situation in a good way to myself, I just can't stop that sad feeling.",16Aug2020,1
556,"I’m a dumb, stupid, immature 18 year old who’s stuck, lost, and confused as to why I’m doing the things I did. For context this is all long distance.

I’ve been cheating on my girlfriend of 3 months. I made another post about a month back about me splitting with my girlfriend who I was in a toxic relationship with to get with somebody else. The majority of the comments told me to break things off with A, because A had issues and A wasn’t mature enough for a relationship. I went with B and we decided to take things slow. I really fucked up when I kept talking to A. I couldn’t shake my feelings and genuinely thought me and A would work out again and we started dating again. Now, the thing is, me and B weren’t “officially” dating and in public me and A are together. A has met all of my friends and is in my friend group while B hasn’t yet. 

Right now, things with me and A are going good. But, I feel as if some of our problems haven’t been solved. They still get upset easily and their depression makes it hard for me to talk to them without easily upsetting them. But, I still genuinely love them and it’s so painful to think of breaking things with them. They’re my first love. 

B on the other hand is great. We get along well and communicate frequently and work through and issues that come up. But at the same time, I don’t feel as close to B as A. A has met my friends and my friends like A. 

It all really came crashing down when B told me they found my Twitter. I, in my stupidity, agree when she asks if we want to be official. Because B has my Twitter now, I’m deathly afraid of them saying something. My friends follow me there and know that I’m dating A. I can’t post anything about A because B will find out and I can’t post anything about B (she asks me to talk about her) without my friends questioning A.

I know I shouldn’t have kept talking to A. It’s A’s birthday in a few days and I made an extremely thoughtful gift to them. However, I’m afraid of breaking either of their hearts. They’ve done absolutely nothing to receive this treatment from me. Neither of them deserve to be betrayed and I just want this to stop. I don’t know what I want.

Im a late bloomer so to speak and was never interested in a sexual relationship up until now

Im still a virgin and im frustrated at myself...

I am the typical dude that most guys are envy off when it comes to the sexual market, and what most girls would think of the dream guy, I fit in the cateogory of being tall 196cm (6'4 for Americans) Have a succesfull job, My work colleagues all love me and we all have all wake up every morning with a smile on are faces going to work, I have a rolex on my wrist, genuine nice guy that is really loyal and have a close social circle of friends that Im proud to be with...

I get a lot of compliments from both sexes on a daily/weekly basis stating how handsome I am and how im ''winning in life''

As stated I suffer from Aspergers so on the outside it may look like a dream relationship come true for most females but when push comes to shove I somehow get near crossing the line of being in a relationship but something which im not aware of pushes them away where they suddenly lose interest and either die out and we dont talk anymore or they decide to put me on the sideline for some other dude...

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the confusing part, The whole Alpha/Beta male Shit, during Quarantine I was and still looking for anwsers as to why and what im doing wrong, most guys can relate to the whole ''red/blue pill'' which is basically code word for alpha and beta males and their behaviours, Been watching channels on youtube such as ''AMS'' ''StephIsCold'' ''MJ\_GetRight'' and numerous others, they all share the same theme which is basically to not let woman control you...

You name it, those men are the type of men that supposdely guide lost ''beta'' men such as myself in getting anwser towards their non existant and sexual frustrated lives, stating how men should have a purpose and grind, and not get into relationships in their 20s and focus on getting the bread, and girls will follow after, which imho I agree with half of what they say and disagree on the other half...

&amp;#x200B;

They also go in depth about female nature which also makes sense, a lot of bitches in this day and age all act like they dont cheat, words say one thing and their actions prove the opposite, which I have encountered IRL with my guy friends, Things like giving a woman to much attention back fires to the point that they get annoyed and seek another guy behind your back... (Being a beta simp)

A lot of woman who I thought where actually angels back in university turned out to be un-loyal little whores behind their boyfriends back, for example this chick that I was cool with during my stupides that had a current bf, I was platonic friends with her, we chatted on a regular, not every day, but a few times a week during class studies, just recently I found out that she cheated behind her BFs back in a 2 year relationship with a threesome with a  guy friend of mine and his friend.. Never in a million years would I thought that she would do that, yet here we are...

This already has turned me TREMENDOUSLY nervous and really put doubt and broke my heart about the dating life, all these females in their 20s/30s are still playing these games just like in highschool when we thought that shit was over with, no no no, the game has just evolved, once again its the woman that state that shit doesnt happen outside of teengae years, yet here we are, I feel betrayed about reality and just honestly upset that I will never get a genuine partner without worrying every day about weather shes doing sneaky shit behind my back you know?

&amp;#x200B;

And before you say it, yes, yes I know that: ''NoT alL fEmaLes aRe LiKe tHaT'' but when I encounter so many storys from my guy friends, I tend to think, the majority really are, and thats the truth...

And honestly most of the girls that dont cheat are sorry to say, but they are the 5/10 6/10s that know they cant do better so would rather stay loyal and stay with their current bfs..

&amp;#x200B;

Im honeslty lost

the rundown is this:

Obviously I think all this redpill channel has given me a reality check BUT also a toxic way of thinking about females and their games to the point where I do want a genuine relationship but I really dont know where to go from there onwards, I feel betrayed being brought up espicially from woman saying one thing and empahsing on it, yet their actions prove the opposite...

These channels also honestly promote ''pump and dump'' they dont whole-heartedly admit that, but it is what it is when they say that men grinding in their 20s should have a ''rotation'' of chicks to bang without being in a relationship...

Its like im actually forced to date asian woman as their loyality is un-constested with Western/American woman...",16Aug2020,1
567,I guess you could say I was somewhat of a bully/edge lord as a kid. Recently I’ve started having a lot of guilt/stress over many things I’ve said. I’m trying to deal with it and move on with my life. Any advice?,16Aug2020,1
568,"I will travel from my university city to my parents home soon. Currently i am trying to decide how i will do that. Hygienical- optimally, i would have a car for me alone, but i dont. I also cant find anybody who drives the exact same route, so here are my options: 
1) travel by train. 4 to 6 different trains and ~6 hours travel time
2) Travel by train and carsharing. 2 different trains (to meeting point, then car, then from dropoff point to home), ~2 h train time and 3 hours car time. Either i have trains at beginning and end of the route or i start with car, then do the trains. Its multiple trains either way.

Now on the train everybody wears a mask. In the car, only i would (probably) wear a mask. I cant really keep 2m distance in either of the transportations. Is it safer to take part of the route in the car, cause it limits the amount of people i am with, or should i rather stick with all train?    
Or does it not matter at all?",16Aug2020,1
569,"Throwaways account  just because my gf follows my other account. 

To be blunt - I am not lazy- I have a second job delivering groceries and a first job that I love also in a warehouse . I love doing both of my jobs but I have an extremely hard time going to work or staying at work. 
If I’m at my first job I’ll leave early just to go to my second . I make more at my first job and I also get points against me for leaving early but I get this horrible impulse to leave and I HAVE TO LEAVE . 
It’s not me being lazy because most of the time when I leave my first job I’ll head over to my second job and work there for a few hours . 

Some days I just wake up and call out- I have no reason at all to do this but then I’ll go to my second job and make money. 
I don’t know why- I enjoy both jobs equally so I don’t understand why I do this. 
Is there something wrong with me . I’ve lost jobs in the past because I can never just not leave. It’s ruining my life to be honest and I’m struggling to stop doing this . It’s like an addiction.

570,"On multiple accounts my husband would pester, guilt, pressure, and occasionally force sexual intercourse on me. Particularly during and after when I was pregnant with our daughter. I was 6 months pregnant when we got married and the first night of our honeymoon he guilted me into having sex to ""consummate the marriage"". I kept saying no, that I was exhausted after a long day, that it hurt because I had vaginal dryness from being pregnant, all of which was true. Not to mention I had not been in love with or even attracted to him for the 2 years. He got actually mad. He said that if we didn't that our we wouldn't actually be married. When I shrugged that off as old timey bs he just started pulling my clothes off. When I said stop he threatened to rip my shirt off. Eventually I gave in. 10 minutes in it was painful and I asked if we could stop. He again got mad and guilted me saying he wasn't my husband then and he would just go home. Again, I didn't react to this the way he wanted so he grabbed me and forced me to continue until he came. He fell asleep and I stayed up crying for half an hour. That was two years ago. Every time the date of our anniversary comes around I get panick attacks and have nightmares.

That was one of many scenarios. There have been times where he literally ripped my shirt in half when I would say no. He's a big guy(6""7, 200lbs) who works out so he often used that to intimidate me. There were times when I literally was crying and he wouldn't stop. I brought it up to him once that he has forced me multiple times and he started yelling at me and calling me a liar and an attention whore.

There's probably nothing I can do about it because it's been so long and we were married. I finally left him a year ago. Of course, I still have to deal with him because we have shared custody of our daughter. He wants to be a teacher and join the military. If he has sexual assault charges on him it would ruin his life. I'm scared that in turn he would try to hurt me or my daughter.",16Aug2020,1
571,"I (20m) recently told my dad the reason why I have been very distant with him for the past years and it’s safe to say I’m scared shitless. When I was 14, I had sex with my at the time 9 year old sister and yes I know I’m a disgusting pig for doing that, I’ve told myself that everyday since. I have no idea why I did it or what was going through my head but it happend. Ever since then out of pure disgust, shame and guilt for what I’ve done I distanced myself from my dads side of the family and especially my dad. I’d say it fractured my relationship with my dad because of the years I’ve refused to tell my dad why I’ve been so distant. Until recently where the guilt and shame overcame me and I opened up to my therapist about it, which then gave me the courage to tell my dad the exact reason why I’ve been so distant. Safe to say he did not have a positive reaction and he has no idea what to say to me or how to deal with it. It’s the exact kind of reaction I expected, I’m just scared shitless that if he ends up telling the rest of my family what I did all those years ago that I could be kicked out of the family or ostracised. I hate myself so much for what I did and the potential pain and trauma I could have inflicted on my little sister. I can barely look my dad, step mum and or little sister in the eye anymore because of the guilt and shame I’ve had since. As far as I know, my little sister has never said anything of the matter so me telling my dad has potentially opened a serious can of worms and I’m extremely scared of the consequences even though I probably deserve them.

573,"I’m 25, recently jobless. I got lucky just kind of falling into a career I enjoyed by chance. I took a shot at getting a certification that was recommended to me when I was lamenting my old job and it got me into a pretty decent position. I was making a little over $22 hourly and enjoyed my work for the most part. I quit not long ago due to a bad bout of depression from some personal issues that made me incredibly anxious about going into work, I tried to get unpaid leave but was denied and felt forced to. I regret it now that I’m back living with my parents and can’t even get a call for an interview. My field is in a really bad downturn so jobs my certification is relevant for have much higher competition than usual &amp; outside of it my cert and experience aren’t very meaningful. For jobs both in my industry and outside I have been turned down multiple times now because I don’t have a bachelors degree. I dropped out of school in the 8th grade. I did get my GED a few years later at 16 and attended 2 semesters of community college but I stopped going when I couldn’t decide what I wanted to go for. I just worked for the next few years in food service, secretarial work, bar tending, etc. until I found my way into the field I was in at 22. I feel like to even have my resume be looked at I need to get a bachelors even though I was better at my job than the majority of my coworkers with one. It’s not a job with an easy connection to a major either so it would be in something totally irrelevant. 

I haven’t attended a college class in 8 years and I never took a science or math course when I did so I don’t have any formal education in those subjects beyond the 8th grade level. I’m not a stupid person and I know I’m capable of attaining a degree but I would have so much to learn to even get started and it would take me so long while working full time to support myself. I realize I was dumb to quit my job in retrospect but it is so frustrating that I seemingly can’t get another doing the thing I was already successful at without getting a piece of paper that is not directly relevant to my work. 

Should I just suck it up and have a miserable next 5-6 years trying to power through getting a degree or am I just getting too impatient and down on myself for a couple rejections in the middle of an economic downturn? I know I should eventually get a degree either way, I just mean should I make it my whole life’s goal right now to get it done or is it more of a secondary issue?",16Aug2020,1

576,"I'm 16, my mom is 49, and my dad is 62. My dad is probably the world's ugliest person. He has bulgy eyes and puffy hair. He has stray whiskers growing everywhere on his face, a fat face, a big nose, tiny lips, large breasts, a huge potbelly, gross armpit hair, and he also has stinky feet. It's so gross when he props his feet up on the table because I hate smelling his gross feet.

He is really rude as well. Every time he squats down, he accidentally squeezes out an enormous fart. It smells terrible, and it's disgusting to hear it as well. Then when we go to church, he props his feet up on the seat in front of him, and he just sticks his hand down his pants and farts non-stop. At home, he has anger issues. Every time my mom cooks something like a casserole or bacon, my dad eats literally all of it. He eats with his hands, and slurps milk straight out of the carton. He doesn't flush after using the bathroom, and he always releases massive farts when he's in the bathroom. He discusses politics with literally everyone at church, he stalks people on VSCO and Instagram, and he inappropriately comments on people's Facebook posts. He cleans the furniture by squeezing hand soap on and then scrubbing it with toilet paper, and he leaves his dirty clothes on the shower floor. He dips sushi in marinara sauce, and he puts ketchup on Jello. He needs to stop being so gross and vulgar; I am 100% fed up with his antics that gross me out.

The worst part is that my dad is severely lactose intolerant. He drinks too much milk and eats too much cheese and ice cream, and it causes smelly farts. People call him stuff like skunk, and I think it serves him right. He also farts really loud fart at night. I can hear them across the house, and my mom doesn't even sleep in the same room as my dad anymore. Every time we get something like a pizza or Asian takeout, my dad literally sits on the food to ""warm his butt"", especially in the winter, and he just toots non-stop on the food and I don't even wanna eat the food because of this.

577,"Hello!  


I'm seeking some advice regarding my situation (Worked at a job for two years, quit on bad terms, now after a year and a half I have a sit down with my former boss who I had a lot of issues with. I'm shocked he even considered sitting down with me.)  


However, I am close with a lot of current employees including my Service Manager. We have a great bond and work well together. Most of the current employees I am on good terms but but there is some who still have some negative feelings about how I quit.  


There's a manger position open in the area I worked full-time and I was originally next in line, now due to the pandemic there is no longer a manager as they both quit abruptly.   


I have no idea how to go about this other than being aware that I am an entirely different person after a lot of what I have been through since working there. I just don't want to mess it up as I have always said to myself I wish things were different.  


Does anyone have any advice about going forward and how to treat employees specifically who feel negatively towards me? Or advice regarding my sit-down tomorrow or just any in general.

579,"I’m writing this on my phone so I apologize for any weird formatting. 

To make a really long story short, I and seven other girls I know were victims of a sex crime, and the person who did it was someone all of us had known for years, let’s call him Mike. We had done theater together and he was extremely nice, but then he hired someone to hack into our snapchats, steal nudes (many from when we were still underaged), and posted them on a porn website. Mike said he would send people more if they described how they would use and degrade us. Over 2,000 people saw my naked body. He was also giving out my, and many other girls’, private info and people were contacting me through my email and instagram asking for more and showing me conversations with him. And believe me when I say this was just the tip of the extremely fucked up iceberg that was this porn website. 

This happened about 5 months ago, and I got authorities involved immediately. The case was first investigated by the FBI, they confirmed it was Mike (because at first we had no clue who it was) They found out who the hacker was, brought Mike in for an interview, and confiscated devices to collect evidence. The first month everything was fine, and I was hopeful that he would actually face consequences. But then everything just stopped progressing, Mike got his devices back, he got a job at a nice restaurant, he was about to go to college. The case got passed to the state level around a month ago, and around a week ago we found out it was in family court, and the agent working our case told us the worst thing that could happen is this goes on his juvenile record (he was two months away from turning 18 when the crime was committed, which is why no one wanted the case) 
I, and the other girls were frustrated that the legal system had seemingly failed us. So we took matters into our own hands. 


Before I continue I would like to point out that both the school that he would soon be attending, and the place he worked were both aware of his actions. The school had been contacted by the agent working our case and they basically said campus police will be made aware, and if anything happens they will know. In my opinion this is bullshit, considering the fact that sexual assault is already rampant on college campuses. In addition to this, Mike never apologized to any of us, those who have spoken to him tell me that he had shown little remorse for what he did and victimized himself throughout the conversation. He claims he could’ve gotten away with it if not for corona, and when asked if he would ever do anything like this again he said “no, look where it’s gotten me.” Which is weird because he really hasn’t suffered any consequences. That alone gives you an idea of how he feels about what he did. 


So I and the other victims made an instagram page where each of us told our stories. It showed his face and his name. Within 24 hours the page had 1,300 followers and there was a petition to revoke his acceptance to his college that had around 2,500 signatures. Because of the public outcry, he lost his job and the college will most likely revoke his acceptance because many people contacted them voicing their concerns. The page quickly got taken down by instagram, probably due to Mike reporting it repeatedly. 

You’re probably wondering where my best friend comes in. Well she was right beside me for all of this, she encouraged me to make the account, and thought it was really fucked up he didn’t suffer consequences. She can relate because she’s also been the victim of a sex crime, and her abuser didn’t suffer consequences either. But then the next day after the account was made, she posted something on her story while that said she was sorry for reposting images of the account and that we should all rethink what we were doing because he was human. 

This is where I don’t know if i’m overreacting or not, but I was very upset. It felt like a betrayal, especially because she never told me she was posting that. I texted her to understand what she meant, and she basically said that he deserves to face consequences, but not like this, and that we were treating him inhumanely and have no right to determine his fate. She called it cyberbullying (which i think is laughable)

I pointed out that he was never going to suffer real consequences, and that the account was only up for 24 hours but got more accomplished than law enforcement did in 5 months. (i understand that cases take a VERY long time, if the case hadn’t been passed to family court the account would’ve never been made. I would’ve waited years longer if it meant he was actually put in jail) 
She basically said she wasn’t going to apologize because she wasn’t going to go against her morals and ethics. She said she was allowed to have her own opinion about it, but in my eyes this is a lot more than just an opinion, this isn’t agreeing to disagree about politics or some bullshit like that, this is real shit that impacted me. 

We later had a conversation over facetime because she’s quarantining right now, and I really want to fix this considering she’s my best friend, but that conversation just made me more frustrated with her. I asked her specifically what morals and ethics it went against and she couldn’t tell me, she just said it made her feel bad and that she posted what she posted to clear her conscious. I asked her how else he was supposed to face consequences, and she also couldn’t answer that, other than saying i should’ve made my own organization for people who’s abusers are under the age of 18, which in my opinion isn’t really a viable option. I told her that the account didn’t make me feel good either, and that it brought back a lot of terrible memories and anxiety, but it got a lot accomplished and was for the greater good. I explained why it hurt me so much that she posted it, and that I thought she showed zero empathy for me in that moment and was only thinking about how she felt and not how her actions would impact the people who saw it. But she still stands by her word and said she’s not going to apologize for posting something she believes in. 


So I told her that if she doesn’t apologize I would have to think long and hard about our friendship, and it would take me a long time to forgive her. She seems to think i’m being totally unreasonable, but I think I have the right to be upset about what she did. I think that she should’ve at least talked to me before posting it, and that it was selfish of her to only think about how she felt and not how i would feel seeing it. It also seems like she would rather see him face no consequences, which is really just a slap in the face. I’m not asking her to apologize for how she feels, just for her actions. 

I think maybe I showed a lack of emotional maturity when I gave her an ultimatum, but that she shows a greater one by not being able to set her emotions aside when they’re unreasonable , or when acting on them could potentially hurt others. 

I’m sorry this is so long, but I think context is needed. Am i the antagonist?",16Aug2020,1

We both study at the same college and live at home right now (even without covid, we still stayed with our respective parents since it was convenient).

A week ago, my parents found a pregnancy test I had taken because my period was late and I just wanted to make sure that nothing was there.  Having a baby would completely alter my life and my bf's, as we both have high aspirations for ourselves.  It was negative thank goodness, but it cleared by the time my parents had found it.  I told them the situation, but they completely freaked out on me, saying how could I be so stupid to have sex unprotected (not true and I told them as such: shit happens).  My dad then told my bf's parents and brought them into it.  They were understanding of my reasoning and tried to tell my dad that it was responsible of us to check (bf did know about me taking the test).  My bf then tried to talk to my dad and remedy the situation, but to no avail.  Unfortunately, bf did not word his responses in the best manner, saying that I may have been late due to stress, but then my dad asked how could I be stressed about since we're not in school.  He then assumed that my bf meant abuse or something along those lines, which is not the case, and my bf knows that.  

So now, my parents both despise my bf and are ""recommending"" that I do not talk to him.  They say stuff like he's a textbook narcissist and has been manipulating me.  My mom has even referred to him as my ex, when we have not broken up.  My bf and I have a great relationship.  Of course, there are things that we can both work on, but I don't see this event as being what causes us to break up, and neither does he.  I love him very much, but I also love my parents, and I don't want them to think that I'm going against them and choosing to be in a manipulative relationship.  Both sides have fucked up, but while my bf is willing to amend things, my parents are adamant that he has no part in our lives anymore.  I have tried to explain to them that he is not a bad guy, but they just don't hear it.  My bf has reached out to my dad apologizing and wanting to talk more, but my dad left him on read for a few days until responding ""how about never.""

584,"I live in a downtown apartment on the highest floor with only one other room next door. Nobody else ever has a reason to come up here unless we invite them over. 

A couple weeks ago, our neighbors got into a fight, screaming at each other in the hallway, and one of them punched a hole in the wall right across from my room. Later that day, I heard them say that they should probably fix it and never have. It sounds like they made up fast, so I'm almost worried about what would happen if something more serious happened between them because I'm pretty sure one of them has guns. 

Earlier today, it sounded like they had someone over that asked about the hole in the wall (I could have misheard, but I can't think of anything else it would be about), to which my neighbor replied ""I don't know. We were gone for a week and suddenly that was there."" So I'm worried that they'd blame it on us. Problem is, the girl that lives there seems nice and if I tell the landlord, I don't want her to get kicked out in case it's the only option she has. It's only the guy that lives there that I really have issues with. 

Our landlord is pretty neglectful of the building condition, however. When it rains, much of it comes down into the building outside of our room. If it is pouring outside, it is pouring in the hallway. They don't listen to our concerns with the condition of the place, but I would assume a tenant causing damages and doing nothing about it would be something they'd want to take action over.

585,"Hi, so I’m 20 starting my third year of college later this month. I’m thinking about changing my major.

I’ve kinda been struggling with this a lot. Ever since high school I had my eyes dead set on computer engineering as a degree. So, I worked towards that and never really considered any other major, which ended up being my downfall when I got into college. 

In my first year of college, things went very well. Mostly because I was only taking intro classes and general requirement classes. Once I went into my second year, everything was turned upside down. I struggled in my classes and stopped being as interested in engineering as I was. To be honest, I’m not really sure if I was as interested as I thought I was in the beginning.

The thing is, I really love art, writing and character design. I always wanted to make things like comics, stories, maybe even a cartoon show someday. I’ve been writing ever since I was in middle school and drawing since high school. I have an art minor and I’ve been on the road to building up a portfolio.

I ended up realizing what I really wanted to do and what I really enjoyed. But I still went with CE.
Mainly because I always knew the more creative stuff I was interested in can also be a struggle, financially. I wanted a degree that was a safety net of some sort. Something that was lucrative and flexible career-wise that I could fall back on if I was ever in financial trouble. 

Since my Sophomore year, I’ve been absolutely drained and stressed. I’m never excited for any of the classes I take nor do I want to take them. I thought about changing my major to computer science because of the slightly less math I would have to take and the fact that I did good in my Java and C# classes. It also seems like a very safe major to have. But now I’m not sure. I’m not sure if I even want to be in STEM at all.

This is where I struggle. I still want a safety net. A degree that would offer a broad variety of jobs and is lucrative. So, I was considering a business degree, though I’m not sure in what specifically. I thought about going the business route during my second year, but was too scared to change. I worked in business before and enjoyed it. I’m actually helping start up a business of a family member right now. I can see myself enjoying it and having it as a degree as I pursue my interests, that is until I can comfortably make money from my creative passions.

587,"I am a 23 years old accountant from the Philippines. I earn $500 a month, good enough to support my family but not enough to live the decent life that I want. I am lucky and grateful to keep my job during this difficult time, but it has also been so stressful and I’ve already burnt out working for just a year now. I also don’t learn much from it, hence the unsatisfaction and everyday resentment in this job.

Also, it’s been quite stressful at home and in Ph recently so I want to start new in a different country (that pays enough to live decently). I don’t mind starting from scratch (being an apprentice or getting back in school) cause tbh, I feel like I didn’t learn much skills in 2.5 years of working. I’m good as long as I learn from my job, salary is enough for me to live decently (have a few savings and extra $160 monthly to send my family) and will not take toll on my mental health. 

I currently have $5,000 savings. Is there a way for me to start a peaceful and decent  life somewhere? Any tips if I can get a job/ scholarship/apprenticeship of any kind? I’ve been sending my resume in Canada and Europe jobs but there are no responses yet.

Oh god, where do I even start with this mess?
I (F19) am in this kind of fwb situation with a guy (M24), we’ve known each other for 2 years now, used to talk a lot, then stopped cause we fought or something (honestly i forgot why), in the mean (in those 2 years when we didn’t talk) he got himself a girlfriend and i completely forgot about him. This summer i decided to reach out to him because i was bored and wanted some company (we have vacation houses in the same small village, where you can’t really do anything fun). We never established what we wanted to get from this hanging out thing, cause (i can only speak for myself) at the beginning i never felt like it was necessary since we were just friends or not even that.

Now we are back home (we live in the same town), hanging out like 4 times a week and having lots of fun(not sex but more of a foreplay). He said he doesn’t want a relationship because he still has to get over a situation that happend with his ex girlfriend (the only thing i know is that they broke up around 4-5 months ago and it must’ve been something traumatic since he expressed multiple times that love is a bitch and he doesn’t want to get hurt again). I’ve never been in a relationship before and to be completely honest i still don’t know if i want to be with this guy but i am still curious as to what he feels.
Before all the hanging out and being intimate happend, he said that he does not have feelings towards me but drives me home every single time we hang out, watches stupid rom-coms with me, cuddles, gives me small kisses, keeps on reaching out as to when should we hang out next time, in bed always makes sure that i am pleased first etc. so i am split. Does he “not want a relationship” ‘cause he really does need time to recover or is that sugar coating the fact that he doesn’t like me like that?",16Aug2020,1
589,"It’s been like that for as long as I can remember. One to two times a year, he gets an aggressive episode. When I was little (4-15 years old) he would hit me, kick me or push me when he got like that. Since I’m 16, it’s more a kind of psychological and verbal aggression. 

He got another episode like that today. I just graduated law school and was saving up to move out at the end of this year. I’m pretty used to this in general, but it’s not good for my mental health.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this a disease? Today he got aggressive because he asked me to watch a video about some educational topic. When I asked him “what’s it about” he totally flipped, saying that I am nothing and useless and don’t want to do anything for him while he does everything to me and bla bla bla.

He messaged me again last Sunday saying “David’s birthday is a week from today and we need to calculate how much food to buy.

I’m 18F and white (family is from a whole bunch of places, but still mostly European). My brother is 17, and I’m worried about him. This past year, he’s started saying racist stuff like “the police in the video never SAID anything racist against George Floyd” and “what about black on black violence”. He’s also turning kinda sexist, saying stuff like “why should a guy have to show that he’s not following a girl, it’s not his fault she’s scared” and “why do they always believe the claims of supposed sexual assault victims?”.
Basically, it’s not good. My brother is angry, I know this, he’s been getting angrier since my parents divorced (3years ago) but now he’s really becoming a douche. I know he’s not a bad person, and I love him even with all of this, but I’m also 18 and have no life experience and I don’t know how to talk to him in a way that’ll make him understand that the stuff he says lacks compassion. 
Can someone give me some advice on how to talk to him? I know I can’t change people, that’s not how it works, but I want to try anyways. I don’t want to have to cut him out of my life, but the stuff he says makes me feel like I’m a bad big sister for not looking out for him more.

Since quarantine ot has become much worse, he has started to attack his father (also a vegan) for abusing him.

I slowly realised that his behaviour was becoming more and more unstable and extreme. He recently broke his father's bike and sent me messages calling my wife a fat bitch who supports throwing animals into gas chambers. Kept calling him that and I was honestly so tempted to go to his house to punch him in the face for saying that but what would that achieve?

610,"I have mental health issues, had a long depressive episode which ended in a hospitalization. I really hurt her in the last years just in the shitty ways I was acting and treating her. No abuse, just neglectful and disrespectful and the worst person. But that’s not me and we both know that. I got tons of help, found a med finally that works, feeling better and on track to be who I truly want to be. 

Anyway, she needed a break, understandably. When I got out of the hospital she told me she was being with someone else. That we can obviously work out our issues and get back together when she is ready, but she needs to heal and have some space. I understand all of that. But I’m a deeply emotional person, and demisexual, so I don’t understand, and even have trouble believing, in sex without love. So I’m devastated. If I didn’t get so much help, I think I would have completely lost it when I found out or at least by now. But it’s fucking killing me. We are making progress and we are very optimistic we will be better soon. But words cannot begin to describe how hard it is knowing she is with someone else. I recognize my deep fears/ emotions: she will leave me for him, she doesn’t love or care about me, I’m not good enough, I’ll never be enough, everyone else is better than me, I’ll never be able to get over this. I have also identified tons of things to think about to help: if I’ve gotten this far I can get through it, this is a common thing people get through, sacrifice some pain now for your long term aspirations, I can 100% put myself in her shoes and understand exactly why she is doing this, this is something I cannot control so there is no use stressing over it. 

But none of that helps. I do have a semi-traumatic experience with being cheated on in the past, though (besides at first, trouble understanding what was happening) I don’t see this as cheating. Maybe the cheating in the past relationship hurt more and was worse to deal with. Probably was. But that’s an issue I have, not properly comparing a level of emotion I have to how it was in the past. But it feels like the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I don’t know what to do.

611,"So I (M42) work in a large office and in one of the other sections is another co-worker (F23) who will often drop by for a chat. She is married and has a couple of young kids. Her husband works in the same field and at the same level as me. So my co-worker, lets call her Jane, comes up to me and says “Can I ask you a personal question?” I’m fairly open so I’m like sure go ahead and she asks what it was like for me when I was married and my first child came along (I have been divorced for 13years now). So I gave the run down on how it was a big life change but myself and my partner weren’t well suited and kind of rushed into things. But if I had any regrets it was that I didn’t get us to see a therapist/psychologist before it was too late. She listened and then divulged that her and her husband were having troubles that she doesn’t feel they are connecting like they used to and like he is distracted and doesn’t pay attention to her as much. Which I said is understandable because having you kids and working that it’s easy for parents to lose their identities a bit and be tired and distracted and they should make sure to take the time for each other with date nights etc.

Jane then goes on to say how their intimate times have become problematic because they were sexually compatible but now he seems to have become premature and finishes before she gets a chance. I asked if she had mentioned it to him and Jane said she had but nothing has really changed, whenever she mentions it, he gets sulky and moody. I said to her that they probably need to see a sex positive therapist to get things on track and suggest some other resources she could go over for some ideas on how to deal with the problem. 

So Jane says that she wants to sort it out because on a sexual level she’s been trying lots of different things and nothing has helped so far, but she’s wanting to fix their sexual issues because she’s concerned if it doesn’t improve she may start looking elsewhere. To which I replied, if that’s how she’s feeling then she needs to get to a therapist quick smart.

Jane has sent me a few messages on social media since and thanked me for my input. So I look back on the conversations and now question a couple things in my own mind. On one hand she’s basically saying her husband ignores her and on the other that he’s become premature in bed now I know these concepts do not negate each other but I just had the feeling that when I made a suggestion for one issue then there seemed to be another issue.

Jane and I do not normally have a close friendship where this sort of conversation would be considered normal. I also think it may have gotten out at work that I have been in open relationships before. I keep my private life private however a couple years back a I found out a co-worker knew one of my previous partners and she may have told some people.

It’s late and I’m tired so this may not be coming across as well as I would like. I’m curious if Jane was actually seeking my advice of if maybe she was feeling me out for something else? 

I don’t think it would be the latter, mainly because of our age difference and if it was I wouldn’t take advantage of that because I don’t agree with cheating and I think it’s a recipe for disaster to have sex with a co-worker.

TL DR? Co-worker asked for relationship advice and I don’t know if they wanted advice or to let me know they were contemplating being unfaithful.",16Aug2020,1

Sorry in advance if i messed up anything, im writing whats on my mind rn.. been thinking of writing for awhile.
So i met this girl in a game and we talked for abit ( for months ) and flirted , until i catches feeling n stuff.. i guess i was desperate ( nerd + virgin ) and at the middle of the period i 23m found out abt her age 16f , which i wasnt expecting.. i thought she’s 20 or something.. she gave me the feeling that shes got a matured mind ? Idk how to say it exactly , i did talked to our game friends and one of them thought she’s actually in uni as well.. 
( i didnt ask for or persuade anything sexual ) 
But we still continue the flirting and always there for each other , we even talked on the phone ( which was funny n awkward af but we enjoyed it , again nothing sexual ) we nvr seen each other faces even now. 
She had some experiences before talking / meeting me.. , and idk why but i feels like im taking advantage of her n i told her of it but she says she chose to talk to me.. 
Then she actually did suggest that we shud stop the flirting n watever is going on btw us , even tho none of us wanted to stop.. and i rejected the idea. Oh and the title grooming , because i read it says something about gifting stuff , i did get her a pass in the game , i only do that two times , first was when i had an extra.. second time was cuz we’re pretty close ? So i thought why not? 
And umm currently we arent talking to each other due to some circumstances.. and we’ll wait for the time to come and we’ll talk again..
So was i manipulating her ? I just feel like giving her what i can.. idk im sorry if i sounds like i am manipulative.. i dont like forcing things so i dont wanna manipulate her or anything..

Although table service still makes me nervous, it’s a lot easier than having to go up and ask.

625,"I chose not to post in relationship advice as it’s not solely about my relationship, but this plays a big role.

My girlfriend and I got together back in Sept 2019 and the months from Sept-Dec we’re absolutely insane, some of the best few months I’ve had in recent years. From Dec-Feb(ish), my GF and I had a couple of the more major clashes in our relationship, but this was also countered by some of the most memorable moments of our relationship. 

Not only were the months mentioned good relationship wise, my life was going awesome. College was going good, my side job was going good, friendships were blooming and I finally had the freedom of being able to drive so that made for a lot of fun meets and adventures. 

Ever since about March, when COVID became a lockdown worthy issue, everything’s seemed to have just gone downhill. My GF and I had some of our worst arguments in the period of March-Now, I’ve got less motivated, barely seen my friends (probably lost a few of the less close ones) etc. I also have OCD so it’s been a massive struggle for me coping and trying to function normally. Now, although I’d had these bad arguments, my GF and I also did a lot of quarantining together (after a 3/4 week period of not seeing each other because of the initial threat). This meant March-Now has also created even more of my most memorable moments... But it just doesn’t feel EXACTLY the same all the time. And I don’t mean the relationship, I mean me as a whole, I guess. I just missed that vibe I had Sept-March. I felt on top of the world, everything was good, nothing was in the way. 

I’ve had similar issues with being attached to a period of time before. I never really got over it, it just dulled with time as I moved on with life. I just want a way to stop saying ‘I’d do anything to go back to September and do it all again’ and more so ‘I’m glad I’ve had the time I’ve had, I’m looking forward to more’. 

Thank you for reading!",16Aug2020,1

632,"Uh... hi! So I’ve always struggled with math, ever since I was a kid. My mom always drilled me on those times table things and they never stuck. I still don’t really know past the 5’s. Math never really made sense to me. 
In 7th and 9th grade, I was depressed and also had one of the worst math teachers I’ve ever had. She was mean, basically never helped me even when I asked, yelled at me, embarrassed me and other students, made me redo work that took hours because I was absent the day it was supposed to be turned in. I taught myself everything using youtube videos. And that really made me hate math more than anything. It also made me realize I was suicidal. I cried in that class all the time and had multiple panic attacks because of it. I even had a mental breakdown one morning seeing my math grade in her class was a C and my parents ended up witnessing it. 
Now I’m in 11th grade, doing online school and I’m struggling. My teacher just puts up these PowerPoint slides and expects us to know everything already. I have a quiz tomorrow and I’ve been studying for the past 3 days nonstop. Yet I can’t even get 3 questions right in a row. I think I understand it but then I go to do it and I get answers that don’t make sense and when they do, they’re incorrect. Then I just break down crying. I’ve watched khan academy and YouTube tutorials and they make sense. It’s just when I do it, I somehow don’t do it right. 
Am I just THAT bad at math? Or is it caused from something? I’ve considered maybe I have dyscalculia since I struggle with understanding money and numbers in general. But even if I do have it, I don’t want to tell my parents cause they’ll just say I don’t have it.

633,"I was just wondering what the opinion is on this. What if you end up going out to drink and dance last minute with a group of friends who happen to be all guys? I'm a female in my mid twenties and work in hospitality. My job is very casual and relaxed so it's normal for us to party together. 

Anyway, after work a few nights ago, went last minute to a gay club with a group of people from my job and was the only girl (only 1 guy in the group was gay tho). We all danced the night away and had an absolute blast! Nothing dodgy happened, didn't dance with anyone really just had a good time.

I'm in a committed relationship with an amazing guy, and he was away at work this week so couldn't invite him or anything. 

So I was chatting to my dad today about what I'd been up to and mentioned that night. My dad asked if there were any other girls and I said no. He kinda was weird about it and told me my boyfriend probably wouldn't appreciate me going out with only other guys. I didn't really even realize it was only guys till he said that! I have plenty of girlfriends, but due to it being last minute I didn't invite them.

To me, it wasn't that type of situation because my friends all know I have a boyfriend and (besides lots of drinks) it was a totally innocent night that ended in eating kebabs at 4am lol. Nobody made a move on me and it was the most fun I've had in a long time.

635,"I went home to visit family on the Friday &amp; Saturday and due to other events it became a stressful ordeal. On the end of Friday I started feeling ill (high temp, upset stomach, high heart rate) but this is common for me due to anxiety, recent hot weather in UK (lack of sleep) and after a 2.5 hour drive home. 
Saturday morning felt fine and carried on as normal but my Dad concerned by my high temperature to the touch suggested to take my temperature under my tongue, which was normal but still concerned me. I was however set to visit other family this day which I always find stressful and anxiety inducing so again that could be the cause. 

I did however try to get out of seeing more family and told them I was worried my symptoms matched the virus. They asked about my temperature and as that was normal they convinced me to attend. 

As soon as I was done with seeing various family members, 5 in total but 2 separate households effectively (over the whole weekend). I decided to drive back home in case it was the virus as I was feeling uncomfortable about it all. 

During the times I saw my grandparents I was in close proximity to them on the Friday and Saturday. Both times I felt fine and tried when possible to maintain some distance (as I have done for the past few months), but it was less than 2m a lot of the time as we had a meal. 

Before visiting home I’d only left my own home once in the past week for a 10 minute trip to the local supermarket for essentials. Only other possible infections could have been receiving mail. 

I’m now terrified that during that time I did have the virus and gave it them, this is now causing me to be tense and anxious which base on experience normally makes me have similar symptoms to the virus making me think it the virus and so on. 

I’ve requested a virus test which gets delivered on Monday, with results expected Tuesday. However I wanted to hear if anyone has been through anything similar over the past few months or has any advise. 

If it does come back positive I have no idea how to tell them either.",16Aug2020,1
636,"Hi guys, I want to thank all you guys who took their time and energy to read this post. And I want to apologize if my words/the way I talk is incoherent and all over the place. English is not my first language and I'm really bad at presenting information to people/making people understand me.

Also it's gonna be long. And what I say in this post, is true. I am not joking or trolling. This is my life.

\---

I'm biologically male and I'm now 22. I look like a normal guy, talk like a normal guy, from the outside.

Back when I was 6-8 years old, I started to do 'weird things' in the shower. I wore my sister's bra and underwear and it felt really good. She is 12 years older than me.

That went on for some time. Then I got caught in the night when searching through my sister's closet. So I stopped doing those stuffs.

===============================

I hit puberty when I'm about 11. When I reach 12 or 13 I started to find out about online chat rooms. Yahoo Messenger back in the day. And I started looking for sex.

Of course no girl wants to talk to a kid for that kind of stuff, so I landed on gay chat rooms.

Gosh I'm a mess.

My first intercourse was with a guy about 20s. Of course I would say I'm 16. We met on a top floor of a building, of course no one was around. And we did it. He penetrated me. Condom at first, then it feels really uncomfortable, so I told him to take it off. We did it for about 3 or 5 minutes and he came. Inside I guess.. I can't remember.

In my life no one has ever sexually abused me. I did it all to myself. Sometimes I cry and be ashamed of it. Sometimes I think of those guy-on-guy experience and feel like I want to do it again..

\---

My years at junior high school was hard. At 6th grade I tell the girls I like: ""I like you"" and all sort of stuff. Nobody accepted me. That process went on a few times and they start to hate me. I became a joke. They see me and address me as ""Shit"" or loser, something along those lines. And of course, at that young age, no one teached me how to talk to a girl, or even to socialize properly. So I was bullied like that.

So I failed with girls, I went to more chat rooms, find more guys. They liked me, you know. They liked me. They valued me. I had VALUE. 

But the problem is I don't like guys, in a romance way. I sometimes like guys for sex, but not for love.

\---

Then I reach senior high, 10th grade, about 16 years old. Same shit happens. I failed again and again. Then I drop out of school. Then there was a period when I whore myself out for the price of 2 and a half dollars :)))

===============================

Sometimes I think to myself it would be a lot easier if I was a girl. Sometimes I wanted to be a girl. I watch a lot of k-pop girl group songs, and I relate to those stuffs. When I watch porn/read adult comics, or even a regular comics/movie I want to be the girl! But I don't like guys,... like WTF IS WRONG WITH ME??

\---

I think further and further about this topic. Observe my body behaviors when I make certain thoughts, and I noticed this: 

  \- When I'm on the 'normal guy' mode, my head feels heavy and I get tired all the time. Even when I don't do any hard work I still get tired.

  \- But when I think thoughts like ""It's okay to be a girl"", ""I can grow boobs to show them off"", ""I grow my butts to twerk,.."" the headache goes away, my head feels light, even euphoric sometimes. 

\---

I'm not handsome or pretty. My body is really ""male"" and there is no way that I can transform myself into a girl. So I can't be a girl. But being a guys is so fucking rough, so much responsibilities.

When identify as a guy, of course I want a lovely wife who will take care of me. But I cannot carry the responsibilities of a good husband. I want a lot of things but I can't give anything back. It's not a fair exchange, which cannot last.

But when I imagine I am a girl (with a nice body of course), I can cook for my partner (whether it's a man or woman). I can clean the house for them, I feel like I can do all sorts of stuffs for them.

But as a guy it becomes a burden that I cannot take.

What should I do with my life?",16Aug2020,1
637,"reddit i need help decideing who i stay with. sorry in advance for typeos. d= my dad m= my moms s = my sister woohoo=sex. ill start with a description of everyone from my point of view.

D ,39, a hard working logger/contracter working for himself, e4 ex vet, no bullshit attitude, definite gambling problem, a bad liar or a REALLY good one. also classified a genius by the milatary and crasy strong. (casully moved a cord of WET OAK in a 450 pound trailer. 3500 pounds in toatal all the way to the other side of our kinda yard area wich is all gravel)

M ,40, idk it changes everyday

S ,22, cut-throat, past drug issues, (i never really got to know her)

me ,14, a boy who noshit has no irl freinds because he pushed them all away.

ill start with a gloss over the past for refrence starting16 years ago when my parents met, they met in collage while not in the same degree they met in the collage jobs they both had. after a week my mom and dad were in absolute love. they both droped out of collage and quit their jobs just too spend more time with eachother (no joke) they watched movies and took care of M's daughter.

after a month they were planning on getting married. Ds parents told M to not go through with it because D was a lair and a manipulater. but M went through with it and after 2 years they had a baby. D got a drilling job in alabama paying 120,000 a year while M stayed home and took care of the kids and studied respatory theripy in collage for seven years. D got angry at drunk boss who almost got him killed and quit job, went back to oregon M did some collage tests on the way there and got a half assed kinda degree for respatory therepy that can only be used in alabama. S acused D of rapeing her but her past history of lieing about shit gets it put to the side. she atempts suicide a uncountable amount of times. D started a trucking job then moved to a diffrent place in oregon a year later.

after about 9 months they got in a fight and D held M up by her neck with one hand, little 8 yr old me saw this all D went to jail for a few nights and got bailed out by his mom. me, M and S went to idaho, and i wasnt allowed to know anything wich ment i only knew the tiny bit i saw. from here i hated my dad a lot more them any 8 yr old hated anything else before. after a 4 months of me refuseing to talk to my dad over the phone my mom forced me to talk to him. i dont remeber the call but i hated him less.

during the summer me, M and some of her freinds went camping. one of my freinds came with. after a day i had the brillant plan of hikeing it all the way to west oregon from 40 miles away from the canadian border idaho with said freind. i might make a seprate post about that becase it was maybe the coolest thing ive ever done. the reason i might wana do such a thing? to kill my dad. yup 8 year old me tried to kill my dad. we got caught but we made it 14 miles. a helecopter found us. and some cops ended up driveing us back. when i told my mom why i ran away she packed our shit and went to oregon to make me love my dad again. while not the most rational desision it had good intrests.

when my mom droped me off and left before they started fighting. why would they fight? D started dateing his dead brothers wife. but for the most part me and him made up while i lived with him for a month or so. nothing important happens really so ill do a summary: D and M get back together and split 3 times, Ds brthers wife sucks Ds dick, me, M and S get evicted twice, we move around a lot, S(16ish) fucks a 30 yr old with kids, S move to idaho by herself. and from here it starts to get real so leave if you were in a good mood or buckle up for the ride.

D and M get back together again and we get an apartment after a while D starts to turn down woohoo, somting that never happend before. we assume its because of the loss for sex drive due to age. well they start doing firewood for money. now the family dynamic is D does most of the wood work M does some of the wood work and most of the chores. and i did school and some chores. it was pretty nice until M started seeing people in the woods, like hideing behind the trees. me and D both thought she was seeing things and was going crazy. we mostly ignored it until she said D started doing hand signs to the trees.

now im starting to put 2+2 together and so was M. but we didnt wana say anything when we had no proof. now D starts to take up to 4 hours longer than he should on a delivery of fire wood. money started to disapear. while all this all happening 11 yr old me starts to do yard work for bags of cans, makeing enough to pay for my own games and toys. we start doing family things less

about a year into liveing in the aparment M is starting to cry every here and there D starts gambleing a a whole week of pay. D starts dissapearing randomly, i start getting bullied, i start making money without working, we start to do family things even less i start to have to buy my own food somedays. i start missing school events. and the family dynamic is D most wood work, M some wood work half chores, me half chores and school work. D makes M think she is going insane by making her think whole days never happens to get away with gambleing that days work worth of money.

3 days ago: 3 years in the apartment, mom is on the verge of cracking D has everything in his name so if M tries to take me we have to start over completely. im 14 and might get a legal job and can make 50$ a day sitting on his ass, lost all my saveing due to D needing bill money, anytime D or M finds out i have &gt;3$ they need it for some reason, D and M both are telling me completely differnt storys about even the most trival shit like how much moey they used for gas both promising their right. both lie to me about money, work, what they said to me, what they did, and how they did random ass shit like mopping with bleach even though we were out for days. neither of them i trust D isnt even allowed at his own moms house because he stole stuff from there. they acused eachother of cheating atleast once a week

one day M was snooping around Ds phone and found a hidden app....a texting app.... she looked at his messages 20+ women. some he sent dickpics to, others he met, others were talking about meeting for another ""date"". she shown me it. i was angery, like go to jail for assult mad. if my dad wasnt at work i would of done somting stupid. i got my bat and started paseing my room and completely forgot about my crying mom. i chiled out and slept we decided to wait until the next day to tell him we knew. but he knew we knew before we even told him we did, he came into my room and said that the dicpics were ""jokes"" and were ""photochoped"" i told him his lie was the same as the ""i have a girlfreind but she go's to another school"" bs that little children use. D said he wasnt lieing so i said he dosent even know how to pronounce photoshop. he said ""whatever"" i brought up all the other shit but all he did was make up more retarded bs. after not convinceing me he stomped off. mom started packing my stuff up but i told her to stop because we have no money no plan no car and we dont even know where to go she got pissy with me and said ""are you not going?"" i said not yet. we need money. still a little angery i havent wheighed my options yet. now my thinks im staying with my mom and my mom thinks im staying with my dad. both are more upset about me likeing the other one more than lose their damn child.

now here is where i need advice, do i stay with my scum ass dad and keep my ivy leage level online school and 50$ a day for doing nothing job and know i have a house and maybe even get a job or do i go with my mom wo wont have a house or a job but i already know ill be happier but i wont have a stable life and ill have to couch serf for a few months like before.",16Aug2020,1
638,"Sorry if this is kind of long.

So my mom started this new job working in a correctional facility in finance a little over a year ago. She had trouble adjusting because she can be pretty quiet in new situations, and had trouble becoming friends with her coworkers- a few apparently didn’t like her from the start and gave attitude to many people. Eventually she became friends with one of the officers there. She’s finally coming home happier, now that she made a friend. Last August, he invited my mom shooting, and she wanted me to come since I was leaving for college the next week and she wanted to do something fun. He was very nice. I notice her texting him quite a bit after that, and caught her sending hearts to him. I mentioned that they seemed flirty, but she said they’re just friends. 

Fast forward to last week, my best friend caught her bf cheating on her and dumps him. I’m sitting with my mom and sister and I’m talking about what happened, and I said “well I’m not as surprised and I should be, he cheated before so why not cheat again? Once a cheater always a cheater.” My sister agreed, but my mom said that’s not true. We argued a little bit about how it is, and she insisted that people can change. My sister asked if my dad ever cheated on her and that’s why she’s defending cheaters, and she said no, he never cheated on her. Now this is in the back of my mind. 
The other night, my mom handed me her phone to read my brothers college schedule because she’s planning a trip for Labor Day weekend, and I exited her convo with my brother and notice her conversation with police officer, since it’s one of the first few conversations. I was curious but not really expecting to read anything, so I click on it. I scroll up a little bit, and now I’m reading pretty sexual messages. Now I’m scrolling up more, reading stuff about how they meet on their lunch break in a parking lot somewhere, how my mom is “fckn sexy”, and there’s also messages of one asking how the others family is, how his gf is, how are the kids? I managed to take a picture of one section, but put her phone down so she wouldn’t notice because at that point I was just shaking. 
I went to my room and kind of avoided her the rest of the night and yesterday, and drove around for a while after I finished up at work (it was a wedding that ended kind of early so I drove around until about 1:30 am so she would go to bed and I wouldn’t have to talk to her) because I just don’t know what to do. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this? How would I even go about bringing it up? If you have experienced something like this before, what was the outcome for you? At first it seemed like it didn’t even happen and it was just a dream, but now it’s starting to really set in. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",16Aug2020,1
639,"My dog recently passed away. We decided to get her cremated. My parents want to scatter the ashes at a lake they enjoy going to, on a piece of property we’re going to be buying soon. I don’t want to do this for a couple reasons

1. My family is emotionally, physically (occasionally) and mentally abuse to me. As soon as I move out, I will cut out virtually all contact with them. I don’t want to loose my dog by having her blocked off by them. 

2. She never even visited this area before. I think it’s kind of stupid to put her somewhere she never even went when she was alive (obviously way less important then one)

How can I subtly get them not to bury her? I keep saying i want to keep her at home, where she spent all 11 of her years, but they continue to brung up scattering her. This dog was basically the only thing keeping me together through my childhood and the thought of not being able to keep a piece of her with me when I inevitably leave is making me loose my mind. She was the only one in my family that kept me sane this far, as well as very necessary to avoid bad mental health stuff that I otherwise get no support for. I need to keep her with me.

I met you in a restaurant after you matched with me on Tinder. You made me feel so incredibly loved. You made me feel genuinely attractive, worth chasing after, as you awkwardly complimented me just a little bit more than was really required. And it made me feel so much more confident than I really am. Like an object of desire.

And god, the sex was so good. Is still incredible. What an indescribably selfish reason to stay, but god, it was so good. Caring in foreplay, smoking hot, a great, knowledgeable, kinky dom who helped fulfill a my deepest fantasies, yet was respectful of my boundaries. Great at cuddling afterwards.

I knew then, and I know even more now, that despite everything, despite all the love you had for me, the spark was just missing for me. I don't know why. I still find myself wondering why I can't quite feel the same love despite you checking seemingly all the boxes. I don't know. Perhaps I will never know how true, romantic love really feels. Perhaps the universe has decided I'm not worth it, I'm only worth being a person who breaks people. In my desperation, I thought if I just kept it going, I would find the spark eventually.

But I know I'm only continuing because I'd never felt attractive before. You helped me feel so much better about myself and my worth, and for that I will be eternally grateful. Yet I know I can't give that same feeling back to you. Maybe in a sexual sense, but not in the deep fulfilling sense that you give to me. And I know, deep down, you know that too. But you just aren't willing to admit it to yourself. I can see it in your eyes. Such a cliché, but they are beautiful eyes.

I know that if I continue like this, it will get worse. You'll realize more and more that I just don't love you in the same way and you'll hate me for tricking you all this time. You've been punishing me in bed more and more lately, and I can see it's for more than the fact that it's sexy. I try to hide it, but it's fucking sad. I broke down the other day seeing the real anger that shine through your eyes, for a brief second. And you stopped right away, switched back to caring mode and cuddled me so fucking good, and that made me feel worse, made me feel broken for not loving you. I told you it was just a random mood swing, and you told me you understood, even though that was a really shitty explanation, and you knew it.

I'm so sorry. You deserve so much better than me. I know I'll have to tell you eventually. I just don't know how.",16Aug2020,1
643,"A week ago I went to make my first LinkedIn profile and spent a week building the profile and connecting with my friends and acquaintances. When I went the add my email, it said that an account already exists for that email address. So I continued with the preexisting account tied to my email address which was basically empty, had no connections and had a blank profile. 

After a week of spending 4-5 daily hours talking with people, making connections, etc. when I went to login I got a restricted message. I immediately emailed customer support and they asked me for id. I gave them a copy of both my passport and license only to receive an email saying that the id did not match the original name on the account and that the account was made 7 years ago with a different name.

I continued to explain to LinkedIn that the account was made by either a hacker who used my email or due to an internal LinkedIn mistake that I had no relation to. 

Instead of doing any investigation on how someone has used my account, they continued to email me parts of their user agreement that they themselves were going against. They did no investigation as to whether the original user was fraud or a hacker or if it was an internal mistake. They refused to give me information that was created by my IP, my email, under my name (and i provided them with ID). They have now forced me to lose a weeks worth of work and countless connections.

They said they can not give me back the connections because its against LinkedIn's user agreement to be able to assign contacts to the wrong users. If they just had done some basic research they would realize that there were 0 initial connections on the account under the original users name and that all the hundreds of connections added me under the name that I have provided ID for.",16Aug2020,1
644,"Hi folks,

First of all, apologies as english is not my first language. 

Me and my wife live in a cul de sac with our cars parked in front of the house and approximately 25 feet by 25 feet of parking space for other cars, which no other households currently occupy. Since it's a closed off and a rather small area, kids around 6-12 like to play there, which I do not have any issues with. They can be loud, but I do not want to be a grumpy old man. 

Lately, I've noticed a rather unusual amount of scratches and bumps on the hood of my car. This afternoon the kids were playing again, I was watching them just to check if they might be the ones hitting my car, and they were. I went outside, told them they were done for the day playing in that area and to try again tomorrow without hitting my car. I checked, and there was a bump which were similar to other dents I had. 

I do not want to start a neighborhood fight by any means and I have always been bad at confrontating  people. I should mention that there is plenty of play areas in the neighborhood, but they like the spot in front of my house since its fenced off. 

How do you think I can best handle this situation without being seen as the 'grumpy old man' as I mentioned earlier?",16Aug2020,1

646,"Hi,

I have a friend that has had a rough last two years. She quit a high-paying career and decided to move into a van by choice. At first, I felt guilty that she was staying in a van so I began inviting her to do things with me and my boyfriend a lot because I knew she was lonely. It became overwhelming when EVERY weekend she asked to hang out (when I would make a white-lie excuse as to why I wasn't free one weekend, she would wiggle her way in and get herself invited to hang out). One day I actually found she was sitting in a parking lot waiting for me to drive by to ask to be invited to spend time with my boyfriend and I while we did our usual Sunday studying; this all caused my anxiety to start to increase about spending time with my friend- it felt like an obligation now and like I would be ""caught"" if I wanted to spend time alone. It started to create a rift between my boyfriend and I because he felt like we weren't able to have alone time because this friend was always trying to spend as much time with me during the weekends as possible.

During this time of living in her van, she decided to switch her career-path and try to discover her dream job. She started working a minimum-wage job and had been assuring everyone for months that her set-up for ""van life"" was foolproof, but she kind of lied to everyone; one day I had to rescue her from polar vortex temperatures and discovered she hadn't been using heat all winter. I invited her into my home for a week to help her figure out a plan of how to survive the rest of the winter and she decided she would move back into an apartment because this wasn't working out. During this week at my place, she asked if she could be a ""live-in maid and chef"" to stay in my apartment with me and my boyfriend and I had to tell her I didn't need that. She has a small dog that lives with her who is badly behaved and I saw that she wasn't planning on leaving my apartment any time soon, so I had to sit down and tell her one night that when the weather warmed up, I needed her to find a new place to go because I wasn't allowed in my lease agreements to have a dog in my apartment (I know this wasn't the most direct way of telling her that I couldn't have her stay with me, but I was scared to hurt her feelings when she was so vulnerable). It was an incredibly stressful week for me having her stay with me and my anxiety climbed again.

She sold the van, found an apartment, and then bad luck struck and she lost her job. She told me (only me) she had suicidal thoughts and my friend and I staged an ""intervention"" and told her lately that I had been feeling very overwhelmed with this friendship lately and even burdened when she was only telling me information about suicidal thoughts. We suggested she see a therapist and she said she didn't need one because she was healing herself. We asked her what her plan was for the apartment payments because she was hiding the fact she had lost her job from her parents; She said she would rather go into debt than work a job she didn't feel was meaningful. Eventually, the debt climbed enough that she took a minimum wage job (that she didn't find meaningful) and moved home with her parents to pay off the debt. During this time of paying off her debt, she put $10,000 on her credit card to do a health assessment (by choice) and put herself even further into debt. COVID happened and she had to quit her job due to her parents health issues and unemployment money came through which pulled her out of debt, so she ended up getting very lucky.

Now she's sick of living with her parents and texted my friend and I again saying ""do you want a live-in maid and chef."" I again said ""I do not need a live-in maid or chef,"" and she told us how she is planning to quickly move into her car (her mom's car) if she can't stay at home anymore. My friend and I asked what her plan was for showering since gyms are closed and what her plan is for when it gets cold again (because of the situation that happened the last time she lived in her van during the winter). She said she would figure out the showering and never said anything about the cold temperatures. She said she will not ever live in an apartment again and prefers to live in a van, but she doesn't have a job right now, so we asked her would she take any random job to just get money for a van. She said no, she would not take any job and would rather go into debt again than work a job that doesn't fit her values.

I have no hate for her deciding to live in a van- in fact, I'm fine with anyone who wants to make that their lifestyle.However, I don't feel like it's fair to ask me to support her emotionally and physically when she decided not to plan for living conditions. I also don't think it's fair to ask to move in with me and tell me she will not work unless the right job is found (it's been 2 years and that job has not been found)- that's taking advantage of the hard work I've done for myself to create my living conditions and it's taking advantage of my emotions in this friendship.

I thought I set my boundaries before by telling her I couldn't have her living with me, but apparently my white-lie about her dog being the reason she couldn't live with me didn't ""click"" with her that I didn't want HER living here... because she's asking me to move in again. How do I go about setting my boundaries very clearly without hurting her feelings? Over the last 2 years, I feel as though every interaction with my friend has involved negativity or that I'm not getting as much out of this friendship as she is from me. When she asks to hang out, I'm filled with a sense of dread and she usually ends up crying about a situation she's put herself in because she's too stubborn to work any job that allows her to create an independent living situation. Her pattern the past two years is that when I say ""no"" to something, she manipulates me to say ""yes."" I have been filled with anxiety all week over the thought of her showing up on my doorstep a few months from now and having to let her in again, even for a week, out of guilt.

Ive been wanting to text her (i live about 6 hrs away) but were both stubborn and I guess have too much pride? Lol but long story short, I didnt agree to what she was doing back then. She was making fake accounts trying to sabotage her exes relationship and I ended up telling her ex that it was her doing it. Im probably a bad friend for doing that which is probably why I havent said anything to her bc I feel like i owe her an apology too and I feel embarrassed for what I did. But I also felt like I just needed to end what she was doing bc it just wasnt right. 

I miss having someone to talk to most of the time bc we would talk 24/7. And i just recently got engaged and she would have been my maid of honor. 

What should i do? Should I just text her and ask if we can talk? I just feel like 2yrs is too late and nothing can be fixed.",16Aug2020,1

662,"Hiya, kinda new-ish with this Reddit thing so please bear with me...

So, I have this friend whom I've known since 2015.
(let's call her J) 
We met at my first job, despite having different interests we really became close. We even became part of the management team later on. 
We also hung out outside of work. 
J decided to leave the job to help out her brother with his business, however, her brother wasn't successful in that field so she had to look for another job.
J still continued working part time for my company even though she found another job. 

Because of COVID, my company decided to close down physically as we lost quite a handful of clients..
(I didn't lose my client so my boss decided to keep me) 
I shared to J that I was having a hard time with my finances because of COVID and I had a brush with COVID last June 2020.. 
J then offered me a job in her company, not only for extra cash but also because she had a great health care provider/insurance there.
Fast forward, J and I are working together again just like the old times.

A week or two in my new job with J, she approached me via DM asking if she could stay with me in my house because she got evicted from her boarding house because the other tenants and her kinda got into a misunderstanding regarding the upkeep of the bathroom and their areas.
I took pity on J and begged my mom to let her stay, we even discussed the amount J will be paying and her privileges in my house. My mom agreed to let J stay with us.

It was around the last week of July where J invited me and another friend our ours (let's call her P) to have a snack outside of the office..
P asked why J moved out and why she chose me instead of staying with her boyfriend...
J eventually broke down in tears, saying that her family was against her and her boyfriend so she chose me.
J said that her mom didn't like her boyfriend because he had tattoos and was drinking before
(a little background, J's family is religious and a bit old-fashioned.. Her dad is a pastor)
P and I sympathized with J and told her that things will eventually be okay.

Fast forward to a couple more days..
J's mom reached out to me on my Facebook asking about J, I her mom made it sound like J was at fault..
Obviously, I told J about it and we brushed it off.

I don't know what cosmic force collided tonight but J's older brother reached out to my mom on Facebook, he was also asking about J, however, their conversation was a bit eye-opening because J's older brother shared that he believe J is pregnant because she decided to cut them off..
(I wasn't able to read the whole conversation of J's brother and my mom sadly)
But it dawned on me that J's older brother maybe correct because:

- J had been constantly complaining that her clothes had gotten tight on her..
2 of her skirts got ripped up just from simply moving.
Now, I know we can blame on it on the extra pounds we gained during the stay-at-home order/lockdowns.

- J's eyebags and circles have become prominent lately
- Back to the first one, J does seem to have a belly.

Now, I'm not being judgmental.. I also have my tummy pouch cos I'm a lazy potato and took quarantine seriously but J's seem to be growing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I honestly don't know what to ask here yet as I only know one side of the story.
I wouldn't mind breaking a limb for a friend, especially for someone who has seen my ups and downs however I feel I've been taken advantage of.
I have spent time with J's family before because they invited me to their church and I know they won't get upset unless something major happened.

I'm worried that my friendship with J might go down the drain if her brother's hunches are correct, not because of asking for help but because she lied to my family and took advantage of us.

I apologize for the word salad but I am at a lost.
I'll answer questions if there are misunderstandings..",16Aug2020,1

I really need advices from my problems ;((

1st, I stammer. Usually, when reporting, after a few minutes, I would stammer some words (mostly those with ""th"" sounds and words with ""s"" and ""t"") I think I have more but I would mostly stammer under those circumstances 

2nd, I GET TIRED EASILY. After maybe 2-3 minutes of continually talking, my voice would either start to crack or would sound out of breath. Like if you could hear me talking, you could literally hear that my voice sounds like I ran a full blown marathon.

3rd, My voice is not clear. every time I record myself, my voice sounds very muffled and sometimes there's this like vibration sound at the end of words (you know like vibrato but imagine it with a horrendous sound LOL) 

4th, I know my vocab sucks. English isn't really my first language, but is like there any way for me to improve faster (other than reading books and dictionaries lol)

5th my voice cracks a lot (especially if i've been talking for a long time (usually 2-5 minutes))

6th I think my voice it too low for a female? Idrk but eveyrtime I hear a record of myself, it sounds like a male person is speaking. Maybe this could also be the reason why my voice cracks a lot

673,"I know this is a common Indian stereotype and as a result I hate Indian people. I know that's a horrible thing to say but my Dad always shouts and degraded me pretty much every chance he could, but when he saw that I was visibly upset the next day he would be like he used to be when I was little and tried to cheer me up. It really made me think that every Indian is like this.However Im not the aggressive type and wouldn't ever dream of hurting or racially slurring an Indian (especially because I'm Indian, I just get a bit of anxiety from all my experiences with my dad. 

Anyways moving on to my actual problem.I am really scared for the future, like terrified. I live in the UK and get up and down scores but my Dad hates me for it, he wants me to get the highest grades in my class, top of the year and know everything. Thing is though he was a manual labour worker from india so he always talks about how hard he worked to get here and how ungrateful I am, so when I try to study I get shouted at for not helping him out. But when all I do is help him out I can study and fall behind, as a result I get very depressed and told a few people about how I self harmed and stuff but now they think I'm clean (for the record I am clean and have been since feb also my parents don't know about it).

My parents say they genuinely do love me but it feels like the exact opposite, as sad as this is sometimes I just bust out crying on my own (never around others, even my family.) and I start thinking negatively.

My main passions are playing football/sports, ICT and I like to edit videos and stuff as well as grow a few Instagram theme pages. However my parents only know about the first 2.  What I wanted to do was take a college or university that would allow me to play football ( by this I mean either representing the place such as Loughborough university, or allow me to trial for an academy) while studying about ICT.

Here's the problem, my Dad recently said that he's very concerned about my life because He doesn't think I won't be able to get a secure job. I don't know if it's true but he says IT jobs are just impossible to get a job in and I'm too shy to teach people about sports or play at a high level. He also said that he will only pay for My education and if that doesn't work out for me he won't lend me any money. As a matter of fact he said he would essentially CUT ME OFF from the family.

He says how med is a guaranteed job and Indians are born to do it because we are smart. I feel dumb as hell and although I know I'm smart I have zero confidence in myself. 

Now I'm thinking about how I should either do what I love, potentially fail and get cut off from my family and be completely on my own in the real world or succeed and live a happy life with my fathers approval (only if I succeed) OR
Become a medical student complete med school work in a hospital or as apart of a medical scene and work at a job I hate.

675,"So I'm a male in my late 20's, and two years ago I began working at this upscale retail store in the Health/Beauty department..

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never written up and never had any conflict with management...

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired...

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shawn, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things...

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person...

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup...

didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then about two weeks later, I decided to take one extra 15 minute break because somebody called off and I had twice the work to do, and didn't see me getting out on my scheduled time... that was apparently the straw that broke the camels back, because the next day i was fired... this was an issue one year ago, but not this year.

The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me...

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups...

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to fire me.

I believe Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset. I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through, how much unfair intense scrutiny he gave me.

Why does it seem I was fired? Does this seem unfair? 

All the store managers and HR think my writeups and termination are justified, while everyone I talk to outside of that sees it as totally unfair.

I never really felt like the managers and HR were being honest with me, when Intold them I was concerned I was going to be fired no matter what by Shawn.",16Aug2020,1
676,"My 25 year old partner suffered a brain bleed in his brainstem as a result of his tumor on July 31st. He was intubated that day and lost consciousness and was in a coma until around the 12th of August. Since waking up, he can barely move his left side (sometimes can wiggle the left toes and occasionally slightly squeeze his left hand). Also, because of the intubation he cannot speak (they performed a tracheostomy to help wean him off the ventilator so until that process is done he cannot speak). To top it off, the tumor has caused some hearing issues and vision issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Since he woke up, he has been visibly depressed and withdrawn. I am scared he's given up and wont want to start treatments or wont try during physical therapy to try and regain some of his motor control of the left side. I wouldn't care if he never regained any control of the left side and required a wheel chair. I'm honestly just so happy he's alive (the doctors gave me the he's-not-waking-up-plan-the-funeral speech three times prior to him waking up). His medical team wants to start him on SSRIs, and I've asked him his opinion (he can write, nod, or shake his head to communicate), but he doesn't answer me. I'm worried about starting him on SSRIs without his consent, as his autonomy is already limited. I also have no idea how to cheer him up or how to show him I support him. Further, when he moves to the rehabilitation facility on Monday or Tuesday, I can ONLY visit from 2pm to 6pm (normally I stay at the hospital from around 7am to 9pm daily), so he'll largely be on his own. He cannot text (because he cannot read yet), but he can see pictures and react to messages (and send me gibberish texts which make my day).

X is the type who is not very friendly with the girls but super friendly with the guys and keeps everything to himself and gives a mysterious vibe...so I was shocked when he came to talk to me(apparently Y talks a lot about me in their friend circle about how I help him a lot mainly with his studies)..So anyways X and I started texting about clg stuffs and that's when this pandemic and lockdown started and we had online classes. X insisted that I should be his human clock as he can't depend on other guys(since all guys are lazy like him) and refused to get help from any other girls..later I realised that Y also call him to wake him up but I didn't thought anything about it since I also ask more than 1 person to wake me up at times.
Anyways, we started becoming close and our texts turned into calls( i didn't mind since I prefer calls over texts) and now he started being more open to me about his insecurities and doubts (which he didn't do before) and also once changed his ringtone (just because I said I didn't liked it ) to a song I liked..now he is sending the different versions of the song I liked (sometimes even tiktok videos of that song) ....he also asked me to block the guy in fb who said that I have an attractive smile and that I look beautiful .

680,"tl;dr my mom is stuck in this abusive relationship with my dad and I'm scared she's going to end her life.

My family is kinda a shthouse. Like literally since I can remember there have been fights, like screaming at the top of their throat fights, every couple of weeks. It's like my family has periods and the only way to remedy it is to fight. Thing is, it's almost always, like 99% of the time, my dad who starts it. I'm only now starting to realize as I near the end of high school that he is so emotionally abusive. He dictates the household, whether we should be happy, or not, and goddam is it painful. He's so petty, with such trivial issues like where if my older brother, yes my OLDER BROTHER takes her to work he gets pissed off because he wasn't the one to take her, and here we go another fight. He always says some crazy ass shit and messes up the house like punching a door in or a wall and then later completely denies doing any of it. On one occasion, he even hit my mom pretty hard and gave her a minor black eye and bruises around her body, as well as a bruised rib (on a different occasion). My mom actually packed her bags and went to live in the car, but my dad being the ol prince he is went and asked her to come back. My mom's a warrior and has gone thru this shit for the whole time they were married (apparently he even cheated on her when they were dating, so he's that typa person). I've never seen, met, or even talked to my mother's relatives. Basically, my dad literally flips the whole house upside down whenever my mom tried to talk to her parents or sister or literally any friend or person other than him or colleagues but only for work. Also, he claims to be the sole breadwinner of the family, when he blatantly isn't. My mom works just as much, on top of chores, none of which my dad does. Whenever I try to help my mom out by doing dishes or laundry or whatever, he throws another tantrum and begins another fight. This endless cycle. He has never, I mean never gotten my mom a gift, present, even a fucking cake on her birthday. My mom has tried, and failed, countless times to show affection, usually being laughed at or ridiculed. My mom is stuck, and I want to help her, but I know if they were to split it would be very hard on both of them. My dad's a fucking jackass, but he's my dad, and still works hard and provides for us, though he is not the sole provider as he claims he is (he also takes all of my mom's money and literally puts it in his wallet, as my mom is also a tutor working odd jobs here and there to cater to my school schedule). He's also so insecure of her being better than him he forced her to turn down a big time promotion. I want them to separate so bad and I also want to meet my mother's relatives because it's only fair to her...They're in a fight right now and my mom seems to be suicidal... shes talked about it before but she actually did some stuff this time... like this morning saw some slits on her wrist and she gave me and my little brother our birth things and valuable items as well as an envelope of money for ""college"" and stuff.

684,"Note : I'm not good at english so i'm sorry if it is difficult for you to understand my english.
I don’t really know how to express this, but I’ll try my best. Here’s the story : 
When I was 15, I was in a very close relationship with a girl in my class. We chat everyday till night just like a couple. She was very active, usually flirted with me. But back then, I was very stupid, stubborn, childish ( only care about playing games and studying), and somewhat also afraid of feeling love ( My first confess many years ago got rejected harshly, therefore, I was afraid of the feelings happening when you are going to confess ( the heart rate rises up)). So everytime she flirted with me, I didn’t care about it, didn’t believe my feeling that she liked me. I acted like an ******* to her, was very cold to her when we meet in class ( even when she approached me first, I would say nothing or very little ( partly I was nervous and didn’t know what to say) and if she didn’t approach me, we’re just like strangers in class ). Especially when she gave an ultimate hint : she changed her nickname in the chat to “My Princess” and I didn’t how the **** can I say “ It’s disgusting”, she changed it and didn’t say anything about it. We kept our relationship for 2 years then we became just normal friend, talk when needed.
 Now, 4 years have passed, I’ve grown up, had a girlfriend for over a year, become mature in thinking.      Only when I look back from now did I realize everything, her feeling, my stupidity. I’ve been wondering for weeks that if I should apologize to her for what I’ve done or not. Because everytime I remember it, I feel very very guilty. Please help me.
P/s : If you find it hard to understand anthing, please feel free to write down and I’ll try to explain it.

685,"My best friend is in a very toxic relationship. I warned her many times as he was very abusive he threatened, insulted and even he went violent and he tried to rape her. Anyways, as my friend is more of an emotional person I did my best to keep her away from him. After a while she told me that they started to talk and I had told her earlier that ''If you get back with him I will not be with you'' but I love her too and I said it because I was very sick of this drama and I did not want to see her this miserable anymore and I would threaten her if it would keep her away from him. I did what I said and I told her that as long as she is with him I will not see her. She is a grown woman and she can make choices but she disrespected both herself and me. He threatened me too by the way. He told me he would beat me up - He locked her ex girlfriend and beaten her up for real so it was all real-

Now they broke up and she came back. I want to support her but I have a pride too, and it will be hard for me to look at her face.

686,"this is probably gonna be a long wall of text, sorry.

my boyfriend (22m) and i (19f) have been having a lot of issues lately, but the main one is his apparent lack of empathy for animals. i've told him multiple times not to do certain things to/around our cat, at first i thought it was maybe his lack of experience with owning cats but i'm now realizing he just doesn't care.

the other night, he got mad at the cat and did something physically to him. i won't go too into detail, but i was so upset by it that i went into a blind rage and starting hitting my boyfriend repeatedly on the arm. i know i should not have done that and i feel incredibly awful and guilty for it, i have never, ever been one to be physical.

however, caring for animals my whole life, seeing the things he did and continuing to torment him (chasing him, yelling at him just to scare him, etc.) was incredibly heartbreaking. it really hit me last night when i was giving the cat his food and he refused to eat while boyfriend was near.. i think he noticed it as well because he crouched down and started petting him and being nice but i can't stop thinking about what he's already done.

due to circumstances, i cannot see myself leaving any time soon. i'm second guessing myself, beating myself up trying to figure out what the fuck i should do. i left home with no independence and i still have no independence which at this point is no one's fault but my own. i feel like a scared little kid with no parents that i can go back to without destroying my mental health more. it's gotten to the point where i'm in a really dark place, and i can't get help even if i wanted to.",16Aug2020,1

This is a joke because this girl says she doesn't really want to be in relationships because they control you too much. Well, just today we were talking about about if vaginas are different and that lead to another thing (not sexual) and that lead me to saying ""yours probably isn't as tight"" blah blah and she says ""know your boundaries"" and that led me to askijg ""who can talk about your pussy then?""

690,"A bit of background - 
I(22M) have been friends with this guy (22M) for more than 7 years, we meet in highschool and have taken different paths since then but still remained good friends. I left my small hometown and shifted to a big city for my undergraduate degree. Whenever I come back, he is the one who I spend most of my time hanging out with out of all my old highschool friends. Even while being in different cities we kept in touch and usually talked atleast once a week. He is becoming a doctor while I am trying to get into MNA, and have a economics degree.
I had to come back to my hometown as everything due to this pandemic was closed and I was living on rent with my roommates who decided to go back to their hometowns and hence I did too seeing it as a sensible option. 
I started hanging out with my friend (22M) again but we didn't have any of our usual places to hangout as all pubs, bowling alleys and restaurants were closed. So we decided that we will meet up on the weekends and watch a movie, drink a few beers and order take out. Whenever we meet its our ritual that we start making fun of each other or ourselves and laugh till our stomachs hurt, I share my problems with him and he does the same we know almost everything about each other.

So, on a casual Monday I decided to buy some shoes and called him up askes if he wants to join me cus we both love collecting sneakers and the showroom was close to his place, he agreed and told me to pick him. I parked the car within 5 mins of walking distance of the showroom, and while we were walking towards the showroom talking about mountain bikes or something out of nowhere he tells me, "" Me and my friend x ( I don't know this guy ) on the eve of new years in 2018, and you weren't here then, called a prostitute after coming back from the club and fucked her in turns and then payed her 100$ 50-50$ each . And it's the first I had sex and people talk rubbish about lasting a min first-time, I lasted for 30 mins !"". 
This completely threw me off, firstly cus we were talking about mountain bikes and secondly the inconsistencies in his story. So I debated for the next ten minutes with him about this and I also told him that he shouldn't have done this if it is at all true, cus he is going to become a doctor in year and should have thought about STDs knowing better then rest of us. I told him he is a good-looking guy 6'3, he played basketball in highschool and got into nationals and was going to become a doctor in a year, he shouldn't pay for sex and should do the due process of asking a girl out for a date and aim to have a nurturing relationship. 
He in turn started abusing telling me that I have a narrow mind and don't know anything about the world and should shut the fuck up. So, instead of arguing more I finished the conversation by asking  him not to discuss this topic with me any further. This was 5 weeks ago, since then he has been replying to my text a day late, cancelling plans and most of the time not picking up my calls. I have been trying to restore things back to normal since that conversation and haven't brought that up at all. I tried making different plans and ideas he said yes to very few even if he picked up the call and then cancelled them later. What should I do about this ? He has been a good friend of mine and this seems to me a really odd behaviour on his part, it's very confusing folks.",16Aug2020,1

694,"Whenever I come up with a title that isn’t weird I’ll change it. Let me explain, my father is a narcissist, rude and disrespectful brat (especially to my mother and his mother) . I’ve been noticing for a year and a half my brother is developing his same characteristics but somehow worst. My brother has serious anger issues and HATES it when people try to help him or simply give him advice. He thinks he knows everything and many times he sounds absolutely stupid. Both of my parents never completed high school but were instead working at the age of 13+ .  So, I was somewhat given the responsibility of helping my brother with his homework and other educational activities. My brother isn’t the easiest person to teach, he has autism and added with his anger issues we always end up arguing during homework time. This went on for a year until I finally got fed up. FUCK IT. I came to the decision that I can’t help someone that doesn’t want to be helped, especially someone who is as rude as him. My mother became upset with me that I stopped helping him. It’s almost like she would rather I suffer through teaching him. Fast forward to now, school is soon reopening in our district and my brother hasn’t revised or even attempted to study this entire time. All he does is watch YouTubers play video games. At one point he even decided that he wanted to be a YouTube gamer because “I’ll make alot of money” . 

His focus are definitely shifting and he doesn’t have a true goal in life. Is it bad if I decide never to help him again and focus on me and my education? I’m honestly tired and definitely don’t want to be put through more stress than I already have.",16Aug2020,1

If he just wanted to know more, I'd be happy to discuss them but it's like he's testing if I'm worthy of wearing certain clothes. I just think it's bizarre and can't seem to brush it off.

696,"A bit of backstory. This friend and I are (to me at least) best friends. He’s one of the only people I talk to, and one of the people I love the most. He is also my cousin.

We met up about 7 years ago when he first moved to Canada. Him and I spent about 4 years together being good friends and spending a lot of time together. About 3 years ago he moved to a different province. Now, when he moved, he cut ties with everybody back in BC except for myself and we still talk almost everyday over discord. Now, I’d like to say all of the friends he had back in my province were on the “straight and narrow” so to speak. They didn’t do drugs, they didn’t hang out with shady people or do illegal things, and my friend also followed suit. 

When he moved to his new province he started making friends with the wrong people. I think this is in part to his parents’ inability to give him attention due to their busy work schedules. He also has a pretty bad relationship with his dad (nothing abusive, just disagreement and he has a general disdain for his dad due to his anger issues). His new “friends” started encouraging him to skip class to vape, allowed him to get piss drunk only to get busted by his dad later on and their newest adventure was getting high off of weed and driving home.  He did all of these drugs while underage, by the way. 

Whenever he faced these issues I made sure to be there for him, no matter what. When he got addicted to nicotine I told him I would help him no matter what time what day whenever. I said the same thing when he got piss drunk. And every time I helped him, he said he thought of me as a brother that he can trust and seek advice from. But when he drove high, he didn’t want to hear it. When he drove while high he thought it didn’t matter cause he felt fine, and it was dark so he said the cops couldn’t catch him. As he typed this to me he thought it was a joke, and as he kept going, I got angrier and more disappointed. I expected more from him y’know? I told him my feelings and he proceeded to laugh at me and call me “extra” and say he just thought of me as a friend and not someone he goes seeking advice to. I then proceeded to tell him that his new friends were bad influences and started to tell him that his mom worked very hard to get him where he is and he’s spitting in her face by throwing it all away. He then told me that his new friends were “good” and “chill”. I fully believe he is saying this because one of his friends took care of him while piss drunk (which is the bare minimum) and because they’re the type of people you go out to have fun with, but not the type you’d want as your best man at the wedding.

So the advice part starts here, what the hell do I do? I’ve seen other people in my life get destroyed by drugs and he’s young and a lot ahead of him, I don’t want his life to get destroyed by his friends.  I really don’t want to talk to this parents because I don’t want him to lose trust in me and I definitely do not want to go to the police. Should I stop caring and stop acting like his big brother? What can I do?",16Aug2020,1

701,"I need some advice on how to get over the fact that you can never really know if someone is telling the truth..

So, for as long as I can remember, I've always been paranoid about people not telling me the truth, or never actually knowing when someone is lying. In most of the relationships I've been in and even with dating I've found that people ive dealt with have not always been honest about their intentions (infedidelity, wanting to date exclusively, not really wanted to date, etc.) Even when it comes down to my personal friendships, I find it difficult to believe the things people say. And if I find out someone has lied to me, I can become irrational, finding myself not being able to believe that person again. Even if it was a ""little white lie"". I tend to hold on the philosophy of ""if they are willing to lie about anything, they are willing to lie about everything"". Ive ended friendships that spanned for years, most notably a 5 year friendship (at the time) with a close pal from high school. Not because he was a bad person, but because he once lied to me about why he couldn't have hung out..which I would not have honestly cared had he simply told me the truth .the thoughts in my mind were ""has he lied about anything else? Will he lie about anything else? How will I know). 

I tend to pride myself on telling people the truth about what i think, what I'm doing, and how I feel (ironically, this too has ended friendships) just to avoid lying to them. And I often would rather someone break me down with the truth than to spare me with a little. 

How can I get over this flaw of not being able to trust people? Ive started dating this girl for about a month now and I can start feeling my mistrust with people effecting how I view her. Its not that she has done something to garner that mistrust, but because i never fully know if she's telling the truth. I dont want to be the ""snooping person"" (I have done this once before admittedly, and besides getting hurt it simple did not feel good doing so). 

Has anyone experienced this level of mistrust with everyone? How do you trust in the things people say without any form of physical proof to it? How did you eventually get over not needing that proof and just being to trust someone? 

Tldr: I have insane trust issues and want help in how to deal with it.",16Aug2020,1
702,"I’m just here tryna figure my life out..

I share a car with my long term boyfriend but things are no longer working out. I want to cut ties with him, but as bad as it sounds I need the car that we share. It is in his name but I make the monthly payments of ($420) while he covers the insurance. We used to live together but I moved out a couple months ago to give us both some space so I use the car weekdays for work while he has it weekends. If I break up with him I of course have to give the car back. 

I live in the Dallas area and there is no bus to take me to/ from work. I live 16 minutes away and according to all my math cannot do Uber or Lyft. I also can’t afford a car and currently have bad credit thanks to the pandemic hitting me hard and no answer from unemployment. It’s also 100 degrees out every day so biking is out of the question. 

I know it’s wrong to stay with a man for a car which is why I’m trying to figure this out ASAP. Do I get a cheap moped..? I can’t afford to move right now or break my lease and I just got this new job as an assistant teacher so I don’t want to search for a new gig.

703,"I’m sorry for my shit formatting I’m just so angry right now. Also this is my first post on Reddit. I want to become a better ally in the black lives matter movement and I do not agree with anything my mother has done.


So I (F15) am pretty sure my mum (F47) is a racist, because she supports all lives matter and has said the N word with a hard R twice in my presence. Once while we were eating dinner at home and the second after we ate dinner in a pub today. She also has used micro aggressions. 

Now for context I live in a place where there are a lot of people who are of the Islam faith and who are POC. Me and my family is white.

An example of her micro aggressions happened this week, we went to a fabric shop that had white employees. When we visited my Nan ( Lockdown rules where I am have eased up and have allowed to to see people in their homes) after my mum said said something along the lines of “the shop wasn’t run by Asians”. 

When we were at the pub we got into an argument about her saying the N word and she called me sensitive. 

I want to educate her on why what she says and does is racist but I don’t want to have a shouting match with her. Right now she’s acted like nothing has happened and it frustrates me to no end.

705,"I created this Reddit account on 08/16/2020. I did it on impulse because I feel a change tugging at my sleeves. I'm having trouble formulating and expressing my thoughts so please bear with me as I try my best to articulate this.

If you would like to know the back story on why this is important to me here it is, be warned its pretty long.

&gt;!I am now 26 years old and for the past 3 years I've been through a lot. I've matured a bit here and there and really found my self worth. I've learned to accept myself and with that I've found satisfaction. For most of my life I've lived for others, it wasn't until I was 23 that I consciously tried to live for myself. This is because I had my first real relationship at 23, it wasn't a monumental thing but it brought me happiness and I felt satisfied for the first time. I wont get into the details of it but please know that it truly did uplift me. When I think back towards that time I realize that I was so...mundane, and when it came to me and what I thought of the world and my place in it I felt so incomplete. I've dealt my own internal struggles for most of my life. I struggled with things that were so fundamental to someone's sense of self, things like self value, emotions, goals, wants, needs, ect. I believe that this was me holding myself back, and I didn't feel like I had the potential to do or make something with myself, so therefore I was just existing, and because I was just existing I was just worthless and would end up alone, because of that apathy I never made any effort, luckily I was very wrong about myself!!&lt;

&gt;!The relationship I mentioned earlier was never perfect and despite being a great person she was the worst person to have in my life. I won't get into details so I'll do my best to summarize it, she and I were 2 broken and lost people who found closure in each other but did not progress. This relationship was very fickle we would be on and off for months and each time I was devastated...especially in the beginning. During our first ""break up"" I tried to erase myself from the world, I hadn't realized the blessings I was so fortunate to have at the time and I tried to make my environment match what I felt inside which was loneliness. This despair took a toll on me mentally as I had so many things happen in such a short amount of time and I ended up isolating myself. During my isolation I  began having those self-depraving thoughts I always struggled with and I began pushing myself down like I normally did because I loathed myself. I was 23 with no aspirations in life, no motivation, no drive, and everything I did up at that point was solely to be someone else, I wanted to be this idealistic person that I would never accept to be me. This was the lowest point of my life and I had finally hit the bottom, and I felt myself shatter into pieces and this was my sink or swim moment. Thankfully, I persevered and decided to analyze my actions and how I got to this point. I would put a lot of thought into everything about myself over the course of my life and chose to try and understand myself. I found it jarring that I felt like I was a stranger in my own mind...I didn't know anything. This was the first step in a long journey on learning about myself.  I was slow at first, but I learned how to identify my emotions and I would ponder for days on why I felt how I felt and how I got to that emotion as a result. Through trial and error I slowly made a solid foundation on how I viewed myself and I started to get a handle on my emotions. I wasn't perfect but it was enough to get me to push further.!&lt;

&gt;!Eventually I got to the point that I felt like I was 3 different people, my mind, my heart, and who I've been. Over the course of a year and a half I felt like I could finally say I knew who each one of those people were, but I never felt like they were all the same person. I never felt one to one with each of them, but I felt satisfied with my growth and generally felt more positive and this was enough. Unfortunately I stalled, and despite the accomplishment and the advancements I was making I couldn't get out of bed. I began skipping work, and school and I just didn't want to function anymore and I couldn't figure out why. Despite all the my research on myself I didn't understand what was happening to me, I couldn't find an answer. I eventually came to the conclusion that I was clinically depressed and decided to see a therapist to verify it. We talked about a lot of things and we made a few break throughs and it honestly felt so good to be able to talk to someone who had no influence on my life. He never diagnosed me with anything and with his help I eventually felt closer to combining this fragmented person that I was. As more things happened in my life I began to just improve and started to have more epiphanies about how I treated myself.!&lt;

&gt;!At this point it had been 2 years since I had hit rock bottom and I finally came to the realization that I never considered myself or put my emotions first. I felt like this was the year to do it as my relationship with this person had hit its peak and it we were both at a crossroad. I had always held myself back because I felt like she was also on that brink that change I had a few years prior and I wanted her to come with me on that path of self improvement. Unfortunately life had other plans for me and she disappeared again. I was a much stronger person this time around and felt no regrets because I had truly put my all into us. All the lessons and hardships over the years held me together during that lonely period and I just pushed forward. At this point I was working at my job for a few years and decided to take a break from school because I realized I was just going to school because I felt like I had to not because I wanted to. I decided to try to get a promotion at my job in order to commit to my potential that I knew I had. Unfortunately I wasn't seeing any progress at that company and I picked up a big opportunity at another place and I decided to pour everything I had into it. I wanted a career I just didn't know what type and I had a plan to figure it out. A few more unfortunate things happed in my life that had me needing my old schedule and I decided to continue my plan but at the old place I worked. After 6 months I achieved a promotion at my old job and my ex had came back. It was the same routine between us, she made mistakes and I listened, our old love for each other kept us in each others lives despite us not being good for each other. Things seemed different this time though, because she was putting a lot of effort into me and in some big changes in her life. I won't go into details, but things fell through and for the first time I was the one who broke it off with her. I had more respect for myself and I felt that she didn't love me the same way that I loved her. I decided to stop holding myself back and follow that tug for change at its full pace. I was down for while but picked myself up like I always do and got into my routine. For the first time in my life I felt like I found my rhythm, and I was making some small strides towards things with work and personal relationships, I am much happier now and I feel complete, I feel like that 3 people from before became one and I'm that result. Which brings me to why I'm writing this post, I want advice on how I should go about moving forward.!&lt;

I'm at a crossroads and I feel that tug for change still and I want to do more. I want to have motivation, results, and I want to grow bigger! I feel so small right now, but in a good way because I see the man I can become, hell I know I'm a great man now and I'm so damn proud of myself...so damn proud. I want to accomplish and conquer more that just myself! I want to do great things, and I know I had a bit of a late start but 26 is still so young and I'm happy I found myself now. I have so many wants and I don't know how to go about them. I don't know if I'm just feeling good right now in the moment but my routine these past few days has changed a bit. I'm doing more than just lying in bed watching videos and working. I want to work out, eat better, lose weight, travel, write a story, draw, take pictures, take care of my family, pay my bills I want to do it all and I feel like I can! I feel so close to it and I don't want to keep being wishy washy about it, I don't like being inconsistent with it I want to constantly feel what ever I'm feeling until I die.

707,"Almost of the friends I've made, all from different places and circles over the years, have come to the conclusion that my mother is toxic and abusive, usually after witnessing a phone call between us in which she is raging or after I share some things about her.

But countless people, nearly all of my close friends over the years, my boyfriends, my own father, my friend's dad, even people I don't know that well, have come to dislike the way my mom treats me and say they think she is highly abusive and that she is controlling my life and that I need to cut ties with her or at least move out and contact her as little as possible.

709," Ok so since this summer, there has been a change in my family home life. My mother in law, her daughter, and her daughter  (Mother in-law, Sister in-law, and Niece in-law) all live in my house now with me, my husband and my cat.

Since this big move, we have had a lot of little arguments, regarding  everything from how to clean the dishes, to ""we should use place mats on the kitchen table"".  These arguments are normal for any family I suppose.

But one thing that kind of confused me is WHY does my mother in-law brag about her ""boyfriend"" from Germany? He has a wife and 3 adult children, but he talks to her daily such as ""good morning beautiful"" and ""I made you  breakfast"" (and shows her a picture of food he has made). He sent her an  actual ORCHID to my house. This is creeping me out, she gave him MY home address to a stranger that I have never met, and she has never physically met. Why does she do this and brag about it?

Yes she is divorced. He is not divorced. She is originally from Venezuela btw and 68 years old, and he lives in Germany I have no idea how old he is.

Is  this normal? I keep my mouth shut most of the time, some time I even respond with ""you flirt"". But I am actually uncomfortable by this.

713,"Posting this on a throwaway because I’m not sure if he has Reddit or not. If he does, I don’t know what he’d do if he found out it was me.

My dad is a bit hard to explain. I don’t know what goes on in his brain, so I’ll just list the things he does. I don’t know if any of this actually counts as abuse or anything, which is why I’m posting in the first place-


- He’s strict and says so, but he goes overboard sometimes. He gets angry at every little thing, whether we have proof it was an accident or not.

- Refuses to admit he’s wrong. He only sees things his way and forces it on me and my siblings no matter what our view on something is.

- I’m trans, he hates when I correct him on my pronouns and tells me to stop, but I correct everyone and they usually get it. Not my dad.

- He lies to make himself look good. He used to physically abuse me when I was younger for little things. He never used a belt or anything, just his hands. But it still hurt like hell. My siblings can confirm. I was recently in the hospital for a panic attack and when we were filling out a sheet for a psych ward, there was a question that asked if I had ever been physically abused. I read the questions aloud and when I got to that one, he quickly said ‘no’ and stared at me with a scary look in his eye. It scared me, so I wrote down ‘no’. 

- He puts my problems down as teenage angst and says I just act out for attention. A good example of this is when I had that panic attack mentioned earlier, he brushed it off as me doing it for attention. For a half an hour.

- I think he knows he’s threatening. When I tried leaving the house a few times because I couldn’t take his yelling, he kept saying “Don’t you dare leave this house” and things like that. I was scared he was going to hit me again, so I never left and hid in my room.

I (M15) live with my dad
I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. This is only because my dad caused a panic attack which put me in the hospital for a bit, then to a psych floor. While I was having the panic attack, he kept saying that I’d stop when I wanted to because I was just doing it for attention. He likes to yell a lot and act like a saint for it, saying it was just his job as a parent. But he takes it a bit too far. I was also physically abused as a younger kid but he has stopped, although he makes me feel like he is going to hit me sometimes.

- He does this weird mood swing thing where one second, he’s berating me about something I left in the living room on accident. If he gets me to start crying (which is often) he immediately switches gears and tries comforting me like nothing ever happened. It’s creepy and a lot of the time, it works, which makes it worse.

I think he’s the reason I have anxiety and depression. He second-guesses every action I do like I’m just a little kid who thinks I know everything. But I don’t. I know that. But he treats me like a child while giving me adult responsibilities. I’m a teenager, I’m not a child. I’m turning 16 in a few months, but I feel like I’m turning 12. I just can’t handle it anymore. I want to go back to living with my mom who’s across the country. 

I don’t think I can do anything legally since I don’t have any physical evidence. I don’t know what to do. I want to sneak out but he has cameras and I’m afraid he’s going to call the police, even if I leave a note saying where I’m going. 

I need your help, Reddit. I don’t know what to do and if I can escape it. I don’t even know if what he’s doing now is abuse, but I hate it. So much.",16Aug2020,1

I'm transgender (FTM, I changed since my last post). This whole situation is really tricky because my uncle lost one of his daughters recently. I really want to be there for them and support them and that's partially why me and my mom moved here. I especially want to see my little cousins because I think an older cousin figure could be really good for them.

 My uncle won't let me be around his kids without calling me by my deadname and my old prounouns because it'd be too confusing for them. I asked if I could explain it to him and he hasn't responded to my text. He said through my mom he wanted to talk to me in person about it. I really didn't want that at the time cause I kinda had a shitty coming out expierence and I didn't want another person telling me it was just a faze. 

I've been talking to my mom about it and she's said a lot of things about my uncle that just makes me think he'll never change his mind. ""He's always been an asshole to us. He's super stubborn he won't change his mind. He's always been like this, He won't change. He said that you not wanting to hear your deadname was dramatic"" Including stories about him being a dick to my family.

It's just the thing is that we moved across the ocean to support his family.  It just really pisses me off because I want to see my little cousins so badly. But hearing my deadname and being called she is really dysphoric to me. 

I think it'd be even more confusing for them to call me by my deadname and my old prounouns now though. Because I look like a boy!!! I think my uncle is just being stubborn because he can.

720,"I went to see my boyfriend at his family house in a little village in Spain. As the weather was nicer tonight we decided the both of us to go for a walk. As we were walking at the outside skirt of the little village we came across a kind of made up cage were inside was the sweetest dog. He was in a horrible state, very bony, his fur was very dusty, some kind of mould was forming on his ears. He was the sweetest dog, just completely letting himself being pet and craving it so much. I think he was blind or at least have a terrible view ( he wasn't looking at me in the eyes but just was following the sound of my voice). His water was full of leaf and dirt.

When we arrived home I immediately asked his family about this poor little dude and if we could do anything about it. They told me that he used to be a hunter dog and the owner was an asshole. Because it's little village there's always this wise elderly man who everybody respect. And they asked him years ago if they could adopt they dog, but he just answered that it wouldn't be appropriate and not something you ask. It's just breaking my heart to see this poor sweet dog dying away while his ""owner"" don't give a damn because for him it's just a dog that is not working properly anymore so he don't have any use of it anymore but just blankly refused to give it away. 

The problem is because his family his the only one to have taken an interest in the dog if any authorities were to come to take a look and something happens, the whole village would understand that they are the one who contacted the police (its a small village, were word travel fast and people judge easily)

726,"Okay so this will be very all over the place but here it goes

Me (18f) and my dad's gf's and her kids went on vacation to her mom's place in a different city for a week. They have a really big family which I'm just getting used to, but I have pretty bad anxiety especially in social settings.

Now to the point: there was this guy (C) who I met a few times already but never really spoke a lot. He is 22 and an university student, the only person around my age in that family. 

For some reason we talked a lot in the beginning of the week, and he ended up taking me motorbiking but like not in a romantic way, you know.
This is when I kinda started to have a crush on him and later found out we have plenty of things in common which was really cool.

Yesterday, the last day of our stay, we had a big birthday party for some of their relatives and C and his family was also there obviously. Everybody got pretty fucking drunk eventually, and C and I talked a lot during the afternoon and I really enjoyed it honestly, but because I wasn't sober either (nor was he) I started flirting with him and we had a pretty good time.

After most of the people left, a few of us stayed outside for a mini party, aka getting even more hammered. Everything was cool, we shared our movie lists, sent eacother songs, checked out spotify playlist, and so on.

C and his dad decided to leave as it was well past 3AM at that point. I had the amazing idea to walk them home as it was just a street away, and so I did. We arrived, his dad went upstairs and C and I stayed in the garage talking. It's worth to note that it was really flirty at that point and I was really deep in this crush thing.

I decided to leave around 4AM, and he insisted to walk me home, how great I thought, and it was. When we arrived everybody was already sleeping so we stayed outside to talk some more, and things lead to another and somehow I built up all my courage to ask him if I can kiss him, which was kinda awkward but he was happy about it and so we made out for a while, then I went to sleep and he left.

My problem is that I have no idea what to do now, we didn't meet after that and now I'm at home, still confused about how the hell did I get that confident to do that? But also I would like to keep talking to him and keep in touch but I really don't know how he feels about the whole thing.

I feel bad that I will be 25 and essentially starting over at my moms. I was venting to my bff the good and bad.

She is however, doubtful I will be self sufficient and feels I wont grow as a person living under my mother. She thinks I have been coddled too much and need to grow up and get my own apartment. My mother is quite religious/strict but, I will and I'm saving what little I have for a few months first. She calls me every day to do instacart (shopping for other people) even though she knows I cant because Im waitlisted (too many applicants). And sends me how much money she makes in screenshots. 

We have this same conversation everyday then hangs up saying she feels sorry for me. She says it is to motivate me, I guess. At this point I feel like I will always be behind my peers. Buying houses and getting married. When my partner turned out to be a monster. Im trying to find a better job but its been slow. Someone please give me advice on what I could do to move forward in life?

We had decided too take a trip too my old house where I was born and raised and stayed over with my friend and his family which consisted off his dad (who was dating my mother) and his two younger brothers (4,6) now at the time I was a complete beta. I was very insecure and therefore I kinda just took a lot of shit. This isn’t very relevant to the story though.

I can understand and apparently she told my mum 6 months later. She broke up with my friends father and this was never mentioned too me. Now decades after, she’s gotten the courage too tell me.

It’s not necessarily sex with him, but sex in general. To clarify, I’m NOT asexual. I get horny, can masturbate, but I just don’t enjoy sex. I find sex incredibly uncomfortable and often painful. Because of this, we very rarely have sex. The longest we have ever gone without having sex is almost 10 months. We have tried a lot of different positions but all are uncomfortable at best. We use lube, but it doesn’t really make a difference. I went to my gyno to make sure nothing was wrong with me, but she said everything was normal. 

My boyfriend recently sat me down and told me we have to figure out a solution because it’s the only area in our relationship he feels unfulfilled in. He basically said it’s the only issue in our relationship he ever considers leaving me over. He said over time it’s become more of an issue but he feels bad bringing it up because it feels like he’s coercing me.

A few things to mention before I get started, I'm in a LDR. I have currently unspecified (by my psychiatrist) mental illness(es). I moved in with my father in April to get on my feet and save money so I can have a head start on life. On to the story.

I deleted all of my social media excluding Reddit. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, etc. I did this because my father continuously chews me out over not saving enough money, not doing chores everyday while he's away for work, not going outside and doing things (""living life"" according to him), and the like. He says I can't possibly be happy sitting in my room on my phone or playing video games and that I'd be happier if I went out and did things. He blames my social media and my partner for my not doing much. Part of me feels like he's right and that all my problems are because of my addiction to this phone. So I messaged all my friends, told them I ""would be gone for a while"", that I was sorry, and deleted everything. My partner is currently asleep, he will wake up to a message saying my goodbyes to him and I feel guilty about it. My heart hurts leaving my friends and partner behind. I don't know if what I did was the right thing. Feel free to ask questions because I'm sure I left some vital information out. Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.

753," 

So a bit ago someone was going through a tough time and I decided to try and help. They described a long distance relationship that did not sound positive to me so I talked to them and something along the lines of ""if I were you I would break that relationship off because it's not a give give relationship. Just a give take."". So they ended up breaking up. I stood beside the person and was there for them while they recovered from the break. Then I realized that After a while I was starting to flirt with the person. So I went to a friend and said "" I don't know if I should investigate this further. because I am moving away from \*place\* two \*places\* and I don't want to put them in a relationship like a long distance one because they aren't great for people and I don't want to make them sad or leave them feeling unhappy you know? if that makes sense "" as I did not want to ask them to potentially burn themselves again as I thought it was inconsiderate of me. The friend told me that \*Person\* liked me back.

Then my friend then said that they also liked the person. I decided then that I would try and step back as I felt like everything was moving too fast with me moving being decided in less than three days changing everything I thought. Then it hit me that I don't even know what gender I am(it had been something I had been pushing away because it scared me to think about and I hate thinking about it). So I something along the lines of ""I will back off because I did not know who I even was. Please help me make a message to them so that I don't just seem like an egotistical person who assume everyone loves them"" because at that time it was going through my head that I only know they like me because friend told me something \*Person\* told them in confidence. So we made the message and it ended up as

"" Hey so this is an important thing that I really am sorry for potentially not making stuff clear. So over the past few days it feels like I might have been sending mixed signals and I want to try and clear some stuff up. So thing is I think I like you as more then a friend which is really confusing me as recently I have been questioning both my gender and current sexuality as I don't know whether what I am today is what I want to be tomorrow. And that is something that I need to figure out before going into anything. So I am hoping we can be friends. As I really value and enjoy the time we spend together. It is awesome to be able to be there for you and have that trust from you. And while we might not be progressing the relationship to something like bf and gf. I am hoping we can still progress and grow as strong friends despite my mixed messages. ""

I sent it and \*Person\* started messaging friend who said that \*Person\* was distraught and hurt. And that they felt they couldn't help. So I messaged \*Person\* explaining things. And we talked. And by the end if it seemed fine. And I felt like it ended well as we talked for about ten hours after. And it felt happy. But then in the morning we don't talk like we normally. And when I joined discord it just felt like I was unwanted and they sounded sad. So I asked if they were alright and they said they were. I then got hit with a wave of depression and anxiety and felt like I needed to be sad so I left the call.

I was thinking about my gender and spiraling as I started to panic and hate myself. So I sent out a message to \*Person\* who we both were anchors for each other's mental health. Saying "" I am sorry for wasting your time. I am sorry"". As I my brain was telling me ""if they care about you at all they will respond."" and the only respond I got was from friend saying "" but i don't think you trying to talk to \*Person\* at the moment will work. Please give them sometimes that would make me sound like a mean person "" I just feel like dying and I want to give up. This is the second time this has happened last time I lost everyone. and it just feels like such a better option to disappear and never come back.

Slip ups caused only by his medical conditions. He was on and off of depression and anxiety meds and whenever his doctor upped the dosage he had a few episodes where he either doesn’t remember what he did (ruined my companies Xmas party being blacked out) or sleep walks and ends up peeing somewhere nowhere near the bathroom itself. And it’s draining me what he’s doing. For 98% of the time he is perfectly fine. He’s working hard to make money for us, got promoted twice in a few months. We hang out most of the time because of the pandemic keeping us in. But then I feel like I’m always looking out for him. He’s also not great at picking up after himself or just sucks in general of doing the dishes and I have to re do them. I feel like I’m mom for him. Granted his own mother wasn’t around like she should’ve been but he’s 32. And I’m not taking care of me. I always have one eye open on him to make sure he gets his sleep at night because when he doesn’t, he’s not in his right mind and the following night usually has some sort of repercussions. Like twitchy sleep, sleep all day long, or pissing in my hallway. These instances are super rare but it’s enough to cause me to be unhappy.

We went back and forth and she started talking about how I was a burden, a leech, I always cause issues and that she couldn’t wait until I was 18 so I can move out and get treated like shit and she used a word that triggers me a lot. I have a lot of mental issues and it doesn’t allow me to do a lot around home but nobody wants to go get me help even though I’ve begged.

760,"The title pretty much sums up the idea, but I also wonder if that makes me an AH. I've been conflicted on that topic for years now.

I graduated from high school three years ago, I still struggle to make real friends (social and generalised anxiety) but there's this guy I've known since middle school. He's nice and all but I've never felt that close to him, and ever since we both left middle school he's been pursuing friendship with me, texting me every few months or more and asking how I'm doing etc in a very attentive way. We hung out a couple times and it was nice but I just feel like we don't live in the same world anymore (we grew up and stuff happened to each of us) and I'm not sure whether I want to connect with him as much as he does. It's just awkward and I used to think he had a crush or sth which I did not want to deal with.

He's done nothing to deserve a bad treatment, I insist on that, and I really feel bad about not feeling like being his friend, especially since he has tough times and a sometimes poor mental health just like me. And he is the only person who actively tries to be my friend after all these years. Sometimes tho he just wants to talk about his mental health and I'm not strong enough on that topic to be that kind of friend to him... I helped him reach out to professional help but I guess he wants me to be part of his support system, and that's flattering but I'm not sure.
I feel guilty and hypocritical for avoiding his company and trying to implicitly tell him that I don't want to be his friend, when I try and be friends with pretty much everyone I meet (unsuccessfully).

So, should I give him other chances? How? Or, if that doesn't happen, how can i gently and kindly show him how i feel?",16Aug2020,1

This happened few days ago, I was having college exams and could not have much distractions because I had to study a lot, my boyfriend decided to come to my home town (we are in a distance relationship) without telling me anything and called my mother to stay with her( me and my mother were not connected at this time,she had a huge fight with my father and decided to move out ) he knew my mom and my dad were mad at eachother and still came,he stayed at her place eating,going to work with her and the worse happened when he had his room to sleep and decided in the middle of the night to move to her room and asked her to sleep there, he even felt comfortable enough to sleep just in his underwear near her. I’m still in shock with this situation, I didn’t know about this ,my mom told me about it because she felt uncomfortable and bothered with his presence .

780,"I have a close friend (we're both 17 y/o) that is a generally nice person and a good friend, but at times can appear as socially inept, tactless and unaware of himself. I won't go into detail concerning this, but the weird things that he does are fairly few and far between, and he does take attention when someone mentions it to him and tries to get better, which is fantastic.

In the past, he sent me a message out of nowhere saying that his dog was going to the vet. Apparently she ate aluminium foil that was dropped on the floor by a family member at a gathering, and she was in very intensive care (she's fine now). I was a bit flustered that he just sprung this onto me randomly, but after additional thought I realized he might be restless and worried and wanted someone to talk to, so I comforted him and supported him how I could.

Today, he sends me a message, again, out of nowhere about how he and his dad went bike riding, and his dad got injured (moderately injured) and said that he's fine now. It was kinda weird since I thought he usually sends these kinds of random messages for emotional support but if his father is fine afterwards, why even send it at all? It made me feel obligated to respond with something empathetic but It felt very forced to do so as his dad is fine right now. In the end I messaged him ""Well, I'm glad your dad is doing fine now!"" or something along those lines.

I'm kind of uncomfortable with displaying much emotion, same with complimenting someone. I am capable of genuinely recognizing a good thing someone did/had but there are times where I feel like saying something is unnatural and forced, and that I just appeal to the social norm since others ""expect a compliment"", while trying to seem humble when receiving it. It's worth mentioning that I DO compliment people, but usually on things that I hold in higher value than things like appearance, grades, materialistic things etc...

This is kind of tangential to the story but I thought it helps to understand my position this way. What should I have done? It seems to me like he's messaging me these things for attention. I'm positive he's not doing this out of a shallow reason but I can't help but think about if I'm in the right for being uncomfortable about these kind of messages.

782,"TLDR - My older brother that still lives with my parents, is so unpleasant to be around that my SO and I feel like we can't visit my parents, one of which is terminally ill, if he is around - and he always is. How do I approach my parents about not wanting him around?

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be a long one folks so sorry in advance. Part venting but also providing as much information as I can for clarity.

So a bit of backstory for context - my parents are in their early 70's, and my father has stage 4 melanoma that has spread to his brain, lungs, and other organs. My brother is nearly 30 and still lives with them despite having a salary that would easily allow him to live independently. Due to my father's illness they recently had to sell their home (brother and I's childhood home) and move into a rental house; my brother moved with them too. My SO and I have a house about 10 minutes away from them and we're both 26. Given my father's deteriorating health, its really important to me to be able to spend time with my parents in a pleasant and joyful atmosphere. I've was always closer to my dad than my brother was, and I know he desperately misses having me around more frequently.

So my brother and I have never really gotten along, and he has always had some social / behavioral issues, but the past few years he has become so unpleasant to be around that both my SO and I don't want to spend time with my parents because he is always there. He has developed some pretty extreme ideological standpoints, believes troubling conspiracy theories, and holds pretty clearly misogynistic / racist / generally hateful ideas. As much my SO and I disagree with his views / political stances, that isn't why he is so unpleasant to be around. We both are politically engaged and frequently discuss and debate issues with people that we don't agree with. Hell, the first time my SO and I spent time together it was with the intention to talk politics, she being a Republican campaign consultant at the time, and me identifying more with the Progressive movement. So I would describe us as being capable of being civil and discussing differing viewpoints.

My brother is the type of person that drains all the energy from the room when he walks in. He is generally very sullen, contrarian, and angers quickly resulting in physical outbursts. When he is around it feels as though you are walking on eggshells in regards to what is said and how it is said to avoid setting him off. The way he ""discusses"" things is raising his voice, being forceful and hostile in tone, and genuinely insulting with the extent that he deflects or disregards other people. There is no  genuine attempt to analyze what anyone is saying to him, no willingness to empathize with other's experiences, or consider how things affect people other than himself. What he reads from various websites and forums and what he believes are the absolute truth and always correct, and perceives any challenge / fact check / disagreement with those things as a personal attack or criticism of him - making him even more hostile and aggressive. Eventually after enough ""perceived attacks against him"" all semblance of communication breaks down and he begins shouting about how everyone thinks hes a terrible person and usually stomps back to his bedroom and slams the door.

The obvious approach should be avoiding discussing anything political around him. But unfortunately he is often the one to bring up something that is politically charged, often conspiratorial or very controversial. Plus politics are a significant portion of our lives, and something that is really important to talk about given what is going on in the US / around the world. Another approach is meeting up with my parents somewhere for dinner without him, which we used to do. Due to COVID and my father's vulnerability that isn't really possible anymore. My father has been in and out of the hospital for months due to seizures caused by necrotic brain tissue from radiation treatments and surgeries, so its important that he has all his medications and walker / equipment around, making it hard to go out even if COVID wasn't a issue. As awful as he can be sometimes, hes still my brother and family, so it feels wrong to ask him not to be present. That is all I can think of though, I want to be able to spend time with my parents in a positive way.

If you've made it this far, thank you. Please feel free to give any criticisms / call me out if you feel like I'm in the wrong on something. Tried to write this out as objectively as possible...but its not always easy.",16Aug2020,1

I can understand that it's unpleasant to have snot in your nose, but can't he just go into the bathroom and do it, or at least blow his nose? We've told him that he needs to stop, but he doesn't listen. He just sticks his finger in his nose and picks around for a few seconds, and then wipes the snot on the underside of a table or something. It's really annoying when he does that.

He also watches a lot of TV. During the weekend, he spends literally the whole day watching TV, eating snacks and drinking milk and soda straight out of the container. He also farts really loud. It's so embarrassing, especially when my friends come over or someone like an exterminator is in the house. His farts are so gross; they sound like a combination of a tuba, an airhorn, and a toad croaking. I feel scared when he farts, because he releases tons of harmful chemicals into the air each time he farts.

The other bad thing my dad does is fart non-stop. He often just sits on the toilet for close to half an hour each time, farting really loud. I try so hard not to vent my anger on others when he farts that loud. He also drinks a lot of iced coffee and eats a lot of cheesy foods, which probably makes him gassy.

When he is taking a shower, he farts super loud. He spends almost an hour in the shower, and he throws his dirty razor on the shower floor. He sings off-pitch while farting 100 times each minute. It's so gross, and I just don't know what to do. Then during the day, he just sticks his hands down his pants and taps his rear end. I don't even know why he does that.

I want to buy nice clothes and get nice makeup, as well, but I'm waiting until I get skinny so I know the right sizes to get and which makeup fits my face best. 


The only issue is, my family is super judgemental. If they notice that I'm trying to fix my appearance, they'll mock me for not doing it right or that I'm trying to hard and it's cringy. It makes me very anxious. I want to be better looking, but I don't want everyone to focus on it either, especially my family.

Obviously I know counseling and meds are #1, I just started prozac and I see a counselor next week. I just want to know what other people in my shoes have done. My PTSD is so bad from my relationship. We are back together (smart move, I know, but we have a baby together), he's done a complete 180 from how he used to be (see post history) and is a wonderful partner now. My sister is a licensed therapist and says I may need to leave him before I can get better. I am constantly dizzy, have hyperadrenergic POTS presumably from the PTSD and I am pretty much in a constant state of panic and dissociation. I just want to know if anyone else has been through something similar and what they did to fix it? I don't want to leave him, I'd like to stay with him if at all possible, but I have a child and right now it's incredibly difficult to be a mother.",16Aug2020,1
793,"Me and my roomate are both 19 and were friends for 5 years before moving in together after school. She has a friends with benefits situation with her ex and today she got a positive pregnancy test. She has told me before that if she ever got pregnant she wouldnt want to move in with him and for him to not be a primary figure in the babies life. He would most likely help out in some ways but she doesnt feel he is responsible or emotionally available enough to take care of a child. 

We have talked about what if situations before and she has always wanted me to be apart of the babies life as a sort of uncle (she compared me to uncle Joey from full house). I have always wanted to help out if anything happened but I dont know if I'm prepared to deal with living with a baby. I know if I am in the house I will have a responsibility to the baby and I dont know if I'm ready to handle that kind of responsibility. I also dont want to leave her alone and I want to be there for her since she is upset about it right now. 

Sorry this was kind of all over the place I've panicked a little.",16Aug2020,1

But after my internship period was over, my supervisor told me he would like me to work for a bit longer. With college starting and everything, I would like to get some money to buy groceries and pay off debt. I won't be asking much ($10 an hour) because of the economic crisis going on (and my company took a hit financially from the pandemic). I'm planning to say that I bring value and assistance worth at least $10 an hour but is there anything else I should say? Thank you all in advance.",16Aug2020,1

She wants to continue to live in her home with my sister f32 and her husband and 3 children. My sister will get that home when my mother passes.

The issue is I live 2 hours away from them and the house that will be mine and my mother states I have to do all yard work, clean and remove all the family friends stuff now. In the mean time my mother has started saying ""you need to come down here and help get all this stuff out so I can sell it. Then I will buy a house on a cliff side"" my mother is not mentally all there. She makes big plans with big money that she often doesn't have. Where the house is a big house that could sell for a lot. I'm afraid she will have me work hard to maintain a home that she will sell as a down payment for a house and when she passes it will leave me with a mortgage. I'm also nervous if I decide not to help she will also sell and won't leave me anything. So I'm not sure what to do.",16Aug2020,1

800,"So long story short, a year ago my brother passed away at 27. His fb is set up so that any comments to his timeline are private. So anything I wrote to him, for instance, in 2009, I can’t see even in my memories on fb. A lot of our rel is filled with inside jokes and silly comments we left each other.

When he passed away I went on his fb and logged in, and started making it an almost daily thing that in the morning I check his fb memories to see if we have any. At least once a week there’s something that makes me smile or reminds me of something about him. 

My mom found out, and told me that her, my older brother and my dad decided we can only look at it together once a year on the day he passed away. They changed the pw and said they were offended I had access to it. They had access and my parents knew the pw. So I don’t get why me seeing his fb memories matters if I do it to help cope with his loss ya no? I don’t go showing people, or anything like that. 

But on his death bed he tried giving me his pw to his phone, I just forgot it due to the intense emotions and circumstances. I regret forgetting it alllll the time. This kinda helped since I feel like he was giving me permission so it’s not about his privacy ya no, he already accepted I’d look at it all. I think he knows how sentimental i am. He knew I’d feel sad about it. And i would def want him to have the same access if i passed away. 

Anyway I get it tho. They’re his parents. They also just naturally have a need for control since becoming parents and this brings control over my brother and I’s life in a way. I certainly don’t expect that trait to go away at this time, esp with the loss of a child in a way they had no control over. 

While i will not keep asking and complaining. And i will respect that i no longer have access, i can’t pretend i agree with their choice. So I told them I disagree with it and that if it helps me cope they shouldn’t make it so I can only cope that way, with them present, once a year. ESP since they lived with him so they can go in his room, read his books, look at his songs he wrote, etc. The point is that it’s a daily activity and reminder of his life...and also the point is that I would have told them if I thought there was a chance I could do it without them grasping for control. Was I wrong? I see I was in some ways but I also see how much I wanted to see at least a year of memories, so that then i can see a full year...which literally woulda been in a couple months. I know It sounds like I’m being too much but this 2 min activity was helping me with the biggest loss I’ve felt. 

But ok. I just want to accept that I can’t see it and not have them mention it to me again. So simply put, if/when they do, how should i respond in order to not have to explain again that I disagree with their decision to withhold it. They will mention it explaining why i was wrong and i won’t get a chance to fully explain myself, because that’s also rare when having a discussion with them. Once they’re done talking so must i be. 

I don’t want to just agree I’m wrong ya no. I just want to find a way to disengage in the convo politely without losing my sh1t. I take pride in how far I’ve come with them and standing up for myself but I have trouble doing it without knowing how to handle the situation first.",16Aug2020,1

803,"I think I'm going into major depression that I've been ignoring for a long time without realising it. I don't feel good about things I usually enjoyed. 

I don't get good sleep (usually experiencing certain nightmares about things a normal person won't even care about. Like I feel bad about saying things that may or may not have affected others but have started to part away from me. My gaming friends that I don't even know personally have started parting ways from me and gaming was something I truly loved and enjoyed spending my time. I thought losing contact and deleting them is the best way I can find peace and not be treated like shit.) 

I don't eat well (basically loss of appetite). I've stopped enjoying food. My professional life has taken a toss for over a year and half now. I'm not finding a job that I would truly enjoy and been rejected over and over again for certain gap in my work experience. I have I've come to a point that I have started questioning my existence. I don't know what to do. 

I can't concentrate or remember sometimes, when my brain is a memory tank. I could remember any good or bad conversations I've had with any person if I want to. With that sometimes I feel it's a curse because I can't let things go and the stupid memory keeps haunting me.

808,"I've worked for a medium size corporation for just short of a year now. I am the only one in my roll at this company. About three months ago I landed in hot water after a string of poor decisions.  The issue worked its way up HR and into the COO's office where we were able to hash things out, shake hands, and walk away happy. Both parties agreed things were water under the bridge. 

Since then I have laid low, keeping my head down and doing my best at work. I have been very friendly with the other employees as well as management. However; a friend brought to my attention that my job was listed on the popular hiring website 'Ziprecruiter', the post was made last Thursday and is still marked as ""NEW"". (I just found out over the weekend)

There's a VERY small chance that they could be hiring an addition/assistant, but I doubt they would be spending that amount of resources on an employee who has recently been in the hot seat.

How should I approach this? I am a very sensitive person and when stressful things like this happen my work tends to suffer - so I would really like some sort of closure early on in the work week. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",16Aug2020,1
809,"About me: 34, married, with one toddler probably no more, NW ~250k-300k, currently renting in SoCal with aspirations to buy in the next two years

Our combined income is about $225k-$240k (I make about $120k-$130k) and it should grow over the next few years about 3-5% per year, 401k with 4% match, cash balance pension at 7.5% of my income paid by my employer, great benefits

My current job is quite relaxed (prob about 15-20 hours of actual work), stable and guaranteed (utility work), and very low risk of losing it. Travel is pretty minimal. I used to commute in to downtown Los Angeles, but after covid that may never happen again.

My prospective job is with a firm I am very familiar with. They manufacture and install equipment. They are based out of Canada and they want me to be a western USA manager. The base pay would be $150k with about another $100k in bonuses upon project completion (~400% YOY growth), stock purchasing, and other perks. Not sure of the benefits at this point. Probably no where near as stable and guaranteed.

Only con is it is up to 50% travel after the pandemic. With that trade-off in mind, I could buy a much cheaper, larger house closer to my spouse's work and double my income. Wanted others thoughts, what would you do in my situation?",16Aug2020,1
810,"Hi, this is kind of stupid, but I’m really anxious about this. I (17F) have never sat at a dinner table with both of my parents before. Even back when we all lived together, either my mother or my father would be somewhere else during dinner time, and my brother and I would be left to eat with one parent. 

There’s good reason for this, as my father has always been very abusive to my mother and I was exposed to his violence toward her as far as my memory stretches. I associate the early parts of my childhood with blood, gore, curse words, and a lot of screaming. So I’ve always understood why they haven’t been in the same room together for very long anymore. 

My dad has actually been out of state for a while, and I only ever ended up seeing him a court-ordered once a month anyway, so I’ve barely thought about him. 

For reasons unknown to me, my parents have recently decided that we are going out to a nice restaurant to eat together as a family. This is happening tonight and I’m worried about it. 

I guess what I am wondering is, how could I possibly cope with the inevitable awkwardness? I can’t imagine either of them would have something to talk about. I also have a tendency to get nauseous in restaurants when I feel claustrophobic, and I’m concerned that will play a part in this somehow. I’m already anxious thinking about sitting there with them and my younger brother in a few hours. I know I will barely be able to eat my food, and I’ll just be sitting there, waiting for time to pass.

So after I got my pixie cut I decided to come out to my mother about being Bi (no biggie right?). So she asked me why I think I’m Bi and for how long. She seemed very concerned that my friends were influencing me, but let me get something straight (Bi). My friends did not come out until after I did! She kept insisting that my friends were a bad influence and that I’ve changed and how selfish I am. Yes I understand that I’ve been getting so much lately and of course I feel guilty of not being able to pay any of it back.

816,"Hi there. I recently joined this sub and I'm looking for some advice. I'm currently 19, in my second year of college. Since the pandemic started (early march/ late april -ish) schools closed down and they were open up again tomorrow (from the time of writing). Colleges remain closed but highschool and the others will be re-opened. My little sister is supposed to go back to school tomorrow, (starting tomorrow then Tuesday, break for the rest of the week, for the rest of the term) and my mom is supposed to take her there. She's feeling a bit under the weather, feels a bit dizzy in the eyes sometimes, only when she turns her head around. I unfortunately do not have a driver's license as of yet and I want to get mine but I'm not sure what to do with this pandemic in mind, so that I can ease the burden. She feels that I should as well. I can take lessons but the last driving instructor I had suggested that I have a spare Manual car around so that I can practice. We only have an automatic vehicle at the moment so this complicates things a bit.

Sorry if it sounds like I'm rambling but I feel guilty that I don't have my license yet, in the sense where I should have gotten it at 18 already. What do I do? Not sure what I can do to help her. Thanks.",16Aug2020,1
817,"Background info:
I'm 20, single, no ""best friends"" and probably 5 friends (there are people that know me, but I wouldn't classify them as friends),  in college with good grades (meaning my life is school, max of 5 hours free everyday before I have to go to bed) and I spend that eating dinner and working out or rock climbing (my two hobbies).

Idk why but when someone talks to me about 60% of the time I just want the conversation to end. I don't know if I'm just not interested or if I'm a shitty person. It feels like they are just taking up my time. I feel bad because I know I'm supposed to show interest and add to the conversation. To make things worse starting a conversation is practically impossible for me, I find myself walking right by avoiding contact. My attempts at starting one from scratch are useless. I feel like I can function alone perfectly, haven't had a problem yet. And I believe that is my problem. I do just about everything by myself, eat, homework, you name it. I feel like I'm not your average college student, I believe the stigma is staying up until 2 am either playing video games, bingeing Netflix, or Greek life. My reason for the first two is that I don't like wasting my time doing useless things, I'd rather spend my limited time being productive or doing something that makes me happy (which can be Netflix sometimes). And I can't wrap my head around Greek life, I fall short somewhere around the essentially paying for friends part. I rarely talk during the day, I might talk once every hour but that's pushing it. Even typing this is a lot for me, I normally keep to myself and show no feelings or emotion. The only reason I'm doing it is because I just turned 20 and realized that I haven't lived, feels like I've missed out on so much and I feel alone. I can't stand wasting time, I operate on a schedule and try my best to stick to it. I have minimal patience. I dunno what to do, I feel like I'm on a road to die alone. Im surprised I'm not depressed (honestly might be but don't really know what counts as I have been like this as long as I can remember). The only way I've gotten this far is because I think I'm ""strong in the mind"" I dont hold grudges, I don't get angry, where some people comt function alone I just don't need people I see in multiple perspectives to see why people do certain things (not trying to be political but gling to use this example because I just read it, I'm neither Republican or Democrat because they are both too radical for me, so here is my example, on cnn there was an article saying 'stimulus talks are at a complete standstill because of Republicans'(not exact words but this is what I remember the title meaning) this statement is ridiculous, to think that Republicans are stopping this is crazy, CNN is obviously liberal (the fake news not fake just not reported accurately), the other perspective is conservative (stimulus talks are at a complete standstill because Democrats want to change stuff), in reality the truth is somewhere in the middle.

I have trained myself to act like an extrovert in certain situations like with presentations and whatever but I always crash afterwards because it's an act. But lately I haven't been crashing at all. In all honesty ever since quarantine started being away from people makes me feel really sad, lazy and worthless lately and it sucks. ever since quarantine started I've been planning more and more party type things with my friends because I have nothing else to do and I feel like I'm starting to depend on people to bring me joy. My hobbies still bring me joy but it's just a doodle here or there not massive projects like in the past.

823,"I (24M) constantly have this feeling where I have to consume as much as possible with everything I like. I like books so i have to plow through as many books as possible. I like music so i have to listen to every album under the sun. I like video games so i have to play every video game ever made. I like movies so.... well I think you get what im getting at. Its gotten to the point where I can do anything without thinking about the other things I could be doing. I'll be listening to music and thing about how I'm not playing games, or should be listening to a different album. I'll be watching a show and thinking about how I should get around to one of the books I havent started instead. As a result, its just really hard to enjoy anything as much as a could be. It has me constantly thinking about ""whats next"" instead of just enjoying what im doing now.

On top of that, i have so many desires for hobbies that just go unrealized. Such as writing music or making youtube videos. I dont really have any skills to make this a reality however, and a 40h a week grind has me constantly mentally exhausted and just have a hard time working up the smallest desire to grind more with the previous hours of free time i have away from work. When I do this about doing these things i have this massive sense of anxiety over ""what if its the wrong thing to spend my time on"" and just fall into the safe an comfortable, yet not spending time on these things fucking haunts me.

And on top of all that there's the long list of places I wanna go and things I wanna do that'll forever be out of reach until I up my finances, but I get in my own way in that regard too. I'm not a career oriented person, so I've really been limited to entry level shit like fast food and basic factory work my whole life. I know I should go back to school (was in college for programming a few years ago, dropped out because I didn't like it), but I'm worried to go back. If I can't find something to go for that I'm absolutely certain about it feels like a waste. 

I feel so fucking lost, and it feels like I have to use the rest of my ""young years"" to find myself, which also freaks me out. I have ambitions but I'm hopelessly burnt out and lazy. Things are becoming less enjoyable as time goes on, yet I'm scared to lose more time to finding new things. I'm at risk of spending my life working low income jobs that completely bum me out. I feel like my entire life is just going to be feeling depressed over unrealized fantasies.

I feel so fucking hopeless, I've spent years just bitching and bitching about these things to people and im just so fucking bad at applying advice into my life. Maybe its a lack of focus, maybe I'm just some lazy useless fuck, i don't know but I'm sick of it.

Dear redditers, kindly help me, im so desperate for advice


Please help me to know whether im getting the signs right, and how to tell her about my feelings

Long post, but please I need your advice. We are both 25 yo, she is few months older than me.

So it all started 6years ago when we both joined a charity club in our university.

I met this wonderful and full of energy girl , lets call her Emma, who is my age, and i immediately had a crush on her, but i was lacking self confidence and convinced myself that she was way out of my league, but i started to get close to her as a friend. I was fat when i grew up, but now im more fit/muscular, im 6ft, 184lbs, brown eyes and golden brown hair with some facial hair Over the years i just got over her, had many gfs and many hookups.

4 years later, we both had graduated and have very good careers. I got contacted by some of the old members in the club asking me to create a new one, and so did I. I contacted all the old members including Emma ( who was in a relationship back in the time)  and I created a new club. Bonds were getting stronger between everyone in the club and were all going out together all the time. Few months later she broke up with her boyfriend and we started seeing each others more and more.

I was so desperate that I didnt even took the chance to ask her out, but worked it in a way to hide my feelings and ignore them by hooking up with other girls.

Over the time we got very close friends and we started telling each others everything..I even let her decide me which girl to hook up with while we were travelling together with a bunch of friends
And many of our friends thought we were secretly together

With the quarantine, we had limited places to go to, so we started walking together regularly, and she started telling me over the time about how many guys I know wanna go out with her, and it all really made me so jealous. When i was telling her about my hookups and my flings, i had no intentions of teasing her.
One specific time while we were walking she told me about a guy she met few weeks ago and she mentioned him many times, and told me that she gave him a handjob and now he booked them a room for the weekend and that she doesn’t want that at all...this story really hurt me so much and then I realised how deeply im still in love with her and how a douche a I was when i was telling her about the girls i was with:/

Last week she had 2 car accidents, and I got really worried about her, I offered  to pick her up from work and drive her home, on our way, I gave her a nice big box of chocolates and yummy things she likes,
She was surprised anf hugged me and kept thanking me for it, 
Then yesterday, we went for drinks with the same bunch of friends, and i ordered her 2 more drinks, and asked the waiter to put them on a separate bill that i will be paying because I didnt want to make a scene in front of everyone
I offered to drive her back home, but first we decided to driver our friend who lives a bit far away, on our way to her house, we had a wonderful conversation, where we both told each other everything on our mind, but i didnt have the courage to tell her the truth.

I really need your advice, it really hurts me every time I see her I wanna tell her how much I love her, and keep postponing it because im not sure about her feelings and am afraid she had already friendzoned me. How should i react? What should i do?",16Aug2020,1

828,"It all started about 3 months ago, I thought I had life figured out, I had a well-paid job, I moved to a new country, started living alone for almost a year but then I started feeling like something was missing. I think it's just me wanted to be loved and sharing all I have with someone.

It may be me being a bit of an introvert, preferring not to go out, or the previous experiences that drove me to this but I feel that for me it's very hard to speak to women/girls.

The first girl I went out with, was my actual first girlfriend, we have been together for about 3 weeks, but then I had to go abroad to my home country to give my aunt some medicine since she was sick (terminal cancer). One night she messaged me telling me that she went to bed with another guy. (keep in mind, we were just 3 weeks into our relationship, so we didn't consummate, also I was quite young at the time, and since I really liked her I didn't want to push her away).

The second time I went out with a girl, it was in my home country, I've known this girl since middle school, but then I moved to another country and we didn't keep in touch. She actually kissed me, and I was quite surprised when she confessed she had a crush on me. But the second day I found out she was about to get married in 2 weeks.

The third time I went out with a girl, it was a high school crush, I've waited to finish high school to ask her out since I thought it'd be weird to go out with her and see her at school every day. To my surprise she accepted, we went out a couple of times, and I thought it was all going great, but then she told me she had a boyfriend, but would still like to date me. (test boyfriend as she called him).

I don't know how to proceed, I feel sad alone and I don't know if it's because of this or because of other factors. I think I'm the embodiment of what a cuck would be. I sometimes cry myself to sleep.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.",16Aug2020,1
829,"He has a cat that sometimes brings in mice from outside. I guess it really passes him off, because he said that once when he caught one, he threw it out the door as hard as her could, into the forest. This is were I grew concerned. He told me that he once drowned a mouse in a bowl of water. First of all, I wouldn't even consider killing a mouse i found in my house. At most, I would put it outside. Drowning a mouse is just sadistic to me. There are far more humane ways to go about killing a mouse. This was like 7 months ago when he told me this, but someone told me I wouldn't be a bad person if I didn't talk to him about it, but I'm starting to feel guilty again, in case he's killed like hundreds. He also found a rat in his car once chewing on wiring, and he said that if he ever catches it, he's going to throw it against the ground, and watch it suffer.",16Aug2020,1

833,"Hello, I'm a 23 years old male from Dominican Republic. Is no secret that the Covid19 has smashed a lot of plans for everybody.

I finished a 2 years graphic design degree, to graduate and receive my certificate i need to finish an internship, I got one, when the covid began spreading like crazy everyone except me were put to work from home, some weeks later the covid got worse and you know: panic and terror. I live with someone who has underlying conditions, so I asked for more time before going back (It was in April) and the RRHH guy told me that it was ok and that until further information I don't have to go back. It was a relief in the moment because it is an 1 hour trip from my house to there, having to take 2 public transportations, and is utterly disgusting how people behave in this pandemic, don't let me begin. Im SCARED of going outside to do anything (by this date the curve in my country hasn't even reached the peak).

I still need to begin my Biology for education licenciate (My point from the begining was to teach and create educative content for my students, I never had hope to thrive in this country with a GD degree), I dont have the financial means to pay for private college, so I'm going to a public one, in the only available that offers it, the age limit to be admitted is 25 (I'm 23, birthday in July), I can request the admission this year but It may sabotage my internship because i just dont know how the online schedules will work out.

Should I wait for both my licentiate and my internship? Should I write the RRHH guy and try to offer some online solutions to work from home? Should I begin my admission process right now and later deal with the schedules? My mom and dad are asking a lot if whether i contacted the RRHH guy or if they have called me, even asking when I'm going back and then get a job (I'm unemployed).But thats another topic, the thing is that I feel pressure from everywhere and my mind is stuck right now.

836,"For context, I (23m) have a younger brother (21m). I, however, feel like I have a weird relationship with him. We get along fine now, but when we were younger, we constantly fought with each other. 

So my question to you, Redditors, what is your relationship with your siblings? 

I would like to further increase the bond with my brother, because currently, I rarely ever talk to him and I honestly never think about him on a personal level. 

I’d like to change that, but I don’t know how.",16Aug2020,1
837,"I have an older brother who was super unclean, messy, and barely showered. But he has never peed in a plastic bottle and kept it in his room.

Today I was looking for something my younger brother borrowed and I found out he had a piss bottle in his closet. I live in a nice house with functioning toilets. My house is so nice, my younger brother has his own bathroom attached to his room. It's not a walk down the hall to use the toilet. It is literally about five steps.  

I know it's not because he's lazy. It's because of something weird.

I know it's not because my brother is lazy. If my brother was extremely lazy, he would've had multiple piss bottles and kept them everywhere under his computer desk. Because I know sometimes people who game can't be bothered. 

But he had one nicely tucked in his closet hiding behind his backpack. Lazy people don't hide their piss bottles, they don't care about getting caught and they're also too lazy to hide them. I mean if you're lazy enough to pee in bottles, you're also too lazy to hide them. 

Also his computer desk is not close to his closet. In fact his closet is closest to his bathroom, he could've walk a few more steps and emptied out his pee bottle instead of hiding it. Why be lazy enough to pee in a bottle but not lazy enough to hide the pee bottle in a closet? This doesn't make sense.

If it was because he was a lazy gamer, I wouldn't care so much. But it's definitely not because of that, it's something else. I know my brother isn't that lazy. When it's time to clean, he cleans his bathroom, does the dishes, takes out the trash, etc. But why keep the piss in the bottle?

I'm not even sure if it's his pee. I asked him to throw it away, and he just got upset and said he will. But he still hasn't thrown it away. Which is so weird because usually when I ask him to do some cleaning, he does it right away. Why does he want to keep pee in a bottle? 

I'm not going to force him to throw it away because I'm not his mother. I'm so disturbed right now. I told my mom over the phone but I think she thinks I'm overreacting. Please can anyone tell me if peeing in a bottle is some kind of weird underground trend? This isn't normal for my brother because he is not that lazy. There's something going on.",16Aug2020,1
838,"So a little background on myself:  I'm a very competitive person, who has always had a competitive outlet, from sports to video games to card games.

About 5 years ago I picked up Magic: The Gathering competitively.  I'm decent at it, but I get stressed out really badly when competing, which is unusual for me.  I never had nerve issues while playing Tennis, quite the opposite, I always performed better under pressure.  Same thing with video games, always played better when the pressure was on.

Why is it an issue for me with MTG?  I realize there's a card game and there's variance and everyone has bad days, but I'm so stressed it's not fun anymore.  How do I stop getting stressed over a hobby that I know doesn't really matter?",16Aug2020,1
839,"My family is having financial problems. My dad's a truck driver but he's barely home which means he can't ""really"" provide much money. My mom's unemployed after her job fired her for not doing any work during hours, (I know that they have to be telling a lie because my mom is a very hard worker and always takes her job seriously and does it with full commitment.) so now the only source of money coming in is unemployment checks. Today and yesterday have been some of the worst days of my life. Not because I did something illegal or I got kicked out of school no not anything like that. I truly hurt my mother to her core.  My dog chewed up not only my computer charger ($40) but both of my glasses which are things that she absolutely cannot afford. I made her cry. She said ""I have never in my life wanted to fight my children but today is the day"". She was so frustrated She already has only 20 dollars which is supposed to last the whole week and then last week the unemployment check didn't even come in so who's to say it won't come in this week. Plus she has to pay $200 for the light bill, and we gotta pay for my medication because I have ADHD. For those who don't know what ADHD is I'm basically super hyperactive and unfocused. Usually I take my medicine to clam me down or play my PS4. Now I don't have medicine or my PS4 (something went wrong with the hardware.) And we don't even have the money to fix that. Plus my TV broke and now I don't have that to watch. It seems everything I come into contact with breaks and I just think it would be better for my family if I ran away. Now yes, they will be sad because they don't have me but they will have more money. My mom would be able to take financial steps instead of having me pull her ten steps back. Plus she always has my sister. If no one replies that is fine. I'll be out by August 31. I hope I'll be able to survive out there.

841,hi there. so for a while now I've been wanting a girlfriend (I have never had one) so I've noticed that girls don't really like me that way. I've actually been more successful than most guys because I admitted my crush to every single crush I had. I'm really annoyed even though it's the truth. that I'm still young and have a future ahead of me (I'm 16) so I kinda have a breakdown every time a new crush rejects me. but here is the thing it's getting worse every time( my breakdown) the last girl I had a crush on is a bit complicated right now because her boyfriend and her are on break ( because of private reasons) so they are allowed to date and that. he is going dating other girls. but she doesn't want to. I told her my feelings and she said she saw it coming. she says she's still in relationship when I think he has broken up with her but won't accept it.

842,"I'll be straight forward I've been doing speed and my eyes are as wide as the moon and have been for the last like 24 hours at least and I have an interview in the morning thats very important, is there anyway to get them back to normal myself?",16Aug2020,1
844,"My girlfriend and I both live with her dad. We have lived this way for almost two years now. The main reasons that we all live together is that A)My family is an entire state over B)Her dad and I get(got) along pretty well. C)3-incomes help sustain the bills. 

This all started back in February of this year. My gf and I worked at the same Walmart (her for some 5 years and me about 1 year), I found a good work opportunity with Doordash in a large Midwest city. Mix the opportunity with the horrible work environment at Walmart and it was an easy choice. So i quit Walmart to start Doordashing and this was at the same time Covid19 was just starting to hit Seattle. 

At first it was not noticeable at all. I was making about 15 an hour (2 more than Walmart) and working for less hours. It was a total win, besides the wear and tear on the car. So I can say i was pretty blinded by my optimism. Once the virus started taking a serious hit my pay actually went up towards 25 an hour, due to the sheer volume and quality of orders being placed. However this would last for approximate a week, because as soon as the higher rate started, it plummeted. I was spending 4-8 hours making about $50. At this point I had to get unemployment, especially considering the state of the job market (Those hours not on Doordash was me pumping applications out like a factory). 

It was the early days of July when I started drawing unemployment, so I was able to catch the tail end of the ""bonus 600"" per check. Most of my time was spent playing video games or doing random online tasks (Taking surveys, attempting transcribing etc...) and the occasional few job application. On a positive note I was able to make some small bits of cash mowing lawns. My girlfriend still maintained her position at Walmart during all of this.

Now her father and I have had very minor disagreements in the past and were always comfortable talking and working things out. Even going out of our way to give each other advice. This last week was the first of two major incidents with her father that has decimated my faith/trust in him as a person.

So we get to last week. We get pulled by her father into a conversation where he basically boils it down to you have to get a job in 30days or get out. He exclaims that the pandemic is overblown, and that it isn't an excuse not to have a job. That when he was 20 he was able to buy his own house by working his way up in a Wendy's restaurant, and you will always be rewarded by working hard for your boss.  

As you can tell her father is a character to say the least. His personality is a mixture of conservatism, Pride, and an E X T R E M E attention to detail (if you put a fork backwards in the dishwasher he will literally have a piss attitude the rest of the day out of frustration because he things you are disrespecting him). However living with him for two years had brought me to adapt to his personality. 

Lucky for me I qualified for a free apprenticeship program to IT sponsored by our department of labor. This was awesome news, 5 weeks of training and then onto a full-time job. So we let him know and he was pleased to hear and all was well. Then it wasn't.

My gf called of of going to work the other day to spend some extra time together. We decided to go on a drive to a town we like visiting a little far away. While we where there we saw her aunt and the 3 of us all had a catch up conversation and then went our own ways. Then her aunt decides to text my gf's mom(who is not in the picture due to being an abusive drug lowlife) something about how daughter doesn't look good or some superficial garbage. This triggers her mom to text her dad. When her dad gets home he confronts us out in the garage about skipping work, which we admitted to. He then proceeds to tell us he is tired of being taken advantage of and then tells us to get out of the house. Telling my gf she can stay but I have to go and something about how long distance can help really test the strength of our relationship. He exclaims a bunch of other dumb-shit, again restating something about how the virus isn't an excuse to not work, you just gotta get over your depression it isn't an excuse ect... 

So we start packing and setting stuff in the car and he keeps trying to bait us into some sort of debate with him but we remain calm and collective the whole time. He finally starts calming down and exclaims we can stay here but we have to sharpen up, then gives us a list of thing we gotta change. We decided to spend the night elsewhere to think about things and relax. We went back and are now currently staying here. But its different now. There is noticeable tension in the air every time we are near each other, mix this with confirming my suspicions about her family wanting me out of the picture being confirmed, has lead to me being uncomfortable in my own skin in my own bed. 

I hate living here and I hate that we have to live here. My gf still has to finish an asoc in a local area college. And i am about to start this program soon. Im now looking to desperately save money for a down-payment on an apartment or house at this time. My gf is in agreeing with me for all these feelings and also feels extremely heartbroken her father would throw her out at a time like this. Years and in some case decades of trust has just been burnt to the ground overnight. Im not really sure what questions to ask. I just need some life advice right now and maybe help seeing some options that I haven't noticed yet. Apologies for this wall of text but I am grateful you made it this far reading. Any response is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",16Aug2020,1

(The girls there really dont like each other between themselves) 

I dont mind the gossip, but there is one other thing thats been weighting me down about this... A girl (F17) Who I had a huge crush on, and it didnt work out much... (In nutshell, she used me, lead me on, then on my own birthday party, she got together with a guy and ignored me, then tried to ""talk to me"", we met, only for her to ignore me some more and walking out like I was not there) 

Im afraid about my ex-crush witch ruining things for me, because she doesnt like my friend, I bet neither is she neutral towards me, thanks to few of my friends going berserk in the party aftermath and calling her out for being a witch... 

There are a few other problems like my friends parents not being entirely supportive and nice people, but that I can manage, my main concern is being in the spotlight in the community again (been there, and last time, I almost lost my job, and a friend, thanks to few of these gossiping witches).

 I'm going to therapy, and was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm hoping therapy will help, but in the meantime I don't know what to do about my most recent blow up. I said some really mean things to my friends and I don't know how to make it up to them. I've lost friends this way before and I don't want to lose these people, they're like a family to me.

 I feel like a simple ""I'm sorry for my behavior, I will be better"" isn't going to do it for them. I don't know how to even face them, I live with them and have been locking myself in my room and not coming out until I know the coast is clear. They haven't tried to talk to me either, though one of them left a soda outside my door a few minutes ago, and that gives me hope that they want to make up. I just don't know how. 

Any suggestions of what I could do or say to really show them I'm sorry and didn't mean what I said?",16Aug2020,1

I feel like I could say something wrong at anytime and hurt the other person’s feelings and so I choose not to say anything at all. I just graduated from high school and I kind of regret not making more friends and stop being friends with some people. I tend to push people away from me including my family.

864,"     Overly long, but here it is. My last job was amazing. That is, amazing until a few years in, when my awesome manager left. The only issue in our department was a girl we will call “Cathy”. This person was an intense micromanager and overall energy vampire. She would harp on little thing on a daily basis, never based on the quality of someone’s work, but rather “I don’t like seeing your teapot on your desk” or even “you work too quickly, you must be cutting corners”.  She would actively sabotage anyone she was threatened by. Suffice to say she was not a popular person in the practice. My awesome manager would have to “take her down a peg” every few months, and this was a problem since Cathy had joined the practice. Initially after awesome manager left, our HR/Practice Admin (the only man in a practice of 40 women) would bring her in to try to work on some of her interpersonal issues. These meetings usually had a couple day influence on her behavior, then she would be back to her obnoxious self. She had been there for about 4 years longer that I had, In that vacuum of my manager leaving, she was mostly unchecked, and trying to assign herself control of the entire department. 
     Admittedly, Cathy was very proficient at her work, attractive, and very put together. When awesome manager left, I was encouraged to apply for the management position. Awesome manager had recommended me as her replacement to HR. “Cathy” also applied. Our entire team, as well as other doctors, technicians, and kennel staff, voiced strong concerns about installing her as manager. Despite this, she was chosen to be given a “trial run” by HR. 
     HR guy, “John”, and Cathy started to develop a close relationship, long meetings in his office, lunch outings, etc. John was married, Cathy recently out of a long relationship. John was the nerdy, nebbishy kind of guy who thrives on being the only man in a building full of women. He had two children under 4, and his wife was sweet, but definitely on the plainer side. He handled all hiring decisions, and coincidentally only hired extremely attractive women. Like, every woman in the building was easily an 8/10. He would sometimes get a little too close for comfort, including some creepy shoulder massages, flirty Facebook messages late at night, etc. But he was non threatening and goofy, so no one took it too seriously. He was also a very “by the book” kind of guy.
     Cathy, unsurprising, was a nightmare to work under. She was especially vicious toward anyone she considered threatening to her position. She really had a way of grinding people to a nub. And again, this is a practice that is one of the best in the country. Everyone was an experienced professional, and didn’t need much handholding. 
     6 months later, the practice now had incredibly high turnover, mostly due to the mismanagement of our key department. John and Cathy were as close as ever, and he always seemed to have excuses for her behavior. Jokes circulated about their “closeness”. I eventually quit, I just could no longer work under someone who constantly undermined me. 
     John recently decided to move to Canada. 5 days ago, a friend “Destiny” in my department revealed to me that she had a sexual affair with John for over 6 months. It started with texts, escalating to him inviting her over when his wife out of town. He got her drunk, he was completely sober. They had sex while his two children cried upstairs. After this, she did not sleep with him again, but they fooled around, and exchanged constant messages. He would send her dick pics from his office, use the company Amex to buy her coffee and lunch every day, and more. At our corporate Christmas party he fingered her under a table at the bar. His affair only ceased when Destiny quit. He also would frequently make comments to Destiny about a sexual relationship with Kathy. Jokes about her being “under his desk” during closed door meetings, and that she wasn’t as prudish outside of work. Destiny told me this only because he was leaving the practice and moving. She asked me not to tell anyone. Keep in mind, John is 35, and Destinee is 22.
     I wrote up a long email that included all evidence against him. I have the draft ready to send to the practice owner. My question is, am I a vindictive person for wanting to report him? I’m not saying I wasn’t bitter over losing the manager position to Cathy. I had suspicions that this may be happening, but chalked it up to me looking for reasons why I was passed over. But I got over it, and I am in a much better place for leaving. I became an office manager in a completely new field, and Cathy has already been demoted from her new position.
     What bothers me most is John abusing his position as HR to coerce his female employees into sexual relationships. Misappropriating company funds on a daily basis to buy treats for his “special favorites”. Ignoring any feedback from his team regarding these employees. He was someone who the women in the office implicitly trusted given him being HR. And in this new framework, his closeness with Cathy makes more sense.  It isn’t too far of a leap to think this may have factored into his decision to install her as manager. What other reason would explain his choice to install a person with a long history of interpersonal conflict.Now that he is moving to another country, it seems like he is getting off Scott free. I even considered waiting until he updates his new position to Linkdin, and contacting his new office to let them know what kind of person they are hiring. I am torn between letting it go and sending the email. Am I doing this to even a personal score, or because it’s the right thing to do? What if this is a pattern he continues at his next job? And I a traitor to my friend for revealing her affair? I considered contacting his wife, but that seemed especially cruel.

tl;dr - HR passed me up for a position. Turns out he was sleeping with at least one person in my office, likely including newly appointed manager. He is moving out of country. Should I turn him in and ruin his reference or let sleeping dogs lie?",16Aug2020,1

868,"Whenever I ask for something I want or need, my parents make me pay for it or pay for part of it. I get an allowance of $5 every 2 weeks and I obviously don’t have a job since I’m 14, and I know my parents are doing well financially and can totally pay for my stuff. The most stressful part is that it applies to things I really need. For example, I don’t have a lot of clothes (I have like 4 shirts, 2 pairs of pants and 1 pair of shoes) and when I ask my parents to buy me more clothes they say “well, how much money do you have?” 

I understand that it’ll help me learn to spend money wisely or whatever, but I want my parents to at least give me a couple more years of freedom to enjoy being a teenager before I have to worry about that kind of stuff. I’ve tried talking to them about this before but it’s hard not to come off as rude. How should I tell my parents about how I feel and have them really listen?",16Aug2020,1
869,"This is less of a question of advice and more of me telling advice to people.

As a teenager, my parents took the liberty of teaching me the best way to go about finances. While you all are still young, this is the perfect time to start working on finances and becoming successful in the future.

Lesson 1: Relationships | Relationships are key in finances. If your future spouse doesn’t agree with how you want to live, it may be time to consider someone else. Most divorces happen because of finances, and people who don’t agree, and if you don’t agree with your spouse and end up in a divorce, they automatically get 50% of the money you have, and if you’re a male, you have to pay child support and you won’t be able to live how you want, because you won’t have money. Now, sometimes, you can compromise with your girlfriend, but make sure it happens before marriage. That’s the cutoff that you have.

Lesson 2: Investing | A lot of you will be starting your jobs real soon here. Talk to your parents about starting a stocks account for you. Investing is an amazing way to earn money for the future. If you want to learn a bit more about this, there are all kinds of Youtubers and YouTube videos that explain it all. This is one of the best ways to get money and set yourself up for the future and paying for those things you want. I have met too many people who didn’t learn about this until their 30’s and 40’s and they regretted it very deeply. Invest in the stocks, remember, this is the time to buy while everything is down from COVID-19. It may seem scary at first, with all of the stocks bouncing up and down, but trust me. You’re fine, and you have a long time before you retire. You don’t need to worry if your stocks are down, they will eventually bounce back.

Lesson 3: Student Loans | DO NOT GET STUDENT LOANS!!! Student loans are a HORRIBLE idea. They seem great at first, but you become a slave to them if you don’t pay them off immediately. The longer you wait, the more expensive they are, and the worse life will be for you. Do not get student loans. One way to avoid that is investing like I said earlier. Make sure to set aside money to invest and you will be able to pay for schooling in the future.

Lesson 4: Your future life | In the future after college, make sure to set aside some money for investments. The best way to go about this is saving $150 a month for your investment purposes, and put it into your stocks account. At first, it may be hard, but it will set you up for life, and by doing this, you can become a successful person.

Lesson 5: School | Make sure to do well in school. Doing well in school is one of the key components in being successful. You don’t even have to do super good, just try to avoid C’s, and 100% avoid D’s and F’s. If you can do this, future you will be thanking yourself for the work and determination you put into how you wanted to live later in life.

Lesson 6: Leisure items | Sometimes, you will want to buy something nice for yourself, like a nice piece of tech or something. Do not do this. In a few years, it will be outdated and it won’t be very good anyways, so why get a new one now? Use the money you WOULD use to get that device or electronic, and invest it! A lot of the stuff I am telling you will mostly revolve around investing in the stock market, and trust me, you will be grateful in the future that you were able to learn this stuff.

Just remember, this is something that most people would regret not learning, and if you can discipline yourself now, you will be setting yourself up to be successful in the future, and you can get the things you enjoy to have. You will be able to get those cars you want, you will be able to get that nice computer, and keep updating it. Just follow these steps, and you can almost guarantee that you will be able to retire and live well.

This mostly applies to the younger population, though it can apply to a lot of older folk as well, Especially when talking about investing.",16Aug2020,1
870,"TLDR: Friend from work is MIA, and I want to ask our boss if he has heard from her.

I'm good, but new, friends with another woman at work. She had told me that her mother was very close to death, and her sister was battling cancer with a poor prognosis. Due to the pandemic, she wasn't able to visit either of them, and I knew it was weighing heavily on her mind that she might not get the chance to say goodbye to her mother, and she was very worried about her sister.  

Before covid we would hang out outside of work, and now that we all pretty much work from home, she and I were in contact on a near-daily basis. Until two weeks ago, when she stopped responding to my IMs and texts, even though we'd had plans to go to the zoo this month. 

I am pretty sure that she is in mourning, and I think she's the type of person who needs to deal with her grief in her own way, so I'm trying to respect that while also letting her know that I'm here for her. She's new to town and I'm the first friend she has made here. So I have sent her a text about twice a week, and left her a voicemail once, just to let her know I'm thinking of her. I haven't offered any condolences because I do not know for a fact that her mother has died.

I want to ask our boss if she is okay. I would tell him that I don't expect any details or anything, I just haven't heard from her in two weeks and I want to know that she's, well, still around, I guess? Just confirmation that she is alright. There's nothing to be gained from it other than reassurance that she is in contact with someone and hasn't isolated herself completely in her grief.

I'm just not sure if it's wise, or if it would be disrespecting her desire for space, if that's what she wants, or if it's asking my boss for information (however vague) that I have no right to ask for.

Any advice, especially from a manager's perspective, is welcome.",16Aug2020,1

872,"The other day I was sitting at my desk doing my thing, and enjoying summer break.  My brother walks downstairs and walks directly to me sitting at my desk.  He stands next to me and puts his hand on my head and scratches/pets me.

Seems pretty harmless, right?  Not for me.  I’m very much into gentle femdom and heavily enjoy a good cuddle/hug/head pat.  The afore mentioned are sexual in nature to me.  He only had his hand there for like a second but it was long enough for me to become aroused and almost let out a moan.  I tried to act like nothing happened and tried to ask him “what was that for” without letting him know I was now sexually charged.  He said “I’m petting everything I see”, we have a cat and a dog so I guess he saw the cat then the dog then me.  I’m pretty sure that he didn’t notice anything and if he did he did a very good job at hiding his reaction.  It happened a week ago and I’ve been worried about it ever since.  

I didn’t feel assaulted or anything, I was just surprised and slightly embarrassed by it.  There’s no way he could’ve known that I would react this way, I keep it under wraps as much as I can for my own sake.  I can also safely say that there was no malicious intent behind the action even if he did know because that’s not the kind of person he is at all, and he’s my brother.

Thats a fucking dickmove, because that girl is really beautiful and we have been exchanging eye contact for some time now, but as i said, i don't have the balls to go to talk to her.


Probably he wants to be the ""leader"" of the group by showing that he can get any girl he likes.


How do you deal with a guy that you have told him all your likings, and he goes for them, knowing you liked them first.


How do you deal with this kind of people?

So I find a spot, poop, use cottonelle wipes to clean up and go on my way. However within 10 minutes of walking I start to feel irritation down yonder. Some residual poop has somehow survived, so I clean up again. Then 10 minutes later I clean up again. The problem is the 2nd or 3rd time I clean up I start to bleed. So now my pleasant walk in the woods has turned into butt pain. My skin is so sensitive it bleeds easily, I once accidentally wiped a bit hard and ripped myself.

If you don't like this post that's fine. Although I waould appreciate it if you could upvote so that some person with knowledge of the mystical arts will make me some sort of butt heal poultice.  

Background: I'm recovering from acute leukemia (ALL) and the first super bomb of chemo constipated me so bad I ended up damaging my anal area. I pooped something like a foot ball and it ripped up my insides. For months every-time I would go poop I would be in excruciating, 10/10 pain. Once I was healthy enough they where able to fix my butt suffering by surgically removing a rather large ulcer that had developed.",16Aug2020,1

I've been in high school relationships before it's just now, in college, I just wanna know how to start them. The relationships in high school just occurred naturally when I talked to girls and the relationship began to snowball into something larger. I'm not really socially awkward I just don't know how to start it now at this point and now I feel meh. I just don't know how to do it in college and I'm sorry if I sound stupid for it.

891,"Partly due to colleges being online due to corona I find myself lying in bed all day using my computer for up to 14 hours (watching movies, listening to music, browsing Reddit, watching YouTube videos, and many other random things).

Although I do this whenever I am not in college, so it's not just corona causing this behavior. Whenever I'm not in school or at a job I'm doing this, which is why it's so bad that I am not able to attend school right now.

I'm feeling depressed as a result of not sleeping, not exercising, eating unhealthy, etc. And my mental health is also declining because I have a propensity to think really negatively, neurotically, and disgustingly.

I already take the max amount of medication for my depression, so is there anything I can really do to fix this? I used to see therapists, but never for these sorts of problems, since I was always not depressed whenever I saw them.

Actually I think I answered my own question, and I should talk to a therapist over the phone or something.",16Aug2020,1
892,"I dated a guy a few years back and split up with him almost 5 years ago now, every since then he would contact me on various social media platforms every few months, even though he would often have a girlfriend, I eventually got sick of it and blocked him on everything, he then made fake accounts to contact me on both Facebook and Instagram which I also blocked/reported and changed my handles on all my social media to confuse him, of course he then started emailing me so I changed my email address, all of my social media now is private and I’m constantly in fear of putting my real location in case he’s actually stalking me, he’s not dangerous just completely obsessed and it’s freaking me out, I was even convinced he had found me on here at one point.

For years now I’ve ignored him hoping he would give up but since December last year he’s taken it upon himself to start contacting my best friend as a way to find out how I’m doing and where I am etc. She’s been ignoring him so now he’s harassing her too, also contacting her on all of her social media platforms etc. We hadn’t heard from him since then up until a couple of weeks ago when he sent her another message. I finally reached out to him myself to tell him politely to leave me the hell alone which is something I didn’t want to have to do because judging by his response, any response from me was a good one and he said he was happy to hear from me. This isn’t normal behaviour is it? He wasn’t like this when we dated either. I’ve been in contact with various stalking helplines but because it’s online there’s not much they can do.

Does anyone have any advice/tips on how to protect myself or go about this situation?

900,"My brother is getting married in 2.5 months after only just getting engaged in July. I have maintained from the get-go that I am unsure about flying from the PNW to Virginia during COVID and what the restrictions will be come wedding time. With the way cases have been increasing lately and the projections for this fall, I am becoming more and more anxious about making this trip and have expressed all of my concerns to my brother. Maybe I was naive but I was expecting him to be understanding of my decision not to come. I also told myself if it was a small outdoor wedding I might consider it more but as he described the details (just under 200 guests invited, many guests invited from out of state/hotspot states, older ppl will be there, “encouraging those who feel they want to wear a mask”, “yeah the sanctuary is probably big enough for social distancing”, etc.) I became more disheartened by what I was hearing. 

It’s especially frustrating bc I will look like the asshole if others are traveling from out of state but his own sibling isn’t. He is also religious and said that while he doesn’t want harm to come to guests, of course, “we shouldn’t live in fear if we trust Jesus” as well as touting some Covid conspiracy stuff. I did express that I morally don’t feel good about this and don’t think I’ll be able to come but he said he would talk about it with his fiancé and we’ll keep in touch. I know the next conversation we have I will need to crack down on my stance but it’s breaking my heart- not only to miss my own brother’s wedding but that we clearly have very different views on the global pandemic.

902,"Hi there friends,

I just graduated a two-year program in cyber security with a certificate as well, and to put it bluntly, I have no idea what to do now. 

I've worked many jobs both in customer service and manual labor, and I've fallen back on manual labor as I lost my previous job at an IT company to the pandemic. I didn't like that job (it was tedious, grunt/entry-level work), and as I've fallen back on construction and flooring work I've found I enjoy the physical grind more than the office environment.

What has me confused more is that I absolutely love the outdoors, and want to eventually own a home on my own plot of land a ways away from major cities. I love people, but I also love the isolation, peace, and freedom that come with nature. This doesn't go well at all with the fact that working cybersecurity or any IT job really wouldn't allow me to enjoy the world away from a desk. I love fresh mountain air and the smell of greenery too much. 

I also want to travel and experience the world. I refuse to settle for the comfort of my ""bubble,"" and it bothers me that I don't have the money or time to really experience other places. 

And lastly, I love people to the point that I would dedicate my life to helping those in need if I could achieve my goal of owning my own property and being financially stable while doing that. I feel like philanthropy would come after financial security though, so my focus first needs to be centered on securing my future and my goals. I just have no idea what the next step is as these are trying times for a graduate with little experience. 

Do I commit to a career that I may dislike for the time being? If not, what do I do? I feel so helpless. 

Any advice, personal experience involving travel and work, or just constructive criticism helps. I'm just so lost in my head and so unhappy with feeling incapable of achieving what I want. I hate remaining stagnate and my blurry future is all I think about all the time.

905,"I'm considering on pursuing a master's degree after I finish my Computer Engineering undergrad. At some point, I want to pursue a Master's because I feel like I fit within a certain niche in my field.

My ultimate plan right now is I can get a full time job somewhere (whereever that is) and after I work in the company for a few years, pursue a Master's there and have the company pay for it essentially because I heard you can do that. But, I'm sure I would need to take the GRE and I don't like standardized tests (like virtually everybody else). People have told me it's not that much of a big deal compared to like the ACT/SAT scores back in high school, but still...

Recently, my internship for a good company ended and I'm planning on going back (but they're currently not hiring due to COVID and I don't know how long that will last). I am applying to different companies just in case. 

As for grad school, my favorite professor offered me a research opportunity to work with the Department of Defense to work on some really cool projects ONLY if I stay with him through grad school. Now, my school requires a 146 verbal, 157 quantitative, and a 3.5 writing. Not sure on how hard or not hard that is. Like I said, I would rather avoid the GRE altogether but I'll take it if I ABSOLUTELY have to. I tried to register for the GRE to get it over with as soon as possible despite me clearly not being ready because I seriously don't want to study months for the test. 

Also, my brother (who's been through grad school before) recommended me to apply through this program for minorities that has a pretty aggressive deadline. The benefit of this program is that it supposedly gurantees an internship with some pretty big companies. One of these companies is the company I interned earlier that I want to go back to. So, in case if somehow they don't start hiring after that point, that's how I can get in. Wow, this is sounding like some over-elaborate Mission Impossible scheme right now.

Ultimately, I'm building as many options as possible. As soon as I graduate, I want to do something, whether it be work in industry or doing research. I have a plan, but I'm just not sure if it's the right plan. **I want to know what you guys would do in this situation.** **Take the GRE soon and apply for grad school? Or wait, try to get a job, and then do a Master's later?**",16Aug2020,1

907,"I have the absolute laziest coworker ever and he also happens to be an assistant manager. NO idea how this happened, he has been with the company 17 years. He is EXTREMELY obese. Not trying to be mean or shame but the dude is easily 400 plus. He finds ANY excuse to sit down at work. He will sit and watch videos on his phone SO loud that you can hear it far away. My point is, besides being lazy, he's loud/obnoxious and rude. He always has the work phone on speaker when he answers it, his speaking voice is basically yelling. If I am on a phone nearby I can't hear at all. He disappears for 20-30 mins and then will say ""I'm gonna take my break"" At the end of the day everyday I am stuck with him until closing and EVERY day he decides to take his break and leave me by myself. I finally snapped because I had some work I needed to do the other day and he comes storming in saying ""Hey everyone is leaving, I'm gonna take my break"". I finally said ""why do you do this every single day? I HAVE to get this done for tomorrow. Every day you wait til everyone leaves to take your break"" he had NO answer for me and stormed off. This is only the half of it. About 2 weeks ago I got stuck with a ton of work that had to be done in the morning and I knew my boss would be pissed and get behind even more if I didnt at least try to start it. So I started it and said obese coworker decided to take his break and not help me AT ALL. I don't want to get into too many details but my job sometimes requires lifting heavy things. So it made me SO mad that he did this. On top of that he is extremely rude to customers if they come in close to the time we close the store.

909,"She just turned sixty, has a lot of issued with PTSD and is a little off in the head sometimes. She can't make $540 rent every month because she's on social security, and I found out she spends $700 / month on a storage space that she hasn't TOUCHED in seven years. Meanwhile she has a dead junker Toyota that's been sitting in the apartment parking lot for at least two years, that she won't sell for parts because ?????????????. 

I go to her apartment and it's full \*to the ceiling\* with old toys (mostly matchbox cars) in original packaging. The whole place (all 300 sq feet, same as mine) is crammed with boxes that she has to work around. She swears ""they're worth hundreds apiece"", but refuses to let me help her sell them so she can make ends meet. For three years it's been like that, and every time she swears she's going to start selling them on eBay / talking to a collector, and then nothing happens. 

Sorry for the long rant, I'm getting there.

Eight of the last eleven rent cycles, I've lent her at least half her rent, and she's paid me back three weeks later (exactly as promised, tbqh). I don't like enabling people, and I know I wasn't helping her, and most of all I have to do it in fucking cash because she doesn't ""trust"" Paypal. It's always a big complicated affair and I don't like keeping track of all of the nonsense. 

Two weeks ago I loaned her $200 AGAIN, and I texted her a couple days after and told her that I can't do it anymore. I told her that if she at least \*tried\* to make it work for herself, I'd be happy to. We're good friends and I would gladly pay it if she asked me. But her hoarding has a stranglehold on her. She gets extremely defensive / agitated when I tell her she needs to clean out her storage unit / sell the car / sell or throw out all her crap.

910,"I think my brother leant them to a mutual friend. Said mutual friend recently got an N64 (give or take two years ago.) We’ve had ours most of my life.   
  
When he got his we dug up our old games and took them over to play. This is when my brother might’ve leant them to our friend. Basically I think he left them behind for my friend to have something to play while he scoured thrift stores to slowly build a collection.   
  
But since we got him into the retro gaming thing, he was basically trying to gather our better games.   
  
My fear is that my friend either intentionally or accidentally mixed our games in with the ones he was slowly collecting. He would remember it as finally getting what he’d wanted for a while, and we wouldn’t notice until the next time we brought ours up. (We live in a small apartment so we can’t keep it out at all times, there’s not enough useable space for all the games and accouterments.)  
  
Of course enough time has gone by that neither me or my brother really remembers how that shook out, especially because if it happened on purpose I wasn’t a part of it.   
  
I’m asking for advice because I see it playing out one of three ways:   
  
1. I ask directly, my friend (potentially intentionally) misremembers and then I won’t get them back.   
  
2. I mention I think I left some there and he gets protective over his stuff (which is a trait he has)  
  
3. I take them and he’s offended when he notices or I’m wrong or both.   
    
I’m not sure he has them yet, it being Covid and all I haven’t been over in a while.   
  
But I have reason to expect it to get weird because when our PlayStation 3 broke we leant him all our games. He had not interest in trying any of them, and then I replaced my PS3.

915,"It's as the title says. I've basically known I was trans for years but suppressed it. Now that I've joined college, I've really had a better headspace to think about it and I know who I am. I am ftm. I was still trying to deny it when I joined the sorority last semester, so I though that if I joined a sorority that'd show me I wasn't trans. Wrong. It was a foolish choice. I just don't want to be this way, bc who would want to be trans? I feel so different from these girls. They're all good people but I can't relate to the things they feel and do. And they constantly make it a point to call us girls or ladies, and it makes my skin crawl because that's not what I am. They're all also very stereotypically girly and I just can't relate. They're girliness doesn't bother me but I feel like they expect me to be like that and I cannot pretend.

I felt a little pressured to join as well because some current members were constantly telling me I'd like it, I should join, etc. I also have two close friends in it, so I felt like maybe I'd fit in a little better. I was still wrong in letting other's words influence my behavior. I usually don't fall for peer pressure but this was also acting in adjunct with my feelings of suppression and the fact that I had close friends in the sorority. 

The problem is, I don't really pass. I dress in what male clothes I have and have short hair, but my face is very round and just looks feminine by nature. I feel like I can't come out if I don't really look the part. I know how I feel but it feels fraudulent because I feel like others won't believe me. I also think the only way to start getting to a solution is to come out my big (one of my close friends) in the sorority, but that's terrifying. I haven't come out to anyone yet and I don't know if I should. I could just tell her I'm questioning my gender. Maybe.

I also feel guilty for saying I don't like it because at the beginning of it all, we were bought gifts by our bigs and then we got them gifts. Idk it feels like I've invested something AND my big did in me. So I'd be cheating her out of her money almost. I had been thinking months ago of taking her out to eat and telling her, but that was before covid and I waited too long. 

I probably solved the problem for myself in what I wrote above but I'd like to hear any outside opinions. I just don't want to damage my relationships with my friends because of me feeling so uncomfortable in a sorority and being constantly referred to as a girl or lady.",16Aug2020,1

He started a new company in a completely different market that is supposed to make us a lot of money but he said before he gets all that money he’s going to open source all his code (make all of it free) and give away all his products. which would completely ruin the industry and would put us in danger.  he has been running 2 companies and moving a house all at once so he finally cracked and started talking about this crazy stuff like how he’s resurrected and died multiable times and quantum physics.

The reason why this is so mentally degrading is because he is was such a role model to me and a hard working person to talk to about video games or nerd stuff. last time we have been in contact with him was when my mom was on the phone with him trying to get him to go to the doctors and him getting really mad at that idea.",16Aug2020,1
919,"Hi guys,

I read a bunch of articles online on this but I'm still not 100% convinced which one is the right choice for me so I'm hoping someone's perspective here might help me make the correct decision.

Okay so my background is I have done my Bachelors in CS and have been working with an MNC(the ecommerce giant) for the last 3 years. I was promoted to an Software Development Engineer-2 (SDE-2) after 2 years and now I'm working towards becoming an SDE-3. I have been a part of my team since the beginning and since last 6-8 months I have been feeling like my learning curve is almost flat and things are becoming boring.

I have an offer from a fintech startup where one of my friend works which has completed series A funding and the founder is second time entrepreneur who has sold his first startup for 300M $. The current team there is around 80 people.

As per my conversation with the manager of the team in the start-up, his selling point was that the learning opportunities are going to be immense and even if the startup does not work out in 3 years, I'll have enough technical knowledge to join as an SDE-3 back in my current company. And if it does, I could grow exponentially with it and reach higher levels as compared to a liner growth at my current MNC. And given that the founder is a second time entrepreneur, the chances of this succeeding are very high according to him.


The other option I'm considering is joining a different team here at my current company which might be working on interesting things. I don't even know how long it'll take to become SDE-3 here since the attrition rate is very low here now and I see there are so many SDE-2s already. I'm also scared my knowledge base will be significantly lower than my friend at the startup 3-4 years from now. How do you think should I approach this decision? What are your thoughts? 


P.S. - Working hours at the startup might be a little hectic but I'm okay to put in a little extra effort since I'm young and I dont have many other responsibilities. Pay at the startup is almost similar to what my current company is paying.",16Aug2020,1

This woman has aided in my depression since I was 7 and it’s only gotten worse. Recently I’ve been doing some things to stay depression *free* since about May and ever since then it’s been even worse. In April I told her I was planning on moving out as soon as I get a job and my license and ever since then she’s been going into over drive. I mean I’m a fucking adult and she can’t understand the principles of “don’t go through my stuff or come into my room because I’m an adult”, which also aids in me wanting to leave, I have no privacy and never did. And before you say “well you live under her roof so she has the right”. All I have too say to that is no, she doesn’t. She told me two days ago she refuses to give me my social security number or birth certificate because she believes someone came into our house and switched out the documents which literally fucking forces me to stay here and if I do for any longer I may not be here.

922,"Genetic Sexual Attraction before even meeting

20F and I am having intense feelings for my newly found Half brother 27M,
Our dad had two failed marriages, including a fling(with my mom) before he died only months before I was born.
My half brother or his family did not know about me until I contacted him on social media months ago, finding out my half sister had died as well a couple of years before I contacted him. I knew I had half siblings, but I didn’t think to attempt contact or even look them up until my relationship with my boyfriend had been coming to an end. Now that I have I cannot stop thinking about my Half brother, he is everything I have ever wanted in a man, well, except maybe not married with two children.. and related to me. 

We talk over social media or video games everyday, I don’t usually go to bed at night without speaking to him until I fall asleep. We send each other selfies which I know is just getting to see what we look like which is similar, we started sending each other photos from bed, no nudity but we are both clearly naked and talking to each other.
He tells me how good I look, compliments my hair and tells me how smart and sweet I am, how my now ex boyfriend is crazy not to be with a good girl like me. Our conversations are intimate but never discussing his family at all, he referred to his wife as his girlfriend once and that was it. We live a whole 7 hours apart, He has asked when I will visit him several times, and I asked if he would come see me and he told me in about 4 months he will.

I tell him what a good, kind, sweet man he is. I can’t bring myself to tell him how handsome too, mostly because the morally correct side of me knows this is GSA, and I should not be having fantasies about him, I shouldn’t be having dreams about growing old together with him, but I am! The feelings are so intense, I think about him too much it feels like it’s actually taking over a part of my life. I’m desperate to know he’s feeling at least the sexual attraction but we have never even had a reunion. 
I knew the second I heard his voice on a voice message to me that I wasn’t going to see him as a brother. 

Now, should I still meet my half brother when I know I will express these intense feelings if he reciprocates?",16Aug2020,1

Before the incident karen had given out to only my sister and x for going behind a wall to get a ball with four boys. She claims she thought the boys were going to take advantage of the girls .yet she never says anything to the boys. My sister and x then leave

On their way home karen appears. This time she is in her car. She begins to slut shame and verbally harass them, saying things like do your parents know where you dress like that , commenting on how they were skimpy clothing (btw it was warm that day) and then even asking x to lift up her  hoodie to prove she was wearing a bra underneath , basically she thought they were sluts. She didnt stop asking x to do so until x complied. After that she threatened that she would go tell their parents.

But I go through phases where I’m fine, we go without much communication then bam. I’m having an almost breakdown because I feel like something is wrong and I need reassurance from him. 

When I say breakdown, for me personally it’s: all my thoughts are consumed about him, what he’s doing, does he really love me, is he lying, etc. and I just want to do nothing all day and I cry quite a bit. I know it sounds dramatic and emotional but it’s not something I’ve told anyone. I’ve been this way ever since I was 17. Only with serious relationships. I’ve had 3, with my current one being the 3rd “serious” one. I’ve always been a huge lover. If I’m with someone, I want them %10000. I feel every feeling to it full capacity. So if I’m happy, I’m the happiest person alive. But when I’m sad, I fall into a state of not wanting to do anything.

Even if he says “I love you” or “I miss you” or “I want you 100%” I still have doubtful thoughts in my mind. I know this is something that I can only fix internally but idk how or where to start.

932,"I struggle being able to make friends and the only ways I could make someone want to speak to me is if I did the following:

• Invite them to a birthday party (which I no longer do for more than 5 years)

• Buy bundles in some games for myself and play till 3am, with the idea that I will make a strong appealing character that people will want to hang out with, just to come to the realization that I suck really bad at playing games

• Buy them games or just some bundles from a game they play

• In rare occasions I will buy them stuff in real life such as clothes and candy

I know that people will not accept this as an excuse, but I became so desperate that I ended up stealing money from my mother, just so that I seemed more appealing and interesting to people with having the ability to buy things without them knowing that it is stolen money. Before this I never did anything that would make people think that I am a bad person, which also includes never even stealing a pencil from school. It became so bad that it turned into a really bad habit of stealing money from her wallet for the past 4 years and now I pretty much owe her  £17,200. I even remember when she asked me to help her login into her savings account and I saw only £17,000 inside, which means that I ended up stealing a solid 500 days of hard earned money from her cleaning people's houses.

I have never been able to have a decent conversation with other guys, much less have I ever spoken to any girl in my life. My speaking skills are really fucking bad unlike my mediocre writing skills.

He told me he just wants us to be just friends out of the blue, I retreated less than gracefully and told him I can't be friends, at least not yet. I've told him I needed space and stopped talking to him so I could clear my head and try and accept this new reality. 

But since then, he's been persistent in asking me why I am distant, why I say I'm hurt, why I need space. He's acting as if I'm thoroughly confusing him. I don't owe him an explanation, I know.

Just like the title says, my cousin is supposed to get married in Georgia next month and they want to know if we’re coming by next week.

936,"Alright so I work for a call center. Initially during the interview they told me that it was a call center. Then, on the first day of work they said they were switching to chats. 

So the first few weeks I do chats and then they play the switch up. Apparently they do that to every single training class, the bait and switch, so that was the first red flag that this company wasn’t right. 

I saw one of my coworkers get underpaid her first week on the floor, but I didn’t like her anyway. Second red flag. 

Anyway, I got a hot head and complained about the bait and switch so they moved me to another supervisor but low and behold, they are all in on this, so that didn’t make a difference. I was still taking calls. 

My fingerprint didn’t work on any of their scanners either and it wasn’t until I broke one of their machines that they gave me an alternate way to enter the building. This was after I had gone off on my supervisor and his 2 managers and then was forced to give an apology to his manager. Now I sound like an ass but the fingerprint system didn’t work for me. I complained about it regularly, developed some semi-ok workarounds, etc. 

So some time passes and I get promoted and then get promoted again because I get a lot of positive surveys from customers. That’s great. 

Fast forward a few months and I’m working from home. We all are.

Anyway, they start coming out with one stupid policy after another. You must take a picture of yourself 4 times a day. You must not use sticky notes on your computer. And then they added 80 ways to get everyone fired. There were 2 places to sign off on it but I only signed off on it in one place. 

Ok so rewind a little bit. The job description was never clear but I was one of the people in making the job description more expansive, behind the scenes, but other people seem to have taken my idea and run with it. 

There was one manager who didn’t like me because I wound up calling her a bitch, lazy, etc etc. I developed some training materials for everyone except her team. I had her team blocked out and obviously the saltiness just grew and grew with her so one day I get the news that I’m getting in trouble for putting the customer on a ten minute hold for a call that we didn’t even handle originally when we got the job.

And I like one of the main people who expanded our job description anyway and the bill was too complicated for anyone to figure out period. 

Anyway it’s 5 strikes and you’re out so with this they were trying to give me 4 strikes which is in line with the 80 ways to get you fired but it’s nonsense. I was legit not rude or anything, just a mofo hold. 

So somehow my manager supposedly got it lowered to 3 strikes but I didn’t think that was good enough because there’s too many ways to do a near perfect job and get fired plus I never fully signed off on the rules!

So I call and message a couple people from the top of the company who are pretty rude and unresponsive. And I supposedly got in trouble for that. Well the 2 things put together should mean I’m out of a job but they are supposedly deliberating. I just told them exactly how I felt about everything. 

Anyway, I said my goodbyes cuz I thought I was leaving but I’m not gone yet. This one girl who I trained got a job and she got me the same job in one hour which kinda had me shook. So basically, I was thinking of just trying to work for this bullshit company 4 hours a day on training time where I help people out without taking calls. Would that be a bad idea? It’s what I did before with my first 4 hours of the day anyway.

Also the girl I hated manipulated hr into trying to get be to take a new job with them and I didn’t take it. That’s then the 3 strikes came in when I haven’t ever fully adhered to their eighty rules.

Anyway I’m scared to take calls now. I know I’m going to fuck something up, even if it doesn’t matter. Part of me just wants to work half time this week and not tell anyone. Should I? People say that they weren’t trying to pull a bad call of mine but it happened and it escalated and escalated and escalated and no one is taking my feelings seriously. 

I posted this earlier but removed it because Idk if I want to be exposed like this. The new job is starting in two weeks and I’ve already got enough money for my bills next week. I just can’t explain the level of discomfort I feel with taking calls now and I don’t know if the fear is warranted or if my ego is getting in the way or what it is. 

The next job is a call center as well but at least I won’t have any poor marks. Idk whether to keep trying hard or to just slack off. I’m upset and frustrated and feel slighted.",16Aug2020,1

I did this around so many people, I don't even know how to convey how extreme it could get when I was very anxious. It was worse when I was excited but also anxious and embarrassed because my impulsiveness and desire to speak was at war with my ever increasing anxiety and the pressure got to be so much I would just ""trance out"" and basically babble incoherent. I couldn't after a while look people in the face because I began to anticipate their expressions of bewilderment, discomfort and exasperation as I'd try to say 15 things at once, contradicting myself and qualifying everything I said with an increasingly panicked, sped up and ungrammatical speaking style, not making any eye contact until it culminated after 3 minutes of nonstop talking in a mortified apology for not making any sense and wasting everyone's time. And then 3 minutes later feeling such a strong urge to do it again because ""this time I would make sense, I knew exactly what I wanted to say"" but then opening my mouth and everything going to absolute shit because suddenly my point which moments before seemed to relevant and integral to the conversation seems incredibly stupid and I as I speak I realize I'm not making sense and everyone is just internally cringing as nervously spew out the 15 things running through my head because I need to redeem myself, only for my face to become redder and redder with shame and the cycle to continue.

And yet I always brushed it off as a minor quirk. Only now am I realizing how many times I thought I was having a great conversation with someone I admired and adored, when really they likely couldn't wait for me to shut up. I feel so embarrassed. And it's worse around people I like the most. I feel like such an idiot. I am most embarrassed about how I spoke around one person, my professor, advisor and mentor, who I look up to and enjoyed being around more than anyone and who I thought also liked to talk to me. But as I think back to our meetings I see so many cues that he was bored and uncomfortable and irritated that I didn't pick up on. I thought the fact that he wasn't looking at me when I spoke, or that he was fidgeting just was part of his personality. I remember the time I word vomited in his office and hearing him sigh very loudly, as I walked out, as if in relief, or exhaustion.

I want to apologize to him, even though I already have too many times, for being so damn annoying. I wanted him to like so much that I sabotaged it. I keep doing this. I know there is hope moving forward but I'm still with the same professors and peers who know me and have witnessed my outburst. I can't get over how much I've annoyed people.",16Aug2020,1

950,"Hi all, I'm a junior in college dreading the start of my classes tomorrow. I'm an illustration major and since about January of this year I've really been starting to hate drawing more and more. When I graduated from high school I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do and thought I would find ""my calling"" if I went into art, but I haven't. I feel like I've made a really wrong decision in choosing to major in it since it was my favorite hobby that I really enjoyed, and now it's just ""work"". I've started comparing the quantity of art I'm able to produce and my skills with my peers (something which I never had a problem with before college). I always feel like I don't produce enough and what I can manage to draw isn't really anything that could get me hired. 

Basically as soon as last semester was over (April 2020) I've inadvertently put a halt on drawing entirely. I really can't bring myself to draw anything and I really wasn't proud of any of the five or less things I've drawn this summer.  I have no drive or passion to make art anymore. I feel like I'm really behind all my peers and like I don't really belong here. 

Switching majors isn't really an option for many reasons. I'm too far in for it to make sense financially and I really have no other interests or skills. Especially nothing that I could see myself doing long-term or as a career. I just feel incredibly stuck and I'm really not looking forward to two more years of this.

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance or some advice on how to make it bearable. I've never had doubts or burn out so badly like this but I can't get the feeling to go away and I continue to feel worse about myself for it. It's making me feel pretty hopeless and stressed about the (already pretty abysmal) future. I'm getting more and more worried that whatever I choose to do in life I'll end up miserable.  What can I do?

953,"So this is a lengthy story, I don't know where to begin. My girlfriend just told me something that connects different events in a way that makes a lot of sense. So this happens in a small town in Canada. There's this family of drug dealers who killed one of my girlfriend's friends over drug debts, they cut him into body pieces. They were only charged with indecency to a dead body cuz they said they just found the body and cut it and somehow the judge/jury bought it. 1 year later they're out. Side story one of her cousins died from suicide the same year from hanging himself. A few months pass and the son that helped the dad kill my girlfriend's friend disappear. Then one of my girlfriend's mom friend died from suicide by jumping off a cliff the same week he tells her mom that people wants to harm him and that he wants to meet with her and talk to her, he didn't get a chance to. Time pass, my girlfriend was driving in town and saw two huge black guys that were acting very weird and then a guy that looked scared with a crowbar in hands and that night he died, from hanging. And this week my girlfriend's other cousin died from hanging. All these dead people had in common was being involved with that Drug family who are in a gang. What I just learned tho is that apparently the dad that went to prison gave a list of people to these huge guys who aren't from around here to get rid of, apparently the guy with the crowbar said so before dying and gave the list.

960," Backstory: 

  
I'm a female turning17 in Ontario, Canada. My parents haven't given me a phone and pretty much think it's useless till I'm in college, even though all my cousins/family friends have one and they've grown up in the same environment. I basically hid one for almost 2 years, mainly to make school life easier, and under those 2 years i randomly met this guy (male 17 turning 18 in Quebec) and who doesn't live nearby, but I definitely feel a soulmate connection and we're pretty much the same person, similar goals, morals, personality etc. We actually got the chance to meet when I snuck out and it was the best decision ever (his mom doesn't mind us being together actually), the energy and everything was the same and I've never felt so connected to someone. I won't go into anymore detail because I could go on about him for hours because he's helped me with a lot of things. I got caught with the phone and they also found out that I've been talking to him. Got physically abused etc, and they're also very low-key racist and not accepting of him at all. Now I don't have access to anything except my laptop and I get yelled at if I'm on it too much, and have to pretty much live like a prisoner. I always knew I didn't fit in this family way before I even got the phone or talked my boyfriend, everything's just so emotionally draining and makes me rip my hair out, and most of their decisions don't make any sense they just like to do things because they're in power.

  
Current:

  
They gave me the option to leave and I was actually ready to pack my bags and runaway, but I knew I had to be smart about it and couldn't because I still have my senior year of high-school left and I won't go far if I don't even have my high school diploma, and even if I did go they'd file a missing persons report because I'm underage. I've realized I feel suffocated in this house and I know even when I'm in college I won't have any freedom either. I also know it'd be a better environment for me to live in and finish my degrees, work, just live my life in general. Me and my boyfriend have both made our decision to leave our houses by the time I turn 18 next year and get jobs till then to financially support ourselves when we move out, he's renting a car to pick me up right after my birthday. I know it's a hasty decision but I would've been looking for a roommate anyways because it's so difficult to live here but I'm so lucky to have found him and I know even if things didn't work out between us we'd still be able to live as roommates. I have decided not to inform my parents because they'd most likely try to stop me and just lock me up, however his moms more understanding and open minded so there's no issues from his side. We've done a lot of research on all the fees, security deposits, utilities it takes to actually get an apartment. Along with researching OSAP loans, grants, etc. I'm planning on becoming a nurse and he also is going into a program he likes, and we're starting that path after we move in together. Even though we've tried doing in depth research we feel like there's things we don't know and we wanna be fully prepared when we make that decision. 

  
Questions:

  
Through our research we decided it's best to move to Ottawa, but since he'd be moving to a whole new province we were confused on how he would switch his health card, if he would need to retake his drivers license, if he's eligible for OSAP when he moves here or would he have to wait a year, if so can he use the Quebec student loan program in Ontario? As well as, if he can buy an apartment here because with my situation I wouldn't be able to apartment hunt with him? and also how difficult it would be? 

  
Another question we had was if my debit is under my parents name in a joint account right now because I'm not 18. If I worked and all my money was going into that account, when the time comes would I be able to deposit my money into a personal account when the time comes? Would they be informed if I do so? Would I need their permission?

  
Also since my parents don't know I'd be moving out, they'd most likely ask me to enroll in a college or uni as soon as I've graduated and start applying so I can be prepared for my first year. I wanted to know when they take tuition fees, I know there's a cost to applying but I want to know the steps after I'm done applying, because I don't wanna pay for something if I'd be moving to a whole new city. Along with how to apply after I've moved out, and for my boyfriend if he can enroll in a college in Ontario with his Quebec high school diploma?

  
Lastly, we just need basic advice on buying an apartment and living on your own in a new city etc (new province for him). We already know the basics such as buying one near a college and transportation etc. As well as the importance of a credit score when buying an apartment, I think one of us would already have a credit score by the time because he's gonna be 18 in a month. But I still need to know all the expenses and hidden fees that come with this stuff for when we move out.   


I know this is a lot but if you took the time to read it I really appreciate it, and any advice is really helpful and appreciated. Thank you :)",16Aug2020,1

962," I have a immense fear of failure, for example “I thought my “thing” was small, which leads to me thinking I get cheated on or embarrassed. This fear of mine doesn’t pair well with the fact I over think so much and I plan for future so much. I constantly struggle with making eye contact with people, even my friends. I don’t know why but In my mind I feel like I have to achieve, and what I don’t understand is that what’s there to achieve at 16? Like why do I have this quota to complete?


More information about my anxiety:
I don’t raise my hand in class for fear of being wrong and making a fool out of myself.

I don’t make eye contact with people and I just started making eye contact with my family when I talk to them.

I often feel myself get hot and red in the ears when every I do experience that “awkwardness/anxiety”.

I doubt myself way too much.

“Also when I was younger my friends would mess with me (ditch me, not play games with me,and when they do it’s only for there benefits.) All of this had no reason too,leading me to think It was my fault,kids can be cruel.

I honestly feel like I can’t find any good friends.

I could be wrong about this fear so tell me what it sound like to you?

967,"Hello,

So, I left College (I live in the UK so if you're residing in the States that's late High-School I believe), in early January; for a multitude of reasons. I was studying Law, Politics and History at A-Level, all of which I have interests in and am passionate about (especially History and Law), but the courses were mind numbingly boring and repetitive. As in individual I really struggle mentally to take in and study things I have zero interest in, it goes in one ear and out the other, I envy those of you who can sit and study a topic you have literally no interest in. Before this over hanging stress of College, I too had problems throughout secondary school, bullied at two schools, physical and mental abuse from my Mother, was falsely accused of rape (the girl was caught out by Police for changing her story every time and eventually admitted it didn't happen) which, although I did nothing wrong, knowing what kids are like and gossiping, it had an affect on me. Struggling with depression, and spending a period of time in the hospital with an eating disorder and overdose throughout. (want to mention here also that the above list is quite heavy; I never ever talk about this to my Mother, or friends, and don't want to be perceived as an attention seeking shit who posts pictures of their anti-depressants on Snapchat for recognition etc and to put other people down and make them feel like they can't talk about their feelings, I completely understand that)

&amp;#x200B;

With basic context now, after leaving I decided I was finally going to do the things I wanted to do and make me happy, mainly travelling! Living each day as if it were my last and being happy and present, which is so important. Alas I got a job at my local supermarket, much to the dismay of my mother who had been pressuring me and screaming abuse at me for leaving and doing the above, and began saving for a working 2 year visa in Canada (my favourite country and a place I've wanted to move to since I can remember, with this plan I was finally starting to feel better, I was grafting for it, I live in the middle of nowhere and had to walk 6 miles there and 6 miles back on windy country lanes to work manual labour work, but was happy I was finally doing something I wanted to do. Then with Covid-19 hitting I lost my job and only recently got a new one (living in the middle of nowhere and my local town not even having a fast food restaurant there was little opportunity for an 18 year old to compete. 

Now however, although I have found work again and can finally start working towards travelling, I have again come under the fire of abuse from my Mother, every single day we argue - her saying the only way I can achieve anything in life is by getting a qualification, which I have no interest in doing, or else I will end up homeless and a failure etc. berating me for growing my hair out, turning vegan and running (calling me, in a derogatory way, a fucking Ethiopian) and playing guitar, watching documentaries on Ai Wei Wei, or Pink Floyd, things I find interesting, saying I am in dreamy land and so on and so forth.

With the above, I ask strangers the titled question, am I being childish? immature? stupid for leaving and doing what I've always wanted to do to make me happy? Or, is my mothers constant judging justified? Her worry's fair? 

Or to put it more simply, am I in the wrong, or is she in the wrong? What should I do as a whole?

968," I don’t exactly live in the fanciest part of town, but our neighborhood has always been quiet. About 9 months ago, a new family moved into the house across the street from us. They are extremely noisy and love to blast their music all hours of the day and night. It is so loud that the sound literally rattles our windows. They started out only playing this loud music on weekends, so we initially tried to ignore it. But over the past 3 months, this has been an everyday occurrence. They sometimes will go from 10 am to 1 am. My mom works from home and my dad is a chemo patient who needs his rest, so we are quite frustrated.

 My dad has called the cops about a half dozen times. This is only a temporary fix as they go right back to blasting their music within hours of the cops leaving. My parents are afraid to talk to these neighbors about their music, as we have been told horror-stories about neighbors getting their tires slashed or dogs poisoned after speaking up about loud music. 

 Is there anything that I can do about this? I have thought about writing them a (polite) letter with a gift card attached, but I don’t know if this is a good idea. Any suggestions are appreciated!

971,"TL;DR someone young sounding called me scared and crying, looking for their mom. It did not feel like a normal conversation. The terror was evident in their voice, and I don't know what to do since I couldn't help and I don't think there's any way for me to help now.


I just got a call from a Mexican phone number (I am only a few hours from the border so it's not weird to me). However upon answering I was met with the crying of someone who was well spoken (not super young) but young sounding enough to have me worried immediately. He/she (I'm going to use 'they' because I'm really not sure) thought they were calling their mother and was crying, asking me, in accent tinged English, ""Mom, can you please come pick me up?."" I was so shocked at first trying to figure out what was going on that I don't remember the actual first thing they said before that...I think they might have said where they were. Or that something had happened. I said I think you have the wrong number and they spoke over me saying something like 'No, please. Mom can you come here. Can you come pick me up?' I said I'm so sorry and to get across that I'm not the person they're looking for I said that I'm in my 20s...my brain died as I tried to get it across -albeit not in the best way, maybe- that I couldn't have a child their age given how old I am. I dunno, it was the best I came up with in half a second. 

I was trying to think quickly about what to ask... Should I ask can you try calling her again? I'm in New Mexico, is she here and you need to contact her? Are you at the border? I know not everyone is genuine in this world and scam calls are a fact of life in the US now...but the sobbing and tone of voice that sounded like they were terrified has absolutely broken my heart and I'm left not knowing what to do. I wanted to help. 

I really, really hope that they made the phone call again when they hung up (before I managed to get my brain functioning and respond further they ended the call -which would be for the best of they truly could try contacting their mom again). 

Now, though, my thoughts are all over the place because it was a desperate call for help, and it didn't reach the intended recipient. 

My SO has pointed out that they could have had a horrible day and just needed picking up from outside of school, or fútbol practice...anywhere mundane.

But I can't stop thinking about how they acted through the entire call like they couldn't really hear me...maybe it was because of the emotional state and adrenaline they were in. Maybe it was some third party holding the phone. This makes me wish I could at the very least flag the phone number in case it is a known potential connection to something shady... The background noise seemed like they were in a warehouse or office space, though. Not alone outside. Their accent was not one I was used to hearing around here, either. 

What am I supposed to do? Any advise? As far as I'm aware there's nothing I can do. There might even be no reason for any concern. All of my instincts are on fire, though, and it feels wrong to move on and forget about this phone call that was not intended for me.",16Aug2020,1

974,"I hope this is okay, and I'm not being a total idiot posting this. I'm 21F, for context. Buckle your seat belts, it's going to be a long one. Multiple friends have told me that the situation isn't right, and I'm looking for strangers to tell me the same haha. 

Also for context, I have an illness called premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It's a hormone condition that mimics depression, anxiety and other illnesses. It also causes severe fatigue, aches and pains (to paraphrase). However, I'm currently taking medication for it and I'm over the worst - I just have occasional flare ups. 

Tonight, I had a gin and lemonade after work. I had it whilst watching an old film and doing some embroidery. Because of my medication, it physically made me a little tired and slurry, though mentally, I felt fine. I was never told by my doctor to avoid alcohol and it isn't mentioned in my medication's paperwork. It's just my personal reaction to it, which I didn't realise would be so noticeable. I just really liked the look of the gin - it was on offer in the supermarket, and I just fancied trying a glass before sharing it with friends later in the week!

Well, my mum kicked off when she walked in and somehow twigged I'd had a drink. Apparently I'm a terrible person for having a drink when I was doing so well. I'm not really ill, and I could snap out of it if I wanted. She threatened to take my medication away,  as it was sitting on the side in her reach. The fact that I'm ill is apparently a slight on her, and that she's failed me as a parent. When I attempted to explain PMDD as a mental and physical illness, she just told me I was being ridiculous and that it was making her feel guilty.

This has been going on for months. When finally sought help, I was apparently bad for telling the doctor more than I told her. Her actual words were ""I'm glad you're getting better though, because you've been really hard work the past few months"". Bear in mind that this was at a time when I was considering my own life. 

Even before I was ill (came on when I was 20), I wasn't allowed to drink at home. I had a curfew of 10pm - at 20. I was screamed at if my mum smelt even the slightest whiff of alcohol on me. I've had to fight to go back to uni in a couple of weeks to collect books for my dissertation research - apparently she would miss me too much, so I can't go for more than a night. (originally, she said she was going to come with me). Not sure they'll take that as an excuse for me failing to do my summer dissertation research...

I have a car. The car is mine, and I pay for the insurance and uptake of it. I have been financially independent from my parents since the age of 16. I work part time, and it was actually my manager who said that my living situation sounded a bit odd. I have a house at uni. I pay for the rent myself through my wages and student loan, with no financial help from my parents.

I could drive away in the morning, and only tell them when I got to uni, 150 miles away. 

The only thing keeping me here is an emotional attachment to my parents. I have been told that I have a responsibility to my family. I just don't know if I'm being a total, utter cow. I just can't see a reason to stay here. I just feel so relaxed at uni, and I didn't want to come home when I last left.

There is nothing good here. There is an escape, but I don't know if I should take it. Any advice - even if it's telling me I'm an ungrateful cow - would be welcome. Thank you, I know this was a rant and a half!",16Aug2020,1

Please skip to the end of backstory divider if you don’t want to read all this, this is just some history behind my reasonings that way I don’t just come off as some hot headed kid who wants to leave for no reason.


I’m in an extremely abusive house hold right now. Not physically abusive (anymore because cps got involved) but my therapists agree that being in his house makes my mental health worse every single second I’m here. My sister moved out as soon as she turned 18 and never contacted us again. She left a note saying it was for her mental health. They always compare me to her and say things like “you don’t want to leave because she got a very harsh taste of reality”.

Every dream or opportunity I’ve wanted to pursue has been shut down for their own personal dislike for it, but now I think it’s about control, because they only want me to pursue things they want me to do, they want me to be their perfect image of their legacy. I wanted to dance as a child, but I was only allowed to do ballet, I quit. I wanted to be a cheerleader, but they never allowed me. Now that opportunity I cut off forever. I wanted to do gymnastics more than anything. They never let me. Then one day they took me to one class and then never let me go again, which I cried over. And plenty of other opportunities like that.

I’m almost 17 and have been studying Japanese intensely after becoming enticed with the culture almost a year ago. I study almost everyday for about an hour or two. Previously it was just me wanting to learn a new language, and go on a language school trip I qualify for. The moment I shared this with them I was met with the “thats not possible” lecture. Because they weren’t going to pay for it. So I got a job and have been saving up intensely for the trip. Ever since I decided japan is where I’d love to live for the rest of my life they have been treating me differently, almost like a child who killed their sibling on accident and the parents are trying to hide their resentment, if that makes sense.

—————-END OF BACKSTORY——————

Because of how controlling my parents are and how they bring me down Everytime I show independent thought, they won’t educate me on things most people know/learn from their parents by my age. They want me to depend on them and live with them till I’m 22 (they’ve said this multiple times). Recently they’ve been getting more and more mentally damaging and I’ve deciding I need to do what my sister did and move out as soon as I can. I asked them how to do taxes because I have a job which means I have to pay those now, but it led to an argument and a lecture. They wouldn’t tell me much.

I need to know all the things adults should know if they want to be independent. Things like taxes, laws, payments, visas, schooling, savings and stuff like that. But I don’t even know where to look for this info. Can any of you kind adults please educate me in your ways, perhaps with resources of anything of the like?

TLDR: my parents never want me to move out and won’t tell me anything about taxes and other things adults do so that I won’t be able to be independent, but they are abusive. I need to educate myself on everything I need to know to move out and live as an adult without accidentally evading taxes or something.",16Aug2020,1
976,"Hi! I (F19) would love to receive some advice about improving low self esteem.

Ever since I was in sixth grade, I've had very low self esteem, particularly in my physical appearance. I have insecurities about my personality as well, but those are at a more moderate level while I'm mortified about my appearance beyond a normal amount. Looking in the mirror, looking in cameras, and ESPECIALLY when others take photos of me and I see them later, my stomach drops. I can't really do anything without being mortified of my appearance, even when I'm alone, but especially in public/ when I'm around other individuals. I have made progress, I used to be very underweight from excessive cardio and lack of calories but now have focused on building muscle and maintaining a healthy weight. Still, I feel extremely limited due to my self esteem; I deeply desire to be able to see my reflection and not feel immediate dread.

I've dealt with this for so long that I felt it was simply a part of me and assumed that since it does not affect anyone besides me, it's a self-created problem I can live with. However, ever since I started dating my first boyfriend (M20) I realized that my self esteem could sabotage my relationships with him or my friends if I let it get out of control again... I constantly compare myself to other girls he interacts with and I let it get to my head and convince myself that, even though he treats me like a queen and gives me no reason to worry, I am simply not attractive enough for him. Also, I struggle with making eye contact with him for long, when people look at me in general I get uncomfy and I have an underlying fear that at some point he will look at me for too long and see in me the ugliness I see in myself. Overall, I feel like my self esteem prevents me from being truly vulnerable in relationships (both platonic and romantic) and it doesn't feel fair to my boyfriend to compare myself to girls from his past and create hypothetical scenarios in my head.

I don't want to divulge into the specifics of my insecurities but they are very intense and I think this is because I solidified those ideas into my head from such a young age and nurtured the self-loathing throughout middle and high school. I'm not sure where they originated from, no one has insulted my appearance to my face before or anything, but I have a hunch that growing up with Instagram and Snapchat and all those beauty-focused social medias has been a major factor. I engage in negative self-talk often and have been trying to alter this habit for months but I've been unsuccessful thus far. As far as therapy goes, my family pretty much forced it upon me when I was partaking in disordered eating, and I really hated therapy and have never gone back since then. I would love to hear advice alternative to therapy but if anyone feels strongly that that's the correct route to go, I'm open to hearing that as well. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this, much love.

TLDR; I have very low self esteem (particularly about appearance) and want to get better to improve my relationships.",16Aug2020,1

986,"I'll try to keep this post as short as I can, skip to the last section for the main question

Context: since 4th grade I've always had trouble making friends. 5th grade I switched schools twice, 6th grade I went to this christian private school and 7th grade I went back to one of the schools I went To in 5th grade (mid school starts at grade 5 where I'm at, and I moved schools alot due to financial problems). Anyways, the two main schools that are important for this are the christian school that's we'll call S1 and the other public school that we'll call S2.

So up until 7th grade I had no friends, but this year in S2 I actually tried to be more social and extroverted and for the first time in my life I actually made some friends that I was happy with and even built up a decent reputation for myself but then quarantine came around. Quarantine was tough for me, I went through depression, relationship problems, trauma, a suicide attempt, and am still going through some of this stuff right now. I wish I could reconnect with some of my friends which would help me alot, but my school announced that they're staying closed until circumstances change and we'll be doing online work again, but there is a chance they might reopen this year. On the other hand my mom said if I want to, I can go back to S1 because they're going to be opened this year. But it's a christian school and I am no longer a christian, so I'd have them be shoving a religion I don't believe in down my throat.



So my options are:

A) go to S1, start over and be the new kid again, try to make some new friends, all while going to school centered around a religion I don't believe in but at least it's in person and I can socialize

B) Go to S2, suffer through isolation and online school again with a possibility of them reopening and seeing all my friends and continuing trying to build what I had at that school.

Risk of coronavirus is not a factor in this decision

Also it's 8th grade and I'll be going into high school after this year so maybe it doesn't even matter",16Aug2020,1

989,"Whoever reads the whole text, I’m sending love to you :)

Soo I (f22) have been in love with a guy (25) for almost 4 years.. I met him when we just had started college and we immediately hit it off.. our love was very passionate and we moved quick to dating. Unfortunately this only lasted about 2 months and he broke up with me for reasons I cannot understand even today? 
He basically said he loved me but for some reason he just could not be with me...

Ever since we have been spending a lot of time and also hooking up, nothing about our connection and our feelings changed, we just stopped talking about them and there was no sort of commitment officially but unofficially we were just about each other.. at some point this became just too hurtful for me. I could not understand why he was not able to commit and started doubting myself and became self conscious even though I knew I was not the problem.. after about 3 years of ,that‘ situation he started encouraging me to start seeing other people because he was feeling guilty as I started to ,wait for him to commit‘. Eventually I met someone I liked and felt like I needed to cut things with my ex, so I did. I know it has been very hard for him. I saw this other guy for about 2 months or so... as soon as I ended things with him I went back to my ex and we hooked up once and went back to going seperate ways.. some months later I got into a relationship which was quiet nice and for the first time I knew I was still able to love (silly me thought I wasn’t capable of that anymore).
During that time my ex and I had to see each other as we were having the same courses.. he kept asking how my relationship was going and it felt kinda scetchy to me but I guess he just really cared for me and my happiness and wanted to see me thrive.

Of course that relationship only lasted for about 6 months and naturally my ex and I reconnected and it became clear that I still had a sweet spot for him (why else would we always get drawn back to each other?) we met up and hooked up after which he asked if I wanted to spend time with him (as in a date but without the title). In that moment I remembered all the pain I had felt and how sad I was and out of fear I said I did not want to do that because it took me so long to ,get over him‘.. however we kept in contact and at some point this turned into casual meet ups where we would hook up but I swear I felt the connection we always used to have and I could tell he was growing back the feelings he had for me.. So I said: hey I would be willing to try dating you again as time has passed, we have grown individually and I still feel our connection. To which he answered that he still was just not ready but admires my bravery and wants to emphasize that I am not the problem. 
However we kept hooking up after that and my feelings just intensified and I guess so did his because he kept telling me he was scared to get emotionally invested.

Fast forward to some weeks ago he told me it would be better if we wouldnt hook up so frequently because he has the impression I was still having hope (he was not wrong tho).
And that was it. That was my sign to back out and I told him I wanted to end things completely, once and for all. And so we did. Ever since I have been feeling miserable but I‘m trying to embrace all my emotions and let myself grieve because I also lost a great friend whom I had a lot in common with and literally the best conversations... 
I just have a very strong feeling that we are supposed to be together and that this is ,real love’. I‘m really struggling to keep myself from reaching out but somehow I also think I probably will love him forever but maybe I should do that from afar? 

I know this is like really a ,modern love story‘ its very typical for my generation.. anyone experienced something similar? How have you dealt with the situation, how did you recover? Did you experience a happy ending? What are your general thoughts on this story?",16Aug2020,1

994,"Last night my GF and I (LDR) were video chatting, and while we were, she was pulled into her brother's room along with his GF. All of them were drunk, I was a little buzzed. Sooner or later I overheard they were gonna roll a joint. 

Now, I have no problem with people who smoke weed/drink. At all. Hell, I even drink myself. I just don't like to be there when people smoke weed (even though I wasn't there *there*) because my family has a huge history of drug/alcohol usage. I've seen some nightmare worthy shit come out of drugs. Heads up, I have lots of trauma surrounding drugs.

Anyway, they're passing the joint, I'm just watching my GF smoke. After it's all over with, we video chat for a while longer, and I realize I was feeling somewhat deattached from not only the conversation but my GF. It eventually passed but today I can't stop thinking about it. 

I knew my GF smoked weed once in a blue moon. We've discussed that I don't like to be approached when someone smells of weed/alcohol/smoke. She's agreed and said that it's only polite and respectful to get rid of the smell for people who don't like to be approached when that smell lingers.

I know weed isn't a gateway drug or anything. My girlfriend actually sobered up when she smoked so her behavior wasn't the issue. The drinking wasn't either, she's actually very lovey dovey when she's been drinking.

 **I think I just had an issue with watching someone I love very dearly engage in this activity, which I have associated with my family history/trauma. That is MY issue, not hers.**

I ask myself why didn't I just hang up. This was the first time I was actually meeting her brother/his GF, so I didn't want to leave a bad impression. I know I should have simply told my girl I'd catch her later or something, but we rarely get time to video chat these days, and I obviously wasn't thinking clearly.

I need a little advice. So my house has a fairly large garden. We have 4 neighbours at our border walls, who also have fairly big gardens. All this outside space means all four neighbours have cats.

I also have a cat. She’s 15, sweet as anything, and very scared of the neighbour cats. 
My cat’s entry and exit to the garden is through my bedroom window. 
A couple nights ago one of these cats came right up to my bedroom window and shrieked at my cat who was on her way out, and again last night, chased her from the garden to my window. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but it is the first in quite a while.

Now I’m 30, three degrees into a subject I never particularly enjoyed (economics/business admin/marketing), with years of experience of teaching English and a teaching qualification. Finally decided to do a masters to reroute my career and get solid education.

After some setback I got into my top-choice programme. Was super chuffed and accepted it, but a week later got an offer from another university with a £10K scholarship (that’s more than half of my tuition fees).

Now I have savings to cover either case, but going to the second option would leave my back account £15.5K better off. If I go to dream school, I’ll be doing away with most of my savings.

With the Covid still being rampant in the UK, at least the first semester will be online. I’m not sure I want to pay full tuition for an experience that isn’t something I dreamed about (deferring for a year is not an option for me unfortunately). The second programme is perfectly fine, a great option and people seem lovely but it’s not quite what I wanted.

He even offered to pay her! He then sent another, uh, penis photograph. My friend cussed him out and proceeded to block and report him one more time.

He then made a third account! He is now using it to spam her with sexual messages like telling her he wants to eat her hoo-ha and stuff like that. He insists he's in love with her and that he's enamoured with her. Gross. My friend threatened to report him to the police but he didn't seem bothered by that.

The thing is, blocking and reporting him isn't doing anything since he just keeps making new accounts. I read the messenger thing and, from what I understood, the most we can do is block him and hope he doesn't make a new account. We looked up our country's (we live in Greece) cybercrime laws but they aren't really clear so we don't know what to do. I've been trying to get her to call the police, simply to ask them what to do but shes worried her mom will find out and take her phone away.

Is there anything she can do to get her to permanently stop texting her? It has reached a point where she is genuinely worried about her safety since he asked her where she lives.

1005,"Hello there,
Before starting I just want to state that my english is not the best.
I am from a country in europe, where high school works different from other places (most likely) , and I will try to explain this the best way possible.

When you graduate from 9th grade you go to high school (I think that's what it's called?) and in high school you need to apply for a certain ""degree"" that you want to follow (Medicine, Science, etc.).
Since I'm not really interested in Medicine and etc. I decided to apply for IT (Not sure if that's the correct name) and I just had to do an IQ test and I got accepted, I decided to apply for IT since I've done quite a bit of programming before.

The issue is that I'm like the worst person at math that ever existed, I had the worst grade at math since 7th grade, and IT has the highest degree of math, and I need good/decent grades to graduate. 

People told me to not worry, that it is not bad at all, but school starts in a few weeks and I'm starting to stress out alot about this.

I know I should've tried to learn math after school ended, but I didn't. 

I've tried in the past to learn math but I'm still terrible at it.

I'm honestly looking for tips, I can't really go back now.",16Aug2020,1
1006,"My wife and I got married a year ago. Two years before that, Greg had approached her at a library and was courting her, and wanting to take her on a date, with the explicit intention to marry her. He was 56, she was 24. My wife and I are both in our late 20's right now.

They had a coffee, they were brief friends, and he even talked to her mom at one point in person, who clearly was against it and told that to his face. My wife was not happy with his persistence, didn't like him, and blocked him on all social channels after explicitly telling him to not contact her any more.

Months later, he texts the mom again asking how my wife is doing, the mom never responded.

Just yesterday, we got a handwritten letter in the mail from Greg. He said that he looked up her address online and wanted to make sure she was ok in all of this COVID-19 mess, bragging about his new job promotions, and giving his address and phone numbers in case she wanted to reconnect.

This is a gross overstep, this is violating, and she's made it explicitly clear that she wanted no more contact. From her perspective, she's mad, upset, and has solid war-like mindsets so she knows what a disaster this can become, but she also says that he's not the type to physically harm, but this is coming more from loneliness and delusion.

I'm going to call him tomorrow morning, since we know that he doesn't know that she's married. I also know that in my state, we have a 2-party-consent law for recording conversations so I can't exactly record this call in case anything goes south.

My wife, I, and her mom have ruled out the option of staying silent (in hopes that he thinks he got the wrong address or it got lost in the mail or something). He has relative power in this small town, he works for a Fortune 500 company, and has a strategic and methodical mindset so I want to play this right.

Is there anything I should know before calling him up tomorrow morning? Anything I should or should not say? I want to play this right from the beginning so that this doesn't escalate into something that needs more aggressive action taken.",16Aug2020,1
1007,"I have a friend (not much of a friend anymore) who goes out everyday of the week buys alcohol and gets drunk after work. The problem is that the entire time he drinks he sits in his car drinks a case of beer about an hour then drives around aimlessly all night. 

This same friend was almost killed when his other friend got in a serious accident while drunk and that still never opened his eyes. 

I know the person well and know where he drinks everyday and am tempted to report it so he gets a DWI. There’s no excuses for that at all and I’ve tried talking to him but he doesn’t take anyone’s advice. I don’t want to see one of my other friends who are dumb enough to get into the same vehicle, or some random person on the road to get hurt or killed because of his recklessness. It makes him a total POS in my opinion. 

Would I be an asshole for reporting this? the main thing I’m afraid of is the situation getting tied to me and I get sh*t on for doing it, I want it to be completely anonymous and make it seem like a random person in the neighbourhood reported it.",16Aug2020,1
1008,"So I was scrolling through TikTok, and I stumbled upon a video of someone I know. I noticed she was using a different name, but it was unmistakably her. So to be sure, I went to the Instagram linked in her bio, and arrived on a page with lots of lewds, not the Intagram she gave me when we met. There, I found even more social media. Her Reddit (which I will not be sharing for her privacy) and her Twitter, on both of those she posts full nude pictures.

Don't get me wrong, I support sex workers and I think she's an absolute badass for doing this kind of stuff, but it feels weird in some way? Here's my main concerns.

-I'm a minor (she's not of course. We're not that far apart, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I'm a minor.)

-I haven't told her I found her yet, and I don't believe she knows I saw it.

-Her using a different name makes me think she's trying to hide it from everyone. I feel like I wasn't supposed to know.

I'm not sure what I'm to do. Of course I'm not gonna like. Show any friends, I have that much common sense. But like, do I tell her I know? Do I not tell her at all?",16Aug2020,1
1010,"*short version below
Long version: My parents don't seem to care AT ALL about me. Since my surgery (tonsilectomy), they have made no attempt to be quiet or let me rest. My bedroom is in the basement, and the contantly barge into my room when I'm trying to sleep to do laundry. They leave the light on, are loud, and don't even turn off the light when they are done. They scream and fight all the time and are loud. When I ask to sleep, then they say I don't need sleep and to wake up. I feel miserable and I'm starting to get a fever now.They won't get me food. I can only have soft foods and liquids. They keep sarcastically saying that ""I won't eat"" every time I ask for food. For example, I ask if I can have soup, and they're like ""I would make you soup, but you won't eat it. I'm not buyung you anything."" Like their logic doesn't even make sense? I haven't eaten more than applesauce in a few days and I'm starting to feel very week and ill. My grandma is over and just offered to make me some food, and my mom yelled at her. It's like she doesn't want me to eat or something. Then there's the medicine. My doctor prescribed me pain medicine and antibiotics, and after a day or so of letting me use it, she threw it in the garbage and said I'm fine. I'm not fine! My surgery site is bleeding, I can't even talk, I am having problems breathing, can't even move my neck, etc. We had a fight about this, which I ended up yelling and making my throat bleed. I ended up having to dig through the entire trash. I feel like she's trying to sabotage my recovery and cause me pain. What parent would throw their kids medicine away after a surgery that the doctor prescribed? They mock the way I talk, because my voice sounds different. They constantly scream at me and make me to feel terrible. My parents are always like this, but it feels like they are trying to make me feel worse.

Short version: I feel extremely ill because my parents won't let me recover. They don't have soft foods in the house for me to eat, they threw away my pain medicine and antibiotics, they wont let me rest, and they just treat me like overall crap.",16Aug2020,1

Hi, i just need some advice or something please. 
Me (F17). i’m about to take a massive step in my life and go into the military my date is in a week. 

There is this guy (M20) that i’ve known since high school but never really was into each other due to the age gap, and that he was in a relationship. we would casually say hi and smile to each other as we walked past each other, be being 14 and him being 17, i was just into the fact that an “older” guy was talking to me. In 2018 i moved away from my hometown to live 25 hours away with my older sister. A month after i left Him and i started texting more and more, flirting on and off. Then i was ghosted.... 
In december 2019 i flew down to my hometown to catch up with my family and close friends. I attended a party and happen to see him there, we were both really uncomfortable due to the fact we both knew he ghosted me😂😂😂. we ended up talking and laughing all night, then to wake up the next morning to him leaving and basically ghosting me, i was into him so much that i was asking him to hang out before i left to go back up to where i was living, but he refused. After new years i flew back home.

about 2 months later he started texting me and flirting again, and this has been going on ever since, calling, flirting, ect. He has supported me through the stress of all my navy stuff, and cared for me as much as he could when i was sick or upset. It felt like such a fairytale to me as someone i’ve known for a while and never really felt a connection, i am so in love with now. he genuinely is the best any guy has treated me. We never wanted to make it official as the distance. We both have done long distance in the past and just never worked out. I would always talk about coming back down to my hometown before i have to leave to the navy to see everyone, but it just never happened, due to school. 

Towards the end of july i ended up dropping out of school because i passed all my exams and paperwork. so here i am back in my hometown. Trying to spend as much time with him, my friends and my family. 

My mum does not like him ... will not give him a chance due to our ages, which is odd because both my sisters have dated guys way older then them when they were my age... she refuses to even give him a chance, and little does she know he is the nicest guy, and he treats me so good. (she’s just lowkey really strict). so lucky i’m good at sneaky around, which is something i really dont want to have to do but can’t not when you just feel trapped. (my mum has done this for years, one of the reasons why i moved in the first place, just always was isolated and depressed) 

I’m in my last week coming up to my date. And i’m just not sure what to do between me and him, i want to try and make it work with distance (because i can guarantee that i’m just gonna be moved around everywhere) but also i don’t want to be held back or hold him back. i want the best for him and i don’t think the distance is going to be good for both of us...

I just wanted to know if it is possible to delete pictures from both sides on messenger... I got out of an abusive relationship last year, but the other person still has images containing personal data and pictures of myself, and since they're rather impulsive and have an explosive personality, I'm afraid the texts and pictures can be used out of context for malicious purposes, especially because I am finally in a good and stable relationship. 

I don't want to ask the person directly since it might trigger them to blackmail me etc etc (I know that putting myself out there on fb is dangerous but I was young and trusted this person at the time). 

Is there anything I can do to delete the pictures and some messages, or even the chat completely so that they don't have access to it anymore? If it helps in any way, we currently live in different countries but have friends in common with one another.

1017,"The game is called osu!, look it up yourself. Long story short, I haven't played this game for 3 years due to busy high school graduation and first two years of university. Now that I'm on a summer vacation I decided to play it again because I missed it. Originally, I quit this game for 4 reasons: 1) I simply had no time, 2) I was jealous of others being extremely talented and improving their skills at a fast rate (it's a skill based game) , 3) Due to all that jealousy, Rage, constant anger at myself for not being as good as othrrs which drove me to the point where I didn't enjoy the game anymore and 4) Keyboard sounds really annoys everyone in my family, even a membrane keyboard which is much quieter than mechanical keyboards ( I have cherry mx reds for those wondering). The last one is what really makes me hesitate at this current moment but university begins next months and I won't have as much time for gaming, especially considering this year is gonna be even busier than the last two. I know, this game definitely isn't something worth my enitre life but I wanna be able to play this game for as long as possible, for as long as I find it fun, thoough, pbviously, my circumstances don't favor me at all. 

Any lind of help is appreciated. Thanks In advance.",16Aug2020,1

School starts tomorrow and I’m not organized I don’t even know how I’m supposed to start and how this online school thing will work out I’m constantly overthinking it and making myself nervous and this feeling I can’t describe I feel anxious and worried about everything.

I’ve been depressed for a long time and I just don’t know what to do I’m honestly clueless at this point what makes matters worse is apparently I had a summer reading assignment I had no idea about cause no one told me and it’s due in 2 weeks and I haven’t even gotten the book which just brings me more stress for that stuff I have to prepare for school today and for the first day of school tomorrow.

I feel so bad all this is stressing me out, and now there’s this different feeling sum feeling all of a sudden I was embarrassed a few days ago and I’m a sensitive person (I don’t wanna be sensitive I wanna learn how to be stronger and happier) and I feel that embarrassment screwed with my head to the point I don’t feel like myself I don’t feel like the funny, witty guy I was I feel so blank and dull, I don’t know why I feel this I just want it to end I wanna learn how to bring back my self-esteem, confidence, and happiness. 

then there’s this girl I’ve been trying to restore my friendship with everything is going well for sure but it’s just that, I don’t know I feel like the only way I can talk to her now is through the friend Group FaceTime’s.

I wanna talk to her but idk if she wants to I haven’t even asked and yeah, I’m overthinking it but I just can’t stop I rather ft her alone and then there’s the thoughts of what if I’m not creative and funny enough cause of what I’m feeling currently I know I should take a step back for awhile.

I’m clueless I don’t know what to do with myself I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom  I don’t wanna feel anxious.

So I'm really at a fork in the road right now, and I'm having a hard time deciding on what would be the best way to go right now. Any advice from yall would be appreciated!

I'm 30 years old and living with family in Alabama after being furloughed from my job due to the virus, and I've been thinking about the path going forward. I've spent most of my life in Alabama, and I'm *really* ready to just get a job somewhere and move, get my own place, and finally start my life proper yknow? 

Thing is, my degree is in Media Studies. I've got little experience and little passion for the industry, but the potential for pay is pretty good depending on what you do. Playing my cards right, I'd be able to have the money to have my own place, pursue my hobbies, and live okay as a single dude even though I'd probably have no love for my job at best. I know that a change of scenery and true independence would absolutely do me good though.

On the other hand, being at home and near my university gives me a chance to potentially go back to school for another degree. See, I love being outdoors and working with animals (volunteered at a raptor rehab center for a while) so I've been looking at a career change into wildlife/marine biology. 

I made it out of my last degree with zero debt, but I'd be shouldering the full cost of another one (assuming I get no financial aid). I'd also be facing living with my family and being in Alabama for another 3-ish years; I love my family but that idea is a turn-off. I'd also never make the kind the money I would in Media and, with rent prices everywhere jumping up, I worry that I'd be facing a future of roommates. Still, I know I'd be happier doing the work I was doing, and I'd mostly be outdoors (I hope). 

It feels like a leap of faith either way, and I worry that if I don't go back to school NOW then I never will. Could I have both? Get a job, move somewhere, wait for residency and attempt school then? 

I guess it all comes down to whether I want to '""work to live"" or ""live to work"" and which is more worth it to me. Any advice from people who have faced the same choice?

Thanks all!

TL;DR: Can't choose between getting a job and moving away, or staying home and getting another degree for a career change",16Aug2020,1

BUT the friend this post is about is the exception. they are probably the best friend i've ever had and that i've actually consistently talked to for a long time, and over the course of the past few months i feel like we've become more distanced? maybe it's because we don't see each other basically everyday because of school, but i feel like she doesn't want to talk to me anymore? the past few weeks especially have been getting worse because now we don't even text that much and even when i try and text more first(which i'm really bad at doing, but we're pretty equal in initiating) i feel like she doesn't really reply with the same energy? we talk about our days and stuff but it's pretty standard because we're both kinda stuck at home, and she says that her conversations with other people are pretty boring nowadays too but i still feel like it's just me. i might also feel this way because we've been trying to meet up for like a month and a half in person but something always comes up. i think we've had to cancel on each other equally but i also feel like i care more about actually hanging out because i'm always the one that asks what's up with our plans. i also might just be feeling fomo because i know she's been hanging out with and talking a lot with other people from social media and stuff, but i feel like she doesn't actually want to hang out with me. like, she never brings it up? am i supposed to bring it up more? i dont know. so that added to the fact that she doesn't try and talk with me as much has me feeling like she doesn't value our friendship that much :( i don't know if these feelings are a me problem and maybe i've idealized what having a best friend is supposed to be like, but i don't know what to say to her. should i tell her all these things i'm feeling? the last time we weren't really talking i asked why and if she was mad at me or something and she just said she didn't have much to say so...would she care? i just want to keep being friends and i don't know what to do and it feels like she doesn't really need me as a friend even though i consider her really close to me. if you guys have a lot of close friends or know what to do that would be really helpful:))",16Aug2020,1

She’s since updated her Hinge profile twice and rarely answers me anymore. That confused me so much because we hit it off like a candle and flame, wanting to meet IRL, and now I feel discarded. 

The total progress we’ve made is FaceTiming for an hour and sending video and audio messages, yet all of that ended with me being the only one enthusiastic enough to arrange a first date. We shared so many common interests before. She finally texts me, “I go to bed at 8-10 range because I have terrible insomnia so I suppose when you’re awake if you’d like to just text. I take off these days.. toodles.” So now the excuses are stress, poor time management, she’s sick, she has insomnia... all her words. And I haven’t heard from her in two days, since then.
