0,"So, I've been at the job (it's part-time) I'm at right now for eight years now, most of those while I was in college. I stayed after I graduated, and was glad I could keep the job since due to depression and anxiety issues I was unable to work full time. Now, I've gone through therapy and I am doing much better, but I have come to the conclusion that I hate my field (graphic design) and simply do not want to work full-time in it, so I've been working on building a freelance career that is still kind of in the field, but that will hopefully allow me to transition into jobs that are less likely to cause me to slide back into full-blown depression.

Now, that's the background. My main problem is that while I am applying to other part-time jobs, I have to stay at this one until I am hired elsewhere just so I can at least guarantee I can pay rent and such each month. I'm also looking for another part-time job so the choices are kind of limited as they're not common in my field. While I get along with all of my colleagues well enough, I just cannot deal with my boss. She talks down to me (she does that to everyone, mind you, but I'm the one who works with her most closely). She changes her opinion and what she wants every time, she wants it done just the other way around as last time, but if I just do that without presenting her the ""wrong"" way first, she will want me to do it the same way instead. She wants me to do something new for a project, them comes storming in demanding why it's taking longer. She berates me for never having any questions about things that are obvious and don't need any further information, and when I do have questions, she is abrasive and makes it sound like I'm stupid for not knowing something. An example:

Me: Excuse me, is the selection for \[coupon stuff\] ready?

Her: Of course not! Don't you know how long it takes?!

Me: Yes, I do. You asked me yesterday to do this first thing in the morning, hence my question.

Her: Well, it's not ready yet!

As far as I'm concerned, a simple ""No, it's not"" would've sufficed. Anyway, that's pretty much how every one of our conversations goes. I try to remain calm and only offer an opinion when I feel it's gone too far or I can offer facts to support it. I have been told by colleagues that they are amazed at how calm I am staying. However, it's just because I know that ANY sign of emotion in a conversation with her will get me called catty and called out on some perceived failing of mine. At one point last year she berated me for ten whole minutes for spending too much time on retouching an image that would be printed in a big local newspaper on Christmas, repeating over and over that if I am incapable of doing that, I should've punted the job off to headquarters in another country. Which would've been the guys who take weeks to finish anything and whom she complains about constantly. One time a month ago, I was retouching an badly chosen image I HAD to use and no matter what I did, she was not happy with the result and made me punt it off to an agency, who sent it back exactly the way I had done it as well.

It's all of these small things that just add up. Look, I'm not some genius at my job, but I like to think that I'm at least decent, and I've never had that issue working with anyone but this woman. I've worked for other departments in this same company and I've never had one single issue with either my work or my behaviour being inadequate. I get along with the CEO, and I've found a common tongue with the secretary everyone thinks lives in a bit of her own world. I have mostly overcome my anxiety and most people do not believe me when I say I used to be unable to speak to strangers. 

But I just cannot find a way to deal with my boss that does not cause me severe anxiety. I'm at the point where I cannot sleep when I have to be at work the next day, which impacts my performance. I am at the point where I doubt my freelance work and find myself unable to work on it, causing issues with clients because I am afraid of always being wrong. I'm at the point where I feel like I am an impostor and am unable to do my job even though I've got eight years of work experience under my belt AND finished college with a great mark while working two jobs on the side (which, to be fair, was likely what cause my depression to begin with). I cannot work on personal projects that may further my freelance work and allow me to quit this stupid job.

Unfortunately, this also impacts my self-esteem when trying to find a new job. I get invited to interviews, but just the thought of the situation repeating itself makes me bungle the whole thing.

I cannot ask for help from my coworkers because while nobody likes this woman and everyone is technically on my side (insofar as they agree that this no way to talk to or treat someone) everyone is also probably secretly happy they don't get the brunt of her issues directed at them (for which I don't blame them). Most just duck out of the room if possible if they see/hear her approach. There is no way to talk to that woman. I've tried explaining my approach to work. I've tried explaining to her the limitations of what we work with (we have to follow what the headquarters do to a t or we get angry emails), to which she exploded in my face about knowing that. I've reminded her of the fact that I am not in the office daily so unless I get copies of emails, there will be things I won't be in the loop about. Or that I cannot always remember what I did or didn't name a file two months ago, just as is the case with her (whoo boy, that was a bad decision). Unfortunately, flat out saying nothing works her up even more. She berates me for not communicating but doesn't communicate herself, unless she has a bout of wanting everything to be done by the second, at which point she will set up deadlines of when stuff has to be done six months in advance.

I am sorry for the long post, but I have NO idea what to do. None. I have to order some quite expensive stuff on Monday for one of our store locations and I have some questions and my anxiety is so bad already on Friday I cannot sleep and basically cannot do anything. Because I know I will be called an idiot for even having those questions while being berated that I never ask any questions. Unfortunately, when I'm this anxious, I tend to make mistakes, which naturally isn't helping my case at all. Sending emails is not an option as she'S one office over and will come storming over to complain about it. I wish I could just quit this job but that is not an option.

I've considered going back to therapy but I doubt it would do anything. Through the therapy I've already been to I feel like I have gained coping mechanisms and skills that allow me to deal with any issues that may be caused by myself as well as most external factors I cannot influence. These here are factors I've no control over and I've exhausted my repertoire of ideas on how to approach the situation. No amount of communication on my part seems able to resolve the situation. I'm honestly at a loss about what to do. I tried coming at the situation from the point of view of her having a lot of stress to deal with but honestly, she's not the only one who's stressed and nobody else talks to other people like that at the company. It's also getting worse. And while I understand that being interrupted while you're doing something is annoying, it's also part of the job. Everyone gets interrupted all the time because we're supposed to be a team and communicate and with everyone else, it works just fine.

Also, I'm not in the US, so US labour laws do not apply. And no one will give a shit about me complaining to higher-ups and I honestly don't want to drag my coworkers into it. Is there anything that can be done or do I just buckle up even more and make sure I get the hell out of there asap?",11Jan2020,1
2,"I (F24) have very few friends, and the friends I do have are people who I really persisted with in getting to know them. My closest friend says that when she first met me she thought I seemed boring and awkward. She says that eventually she realised I'm very funny, caring, loyal and that she can talk to me endlessly. 

This just about sums up my issue. I can't be relaxed and open and ""myself"" around people when I first meet them, or if I don't know them very well. I realise that this is the case for 99% of people - we all have layers, and we all have a layer for people we don't really know that's more polished and less vulnerable maybe. My problem is that my most outer layer is pure shit. I'm always awkward when meeting new people, I always seem to say the wrong things. Plus it takes forever for that wall to be broken down. I don't talk like myself or act like myself and I hate it. Worst of all, because people generally feel very put off upon first meeting me (even say, a barista or a taxi driver), it had really lowered my self esteem, and it dis-sways me from ""putting myself out there"". 

I want to make new friends, and to get out more. I don't want to feel disliked by the majority of the people I introduce myself to, it kind of hurts after a while. Maybe I'm just making assumptions and being paranoid, maybe I'm overthinking. I just need advice on how to get around this.",11Jan2020,1

Some items that i found are these airplane shape paperclips and a desk alarm clock, both of them from Boeing.

5,"I’m currently a career student, 2nd year in a master’s program. I hate near everything about it and the bachelor’s that paved the way.

Like it has to be this way for everyone else’s light to shine. I know I’m not crazy and I know it’s not supposed to be this way but my happiness for people in my life turns to a stubborn type of jealousy that’s not quite the kind of green that normally paints those scenes.

It’s hard to say it but I think I’ve lost a desire for the things that used to make me happy and at times it almost feels robotic to try them. I’ve spent so much time committed to doing things that don't fulfill me that I feel lost.

14,"Throwaway account because I don't know if my neighbours use reddit or not and I don't want to find out.

I live in the bottom floor of a townhouse with my sister just on the outskirts of the downtown area in my not so great city. It's over priced, but we manage and have been living here since June of 2019. Our place is in the middle between two other houses. Our lease explicitly states no smoking indoors, outside only, and because my sister smokes marijuana medicinally, we have a bit of a schedule for when she goes outside to smoke. Every morning at 7:00am, every evening at 5:00 pm, and every night at around 10:30pm. There are occasionally times where she will go out to take another if she's in pain between those time frames but its very little.   


We see a handful of our neighbours almost every day this way, and its how we met most of our neighbours too.  


For the first two months of living here its been fine- no complaints, everyone's friendly and nice, but my upstairs neighbour -we'll call her Pat- found out that my sister smokes medicinally and has been on our behinds since. Pat herself was a nice old lady up until that point.   


Since August, Pat has done EVERYTHING to try and get us evicted, despite her neighbour directly next door to her going outside to smoke as well (Important to note he smokes marijuana too, just like my sister). She's gone to her doctor and gotten a note saying says she's allergic to the smell, she's come down and said her grandkids are banned from coming to her place because of us \[They aren't, they're over every weekend and I can always hear them because loud kids lol\] complained several times to our property management about us only for smoking. Property management has sent us three warnings, has had people come in through *both* of our apartments and has apparently found zero proof of any kind of smoking in her place, but there was no proof in ours either.   


I've confronted Pat twice about this, telling her there's no possible way it's going up to her place from inside of ours and that if she were to come over she would know immediately if we were smoking inside or not. I've been polite and fair, and offered some kinds of compromise too, including smoking near the very edge of the property line, which is a good 30-40 feet away from all entrances and exposes us to the city more. Which, when you're a young adult woman and a young adult trans person in a town that has an opiate crisis, is extremely terrifying. I alone have almost been mugged twice doing this, it's pretty messed up. I've told her I've seen her walk inside with her cigarette in her mouth and she's just scoffed at me as if that's no big deal.  


I'm at my limit guys. We've done everything we can to respect other tenants and the rules of our lease, but this badgering and harassment from our upstairs neighbour has driven both me and my sister into terrible health situations. My sister got herself two more jobs and has developed a stomach ulcer from stress just to afford living here and just to get out of the house as much as possible so that when she has to smoke, she isn't a burden. I'm gone for a solid 18 hours every day and a good hour and a half of that is commute. By the time I get home I have enough energy to cook, watch a show or two and then go to bed before I repeat this cycle. I'm starting to become convinced this is some sort of hate crime because I'm trans, but even entertaining that thought is completely absurd. None of our other neighbours have had this problem with us, including the wonderful older woman next door on the ground with us and the young families who live upstairs beside Pat's unit.  


Does anybody have any advice? I've been calling our local landlord and tenant board to see if they're able to assist somehow too but I would really appreciate if anybody else had anything they could contribute to help. I don't want to be evicted, but if it comes down to that happening then I want justice and for Pat to be evicted alongside me because she actively breaks the no smoking rule without a care.",11Jan2020,1
15,"Howdy! I'm 23 and have 2 Associates degrees (1 in computer science 1 in business administration). I'm going to a 4-year University this Spring and need advice. I used to love programming from the age of 16 but as I've grown older I've drifted away from the computer field and general and don't care as much about computers. I'm thinking long-term that I probably wouldn't like sitting at a desk for hours, typing algebra into a compiler, and not interacting with many people. From the classes I've seen, the Bachelor's in Information Systems seems mostly doable but it'll be anywhere from 1.5 to 2.5 years to complete. I have always been and still am passionate about the healthcare field but I'm 1 scared of the debt and 2 scared that I might not be smart enough for it. I've gotten great grades in every science class I've taken but I have only taken them at the 1xx and 2xx level. On top of that, what if I get the Bachelor's but mess up the MCAT? What would I do for a job? After calculating the classes needed, a biology degree and an information systems degree are both very similar from where I'm at right now. I've been wondering if biology + medical school would be a better fit than information systems long term but if that's the case, I would need to take 2 additional semesters at the community college (but I would get a 3rd associate's, this one in health science). I've always loved helping people, I've always liked money (who doesn't?), and I'm passionate about 3 specializations in particular in the healthcare field. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to waste more time nor money.",11Jan2020,1
16,"Okay so I (M17) re-met this girl I knew from when I was younger (F16). We have chatted before online but I kinda started crushing on her again after seeing her. 
She lives a few hours away from me so I haven’t seen her much irl so I decided that it’d be cool to start texting so I got her Snapchat and instagram.

I’m not really used to the culture in this country so maybe I read things different, but this is what I could tell after texting for a while.

It seemed to be going fine, like mildly flirty etc, and we chatted often and she replied fast. I would end convos and we text late into the night. I thought, ye this is great.

But then she started messing with my head and now I’m second guessing everything???

One night it got like quite deep, and she told me about this guy who treat her not so nice right. Anyways the next morning I wake to a text “Hey sorry my friend took my phone that whole thing wasn’t me ahaha” kinda thing. I was a little hurt like, I had actually cared so I felt that was a tad rude, then I thought maybe she’s lying and just regrets what she said? No way to be sure so I took it at face value.

So things carry on normally after that until last night it happens again! Nothing deep this time just a fun convo and the next morning the same thing “ah ha that was my cousin” text.

Now I’m really confused because like, in my experience when your mate takes your phone they text your contacts random stuff, they don’t have a two hour conversation about their feelings??? And they don’t chat until 2am about their family and stuff???

So I can believe two things: 1) I’m being made a fool of by this girl and her friends or 2) for some reason she’s lying about something. 

Honestly it seems strange either way??? Anyone ever experienced this before or has a better idea of what is going on? What should I do or say? I’m just really confused?",11Jan2020,1

27,"Hello, so I’m a senior in high school and obviously people have started getting ready for graduation, however I’m in a conflict at the moment. My family wants me to take a gap year after finishing school and go back to our home country to stay for a couple of months and then come back. However there’s a 50/50 chance we might not. Today I spoke to my counselor and she told me that I have an option of emancipating. She let me know that I have a lot of options to help me out, like scholarships and financial aid and she even wants to personally help me. She also doesn’t think taking a year off when I’m not even a 100% sure they’ll let me come back is a good idea. 

I have always wanted to go off on my own and do things independently, but I never got the chance to since my parents are very strict and controlling. I feel like I was giving a chance to be able to leave and do what I always wanted to do. However, if I do that I know that I’m gonna have to cut off contact with my family because they’ll never accept me doing something like that. They are very religious and traditional, I stay coped in the house all day, even though I’m 18 they don’t let me go out with friends or go on overnight school trips. I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve been out without them. 

This is very scary to even think about, because I know they’ll be devastated. I have a lot of love for them, but the thought of going out and seeing the world for myself is something I always wanted to do. I feel excited and giddy just thinking about it, but I wonder if me doing this for myself on the behalf of their sadness is even worth it. I wanted to get a realistic point of view from an outsider on this so I’m posting this here.

This trip is 10-12jan (like, now), and just a few days ago I found out that we're leaving on the NIGHT of 10th, which is really a waste of money for the airbnb. We couldve left on the 11th early morning (like everyone else). I was annoyed I wasnt told about this earlier and bc this is rather silly. But I thought okay maybe spend some money for a fresh morning start, why the heck not.

Today I found out that we're not even going to go on the 3rd day.

So this silly trip got sillier; a 2night 1day trip.

I cancelled other snowboarding trips (a 5day trip to a further but nicer place and staying at a friend's, so no airbnb fee) for this. Now I want to undo that and just go for that trip instead and cancel this one.

But I mentioned it and theyre starting to really hate me for this. And I even thought oh well since theyve bought the lift tickets, I better just go. But it turns out that they bought the bundle for themselves and I and another person are the only ones left without tickets and it'll be more expensive than theirs.


Tldr

Option A: cancel ill-planned trip, save money for better one but people hate me (and Im kind of very bothered by that)
Option B: go on ill-planned, money-wasting trip to please others while I wont be happy (but I'll still have them as friends?)

I am rather short on money these days, but I saved up for this so this is more about allocation and not about not having cash",11Jan2020,1
29,"A friend (15 y/o) in America is in a situation where, without getting into specifics, she is:

Being called dramatic for trying to talk about any issue she has.

Being told not to tell CPS certain things (her dad's alcholism (non-violent) being the main thing as she did last time and was told off/shouted at for it).

Fear of being screamed at for saying anything is wrong bc her parents ""don't want to have to deal with it"" (again CPS).

Her dad's way of ""fixing"" problems is ignoring them till they ""go away"" and her mom's is calling her dramatic.

Thinking issues are ""not big enough"" for CPS to deal with (i.e. she's not being hit so she thinks it's not so bad).

Not thinking it's abuse (for aforementioned reason) but she's constantly just used by her mom for keeping the dogs out of her way, which usually means outside no matter if it's cold (40-50 degrees fahrenheit) and the dogs have on numerous occassions bitten her till she's bled but her mother scolds her for it.

They think she wants attention whenever she brings up an issue or does something small like crying when being told off/shouted at.

She says she won't tell CPS but ""If i was getting beaten, sure. But I'm not. I ain't in a uh, situation where its needed."" (Exact quote).

I'm at a loss for what to do, I want to help but don't know if telling CPS this can do anything let alone if she'd actually be ok with it. I want her to be able to get out of the situation but idk... Just idk. I can't explain. I think she's ok with foster care but I'm not sure. Can anyone help?",11Jan2020,1

I mentioned my boyfriend that I want to go somewhere on a vacation this summer. Maybe for a week or a weekend (Fri-Sun). Ideally, a cheap vacation (no more than $600-$700) and local. I want to maybe try to go to Cape Cod because I’ve never been. We can try outside of state too. 

About boyfriend: he likes being in the forest, beach, not a big fan of the city, likes hiking. He loves seafood (lobster) that’s why maybe we could somewhere beachy and eat seafood (hampton beach is always a choice)

32,"Have a middle class income and job that i never needed to go to college for but now desire to go to school but want to avoid paying for the costs of it and am considering joining the navy or air force(whatever gets me killed the least) to help subsidize the cost.

I am a student in my last year of high school. Most of my life I have never done any homework, I am typically able to get it all done in school otherwise I would just not do it. I am a very severe procrastinator, I just cannot get myself to go do my work no matter how badly I want my work to get done. I am at risk of failing my English class and if that happens I will lose all possibility to go to university or college like my parents want me to (I want to go as well). English is a 100% required course for all universities and colleges I have applied to.

Worst part about the situation I've gotten into is I don't even feel like I care. Yes I want to do good and go to school, but I am not stressed that I probably wont be going this coming September. Maybe even ever for that matter. I have also noticed myself that my behavior has changed this year especially. I used to hang out with friends every day, had a group of about 20 of us I knew really well. This year however I just stopped talking to almost all of them, I still regularly talk to 3 of them but mostly just because they drive me to school.

I am worried I've changed for the worse and don't know how to get myself to do anything about it. Should I get professional help or something? I wouldn't even know what to tell them or my parents.

So my situation is my(F23) two friends (F22) (23M) were in a relationship for 4 years, I’d been friends with both from before they got together meaning when they broke up in September2019, I still see them both. The relationship didn’t end clean but wasn’t terrible, they just took too long to realise they should split up, and they argued a lot until they split. But it was never awkward to see either of them. 

Well that was until today when, let’s call her Sally, well me and Sally were out for dinner chatting over the past year and we got on the topic of how their relationship fell apart, this is where she tells me that not only did (let’s call him Harry) put Sally down on everything, from what she wore, who her friends were, even how ‘bad’ her driving was. Obviously I was shocked I couldn’t believe he’d be like that I’ve know Harry for over 8 years. I believed by the end of the relationship he was annoyed she was doing better in life than he was, better job, better money, better car, ambitions all the good thing you want in life. 

Then the bombshell. Sally tells me about one night where she was woken up to him trying to have s*x with her, She freaked out because she wasn’t sure what was happening and it caused a massive fight, and a month later they break up. 

I couldn’t believe Harry would ever do anything so screwed up. Sally says she’s fine and has moved on but is sometimes uncomfortable is certain cuddling moments with her current ‘friend’ cause it brings back that night. To me, that is a trauma of literally being almost r*ped by your bf. she told me not to worry and she has no issue with me being friends with Harry. 

 How do you act around someone who you know has done that? It’s not like I can’t see them anymore because they are my boyfriends friend and Sally asked me not to tell my BF about it. 

Any advice? Do I just forget because Sally has moved on?",11Jan2020,1

62,"Me (22F) and my brother (29M) had a pretty serious fight over Christmas and I just found out now he (and his wife) have blocked me on all social media. This might be a bit long but I think context matters.

On Christmas day, I was having a pretty bad time. I was at my parents house and the company in general wasn't very good (some aunties and uncles who everyone else talks shit about at all other times of the year but is fake happy with on this day). My older brother also travelled from pretty far to visit for a week. There was also another cousin there (21F) who I'm not really close (and tbh don't really get along with).

Anyway the whole morning I was sitting with the 'adults' and my cousin chatting and just putting it on cause that's what you are meant to do on Christmas. My older brother (from title) was hanging out all day with my little brother (15M) inside playing video games. I would occasionally go inside and sit with them for a bit just to show that I hadn't forgotten about them or anything. But I wasn't really included in what they were doing. This was kind of the first things that started to annoy me - he was first trying to relate to me saying that he doesn't really drink anymore cause it 'ruins his creative process' (he is an artist). I don't drink very much, and he knows this but even though he was saying these things every time I sat down with him he would just open a can of cider and sit it in front of me (this is important as during the massive fight he screamed at me for being a bitch for not accepting his drinks). Additionally at one point while he was playing the game I looked at my phone and he took it out of my hands cause he wanted me to just watch him play - that was weird to me. Another thing is that my birthday is a few days after Christmas, and it happened to be the same day as his best friends bachelor party. So he kept bringing up that we have to do something for my birthday because he needs an 'excuse' not to go to this party with 'drunken assholes'. Anyway these things I kind of brushed off cause my brother has always kind of been like this - just an asshole really

Anyway the whole day was like this - sitting outside and then going inside for a bit. It was pretty quite so at about 9 I went to the room I was staying and got ready for sleep. 

Then I get a phone call from my little brother at 11:30 saying the he, my older brother and my cousin needed to be picked up from my oldest brothers (32M) house - they all went over there because 'nothing was happening here'. I was so heartbroken and mad (my oldest brother had other plans that day so I knew I wouldn't get to see him and I have a good relationship with him). They were all stupid drunk and couldn't get back home so I really had no choice to get in my car and get them. As I was picking them up, my older brother got in my car and spilled an almost full can if beer all over my front seat - just another thing to be mad about. 

Anyway the next morning, my oldest brother and my little brother apologised and it was fine, but I hadn't heard anything from my older one, I honestly just wanted to chill by myself for a bit so I stayed in my room that day. But at lunchtime he comes knocking on my door saying things like 'why are you being a cranky bitch for?' and 'do I need to slap you up the side of the head?'. I open the door and told him directly why I was mad last night - they all went and hung out without me (and then had to call me when they were finished having fun). Well he went off and I started crying (this is not the big fight). I closed the door and ignored him for the rest of the day - was walking around the house not just in my room.

The next morning though was just awful. I walked in and he says to me 'well what are we doing for your birthday' and I held up my hand and started to say 'i don't want to talk with you unless you are going to listen to me' but I didn't get to finish before he grabs the full bottle of 2lt milk and throws it across the room right beside me. And then starts screaming at me. These are some of the things he said that have just stuck with me:

You are a little c***
(Repeated a lot)

You are going to be alone forever

Nobody likes you

Get the f*** out of this house

I never want to see you again

I never want to hear from you again

I couldn't even reply, he just kept screaming over me when I tried to so I just started crying - this went on for about 40mins. At the end of it I was just hysterical and was shaking - he went to his room and I followed and said I was sorry and gave him a hug and then left for work. 

For the next 4 days he went and stayed with his friend who was having the 'bachelor party'. We remained civil and I was just pretending that it was okay until he went back home. 

And now today he and his wife have blocked me on all social media and I'm a bit worried of what he is telling people about me (not that I have done anything but he is just a manipulative liar) 

Before all this we actually had a pretty decent relationship - we are both into art and have same taste in music/TV shows so we have bonded through those. It will never go back to the way it was before though.

I know it kind of sounds crazy but I'm just wondering if I should just bite the bullet and try to make contact and take all the blame for the fights so we can just be family again at least

Or maybe I just need to accept my loss and move on?",11Jan2020,1
63,"So there's this project in which we need to do an interview on. It's worth 5 percent of our final mark and I really want to do well so I have a chance to get the class honourable. 

The project hasn't started yet, but me and my 2 friends agreed to work with each other. I had though of adding another one of my friend who I know can do well on this and wants a good mark as much was we do.

Out of the blue, one of my 2 friends asks an uncoropative and mediocre (in terms of marks) friend of our onto our group in which he happily obliges. In previous project, a debate, he didn't do any research and don't talk about anything; making himself get a 0 on it.

She ended up pulling me aside to tell me how I was creeping her out and I apologized. But after the summer I've wanted to apologize and try to fix our friendship but every time I try to talk to her my anxiety gets the better of me and I walk away before saying anything .

i got a crush on a girl from my class. Yeah we are friends but i can get better at talking more

anyways.. i am thinking of telling her that i love her. (we have been in the same class since August and i have loved her since the first look at her)

But im so afraid of losing her. What is she talks less to me after that? That question actually keeps me up every night so i lose sleep.

if i tell her, i would say it around 30th of January or early February. i dont wanna do it the day before winter break cause i cant deal with all the thoughts while being home.

SO LISTEN FROM HERE PLEASE: (important)

i might be leaving the school in June if i choose to be a hairdresser/barber.

i CAN stay if i choose interior designer.

That job choice will be taken March 1st. and thats when we have winter break. So im really confused what to do.

Thats also the reason i wanna confess before the winter break so if it goes bad i can just choose to leave...

But i wanna become her close friend, what if she gets a boyfriend?

	⁃	if she actually says YES, im still not allowed by my parents to go outside after school or come home late... is that ok? But she most likely will say no.
Okay we can stay as friends but she might talk less to me.

When i think about it.. relationships are stress anyways.. i have given her HINTS like giving her christmas gift and stuff

BUT I GOTTA talk more i guess, the question still comes back though, do i ever confess?

70,"So I have a life long best friend who thinks and acts very similar to myself. Or rather, we both think and act very similar to each other. We grew up together, and weren’t ever separated until elementary school, but then went to the same middle school and high-school, and now we’re in two different colleges, but soon we’ll be moving into an apartment together. We have nearly all the same interests and hobbies, and even share the same opinion on a lot of things. In high-school, I heard that someone was talking about me, and they said how similar I was to my best friend. At the time, I didn’t think anything of it, because I already knew we were similar. But as high-school progressed, I kept hearing more and more people compare me to my best friend. At this point, I was starting to wonder why nobody was saying that HE was like ME. By our junior year, we got in some beef (about something unrelated), and spent the entire senior year mad at each other. It wasn’t until after graduation that we started hanging out again. Well once we started hanging out a lot again, I started getting more comments about how similar I was to him. One person even saying “you need to get your nose out of (best friends name)s ass”, and I was genuinely shocked by that comment. We both have ADHD, and neither of us are medicated for it (although he used to be), and again we grew up together and just spent a lot of time together during our formative years. So I’m completely confident that, no, my nose is not in his ass. What’s scary about how similar we are, is that nearly every time we hang out, we’ll say like an entire sentence at the same time as each other, word for word the same, at complete random, as if it were transmitted telepathically or something. Like when we’re in public, we’ll both see something and we’ll have the exact same thing to say about it at the exact same time. It’s kind of freaky, but I’ve always chalked it up to us, again, GROWING UP TOGETHER and generally BEING VERY SIMILAR!

But all the comments I’ve gotten have made me self conscious about being around him, because now I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking I’m some kind of copy cat person, which really, really bothers me for some reason. This has me a bit worried about how I’m going to handle myself once we move in together. And it has me feeling genuinely upset.

Why am I getting all these comments? Why do people even care? How can I feel secure about my own identity that I know I have? I know this is a really weird issue, but I think about it all the time, and it’s kind of interfered with our friendship already, as I feel like I can’t hangout with him because I’m afraid of being called a copy cat by more douche bags. I really just need to tell someone about this so they can talk some sense into me, because up until now, I’ve felt like this isn’t something I can talk to people about.",11Jan2020,1

We started seeing each other at age 14 and were together until we were 17. I lost my virginity to this girl and vice versa. We had something special, but our childish minds could not see it.

I finally filed a formal complaint against her that was substantiated by several other people confirming that she targets me specifically. She stopped everything that could be considered harassment but is still very... unprofessional. She brags about being a bitch and proudly tells everyone how she failed anger management. 

I was told to report any continued harassment so I reported her increasingly hostile attitude that I felt was potentially escalating again into harassment, but when I did I was told I was misinterpreting the situation/her tone, that I can’t take into account any previous harassment I’ve experienced...and maybe other people have thicker skin and I should just learn to deal with her. I was told it was simply personality differences that I needed to learn to manage. 

Basically she can now get away with whatever she wants as long as it doesn’t fall under the legal definition of harassment.

I’ve recently started using dating apps again after a breakup (very short, but toxic relationship). I matched with two guys who were both sweet and handsome. One I began talking to daily and having long conversations with. While was very romantic when we met up, I find him a little forward at times. Early on he discussed wanting babies with me and said I love you in the first 2-ish weeks of us talking. The second dropped off for a few weeks and stopped replying, so I assumed he was uninterested/too busy and let it fizzle. Recently, this second guy has begun messaging me again, explaining he was out training in rural eastern Australia for the army and thought he’d have some sort of phone service. We’ve begun talking again and there’s now potential where there wasn’t before. We met up for dinner and it went really well. He’s not as forward, but is still romantic. It’s important to note I’m not in an offical relationship with either nor am I seriously committed to either man. It’s still early days with them both and at most I’ve been talking to them for 2-3 weeks and met up once or twice. The problem is I feel as though I need to pick one and not lead other on. Talking to both at once makes me feel so guilty! I have no idea which one to choose and how to go about letting the other one down gently.

81,"I have autism. I am 24 years old, I just started living on my own. 6 months ago I moved out of my parents house. I normally visit my brothers house every Sunday. My niece turned 8 last Saturday. I get along with her very well, and I wanted to get her a nice present. She has this opossum stuffed animal that she loves. She always says how cute opossums are and that they are her favorite animal. My main interest is interacting with animals. Since I’ve been old enough I have volunteered at the wildlife rehabilitation center every chance that I get. I saved up for a trail camera and large animal trap which I purchased a couple months ago. I like to catch animals out in the woods so I can observe, and then let them go. I never harm them. A couple weeks before my nieces birthday I was able to catch an opossum, and I was very excited because she loves them. So I kept it and fed it until her birthday. On Sunday I brought it over in a box and went to her room to give it to her. But when she opened it she screamed. I don’t really understand why, because she likes them. My brother came in the room and was asking what was wrong, and when he saw the opossum he was very upset. He was yelling at me and he took the box away. I tried to tell him that opossums are not dangerous but he wouldn’t listen and kept yelling. It stressed me out a lot so I ran home. I tried calling him but he wouldn’t answer me. He finally left me a message the other days saying that his wife Clara doesn’t think I should see my niece for a while, that I scared her a lot with the opossum, and that I should move back in with mom and dad if I can’t control myself. I can’t go back. It was very hard to leave the house and I don’t think I want to do another move for a long time. I am confused and very stressed out and I want to come to my brothers again on Sunday but I don’t know what to do.",11Jan2020,1
83,"Hello,

We were having fun in a bar tonight. When we were coming back, we took a tramway to go home. At one point, as the tramway stopped, a man (\~25M) caught my friend who was next to the door and did a weird thing (he caught his leg with his own leg while grabbing him). A bit after, as the tramway was restarting, my friend noticed that his phone wasn't in his pockets. We know that it isn't in the bar we were at right before as I gave him his phone there while we were exiting it. So we were highly suspecting that the guy stole his phone. The stealer was with another man (\~25M) and both looked like thugs.

Anyways we dropped off at the next stop and me and another friend decided to run towards the last stop to try to catch the two stealers. Without much surprise, we didn't find anyone.

However, by calling the stolen phone, after a while (8 calls) someone picked it up and said that he found it in the tramway and that he'd give it back to us if we called him tomorrow. We recognized the voice and we somehow know that it was the guy who stole it.

So now I don't know what to do. Should I try to meet with the guy with 3 other friends to get the phone back? Should I report it to the police, knowing that there are cameras in the tramway and that we know when it happened, so we should be able to know who did it (?). My friends said that the police wouldn't care about a phone. Are they right?

Finally we are a bit scared that they'd come as a big group and decide to rob us/beat us at the rendez-vous if it actually happens tomorrow, so... I just really don't know how to deal with this situation.

tl;dr : phone stolen, stealer picked it up after a few calls saying he'd give it back but we highly doubt that he'd just do that and now I wonder what to do.",11Jan2020,1

Girls at my school are much thinner than I am, only wear sweatshirts, talk way different, look way different. I was talking to my mom today at dinner about race because my stepdad told her about how this lady was being racist to him at the store. I feel like my mom is very whitewashed because whenever she’s in public or on the phone, her voice changes and she almost sounds like Siri or something?? She doesn’t even talk
like that. I always joke around saying she has two different voices. She also pretends not to know things about our culture and doesn’t speak Spanish unless we are with our family. Today she repeated what she told me when I was 13; she said that I was rachet because of my hoops and my acrylics. It hurt a lot and made me wonder if she would love me more if I was white. Then I asked her “would you like it more if I just bleached my skin and started wearing French tip nails?” Obviously, not all white women do that, but I was just so angry at her because I felt like she wanted me to fit into a stereotype. Then she got all serious and said “no, don’t do that.” It’s like there’s no winning. I started overthinking about when I go into job interviews in a few years.

I think the only thing I have that she doesn’t in my opinion is that I’m prettier than her, but it probably doesn’t even matter because her relationships last a while and mine last like a month before the guy cheats.

Well I am very scared of losing control and do suffer from anxiety. But I have an insane fear and phobia of becoming posessed.

Well I am unsure how to get over my fear. This has been pretty traumatizing to me. I’m 22 and I can’t sleep with the light off. I sleep with one light on all night. 


When I start to focus on the topic and worry about it I will begin to have nightmares about it and it freaks me the fuck out.

Most of the time I’m doing fine but it’s when I start letting my fears scare me I begin to worry and get anxiety and can’t sleep well at all. 

Is there any way to overcome my fear. I’m tired of being afraid of things I feel I cannot control. 

I sit here writing this and I understand my fear is completely irrational. But I have a deep rooted fear of it in my subconscious. And when it begins to surface into my conscious I suffer major anxiety. 


I want to end my fear once and for  all and not be scared anymore. I think my main problem is instead of letting this thought pass like regular thoughts I have an emotional reaction to it and that is why I haven’t been able to get over it.  I almost feel like I have ptsd about the situation.

Another problem is my dad made it seem like it can happen to me even if I’m a good person and am not doing anything dark. 

It has also made me hate religion because of how it has effected me. I wasn’t raised as a Christian thinking god is good. I was taught if you bad you’ll go to hell kind of thing.

I take my job seriously and work really hard, I'd love to grow in the company and become truly valued. My company hired an intern about a year ago to do my same job (with less responsibility) and subsequently, she's been brought on for a permanent position. I sit next to her and our supervisor can't see what we're working on, she only assigns us work through a project management host. To constantly prove my worth to my employer, I take on more and more responsibility, I assign most tasks to myself and have become the go-to person for my role. I like to take initiative and hate to be idle. This coworker of mine is on her phone literally all day. She assigns herself tasks but picks and chooses which ones she would prefer to do. I ask for her help and she often pretends to work on something else but I can literally see she is on her phone all day. The problem is, is she's really nice, and means well socially, but I just can't help but be affected by this while we're at work. No one likes a snitch but am I really the only one who knows she does nothing all day? I'm really trying to take the live and let live approach but it really upsets me. I'm not sure if it's the fact that we have the same job title, or if it's because she's getting away with it, or if it's that I don't respect her work ethic, maybe all of the above.

107,"I’ve been in a toxic home environment most of my life. If I wasn’t with my mom I was at my grandparents, if I wasn’t at my grandparents, I was with my uncle, if I wasn’t with my uncle I got sent to my aunts, my mom could never handle me because she had BPD and also had me at 15 Y/O.

She finally came back into my life when I was a teen, obviously there was resentment and a lot of validation, love and support I wasn’t getting from her because of her BPD her views and tolerance for life wasn’t helping me. I ended up going to a mental hospital for self harm because I couldnt handle the relationship with my mother. 

To avoid home I would go out with friends and I met this one guy when I was 17 y/o, we dated and lived together for 5 years and just broke up because he started becoming violent. But I always went back to him because he was my means of escape, it wasn’t all that bad but it was just toxic.

My therapist and I agreed it would be best for me to go to my uncles house which is a healthier place.

I had to sleep in my little cousins room for a week and a half while my aunts sister (who has 2 little boys) was sleeping in the guest room... for a whole week and half I got woken up with screaming running kids every morning (their playroom was right across where I was sleeping) but I dealt with it until they left. 

Then I finally get myself settled in the guest room and got a little more comfortable, then come to find out they had bed bugs, I got bit on my hand and it’s swollen right now and it hurts. (A family friends daughter stayed a couple days and she brought bugs with her, wtf)

So now all my stuff is packed in trash bags, bed is thrown out, I can’t go in the room until sometime next week when they obviously got rid of the problem. Their getting a new bed and everything of course ASAP.

I have to sleep on the couch getting woken up at 7 in the morning when kids go to school. I booked a hotel room for all weekend until they figure it out.

I had an amazing job where I mad 800 a week but I gave it up because my exes schedule and mind were clashing. Now I’m at a shitty job, doing shitty work and I feel so shitty. I have a 400 car payment I already put 3 years into and idk wtf to do.

My life is going down hill, why? I just need some advice and support. I’m 23 and want to go back to school and get my life together but I’m so behind because I thought me and my ex would be together forever.

116,"So about a year ago my friendship with my best friend started to struggle. It’s a complicated situation but I’ll try and break it down a little. So I’ll call my best friend B, her and I met at the middle of our junior year of high school (March or so 2018). We hit it off right away and even though we had different lifestyles we were super close friends. About August of that year I begin to meet her friend group more, her best friend since freshman year will be named K. K was one of her only friends that still included her in everything because B dated a boy in the friend group that was the main person, what he said went. So of course B and K got more close, and the three of us actually started to become decent friends. 

Now here is where it gets complicated, K was involved with drama, but she was very easily manipulated. In drama there was a main girl that we will call S, she controlled K with most everything and S hated me because of reasons I still don’t know, I asked in person and she literally walked away. I suspect that it’s because I was dating her ex best friend, he realized how horrible of a person she was and in turn she made his life hell. Well anyway, S knew that K was good friends with B. S knew that B was my best friend, so S decided to threaten K to not be my friend anymore. Shortly after (February 2019 or so) K blocked me on social media and it was obvious S was behind it, which made B very uncomfortable. At about March B stopped talking to me and basically ghosted me. Whenever I’d see her she’d look embarrassed and walk away. In May I confronted S because at this point she’s making up rumors about me and this is ridiculous. She walks away from me after denying having anything to do with B not talking to me anymore, and an hour later I check and B blocked me on social media as well. That’s just too coincidental. 

Well time goes past and now B and I go to the same community college in our city, we live and work near each other, and I miss her like crazy. S isn’t as close of friends with K anymore, and K and B aren’t very close anymore either. I’ve seen B grow as a person and get happier and she’s gotten a better job, employee of the month, lost weight, made good friends, and I’m just overall really happy for her. I want to reach out but I’ve reached out in the past with no answer, that was also when that whole situation was still strong though. I was thinking of sending her a card and a gift for her birthday (March) just saying I miss her and I hope she’s well. I’ve tried to just move on but even my therapist agrees that this is a shitty situation and this was just so “high school”. She even said that it may be good to reach out.

So my best friend has been married for a bit over three years. I spent a lot of time with her and her husband when they were dating and he was a cool guy, pretty laid back. He was addicted to pain pills but got clean before they got married. 

So for some unknown reason (according to my friend), her husband has suddenly converted to this uber-religious...extremist? I really don't know how else to explain it. He went from occasionally reading his bible to waking up at 4 a.m. every day and reading in solitude for 3-4 hours. He's begun religious fasting, quit drinking abruptly, and is pushing my friend to follow his ways. He has, on several occasions, threatened to leave, stating that it's not a sin to divorce and never re-marry. I just won't ever be with anyone else."" The most recent of these threats, he actually packed up a suitcase and left. My friend, obviously heart broken and thinking he was gone, went to her moms for support. Well, her husband came back and started saying that he didn't appreciate her ""talking bad about him"" to other people (i.e. her mom). She's talked to me about it fairly extensively and she has never once ""talked bad"" about him. He refuses to see a counselor and apparently only preaches like this to her. 

From my perspective, her husband is being extremely controlling and throwing up red flags left and right. The possibility of a brain tumor has crossed my mind as well considering the drastic change in behavior. 

Regardless...I feel at a loss on how to best support her. He's threatening to leave left and right and I honestly don't see this issue being resolved. They have two small children (3 years and 3 months old) and she is terrified that he is going to get them part time which is a very real possibility. I want to support her without straight up telling her to leave. This seems at least borderline abusive and I hate to see her in this position. She loves this man, however he is not the man she married at this point.

I just feel like I can't do enough. I know I can't rescue her from her situation but she already has a hard time talking about it. It's hard to get her out of the house because her husband can't be relied on to watch the kids because of his rituals.",11Jan2020,1

Any advice you have about battles, training, deployment, and all the like? (Thinking about being a Field Medic 68W)


Hey everybody, thanks for taking the time out of your day to read the full story, this is the backstory, and some things that drove me to start thinking about this. These arent all the reasons, but a few important ones

I’m currently debating joining the military as a field medic, code 68W. I’ve brought it up to a few friends and they said it was a bad idea, that they “know me, and you won’t be happy fighting a war.” I’m currently a Freshman in highschool (I know young to start thinking about this), and I’m top of my class, taking AP classes not even offered to standard freshmen, and am currently at a 4.05, I will end this year with a 4.1. I really enjoy science, and technology in general, and I don’t want to be a useless piece of shit. I want to fight, even if it means I lose my life, atleast it will be helping people; and though I don’t agree with some of the decicions made in this country recently, but I know that I don’t want to let men die out there.  I’d much rather lose my life helping another soldier than die slowly and whither away. I don’t exactly have much to fall back on, my dad is never home, my mom is borderline mentally abusive, and I don’t even see my sister more than once a week. My house is a wreck of an ongoing renovation for nearly 4 years now, and it’s caused my family to fracture. I don’t have any girls, and the friends I have, though great, are a mess of depressed guys, fuckboys, and a couple of dumbasses (love you homies tho). I’m not saying I have the worst living situation, not even close, I just cant fucking muster this anymore. I don’t feel like a part of anything, I want to either fight for my brothers, or die in a fight. I’m near set on this decicion, but still want to get opinions. Expersonel, Reserve, On Duty, or anyone that relates to the military: what do you think? What dangers do I have, what should I do to prepare, and is it worth all the effort? Any advice is greatly appreciated, and if I do decide to register for it, is there a preregistration form for younger people set on fighting?",11Jan2020,1

126,"First and foremost, thank you to anybody who takes the time to read this and second, this is my first time posting on reddit so if this belongs under a different category please point in the right direction :)

A little bit of context, I(28) and my husband(28) have been married for about 7yrs now. No kids. No family nearby for either of us. His side of the family is well off and doesn't really need anything from us. My side, however, is a different story. My mother is 75 years old and has never saved anything for her future. Not for lack of hard work but just recklessness. She's an emotional person and just hands out money to whoever needs it without expecting anything back. When she's not giving it away, she spends it on herself because it makes her happy. I've always attributed it to her orphan upbringing and her need to fill a void.

My mother lives abroad with my stepbrother and his wife, 2 kids, and his mother in law. My mother isn't currently working. She was diagnosed with heart problems and suffers from type 2 hypertension. She used to live with me but she wanted to go back to her country to relax and be near the country side and enjoy her days with her grandkids. Its been almost 3 years and I have sent her $250-300 a month for her expenses(idk what they are, she never tells me) plus her monthly phone bill around $75. 

My stepbrother(38) and his wife run a debt collection agency which from the looks of it seems to be doing pretty well. But just recently my mother has been asking for more money and I am in no means to help. I asked her what it was for and she said it was for for herself and she needed it. I couldn't grasp as to how or why because when I speak to  my stepbrother he says everything is A OK and that my mother has everything she needs. He provides for her and even gives her allowance money weekly. He even pays for a live in nanny, housekeeper and a nurse aide for my mom. His children go to two separate private schools and they just came from a month vacation traveling all over Europe. 

I told my mother if I could speak with the housekeeper to say hello (to maybe better understand the situation from an unbiased perspective) and we spoke for a while. I know it's not right to meddle but I can't really fly 3k miles to figure it out right now and my mom doesn't have the most reliable memory. The housekeeper paints me a different picture to my mom and my stepbrother's situation. She tells me that my mom spends the money I give her on buying food or necessities for the house. That my stepbrother works really hard to provide but his wife is the one that manages everything. From how much she shops for herself to how much is going to be served per plate to not go over the food budget. That they pay her late sometimes and that his wife is always racking up the credit cards. That she hears them fight about it and my mom has no idea about anything. That sometimes they get behind on their bills and that this month they paid all his employees late for whatever reason. I thanked her for her honesty and promised to not tell anyone what she had told me.

I didn't think it was my place to ask my stepbrother how he manages his finances or what to spend it on, but now I'm stuck in a position where I know the money I'm sending her isn't going to her per se but to pay for his household groceries or bills. When my mom left I told her the money I was sending her was for her alone and/or to save up in her bank account. To have it there for any emergency or needs she might have later on. That whatever she didn't use, to just save it up. After all, she has told me repeatedly my brother pays for everything and she has no need to use it.

Fast forward to today, I have found out, again through the housekeeper, yup she's an earful lol, that my brother has been tapping into the bank account from which I deposit my mother's money. Apparently his wife bought some marble flooring and over exceeded her limit on the credit card and when he tried to use it at a different place it declined. So he needed quick cash and used my mom's account. Turns out after my mother arrived over there, my brother told her she couldn't be trusted with money because of her ""forgetfulness"" so he was going to look after it for her and when she needed money he would withdraw it for her and all she had to do was ask. I was never told she did this but my mom apparently trusted him enough to manage it.

Ever since, my mother has been calling for more money I would ask her how much she had in her personal account so she can use from there but she always made any excuse to not tell me. Everything from ""idk"" to ""I haven't checked"".

Fast forward to this week, I had heard enough and texted my stepbrother about what was going on. That mother needed money for whatever reason (I didn't say I knew that she was spending on the house) and that she's been trying to access her account but she cant. My brother quickly replies ""what for? She doesn't need anything"". I reiterated, that I am not aware what for but she needs it. He takes a long sigh and tells me ""there's nothing in her account. He had a mishap where money was tight and he used it all."" I was shocked. I asked why he hadn't told her that the account was empty and why on earth did he take it without asking her. He said super frankly and calm that what's the difference,"" he pays for everything and he could pay it back to  her when she needs it. That all she had to do was ask. He will pay it back into her account in installments and that its no big deal."" I was appalled by his calm demeanor and just left it at that. I called my mom to tell her I had spoken with him and he had said there's nothing in her account. He used it all. So now she is shocked he would do this to her and tried confronting her but keeps dismissing as in no big deal. That he can pay it back to her whenever she needs it but why would she, he takes care of everything for her so whats the rush? So this is the reason why my mother now, wants me to send her more money but this time..she says..this time, she will store it herself. 

Idk if I'm being lied to or taking advantage of by either him or her or both or neither. 

I am currently going into  one of my upcoming surgeries soon(next Monday) for some health issues that have long been progressing. I'm expected to be in the hospital for at least a month or two. So far my husband and I have spent around 27k on loans on the copays of it.  I have stopped working full time 2 weeks ago as to not aggravate the symptoms. And as of right now he makes a total of 45k a yr and will be paying our rent of $1800 solely by himself. I'm hoping to get back to work soon but I'm expected to not fully heal until after 6 months. My husband and I have no other debt and live well beneath our means. So when I told her I was in no position to further help at the moment I meant it. We are pretty tight as it.  My husband works hard for us and I wouldn't dare him jeopardize his finances to help my situation nor is my family his responsibility. Just in the amount I send her a month, I could easily save up 5k a year and put that back into my copay costs. 

If all of this seems contradicting or confusing, I truly apologize. So finally, here are my questions: 

My mother despite all of this, feels that I should still send her something. That it would be selfish otherwise. That she doesn't want to keep asking my brother for money now that her trust in him is broken and that I shouldn't put her in an uncomfortable position. I feel bad for her because I've always been more of her carer than her daughter(she had me at 47yrs old) and I feel guilty not being able to help her but at the same time I feel I am enabling more money issues in their home. My husband says I shouldn't have been sending money to begin with but understood our cultural difference so he didn't oppose but now he does.I could pawn my jewelry at this point to send it to  her but after that I don't know how I could help financially since I will have more debt to tackle after the surgery. 

 I'm wondering if someone out there has a similar experience and how I could go about this? Should I confront my brother to explain to me what's truly going on? His finances or his means to provide for our mom? Is it even my place? Should I let him and my mother deal with it or do I get a say? Should I stop helping period? I'm so confused.

Thank you to all in advance",11Jan2020,1
127,"I've got a buddy (Mike) who I really want to go to Europe with (from the USA). A few other friends are going and Mike would have a blast.

Mike doesn't make a lot of money and I'd be happy as hell to buy his ticket and otherwise cover his share of the Airbnb and such. If he can't go for other reasons that's cool but I'd love for him to go if he can.

He's a proud guy, and I don't think I'd be comfy with a friend floating 1k of bills for me either. I thought about saying something like ""I got a free ticket so it's use it or lose it.""

133,"I don’t know what to do with my life and my future. What is success in life?

I hate expectations. Everyone has them, whether it be low or high expectations. Ever since a kid, I’ve been labeled gifted or whatever, brilliant or whatever, way ahead of my grade level. Able to grasp concepts so quickly and think so differently. Everyone expects me to go off to college and be some engineer or some mathematician or something of that sort. I hate it. Why does everyone expect me to follow that path. I hate to disappoint, and when everyone expects so much of me, it’s really a burden that I didn’t ask for. My issue is, I’m not motivated in terms of my education, I love to learn and I find mathematics such a beautiful thing, yet I do not want me life to revolve around my education until  I get some bullshit degree just to spend most of my life working. Don’t get me wrong, Math is fun, the feeling of solving problems and what not. But in the long run. I’d rather not. I want to become a investor. Investing in real estate and paper assets, investing in and starting my own businesses. That’s what I would like to do. Why? Because it’s a tool or a way for me to achieve what I, and I alone want, which is a way for me to just truly enjoy this one life I’ve been blessed with. To travel the world, to not stress, to not have to wake up at 9 and come home at 5. I don’t want to conform. Life is truly short, really short, and definitely not long enough for me to be going to college and get a degree that will be useless to me inevitably, because that’s not what I want. The same thing I want can be achieved without a degree. Yet everyone want’s to have a say in my life and future. I don’t want to do it, yet I also don’t want to disappoint. Will doing what I want be a waste of a gift because I didn’t want to pursue what others wanted me to? Am I in the wrong for wanting a say in my life? I guess the definition of success is mostly perspective. Everyone has a different definition of what it is. What is success? What defines how brilliant a person was is their lifetime???",11Jan2020,1

136,"I'll start off by saying I love my sister, no matter what. Shes my sister and nothing will ever change the fact that I love her. However, anything I do, and I mean anything, she has to find an issue with. If I make cookies, she will say stuff like theres too much baking powder or under done, etc. When they're not. (Ive been baking since forever and actually almost made a business over it while she will make chicken with no seasoning at all. Like just a raw chicken breast in the pan kinda thing) 

I also do online school and get great grades (mostly A's) and she told me ""That's so easy. All you do is watch videos all day (note: not at all true. It's very difficult trying to teach myself every subject pretty much) you're such a dumba**. When I was in high school, I took all AP classes"" blah blah blah. We were out shopping with my mom at the time but my mom wasnt around. After my sister left, I broke down crying *in the middle of the store* and told my mom what she said because she says stuff like that all the time. My mom went off on her and told her to act like an adult etc. And my sister tried to be a suck up and say ""oh I'm so sorry, that's not what I meant at all"" blah blah blah.
 I plan on taking some college classes in addition to my high school classes because with my school, one semester in a college class counts as two semesters high school credits. She tells me ""Only take one. They're too advanced for you to take them in general but if you're going to, take one."" 
My sister is a verrrryy dramatic person. She loves loves loves attention. She is epileptic and one time faked a 30 minute seizure for attention. She had to take an ambulance ride to the hospital because her seizures usually last around 3-ish minutes. How did we know it was faked? She eventually told us.

137,So I was offered a job and turned it down because I didn’t not want to live in the area and could not see myself committing to it for 5 years which is what they were wanting.

Because it is a small company I know the boss but the guy I would work under I have worked with a little and the main guy I worked under is not in the position to hire so I’m not sure who talk to first.

138,"It all started the first day I [F19] met him [M18].
It was the first week of school I was talking to some of my classmates and he was sitting on a couch working with his phone, I asked a question and no one knew the answer but he started to answer my question then I thanked him and asked his name. Let's call him Ben. He is in all of my classes in college we're both freshmans.

Two weeks after we had to split up to groups for our group works and lab, I saw him sitting alone,  I went to him and asked if he wants to be in my group (I already had 3 more people in the group) and he said yes. We all traded numbers and make a group chat. We always sit next to each other in classes and we sometimes talk, we're not close to each other at all at least I think so.
He's really quite and I don't really want to bother him, I'm new to the area and English is not my first language but it's his first language, so it makes me not be comfortable enough to start a conversation. We had a lab together and we were working on a same thing so I would always ask him for help or he would come to me and see if I need anything or just look at me or look at what I'm doing.

Once he was in my dreams and It was a weird dream, I saw we were together and we love each other and stuff like that (nothing sexual tho). The day after I couldn't look at him, I was so scared to catch feelings. He's pretty cute and he seems like a nice guy and I kinda get upset if I see him talking to other girls. We have another guy in our group (let's call him Max) and he sometimes mess with me (not in a flirty way) he just drives me mad and makes me upset/mad/ect and Ben gets mad at him and asks me why he's always messing with me and tell me he doesn't like the way Max is treating me. Once I was about to cry and he was like do u want me to punch him? (He wouldn't do that tho, he's a pretty nice guy)

Fast forward to the exam time, he would always text me and ask me his questions or ask me if I want to go to college with him so we can study together and it was just two of us studying and talking and kinda enjoying the time. The last time we met up before the exam we were talking the whole time and we didn't really study.
He hasn't text me in the winter break and I didn't text hin either cuz we don't text if it's not about school.

So during the winter break I started to miss him. And would dream about him everynight. I don't know why, I would close my eyes, sleep and he was there. I would wake up crying cuz I don't want to catch feelings, I'm afraid of getting heart broken. I caught feeling for a guy once and I don't want to do that again. But it's out of my control now, my first boyfriend cheated on me and I really loved him, It broke my heart and now I'm afraid of a heart break. I'm kinda isolating myself and I'm sure I can't handle another heartbreak. At some point I want to feel loved and I want to love someone but I'm just afraid.

I don't know how to face him when I see him after the break. I don't know if this is something weird or I'm catching feelings...
I don't even know if he likes me, I don't know if he would make a move if he does, he's shy. I am shy I don't know what will happen.
I wish I knew what to do.
Any advice would be appreciated.",11Jan2020,1

She already has her plans figured out. A month after graduation, she will be leaving for D.C. to study political science at Georgetown. I hate the idea that while she is starting her life, I will be left in my crappy hometown with another year of high school. I am even older than her (by a week lmao). My school has this program that allows juniors to graduate early. Basically, if I did this, my first semester would consist of all my core 11th grade classes &amp; second semester would be my core senior classes, having no electives whatsoever, and I would graduate with her. But there is a part of me that wants to graduate with the class I've grown up with, and I would feel really guilty about leaving my other friends. I feel like they would take this as a betrayal.

144,"I want to preface this by saying I want to start therapy but am unable to at the moment because of financial troubles. I am actively looking into a therapist with a sliding scale that fits me.

I think I am becoming emotionally unavailable to my sister after having so many fights with her. I want to be there for her and to repair our relationship but I feel like I can't. I feel like if I try to talk to her or tell her my view point, she gets angry because she sees it as me invalidating how she feels. She says I'm dead inside, I don't give a shit about her, etc— all which aren't true. 

I've tried looking into ways to support her. I try to listen to what she has to say, validating how she feels (ie: 'I see how you can feel that way and I'm sorry the situation came off that way'), and offering her a place to sit and cool off. It was never good enough though. I've offered hugs, a pat on the back, but she always turns me away in disgust. If I sit there and try to just lend an ear she gets mad because I don't know what to say, or don't add anything that she finds useful. I've asked what she wants of me in that sort of situation, what I can do to comfort her and she would get mad.

Now? I'm tired. It feels like no matter what I do I'm wrong. I have two boundaries I've put up a) no saying 'I want to die', 'I wish mom aborted me', or  anything to that tune and b) no raising voices at me. Those are my limits. And she doesn't respect them. After this has happened for so long, I just feel emotionally unavailable and numb. She comes to me crying about a fight with our dad or her feeling shitty, and I just feel blank. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I hate that I have turned into a person who comes off uncaring. I've always been bad at showing my feelings, but this takes the cake. The last serious situation I was in where I became emotionally unavailable was with our mom who ended up abusing drugs and just being a not great person. I ended up cutting her from my life until she could get sober. Unfortunately, that wasn't a possibility for her before she passed away. 

I don't want the same relationship with my sister. I don't want to have to cut her off but I also don't know what else to do. She won't respect my boundaries, and she feels like I'm not doing enough to comfort her. Any advice? :(",11Jan2020,1
145,"Not sure what advice I’m in need of but I definitely want this off my chest. 
When I was somewhere between the age of 6-8 my friends started telling me that they couldn’t come to my house anymore. My mom eventually pulled me into her room to tell me that years before my dad had molested my half sisters (her daughters). She didn’t elaborate other than explaining what molestation was. I don’t even know if this happened before or after they were married or if I had been born yet. They were still married though and stayed married until I was 18. I’m not sure how my friends parents had found out because if he was a registered sex offender he no longer was by the time I was in 7th grade and checked for myself. Once we moved I was able to make friends whose parents knew nothing about this. I lived my life normally but I have thought about this everyday my entire life. I’ve only ever spoken about it once, I screamed at my mom over the phone and I told her she ruined my life by letting him be in it. My little brother (16 at the time, same dad) was in the car and heard me but we’ve never spoken about it. My mom has never talked to me about it. My sisters also haven’t ever and they grew up in the same house with him. Before my parents divorced their kids even called him grandpa. 
My relationship with my dad was great when I was little. He was my hero until that day. After my mom told me I felt sorry for him. That was my first emotion. Things were weird for a while and he left for a couple days when he found out that I knew. But later I just carried on and let him be my dad. He was a decent dad when I was young too. We went hiking, camping, fishing, vacations. He tried becoming an active church goer for my mom. He spoiled me and my brother. He taught me things. He was good to me. I never really saw the evil until they started fighting in my teenage years and he began drinking again. Even then it wasn’t ever towards me. I chose to live with my dad after the divorce out of convenience because he got the house and I was technically already an adult. This is when I found out that he is stupid, has terrible demons, is hateful, is an alcoholic, and generally unpleasant. I don’t like him but I love him and worry about him. 
I also still have a good relationship with my mom.
My sisters (9-8 years older than me) have always been nothing but overly kind, loving and sweet to me. I hate that it happened to them. They never bring it up and I don’t know how to. They never ever have said anything bad about my dad. 
Everyone treats it like it never happened or it’s normal or excusable. I think about it everyday. It has ruined my life in so many ways. I’m afraid of being anything like him. I question whether I should hate him and remove him from my life. I can never completely share who I am with anyone because I am so ashamed.",11Jan2020,1
146,"I'm not exactly sure which Subreddit to post this on but this is the most general and neutral advice thread I see. I have some minor mental issues. Nothing officially diagnosed. For the most part I'm completely functional and live a normal life. I do feel like it is a problem though and I really want to change for the better.

To start off, I (20m) grew up with a very abusive mother. She constantly told me I was a mistake child, I fucked up her life, I should have been aborted, etc., Side note, I have never retaliated against my mother whenever she has abused me because I found that it only causes more conflict. She isn't going to be changed by my words no matter what I say. She is just that type of person. I also don't even feel ""myself"" when I'm with my family. My family knows my mother was abusive but we're the type of family where our problems stay in the family and mental health issues don't exist. I stayed on and off again with my grandma and my uncle, switching between them and my mom. 

I feel like I can't express myself at all because in the past when I was younger, my family treated me like I was weird or I was wrong. I've had numerous lectures from my uncle that I need to ""change who I am as a person to fit their (my uncle and grandma's) needs"". He has always made me feel like I'm not good enough when I'm being myself. I've felt like a burden my entire life to my family. 

Add all this together and what's left of me is an extremely insecure, introverted, shell of a person that is scared to express himself. Now that I'm legally an adult, I have been actively trying to get out of my shell and interact with strangers, to some success. I feel the most ""myself"" when I'm with my friends. I just wish I had a normal and happy life like most of my friends do. Sometimes I get extremely depressed thinking about my life. I feel trapped, I feel like I don't belong anywhere at all. I know life isn't fair so I try to stay strong and have hope for my future. 

This is the part that may be a bit too personal and what I really wish I could change about myself. If you're under 18 I advise you not to read past this part. In terms of relationships, I've had just a few when I was younger but none at all as of late. I feel like a complete loser. I've seen the term incel passed around and I start to wonder, am I an incel? It seems like I can't get a girlfriend. I don't hate women and I don't want to kill anyone. I think I've identified that because I feel like everyone hates me, I have no self worth and self value. This has led me to dabbling in porn genres such as cuck porn. I know I'm mostly dominant sexually and I prefer to keep it that way, but cuck porn is like a guilty pleasure of mine. I absolutely despise it and I see myself as disgusting for even enjoying it at all. I just feel like no girl would ever choose me and I'm like the bottom of the barrel. I fear I'll be cheated on because I'm not good enough. I hate it. I hate myself for thinking like this. I hate myself for being so pathetic and I want to change, but I don't know how. 

You can laugh at me if you want for being such a loser. I just want to turn my life around, enjoy more ""vanilla"" porn, live a stable and happy life. I don't want to be fucked up. I feel like I am sick and I am a disgusting excuse for a human being. I pray that nobody else has to live a life like mine but I know it happens. A lot of people have even worse lives. I wish everyone was able to grow up with supporting parents and a loving family because this has been such a shit show feeling like I shouldn't even exist.

TLDR: I feel like a pathetic person unworthy of love and happiness due to my upbringing. I want to change that and I want to live a ""normal"" life but I don't know how.",11Jan2020,1

I go to a private HS. I was in the bathroom and it smelled bad. I thought nothing of it. This bathroom is a converted home bathroom. The closet is a tub with plywood over it and a bookcase put on it. Turns out some kid shit on the plywood and and used a paintbrush to spread the shit around. **To be clear, I did not shit on the plywood.** I was the last one to use it allegedly so they say I did it. I used the bathroom around 1:45 and school closes at 3:25, so I call BS on that. Their timeline is screwed up so bad between the two deans and the assistant principal that they are confusing me.

Assistant principal met with mom, one of the deans, and myself. He says that he is ""investigating"". I am 15 years old and know not to poop everywhere. AP says that if he finds out i did it he is kicking me out. The maintanance staff and the ppl who work in that building say they are ""100% sure"" I did it.

159,"It all started the first day I [F19] met him [M18].
It was the first week of school I was talking to some of my classmates and he was sitting on a couch working with his phone, I asked a question and no one knew the answer but he started to answer my question then I thanked him and asked his name. Let's call him Ben. He is in all of my classes in college we're both freshmans.

Two weeks after we had to split up to groups for our group works and lab, I saw him sitting alone,  I went to him and asked if he wants to be in my group (I already had 3 more people in the group) and he said yes. We all traded numbers and make a group chat. We always sit next to each other in classes and we sometimes talk, we're not close to each other at all at least I think so.
He's really quite and I don't really want to bother him, I'm new to the area and English is not my first language but it's his first language, so it makes me not be comfortable enough to start a conversation. We had a lab together and we were working on a same thing so I would always ask him for help or he would come to me and see if I need anything or just look at me or look at what I'm doing.

Once he was in my dreams and It was a weird dream, I saw we were together and we love each other and stuff like that (nothing sexual tho). The day after I couldn't look at him, I was so scared to catch feelings. He's pretty cute and he seems like a nice guy and I kinda get upset if I see him talking to other girls. We have another guy in our group (let's call him Max) and he sometimes mess with me (not in a flirty way) he just drives me mad and makes me upset/mad/ect and Ben gets mad at him and asks me why he's always messing with me and tell me he doesn't like the way Max is treating me. Once I was about to cry and he was like do u want me to punch him? (He wouldn't do that tho, he's a pretty nice guy)

Fast forward to the exam time, he would always text me and ask me his questions or ask me if I want to go to college with him so we can study together and it was just two of us studying and talking and kinda enjoying the time. The last time we met up before the exam we were talking the whole time and we didn't really study.
He hasn't text me in the winter break and I didn't text hin either cuz we don't text if it's not about school.

So during the winter break I started to miss him. And would dream about him everynight. I don't know why, I would close my eyes, sleep and he was there. I would wake up crying cuz I don't want to catch feelings, I'm afraid of getting heart broken. I caught feeling for a guy once and I don't want to do that again. But it's out of my control now, my first boyfriend cheated on me and I really loved him, It broke my heart and now I'm afraid of a heart break. I'm kinda isolating myself and I'm sure I can't handle another heartbreak. At some point I want to feel loved and I want to love someone but I'm just afraid.

I don't know how to face him when I see him after the break. I don't know if this is something weird or I'm catching feelings...
I don't even know if he likes me, I don't know if he would make a move if he does, he's shy. I am shy I don't know what will happen.
I wish I knew what to do.
Any advice would be appreciated.",11Jan2020,1

I live with my fiance and son in Oklahoma and my sister lives with my mom (and my mom's gf) in Illinois. Our parents divorced years ago and my mom has been not a good mom ever since. My dad had to move back in with his parents so he's never had the room to have custody of us. As soon as we were able, my older brothers and I left my mom's house. We're all so much better off for it.

My sister's mental health is terrible and I know that a lot of it has to do with the environment she's in. She DREADS going to school and just wants to be alone in her room. She's developed a fear of men. She barely eats because they never have family dinners and has little human interaction. There's no support system in that house and it shows. 

I've talked to both my grandmothers about the situation and they agree with me, even offered to help out financially if I could get custody of her. But I don't even know where to start. I know both of my parents would have to be on board. They live so far away they wouldn't get to see her all that often.

191,"So, a little backstory, my mom's toxic and that's about it. She doesn't care about how I feel. She only cares about winning the 'argument', even if there's no argument at all and it's just her being an asshole to me. She can't stand when she loses control of me. She thinks I'm on drugs just because I don't text her back after school. And all these other things that are really complicated, but that's not why I'm typing this.

So, after an incident that happened last night, she told me I was supposed to stay home (then she'd yell at me and accuse me of everything I haven't done, whatever, I knew what was going to happen). But I didn't come back home, even though she said she'd call the cops if I didn't. I don't care. It's 10:20pm and I don't even consider her my mom. I'm with two of my friends and I don't feel a bit of regret, I'm so sick of being ridiculed. I don't care if she called the cops.

But the thing is, I'm scared of what'll happen when I get back to the house. I don't ever want to go back. She's so terrible for my mental health, I can't stand her. She makes me want to rip my hair out it's so bad. And it's never crossed a line where it wouldn't be silly to call the cops, but she does this constantly. She's only full-on hit me once. That was a long time ago. But she knows that if she crosses a certain line, I'll be taken away and her control (which is so important to her) will be taken away. She doesn't care how I feel and she never will.

I can't just leave. The police will take me back, it's already happened once. They see her as a victim because of all the 'abusive relationships' she's been in. But I know the truth, she's so desperate for control that she makes them go crazy to the point they turn violent. Every. Single. Time. I need to leave before I kill myself.

I have pretty bad social anxiety. Always have, but it's gotten alot better within the last couple years. Anxiety has gotten worse in all other ways, though. Within the last year I've taken up smoking weed. Mostly for fun, but I noticed it helped calm my anxiety too. Eventually it became habit to smoke when at home. I'm very good about not being high in public or at work or anything like that. I spend alot of time at home smoking weed because it keeps me calm and happy. I feel mentally addicted to weed as it is. But since my anxiety has gotten worse lately, school is about to start back up(and I wont go to school high so that's way less time I'll have to smoke), and it's becoming common to have anxiety for no reason at all I feel like I should probably try to get a prescription of some kind. But I have a very addictive personality, and I think my nearly constant smoking has made that clear already. I refuse to become reliant on medicine. Some anxiety situations, like unfamiliar crowd, I dont want medication for. But anxiety like today where I felt it all night for no reason, I need it for.

I was too scared to drive there myself and take actual classes on campus. After college, I was too scared to get any job. So I stayed home as that felt natural for me. This was for about a year and then I got an opportunity to have a job doing in home activities with my disabled brother. So I did that and I'm still doing that. And now my mom recently got a different job position with him that requires a co-signer (me -eye roll-) and that position basically requires that I stay around close enough where I can check on him regularly to ""make sure she's doing her job"". I actually really appreciated the job doing in home stuff for him for a long time but now I have a bf (24M) who lives 2 hours away and we plan to marry in about 1.5-2.5 years. We have been seeing each other about every other weekend since we met in person, we've been together for 7 months now. We're thinking it would probably be best for me to move to his location. I had to talk to a lawyer on the phone not long ago and answer questions from him as my mom's co-signer.

I basically said not anytime soon. So she must have told him that. :/ My mom does not want me to drive 2 hours in my own car to see my bf and says that my car could break down in the middle of nowhere with my cell phone possibly not working, also that I have driving anxiety and that it's not safe for a female to drive alone that far. Then she said I can take public transportation. My bf has always had to pick me up and drop me off. I feel willing to drive to his location but will probably try public transportation for now at least. She also does not want me to move 2 hours away and guilt trips me about the co-signing thing and about her being left alone, etc. -Sigh-. I do feel too scared to get another job though besides the one I have and I have no idea really what one I should do. I could become a teacher's assistant with my degree but just the thought of that makes me burst into tears. My dad passed away almost a year ago - he could be a good person I guess but he was also very damaging and abusive at times. I have been threatened as a child (up until the last one when I was 19) for basically nothing or otherwise going against his wishes in some way. I have been humiliated and screamed at in public as a child, teenager, and adult. And just otherwise treated like crap and patronized and like my feelings didn't matter. It's hard to know how to get out of this ugly web I'm caught up in.

Tldr: I have social anxiety, my life is in shambles right now since idk what job I can handle with that condition.",11Jan2020,1

I live in Florida. This girl has been harassing me throughout high school and even after we graduated. She has admitted to causing the suicide of her best friend in middle school. I believe she is a sociopath. Over the years of high school her methods of trying to ruin my life have gotten more and more psychotic and twisted over time. She was even given an out of school suspension in our senior year.

We are both 18, and after high school I went to college and she went into the military. She harassed me throughout the summer up until she left. 

She also harasses those close to me. When she visited to Florida for Christmas and New Years, she tried contacting me through Snapchat but I blocked her. She added me from a new account.

On New Years Eve a friend of mine with Aspergers, who is also 18, posted a bunch of screenshots on her Instagram story. I don’t blame my friend for that - the military chick was saying truly awful things, and also threatened to send something to her parents (I don’t know what - my friend blurred that part out).

Shortly after my friend posted to her Snapchat story explaining that the sociopath sent something very bad to her parents. Then she sent everybody her slitting her wrists, and deleted all of her social media.

Knowing my friend, I firmly believe she tried to kill herself, also having slit her wrists and deleting her social media accounts. Her last words on Snapchat seemed very final. Nobody has heard from her since (probably because of her irrationally strict parents). I believe she’s alive but I’m honestly not sure.

I screenshotted my friend’s story in which this military brat was degrading her for being autistic, and denying her requests to leave me and our friends alone, along with her blackmailing my friend by threatening to send something to her parents.

The reason I hadn’t reported her to the police in the past was because of my parents preventing me (I had a violent childhood they didn’t protect me from, so I’m not surprised). Now that I’m 18 I want to take action any way I can. What can I do?",11Jan2020,1

209,"Hello!

I'm a bit at a lost here. For context, I am 17 y/o, as that is my main problem here. I'm a minor looking for a job essentially.

The problem is, all places I've applied to for almost 3 years now have too many minors working, won't accept me because I'm a minor, won't accept me because I have no previous work experience; and more. Then theres personal issues like some places would hire me but I can't drive yet, and with them out of my town, I can't work there. There's just many reasons why I can't get an actual job, and I've applied to as many places as I can. So now what I'm looking for is small tempt jobs such as babysitting, or dog walking, or the like.

Problem there is nobody wants or needs me there. Nobody wants to leave me with their kids if they have to pay me, nobody wants me to do meal preps for them if they have to pay me (thats something I do for my siblings as my parents work till late), and more. I also do art commissions but nobody is interested in those online or in person.

I'm just in need of some cash and I don't know where to go from here. So any advice from someone will really help me out right now. Thank you!

TL;DR - Im a minor that can't get a job, I also can't do tempt jobs like babysitting or art commissions. What else can I do for a small bit of cash?",11Jan2020,1
210,"Hi everyone, so I've been suffering from bad breath for like ten years now. First i found out about it when i was 13 year old. Because a guy directly said it to me. I don't know how i managed to pass this phase through high school. I didn't talk much with people only friend. But i wasn't that much insecure about it that time. But now i am in university and since five years I've completely isolated myself from any social interaction. I don't even meet friends from high school. It just so hard these days i am passing my days in university without talking much. 
I've seen dentist already they said there's nothing wrong in my oral hygiene. And I've throat infection too which causes a lot of cough throughout the day. I've seen ENT multiple times they said I don't have a tonsils stone problem. Also i do have some digestive issues too. But I've took medicine. Nothing works.

I recently discovered a smallish cockroach problem in my apartment, and I can't figure out how to get rid of them. They don't really stray from my kitchen, and they don't seem to mess with my food at all, but its pretty gross finding them on the counter and watching them scatter when I go to make breakfast or something. I've tried the traps you buy at the store and a sonic repellant, but neither has helped. They seem to be living in the walls of my cupboards and places like that, and they're not very big (maybe about the size of a nickel).

214,"Background:Several years ago,this guy calls me in the middle of the night claiming he's one of my stepdad's illegitimate children and wants to connect.I tell him to take it up with my parents since he's such a detective,and he does so,contacting them over FB.

A couple of days later,my mom tells me to cease all contact,saying he'll just ask for money.I figure ""meh,my family has enough drama anyways"",tell him what's up,apologize and cut all contact but keep in mind I did this because I wanted to minimize drama within my own family,not because I believed my mom saying he's after money,cause my mom isn't very trustworthy or reliable herself. (That's a different story.)

I remember one of the last things he said to me was asking if I think we look alike,making me think ""Does this dude not know we have different dads?Huh . . .""

Now:This guy added me on FB about a week ago,asking if I still remember him.I ask him to remind me,playing coy.He goes ""Oh you don't remember.Nvm,it was a long time ago hehe.Happy New Year.""

I greet him back ""Happy New Year"".

And a day after,he sends me a request on FB.

I have neither deleted nor confirmed it cause I honestly wouldn't mind talking to him if not for my mom and I'm fully capable of telling someone to fuck off if they're after money.However,if this guy is up to no good,I wouldn't wanna open that door,and also,I have yet to hear a story about someone reconnecting with their estranged parent's family and it goes well.I myself have no interest in meeting my father's racist,elitist first family from his first wife.

217,"A little back story before we get into this. I was dumped by my first girlfriend and accused of rape by her and her friend group. She never took it any further to try and get me in trouble because she knew it wasn’t true but used it for popularity. Fast forward a couple months and I’m in a really dark place since I cut everyone out of my life except my mom (who’s always been my best friend and I’m not ashamed of it.) Then one day this girl tells me that she’s interested in me and would like to go out this time. Now I wasn’t looking for anything but I thought that maybe if I opened myself up, I would find peace again. So we started talking and we just connected. She’s very shy/self conscious and I’m very outgoing/confident. Somehow we became the best of friends, and eventually lovers. Now I’m still very young and new to love so this is all a learning experience for me and it didn’t help that I am her first boyfriend, so neither of us know what to do since my last relationship was very very short. Everything is going great, fast forward a couple of months and my ex wants to be friends. I have a strict policy on forgive and forget so, hey if she means it then I would be okay with that. My girlfriend finds out and assumes that I was trying to hide it from her (I didn’t think of it as a big deal so I didn’t tell her) which leads to our first fight a bout 5 months in. We figure things out and I assume that everything will go back to normal (we agreed that I won’t be friend with my ex). But just from then on it has been constant fighting. I’m a total push over for people I care about so any time she’s upset I take all the blame even when she’s at fault to make her feel better. After a while I start to believe that I am genuinely a terrible person who doesn’t treat her right. She will randomly call me and tell me that she feels like she’s not being treated right and she wants me to change myself over small things that I don’t even notice. I’m not abusive and All I’ve ever done is given her what she wants. Well it’s been almost two years of that now and I just can’t take it. I cancelled a date for the first time today with her because I knew she’d end up doing it again because this happens daily (over the phone and in person). I just wanted one day to be happy and not get told everything that is wrong with me. I admit that I have my flaws and I mess up, but sometimes I need to be told that I’m loved and appreciated. I really thought I loved this girl, I really did. But I need to start loving myself. Any ways when I tried to cancel the date, she assumed that I didn’t like her any more (I told her I wanted to go visit my mom) and she hasn’t spoken to me since. It’s been about 12 hours and now word from her. What do I do in this situation? I just can’t bring up the courage to break up with her because my mother (my best friend) doesn’t know any of this and adores her. I feel stuck with no one who cares.

I'm working in a tech company's consulting services department and am currently under it's training period. It will almost be a month since I was hired

I managed to pass the interview but under the training, I am having a very difficult time. In the first few weeks I would always finish the tasks given to me per every lecture despite having some difficulties but now I can't keep up

I can't self-study the tools they use in the company at home since you can only access it within their domain. 

I'm sorry, it really sounds like ranting from a guy who's too lazy to work harder but I can't help it. I really do want to stay as late as my other co-trainees but if I do I'll miss the last trip in the bus station

I feel frustrated, sad and depressed after waking up at 4AM and managing to make it home and sleep by 10-11PM and yet still not absorbing all the lessons taught

We were told that if we don't pass two panel presentations we will be terminated immediately and would have to look for another job. They only fully take in those who pass the presentation. So even if I try to finish the training period, there's no guarantee I'll be a mainstay

By this point you may be thinking that this is just depression but I tell you, it's not. She's been receiving extensive mental health care and takes medication for depression.

Some context here:

Before Christmas my dad wanted to treat me, my girlfriend, and her (Asian) friend to a spa day, so we went with his girlfriend and her family. While we were drinking smoothies in the cafeteria accent, my dad, who is normally a progressive liberal dude, told a story where the punchline is an Asian man screaming at him to “TAKE A SHOWA”, and when he tells this story he puts on an Asian accent .  

Everybody laughed, including my girlfriends friend, but I could tell the joke made her uncomfortable. I called him dad out and said that he shouldn’t use an Asian accent mockingly like that but his girlfriend pointed out that my girlfriends friend was laughing and we moved on. My GFs friend later confirmed w me that she thought it was ignorant of him to use that accent. 

Skip to today, me and my dad went out for a lovely dinner and a movie and on the ride home I thought I would bring up with him his use of the Asian accent, expecting him to be receptive and understand how those words could be hurtful. Instead, he refused to apologize, said that he saw it as no different then using a French or Italian accent, and criticized me for always attacking and targeted old whites dudes as the cause of all the worlds problems. He said that he saw what I was doing as a dangerous path towards censorship and that if my GFs friend was offended she should’ve “grown a pair” and pulled him aside to let him know

I was so upset in the car that I cried and said fuck you, and I left without saying goodbye. 

Does he have a point? Am I in the right? It hurts so much because I always looked up to my dad as an emotionally sensitive guy and I’ve never fought with him before, but I refuse to just blindly agree with him when I feel like it was wrong of him

I'm a paranoid schizoaffective and I've never had a delusion like this before. Even when I call it a delusion it doesn't  stop the intrusive thoughts. Here's why I think I'm not human. 

1. I've been allergic and then suddenly not allergic to something. (Cats, medicine, gluten) They were all severe too. I got nasal infections from cats, I was anaphylaxis from medicine, (and sometimes I have a severe reaction and some times nothing) and gluten, I would be vomiting every thirty minutes for two days and have to get a shot in my ass to stop nausea enough to drink more than an ounce at a time and then suddenly I have a dream that I'm not allergic and then I'm not. I eat bread and not a single thing happens. 

2. I don't look like either of my parents, they only wanted three kids and I'm the forth. I have a dozen mental disorders but not a single member in either of my extended families 

3. I seriously think I'm somewhat of a psycic. I have had dreams that I saw years later and even solid things like working at Qdoba and knowing people's orders before they say anything. 

4. I had a lot of illness in highschool like passing out for no reason, vomiting for so reason, once I even had dibilitating pain in my hip that needed PT and a few months in a wheelchair and heavy narcotics. But they never knew why. It was like I got a serious injury with the way I was favoring it. I had a cane for half a year and everything.

5. I am expert level good at something for a few months and then I suck. Like I go from making my own pasta and pastries to burning spaghetti. When I was a kid I was amazing at violin even though I never practiced and I could play at the same time as someone else if I looked at them while they played even if I hadn't heard the music before. And then all the sudden I sucked. Idk why, I gave it up. 

And most importantly 6. I have vivid hallucinations of things (like rape) happening to me that to my knowledge I never experienced. 

I've been self harming trying to prove I'm a human like drinking chemicals and even things like cutting myself and rubbing poop in it to get an infection.

237,"I live in a first floor apartment in a beach town. I came home tonight and was sitting near an exterior wall when I heard some familiar, Spanish speaking voices blaring through the walls to my apartment. At first, I thought it was a neighbor in an adjacent apartment I hadn’t met. I heard the conversation growing louder and began to realize: this isn’t neighbors, this is people outside of the exterior wall. I peeked through my blinds without being seen and noticed one man sitting on the steps leading to my back door, and the second man standing in front of him. This is not the first time they’ve hung out here, since I recognize the voices so readily. 

I know they don’t live in my building, which only has a handful of tenants. I don’t feel safe confronting them either. So, I ended up deciding to call the non-emergency police, who drove by my location twice both missing my address and the man (still sitting on the stoop but seemed to have sent the other man on an errand). 

The man either noticed the police (despite no headlights or police lights) or coincidentally left. He stopped to talk to someone on the other side of the alleyway and took off. The police finally found my place after I came out to wave them down, but the man had escaped into the darkness. The police officer asked me “if I had told him he can’t be there” and said that next time I should say “You can’t be here, I am going to call the police.” He said, “if things get aggressive, just close your door.” Good work, officer. Also, the non-emergency line explicitly told me NOT to confront the man or go outside...contradicting the officer’s advice. 

Feeling hopeless, I walk across the alleyway to the back neighbor to ask him what the man stopped and said to him (again, I don’t speak Spanish). He told me that he did not speak to any man. I continued to prod when he finally said, “alright, I’ll be honest with you, it was me talking to him.” And I explained that he had been on the property and I was checking to make sure he wasn’t up to something “bad.” The neighbor said, “Nothing bad...just stuff...don’t worry about it.” I told him, if it’s drugs or whatever, I’m not a nark. He said, I got you, dont worry. 

I didn’t like that answer. Set up a bunch of cameras in my windows. 

I saw motion and AGAIN the man was back—it’s now much later at night. He then went across the alleyway and spoke the neighbor I spoke to. He pointed at two corners of my place (maybe the cameras) TWICE. Then, presumably, the neighbor told him I had come asking questions. They exchanged cash. I didn’t see an item exchanged. The neighbor went back in and brought the man a bottle of water, and he headed on his way. 

Do you think I’m safe? Think they are coming back to get me since I asked questions and called the police? Any tips for self-defense besides pepper spray, cameras, and deadbolts?

Tells me that he wants to give me house which is a single that used to be a double (double front and back not up and down..though we do have 2 floors) and that he would still live there but that he would give me plenty of space and fix the back into an inlaws style apartment and put the wall back up). 2.5 years later he has done no work and it doesn't feel like he plans on it. He is incredibly nosey and needs to be in my business constantly. I can't even bring dates home because  he is constantly in my living room etc. I have brought his up and nothing has changed. I love him but we were never close like me and my mom were. In October of 2019 (3 + months ago) I lost my job of 9 years ago. Luckily for me I have money, I also received a severance package and I qualify for unemployment. So I have been taking my time figuring out what I want to do next. Currently the bills I have are normal utilities, plus stuff like internet, cellphone, netflix and a truck payment. However again my dad paid the house off so no mortgage etc. In a recent discussion I asked him if he would be  mad if I sold the house and I moved on my own to portland. He said he was cool with it and that he gave me the house but knows that moving to Portland is something I have wanted to do for quite awhile. 

I have nothing holding me here, all my siblings are grown up (actually all older than I) all my nieces and nephews are grown up. I will miss my friends but I really feel like I want a fresh start. The house is nothing fancy, however it is in a desirable neighborhood here in Buffalo downtown and I could probably get around $350k for it. My plan would be to pay off my truck and get a decent apartment/loft etc in Oregon with my cousin who is also down to move with me and take my time finding what I want to do next in life.

Thoughts? am I losing my mind?",11Jan2020,1
240,"ok i dont think that i am, but just tell me what you think. 

i want to be a boy. but i want to be a cis boy. im a cis girl and i just really wish i was a boy. i wish i had a dick and a flat chest. i wish i had a strong jawline and low voice. i wish i was tall and strong. when i see how flat a boy's chest is i get jealous because i want that to be me. i want their body, not mine, i hate my body. but that also might be tied to eating disorder issues ive had for  a few years that i wont go into. today someone told me they thought i had a lower voice and it made me so happy i wanted to cry. i see boys and i want to be them and look like them. i get jealous of the way a boy looks because i want to BE him. i have an image i my mind of what i would want my male self to look like.

at the same time though, i obsessively measure my waist because i want it to be small? i feel like since im not a cis guy and thats an impossible goal, i just want to be an attractive girl because thats my only option. i genuinely want a bigger butt and a smaller waist. i want to be skinny so badly. i still dont want boobs though. i really, really want a completely flat chest.

i want to feel like i could protect myself or my s/o if the time came. i know i couldnt though. im 5'2 and weak. another thing is like girls. if i was a boy then i would be straight. ive always wanted to be straight. also tmi? but if i was a cis boy and had a dick i could have penetrative sex with girls and things like that.

when i was a kid i never really showed any signs of this. (aside from really wanting to be able to grow facial hair? i was very sad i wasnt ever going to be able to) i loved glitter and ""girly"" things. i loved carrying purses and wanted long hair. but as i got older (around 7th grade?) these feelings of wanting to be a boy would show up subtly, slowly getting more intense to where i think about them everyday. i want to be a cis boy so bad. i wish i was born as one.  i also dont really care about pronouns. she/her doesnt bother me, but i wouldnt mind being called he/him either. i also like having long hair(i have shoulder length, its not very long. i used have hair that went down to my nipple and i did not like it). i love doing hair, though i do have an image of what i would want my hair to look like if i was ever a guy.

the thing is though i dont even know if id want to transition. i dont think i would. i would want the body of a cis boy, not a trans boy. i dont know if id like my body after i transitioned. i dont know if id like having bottom growth or my waist getting bigger (since im obsessed with being skinny) and its not like i feel like im not a girl. mostly i do. sometimes though i see boys goofing around and im with a ton of girls and i feel out of place like i was meant to be a guy and would fit in better with them, but thats pretty much the only time. i dont feel like a boy, i just wish i was one. ill probably never ever transition, mostly out of fear of backlash from my friends and family, and i dont really know if id want to. but..

what does this mean? or just tell me what you think, please.",11Jan2020,1

After they broke up, he didn’t really want anything to do with me; I was like this walking memory of a past relationship. And I understood that. And I assumed that that was the reason why he stopped talking to me, but it was never communicated to me, which led me to almost two months of me beating myself up for failing to communicate with him. I sent dozens and dozens of texts and phone calls that all just went unread or disregarded, leading me to believe he didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I slowly started to accept the fact that he would no longer be a part of my life, but he recently spoke with me and explained everything.

But now we’re in this awkward limbo of; “Am I still mad at you? Was I ever mad at you? How do I talk to you?” 

Should I continue to try and reach out even if it means no response/left on read which leaves me disappointed or helpless, or should I just stop communicating with him and wait for him to come to me since he was the one who wanted the friendship to end in the first place?",11Jan2020,1

Going to college for a completely different area of study: sociology/communications, i currently have a scholarship that pays a modest amount of my classes. However, with how my work schedule and school works, I end up taking all my classes the same day and work 9 hour shifts the rest of the week.

Not sure if i’m capable of passion I feel generally burned out. I don’t even wanna go over how the clinic generally made me feel for the past few months. Micromanaging, greed, and unmotivated coworkers. As a response to this, I applied to another clinic and have an interview set up for this week.

Hey reddit, I'm feeling a little conflicted and I could use some advice.  
So about a year ago me (18) and my ex (17) broke up for the second time because of how bad things got between us. we were both having some rough spots and decided to have some space. We both kind of blamed each other for breaking up because we weren't smart enough to sit down and talk about what was going on. However, as of recently we managed to get ourselves in the same room and talked for a bit. Surprise surprise, solving problems by talking it out brought us to a neutral ground and we became friends again.

Flash forward to around now, for the past couple weeks I (19) keep having thoughts that maybe I want and should take my ex (18) back. Third times the charm right? I want to bring it up in conversation with her, but I don't know how she'd react or if she'd even want to hear it. I don't even fully know if I want to get back together. It just feels like it's just supposed to happen between us. I've been losing sleep and having small fits of anxiety and panic over these thoughts, nothing dangerous, I'll just get really tense and breathe faster than normal.

259," After two years of living in California, I just moved back to my hometown of Philadelphia. I had been dying to get back here for a while, feeling like I had lost touch with people back home and missing east-coasters who I find more transparent and straightforward.

However, now that I’m back, I’m in a bit of a funk. Reconnecting with old friends at 31 has been less pleasant than expected. Some friends make me feel like we’re competing in how well our lives turned out, others make me feel judged or guilty for ways I’ve grown, and some make me feel like I’m reverting to an old version of me that I don’t want to be anymore.

I've been feeling really overwhelmed, it’s like a past me and the new me are trying to reconcile who the real me is (sorry this is sounding like Slim Shady).

When I was isolated in California, there were no expectations or who I had been or should be, and I was able to grow. Now I’m feeling a little insecure in the self I had built and kind of miss my freedom to be unknown by others.

267,"TLDR: I’m pregnant, one manager keeps screwing me over in ways that affect mine and my baby’s health and I ended up in the hospital because the stress put me in false labor. 

I’m 23 weeks (about 5.5 months) pregnant. With this comes many joys, including (but not limited to): hip pain, back pain, incontinence and cramping. 

Over the last few weeks my pregnancy has started to hit me harder. There is one manager that seems to have it out for me, but I want to know if that’s actually the case or if I’m overreacting. A short list of things that have happened:

-when you’re pregnant, sometimes you pee on yourself. That happened during my shift. I texted a coworker to get my tables transferred and get my checkout run. This manager waited 15 minutes to transfer the tables, and then another 45 to run my checkout so I could pay out and go. All this while I’m sitting in the bathroom. My coworker asked him 3 times to do it and I ended up having to call the store to get it done. 

-after literally falling over in the kitchen because I was cramping, he cut every other server except me and the closer. 

-after telling me I couldn’t transfer a table, and that I have to close it out. He let the server who started them after I closed out transfer them to me. They were furious. 

-I told the other managers about these instances and that I wasn’t comfortable working with him and they said not to work when he was there and they would put me on an opposite schedule to him on the next one. Then when I showed up yesterday and found out he had switched shifts with someone and was on my shift I was told that if I left I was fired. 

-also yesterday he called me into the office and basically told me “i didn’t do anything wrong deal with it or get bent” and tried to put all the blame on me because I’m too emotional and that I made it all up when other people can confirm every instance. 

-today because of the stress of the entire situation I ended up in the hospital in false labor.

Am I being overreacting? If yes, I need to know. If no, how can I go about this situation best. I cant go anywhere else because everywhere else in town is cutting hours and letting staff go after the holidays, also it’s hard to get a job in my area when visibly pregnant.",11Jan2020,1

I don’t really know the girl well, but I’m thinking this will be a good opportunity to just have a good time and get out there. I haven’t been to that many party’s really, and this is always just good social exposure in my opinion, just getting more comfortable with everything really. My friend know everybody there and they don’t really know me, so I’m kind of nervous about that, and I’ve only gone out clubbing once before since it’s not even legal in the U.S. for under 21. 

The thing is that it’s in Tijuana and although I live 10 min away, I’m scared about my parents finding out and it’s going to be hard to convince my mom to allow me to spend the night somewhere. I’m a sophomore in college who commutes, so my parents treat me like a straight little kid still, and I don’t really know if they’d let me spend the night somewhere else, bc last time I did (like a couple months ago), she wanted to put something on me to track me, she wanted to call the other kids parents, and she was just really adamant about not wanting to spend the night and I practically had to beg. 

This is how I did it last time, but I don’t know if it’s worth it to go through that stress of begging my mom, and then if she doesn’t let me I’m going to get mad and sad. My plan is just to do the same thing as last time, but I don’t know if it’s worth it since I don’t really know anybody, it’s kind of going to be a pain in the ass to just get there, but I’m trying to get comfortable with the uncomfortable.

274,"I (24M) have been talking with this girl (23F) for a few months now. I've been genuine and started out as friends, but I've grown feelings for her. The other day she was talking with someone else that said I probably wanted to bang her. Her reply was ""No he doesnt, hes just nice. Hes very sweet. Hes a very sweet guy"" 

I found out 2nd hand from another person that overheard the conversation. 

When I found out, I didnt know how to feel. At the moment I kind of feel disappointed like theres no romantic future between us, but at the same time I dont want to assume anything. Should I ask her how she feels or is this safe to say that she does not view me romantically? I dont want to make things awkward. I also kind of feel like I'm being the classic ""nice guy"" where I'm only nice because of sexual motives, but that's not the only motive at play here.

275,"Hello,

This is my first time ever using reddit for posting. Anyways here's my issue. So as a senior in highschool I got my senior pictures taken, and they were really good photos that I was excited to have. So this is where my issue starts. My photos were shared with me by the photographer (another student) through google. As the end of the school year approached I backed up my google account like many kids and didn't think much of it. I recently checked my google backup and have not found the photos (Probably because he was the owner/ creator of the folder). I graduated last year. My question is, would it be weird for me to ask the person if they happened to have backed up their school google account, and have my photos still?

Edit: I actually backed up my school account after graduation, by going to the district tech office and having them let me get my data (because the account was closed). So theoretically I could still go to the office and see if they can somehow get the folder. If i did this, it would only take a couple minutes to get it from the tech people, but it might require my  friend (the photographer) going in with me to get them. This situation would only apply if the photographer never backed up his account. The school said they don't delete the accounts for years, so my photos would be there if i went in. Need advice on how to ask my friend if he has them in a backup of his, without sounding weird. I really wanted to keep the photos. If he doesn't, I could ask him to go into office with me for a minute, which is even weirder to ask.",11Jan2020,1
276,"Hi all. I’m hoping someone here can help me with this problem. 

Recently,  I had an important person text me around thanksgiving. He was a potential tenant for a property. My iPhone listed his name as “maybe” John Smith. I texted him back but forgot to save his number to my contacts. I promised to text him when renovations were complete but my iPhone messages was set to clear after 30 days... so the number is gone from my understanding. Btw, I have T-Mobile as my phone carrier.

Is there anyway of recovering this number?

277,"I respect her decision in so many ways but I just can't give up on having feelings for her. She and I get along so well and we have a lot of the same interests. Which is hard to find around here. We attend the same college and I go to class with her each day. I'm just about to start a Diploma course and she's also in it. We're really good friends but I really like her and want more. I'm not going to try and force having a relationship more than that, however, I want more. I've told her how I felt and she said that she just really values our friendship. That's not a complete L right? Or is it just a different way of saying I don't wanna be with you in that way kinda thing. It's been a day since it happened and it's devastated me even though I prepared for something like that. But the thing is she was showing all the right signs that she'd like me. Things like coming into college on her day off because I was there, showing affection, going to a movie she's already seen with me, offering to pay for food, talking in my dead as fuck discord when no one else would besides her and I. Everything was just pointing to her liking me. But I got friend-zoned. I don't know if continuing having feelings for her is a good idea but I can't see myself getting over it. I know I still have her as a really good friend but she is more than that to me and I wanna treat her that way. I know I will get over it, but I don't want to. She's too good to just give up on in that way. Is there a way to have feelings for her but not have it so strong? Or do I just have to face my fears and stop the feelings entirely.

My best friend, we have a strong mental bond and care for each other. But truth is especially the more recent times we’ve hung out it’s not **that** much fun. I think our interests are different and I’m more immature than him ( few years younger ). 


But that reliableness, knowing I can count on him factor of a friend is there. We hang out because of our bond. 







Friend I met semi - recently : we have a ton of fun. More than I’ve had in a long time. But they’ve flaked a few times, are constantly making me wait looong times ( over 25 min usually ), have me wondering if they actually like hanging out with me or just have no one else, etc.

281,"So my (f 25)  best friend/roommate (f 26)  and I had a fight.  I'll call her Jane. After the fight, we had a good 3-hour long talk addressing what went wrong and trying to listen and understand each other better.  We talked about the fact we often misunderstand each other which leads to a lot of arguments. She also had a valid criticism about me, that I get angry too easily, which I admit is true, and am working on it in therapy. I took it to heart and agreed with her that I can do better.  By the end, we have shared a lot about our communication styles and I could see where we were misinterpreting each other. We agreed to continue to work on communication and seeing things from each other's point of view. Or at least this is what I understood.

I have weekly therapy sessions and when I went to my next one a few days later (having missed a couple over the holidays) I was ready to dig in and get some work done. When I got there on Wednesday I was greeted by a very solemn mood and some serious looking faces.  She asks me ""are you, aware Jane came to see me Monday?"" (We both see therapists from the same office. Both therapist know who the other is and occasionally say hello That's the extent of it.) Turns out Jane had seen her therapist and presumably told her about the fight. I don't know what was said, only that Jane floated the idea of confronting my therapist and her therapist told her that was a bad idea and she should not do that 

My therapist, while having a master's degree, is still new to the actual practice of therapy. She's great, it has nothing to do do with the quality of her care that I bring it up. I only bring it up because she hasn't had a lot of hostile encounters from people who aren't even clients. She was obviously not prepared for Jane to storm into the office and demand to speak with her. She probably should have just refused, but like I said shes inexperienced and she just wanted to help.

So on Monday,  Jane stormed into my therapist's office and demanded to speak with her. She then told her she is a bad therapist and has been telling me the wrong things and exactly what she should be telling me. Jane for some reason assumed I got the idea that we have communication issues from my therapist. That's false (though I believe she would agree with me) I got there all by myself considering most of our arguments involve one of us misunderstanding the other. Jane told her she needed to know ""the truth"" about me. My anger problem (which my therapists is aware of we work on it regularly.)  That it's not a communication issue, the problem is me. My therapist (in her view) telling me we need to work on communication wasn't helping because the real issue is that I have ""unchecked"" anger issues and letting me put the blame anywhere else was only hurting me. Of course, she also argued her side of the argument trying to prove she was right to my therapist. (To what end I am unsure.) 

Jane then went and saw her therapist again before I saw mine. (because mine was gone for the holidays) She told her therapist that mine agreed with her and said several personal things about me. This set off alarm bells at the office as it sounds like my therapist broke confidentiality. Now I do know that my therapist doesn't agree with her. Obviously no interpersonal issue on this level is entirely the fault of one or the other. Some other personal details that Jane claimed my therapist told her I know to be false as they were Jane's opinions verbatim. My therapist came very close to getting fired. If I wanted her to be, she would have been. The only reason they told me (which in a way broke Jane's confidentiality) is that they were more worried about me suing and insisted I be told. 

I live with Jand and have to see her every day. I still haven't told her that I know what happened. (Today is Friday) I'm honestly scared to. I never expected this kind of behavior from her and now I have no idea what she is capable of. Our therapists are arranging a joint meeting with all four of us to try and work through this and fo now I'm kind of saving my feelings for that. Where I can be open and honest in a safe space.  I honestly don't know how to even react in the meantime. 

I feel like she lied outright to me about us working together to communicate better and everything. If she never thought that was the issue then she lied about it to my face. Going behind my back to my therapist feels like an attempt at some next level manipulation. That's not beginner's manipulation. How many other times has she manipulated me and I just never noticed. I'd like to note I just got out of an abusive friendship a year and a half ago where his abuse started out as mental manipulation and ended up as sexual abuse. I know I'm an easy target for manipulation but I naively assumed that my best friend who knows every detail of what I went through wouldn't try to use the same tactics. 

I feel like this borders on abuse. Her intent was to change how I viewed myself to her viewpoint by getting to my therapist. The person I tell everything to and who I trust and expect to have my best interest at heart. She tried to get the main person I rely on for my mental health, who got me through the PTSD from my prior friendship, to help her manipulate me. I don't even know where to go from there.

I could give lots of examples to try and show you all our dynamic, but I don't want to try and prove I was right or she was wrong. The fight was indicative of a larger problem. We both made mistakes and we both can be selfish sometimes. I am not perfect.

**So Reddit, got any advice for me?** 

I'd like to add that I do have Idiopathic Hypersomnia which causes chronic sleep deprivation. This makes all of the arguing and whatnot extremely emotionally taxing and is certainly one of the reasons I anger quickly. I'm not perfect, but that's one of the puzzle pieces that explain me a bit.

Shit happens because of reasons.
Keep analysing people who are pretend to be near you or into you.......don't believe onto dum fucks who says that love is what that comes naturally, this is particularly correct.

I lived across the street from a student accommodation, and as I was sitting at my computer writing essays earlier this week, this cute girl in the kitchen opposite starting making gestures at me. I thought she was on the phone or something so ignored it, but she did it again the next day so it was unmistakable and I gestured back.

I tried to shoot my shot the last day I was there but I couldn’t get her attention properly and I wasn’t just gonna stand at my window waiting for her to come back, that’s slightly creepy. Basically I just need some kind of way (that isn’t really really creepy) to shoot my shot now that I don’t live there anymore.

285,"This might be a stupid question to ask, but I feel like an absolute idiot and really want to amend this situation. A professor recommended me for an internship at a rehab hospital. She really did stick her neck out for me, and vouched for my abilities. She personally set up an official internship through my university so that I receive some units in credit. This was set up roughly 12/15. 

The internship is slated for 1/21 until 5/15. My professor originally pitched it as a ""chill"" place to intern, as far as the requirements are far less stringent than the university hospital, where a ton of paperwork, vaccines, and letters of recommendation are needed. Yesterday at work, I was flipping through emails and randomly decided to check out my spam folder. Turns out I had two missed emails from my internship supervisor sitting in my spam folder saying that I need a full background check, and that I should submit the paperwork for the background check by 1/3 at the absolute latest. 

So. Missed a huge deadline by a week. Like a complete ass, I pushed off logging in to the online portal that manages all of my internship paperwork until I saw that email. I was out of town for the holidays and am dealing with having my car totaled by a hit and run when I got back in town. There are a ton of requirements like TB test, drug screen, and some vaccines. Thankfully I have everything up to date except for my drug test and my background test, and I already ran to do my drug test earlier today so the results will be in Tuesday. 

I really dropped the ball on this. I quickly tried to call my supervisor's office, but she was not in. We exchanged some emails about what forms she needs for the background check, and I'm furiously filling out forms now so everything is ready for her on Monday. How do I fix this situation? I'm smart as hell, completely capable, and I know I can kill this internship. However, my missed deadline clearly irked my supervisor and she was cold in the emails. I already sincerely apologized, but outside of just turning in the paperwork ASAP, should I say anything else to her? Just show up and kill it?",11Jan2020,1

288,"2 years ago I tried to kill myself while being overprescribed benzos and other drugs for 5 years and all they did was make things worse. 

So I stopped them all and had the side effect of trying to kill myself again. (Which I cannot imagine trying now! I tried to hang myself BTW glad it didn't work.

Then had ketamine infusions and felt better, then my wifes pregnancy went bad so I started taking just enough benzos to get by which put me in a constant state of withdrawal and made me crazy moody but I didn't realize why at the time.

Then she terminated the pregnancy against my wishes after 2 months of doctors changing their mind about whether the baby would be okay.

Then we fought a bunch.

Then our dog died.

Then our lizard.

Then her mom.

Then I lost my main source of income and my business temporarily.

Then she bought a new car against my wishes.

Then she left me when I yelled at her about it.

Then she didn't help me and basically cut me off so I couldnt afford to get gas or food and she would only help me out if I was watching the kid that we already had. Basically treating me like a drug addict when the only drugs I was ever addicted to were prescribed to me. 

We also own a beautiful house we rent out in a resort so we can live in an overpriced apartment.  Which I was renovating during all of this and busting my ass and spending money on.

One of the times she left I signed a lease on a new place in the next county so I could get some peace but then things looked like they would work out so I talked to landlord and his agent who showed me house and they said ""dont worry, things happen!"" And then I never heard from them again.

I started rebuilding my business and making a very small income.

Then she left me again.

Then she came back.

Then I got in an argument with a doctor (because he was an idiot) while I was sitting on my hands and he called the police for a mental health check after I walked out without threatening anyone or anything and with my hands in pockets. I was just in disbelief of what an asshole he was and told him as much.

The police came to me and my wifes apartment because they had to for insurance reasons to ask me if I was going to hurt anyone or myself which I wasn't so they left.

So did she.

Upside of this part was I realized my shitty moods and anxiety were because I was still hooked on Benzos and it was worse because I went from 1200 10 MG Valiums a day to taking it every few days so I was in withdrawal all the time. 

Every time I was a dick is directly tied to benzos. My friend gave me 30 mg of Valium that I had chopped up and made to last 5 days and I ran out the day before I went to the doctor.  I went to the doctor because I hadn't slept and felt like hell, which was probably more withdrawal.

I haven't seen her or talked to her in weeks but we have been texting and making some progress.

Then today we got sued by the landlord for breaking the lease even though his agent said they would let me out of lease. Looked the guy up on that counties websites and I am the 10th person he has sued in 20 years just in that county. 

He also filled out the papers wrong and lied and it will all get thrown out and I only signed that lease and then had to get out of it because she kept leaving me an coming back.

Now I am alone and sad ( but not suicidal, this is not a cry for help) and except for the Flu I also have right now I am feeling pretty great because I am about 40 days clean from Benzos and anything except for grass and I was on them for seven years and all they did was make my depression worse.

My wife doesn't believe me and took the shrink who almost drugged me death's side on everything. 

My family basically hates me and is blaming me for everything.

I have no idea where to go now or what to do except focus on my business and making money so I can consolidate my debt (which I walked away from 6 months ago when I had to choose between gas and paying them) 

Any ideas? All I want right now is a xanax and my family and my wife would like nothing more I think.

Help :) 

I do not want to lose another 7 years to these drugs but that seems like the easiest way out and I think my wife and family would forgive me for everything if I went back to that doctor and let him drug me into stupidity again for 7 years when I would have been good with some talking and some prozac in the first place 

Or should I get my tent and camping stuff and go live in a national park or some of millions of square miles around me that is BLM land and get a hotel when it is time to see my kid.

291,"I'm a 16 year old boy, and like many people my age I like to smoke weed, and drink alcohol. In moderation of course. My brain is still developing, and getting super fucked very frequently is something that I have done and have learned that it's not what I like to do. As a result of the times that I would get very under the influence very frequently, I am no longer allowed to hang out with my best friends, and my first good, strong relationship with someone who I did and still do love with my entire heart ended yesterday. In addition to that, two of my best friends got into a VERY bad car accident, and luckily they are both okay, but one of them was ejected from the car and hit their face off a tree. Most if their face is broken and they've lost most of their teeth. They'll be okay, but it will be a very long recovery. (The breakup was not due to my partying btw)

Now, onto the real issue. I now am left with absolutely no one to hang out with. I spend all of my time outside of school in my room playing videogames, making beats, and listening to music. When I'm not at home I'm walking through the streets by myself, or driving by myself. The constant isolation in addition to a solid week of terrible events has shown me that I can no longer continue to live like this. I'm not suicidal, but I frequently have thoughts where I visualize myself dying in some sort of accident. I know that these are things that I definitely don't want to happen to me, but I still get these thoughts almost every day. I believe this to be a product of my constant isolation and loneliness, and I have these thoughts because I know that if something like this were to happen to me, it would bring my dearest friends in my direction. 

I keep getting sidetracked, I apologize. I often have a hard time putting my thoughts into words. My problem is that I like to party, but I'm also responsible and have plans for my future like going to college and a career. This causes me to be unable to connect with people because most people who are responsible, do good in school, and have plans for their future often are not the same people who like to smoke, drink, and go to parties, and the people who like to do those things often don't have plans for their future. This is making it nearly impossible for me to find new people to hang out with. I feel like a two sided coin in an environment full of metal spheres. I know there will be people who will tell me to stop consuming alcohol and smoking weed, but the fact of the matter is that most kids in highschool are either strictly responsible and only hang out with other strictly responsible people, or they're party animals who only hang out with other party animals. I am both. What can I do to help my situation?

Tldr: I like to party, but I also like to be responsible, do good in school, and have plans for my future.",11Jan2020,1
292,"   To begin, my parents are divorced, my father never really cared to have contact with me. I was always left out by him and if he had to tell me something, he would ask for my sibling to pass a message to me and I was never invited to vacations or family dinners on his half and missed out on a lot of things. 

Before the divorce, the favouritism was noticeable between my sibling and I, I was always scolded both physically and verbally by him for something that we both would do but I was “the trouble maker”. I missed out on opportunities my sister was given but I was not, such as sports, learning, and even just spending time together.

I am 14 years of age now, I make a point of seeing him once in a while and have slowly improved our relationship socially. I wasn’t comfortable speaking to him about my life because he never showed any interest in it but I came across a situation that my father had to know. I had left school to start online schooling, I had left because the classes were getting too easy and my peers didn’t care about education as much as I did. I had to get a computer, I didn’t have money or a job, I wasn’t qualified for any jobs because of my age. My mother already works too much for two children so I had to ask him for some money. I didn’t mind asking him for money since I had to watch my sibling be gifted thousand dollar presents and money every week while I had to sit there and watch. It took a while to convince him to get me computer, I was already out of my local school and ended up being too far behind to go back. A year later I got some money from him, I showed my gratitude and bought a computer with our money combined (I sold some things). 

A month before I started online schooling, I visited him, he had something to say to me. He told me that this online school is not real and I just wanted to drop out. He told me he has to get me back in our local school because its not okay. I told him about my ambitions and his reply is that I am young and I should have friends and start drinking. He wanted me to party saying it is part of the experience. I knew he was comparing me to my sister because they are drinking buddies and he pays over 2k a year on my underage sisters booze and i’ve constantly complained about it. I told him I want education and that is all. He is going to my old friends and telling them stuff about me and saying that he’s bringing me beach to school. He does not know that I have just quit pot for four months now and i’m ready to get my life on track and i’ve awaited this online school for so long and I had finally felt relieved of pressure.

This is more of a rant but i’m afraid the reason he does not like me is because i’m not like my sister, she is 17 with no job and constant cash handouts from him. She parties everyday and the alcohol has made her very aggressive and verbally abusive. I do not want to be like her and that’s what he wants me to be. I have a strong direction in life and i’m very independent and only focused on success. My father treats me so poorly and I don’t want him to refuse a relationship with me because I’m not someone he likes. Is it okay for him to ask this of me and attempt to put me back in a public school without my consent when i’m already enrolled in an online one? my mother is getting sick of me using her as my only emotional support but this is none of my friends business and I don’t feel confident around my father. I feel alone and i’m going along with no help and everyone is hating on me because i’m different then how they act. He does not like speaking to people that does things differently then he does.

Today we had a few major fights and I was getting ready to pack up and leave. I went downstairs and when I came back up she was nowhere to be seen. I went back downstairs running around trying to find her. Finally she answers my texts saying she was under the bed passed out.

She tells me she went under the bed and slammed her head on the ground which made her pass out and then she tells me she also took a handful of pain killers (extra strength excedrin). So of course I freak out and I make her let me take her to the emergency room. They take blood samples, give her activated charcoal to drink. Then they come back and tell us they will need to transfer her to another hospital for a legally-required psych evaluation. She got really upset by this and after the doctor leaves she gets really pissed at me and says I made her come here. She also continues to tell me not to talk to her just to leave her alone that she plans on sneaking out etc. What do I do? How can I handle this incredibly toxic situation?

I haven’t seen her in years so I wanted to see what she looked like and how she was doing not that I can check up on her like that but anyways does this make me seem crazy or something like there is always a couple times of the year when I think about her but don’t do what I just did. Idk I feel sad when I think about it but it made me happy by seeing her post. She seems happy like she’s living life to the fullest so I can’t complain. I’m happy for her.",11Jan2020,1

I have tried distracting myself with other girls but it doesn't work, I keep finding myself wishing that I had done things differently. I swear I am not feeling sorry for myself or anything, in fact, I wish I didn't have feelings for her anymore. Another thing is that she was one of my best friends, and when she broke up with me she said she wanted us to remain friends, but anytime I see her or I'm about to talk to her she evacuates the area as if I have some sort or deadly sickness. Anyways, the point is I'm trying to get some help on how I can leave behind my feelings for her and instead start being friends again.

308,"I was in some sort internal exile battling an existential crisis in the last 8 months or so. I've always thought that the only good version of myself would be a writer/playwright or musician, sheltered away from everyone; and I gotta admit that I was/am a fairly decent, or maybe even talented at singing and writing. I'm ugly and loud (objectively so) and hurt the people around me (sometimes willfully to feel better about myself; narcissism?). And thus I've tried being nothing, which was a tad bit better than hurting myself by hurting others as some form of self-harm (compassion is one of my greatest gifts, but also one of my greatest burden I fear). This was pretty much at the beginning of the year.

Then I joined a discord server out of a whim. I've noticed that I really can be a good person if the circumstances are given and people that accept me, but I have the fear that all the gain I felt came only from feeding my egotistical needs (if there even are any; but this is probably my ego speaking up as well). But in any way I was more happy and in touch with my emotions; I just cried the first time in 4 years or so, but I fear that I grow over-attached with the people there.

And then I started the first job of my life (well, it was more of a job preparation thing; unsure if Americans have a comparable concept to it). I see my previous problems coming up again. I've acted caring and helpful for the sake of the group. All the others are trying to achieve the lowest possible degree in my country, and as I almost graduated from Gymnasium I thought that I might be able to help them. But once again I fear that the only gain I get from that is a boost for my enormous ego. But at least I am not trying to fuel my self-hatred and laziness with hurting and self-pity that much anymore.
I was immensely sleep deprived in the time, but I couldn't feel the sensation of tiredness in my numbness. Out of a possible manic/nervous breakdown I contemplated ego death. I thought it was the only option to truly know my *real* worth for the people that surround me in my working environment. I am terrible at following orders and get lost in my mind all the time. So I thought I don't deserve a mind anymore. I am all-consumed with worry and self-doubt instead of passion and compassion, and I am only able to funktion. Ego death might be a good escape plan from failing at my dreams as I was so often destroyed entirely by failure, though my ego never was completely gone because of it. I only have no access to DMT and am also nowhere close to handling it as the only substance I ever abused is alcohol for cathartic purposes. 

I've lost track of my shitty text up there, so here is a TL;DR: a 20 year old man contemplates either giving up everything for everyone else's sake or giving or giving up his work and most of his social life to become successful and feel a *real* accomplishment, even if there is no talent anymore. He can only act and think in extremes so he can't see easier solutions.

Any advice?",11Jan2020,1

i have 4 extremely close knit friends of 3 years that i normally chill with online we only talk about 3 for this story. So about 4 months ago my male friend (N) and my female friend (P) started dating. P has a variety of mental issues including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. After 3 months of dating P has left N completely and started dating another person within the week of leaving N. This has caused N to have a lot of emotional issues over the last month as he has no clue what he did wrong. P seems to not plan on telling N what he did wrong (or why she left him). However we all still hangout on discord almost every day, but there is always a thick bad vibe in the air. This bad vibe has been a major stressor for everyone in the group. Me and N made a plan today for him to ask P why she left him. N is very scared about this as P is a very sensitive person and has suicidal in the past. N is having a hard time confronting P about this. This issue is literally ripping apart our tight group from the inside out.

311,"So I (15M) on Tuesday, my phone got stolen in the locker room and I’ve reported it to my teachers and the office, and I’ve managed to have some luck in possibly being able to recover it due to Find My iPhone because whoever stole it often turns it on at certain points throughout the day 

I’ve managed to create a timeline of the locations he has turned it on with one of them being in a classroom in a certain area of the school, and have been able to notice a pattern where he usually turns it on 15-20 minutes after school is over and he leaves through the eastern side of the school whereas the Gym (which is the class it got stolen in and our final class for the day) is on the far left

He seems to not be thinking it through that much because he kept on powering on the phone despite knowing that I am tracking it, but he’s smart enough to not power it on whenever he is at his house or in any of his classrooms except for the one instance which I mentioned earlier

I’m getting a positive feeling that I may be able to eventually find out who it is but my parents want me to give up on trying because they fear I’ll get jumped or something if I keep on looking, although I think this is just their fear which they got from my hometown where gang related crimes and violence was a rather big problem (we live in Vegas now), the school I currently go to does have your typical up-to-no-good people which are present in like every high school and it is considered a ghetto school by many students however the school is considered to be a joke because the “hardasses” are usually freshmen or seniors trying to act tough and the fights that do occur are some of the most half assed fights you’ll ever witness, but my parents are worried I might get followed from school by the guy’s friends if the guy gets in trouble and from their they might do something like shooting up our house or something

I don’t know whether I should continue or not, on one hand I am fed up with my shit often being stolen and a lot of my important stuff was on that phone that I won’t be able to recover if I give up, but on the other hand I am not completely sure if I’ll manage to recover the phone, and I don’t want my parents to worry too much (especially since a lot of this fear comes from my cousin who was killed in my hometown for getting involved in some gang related activities), so I’m not entirely sure",11Jan2020,1

Firstly she’s furious about this because the damage to my floor and her ceiling will be expensive to repair, and also because my room is messy (it’s not great but it’s mostly laundry, there was some trash in my bathroom though). She tore through it and was so angry I thought she was gonna start breaking things or hitting me. She said not to show my face downstairs until everything is spotless and stormed off. 

I’m terrified. My only hope is that my stepdad can somehow talk her down. I’m almost glad I’m locked upstairs because I’m scared to be around her. There was no way for me to have known about the bathroom. I’m worried she’ll take every cent I have or make me sell things to pay for the damage, and I’m *especially* worried she’ll take and destroy/sell/etc a package coming on Tuesday-ish in retaliation. I’m gonna try to help financially of course but I’m scared she’ll take everything. 

I’m still scared she’ll burst back into my room to scream at me more. How do I fix this? Or how do I get my mom to not be a terrifying person to be around? I’m considering staying at my dads for a while, it’s bad over there too but not nearly as threatening.

Or do I play it safe and say yes to job 3...but then what if after I have said yes to them, either job 1 or 2 decide to accept me? Do I jump ship after saying yes? That would be horrible for me to do right?? I REALLY want job 1 or 2 more but if I say no to job 3 and I don’t get offered either job 1 or 2....then I will have lost out on a GREAT position with job 3...

He took it upon himself to go full bore and look into my history of cervical cancer and when confronted about this he didn't even respond.

347,"His family lives overseas so naturally he spends quite a bit of time on the phone to them. It usually ends up being multiple hours a day which I don't really understand but I guess he has a lot to talk about? Usually he talks at a volume a little above your average 'inside voice' but often he shouts very loudly too, which is where I draw the line and ask him to keep it down. Even at his lower volume he is still quite a bit louder than most people having a conversation.

Am I being an asshole by getting annoyed at him being on the phone so often? The constant wall of noise becomes *very* distracting and it is inescapable without leaving the house entirely, regardless of whether he's shouting or speaking more quietly. Would it be unreasonable to bring it up more often and ask him to be less loud or take it outside? Advice would be appreciated.",11Jan2020,1

He wants me to hang out with them and become good friends. And he thinks that I pick reasons to not become friends. Which is slightly true but is also about how comfortable I am in certain situations.

These reasons include one has two kids and I’m childless. One tends to be busy a lot. He claims that I need to reach out to these people but it’s not something I am comfortable with.

357,"I'm not sure if this is even the right/best place to ask this but here goes. I had to take care of my parents and little brother (well always but this case is specific) and rented an apartment for the 4 of us from 8/2017 - 8/2018. 2bd 1.5 bth + den and we paid electricity iirc on an 1802/month bill. I paid for everything. My little brother stained his den area with some drink or juice and it wasn't properly taken care of by my parents or him, so after I left I was informed they sent a claim that I owed them $521 to collections.

This is after a $750 deductible, meaning they charged me totally for $1271. That tells me they're charging me for the full replacement of the rug, which I'm not okay with. 

I've recently tried to apply for an auto loan, first time btw, and apparently I've been denied twice because of this only deragotory remark on my report. My score on Credit Karma says 764 which I'm proud of and worked diligently for in lieu of my circumstances.  But once again, my life is negatively impacted by my family's negligence and I needed this loan ASAP.

I have pictures of the apartment still, but idk how to dispute it or deal with it in the most effective way to remove it from my report and it a fast manner. Idk what to do. I'm already assuming itll take longer than 30 days which means I'll have to reapply and hit my score again. Or should I just go to the dealership and have them do my financing stuff?

358,"I've been living in an apartment complex that just recently got bought out by one of those companies that buys old apartments, renovates them, then leases them out for like 3x the price (typically these places have awful management). I moved in about 5 months ago which is roughly around the time they got bought out.
Here's the problem- I can't get them to respond to my maintinence requests.
I've submitted numerous maintenance requests over the past 5 months and most of these requests are about the same few issues. To keep the list short, my a/c system is in and out of functionality, I'm missing some vent covers, the light in my closet has no means of being turned on or off (no switch, pull, etc), and the biggest one is that the outlet for my washer and dryer doesnt supply enough power to completely run a cycle (it provides enough power to fill the tank but not agitate/ turns the dryer on but provides no heat). I've had someone come and look at the washer/dryer (the people from whom I bought it) and they said they could not find any issues with the machine itself but believe it's the outlet (which I believe them because it's happened before in another outlet in the same apartment).
I've gone up to the office repeatedly to get them to respond to these work orders and they tell me ""oh we'll let maintinence know you have a request"" but nobody ever comes to fix anything or schedule and appointment with me to come into my unit and fix the issues.

Didn’t want her to work. Belittled her. Didn’t let her go to college. Hit her once. She felt scared she left in the middle of the night and served him divorce papers later. Not divorced yet.

5 months later, I started talking to her. One month in our relationship she said she had thoughts about self sabotage and that a voice told her she didn’t deserve to be happy. But would try to ignore those thoughts by seeing me.

We went out for 4 months. I casually made a comment: “I just realized this, I bought a house and I live in it (my mom and sister live in it too), and you want to also buy your house someday. When would we live together?” She said “huh, idk.” And didn’t talk about it anymore. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal.

A week later, she starts asking me questions like: am I your happiness or do I just bring happiness, does it bother you I won’t move in with you, does it bother you if I don’t move in with you even if I lived alone, etc. I didn’t think much of it. I said no it doesn’t bother me. I told her my plan was to move out of the house anyway if it came down to it.

4 days later, she sent me a breakup text telling me she never got over my original comment from a week ago and realized we have no future together.

I was like, wtf? I asked for clarification and she kept saying she didn’t see a future with me. She immediately unfollowed me everywhere and gave me back the jewelry and Apple Watch I gave her the same day she broke up with me.

I was so confused still and lost. I feel like she broke up with me because of the bad thoughts in her head and past negative experience but I don’t think she should’ve left me?? At least ask me for a break or space or talk in person about the issue. It just seems so weird to me.",11Jan2020,1

Two and a half years ago, me and my friend’s Ex (who I was also friends with) sexted one night.  We were having a deep conversation about many things, including her relationship. When she asked if she could show me something, I figured it was nudes, but I didn’t stop her.  She sent them and rather than do the right thing, I sent some of my own back.  She cheated multiple other times with other people before this as well.  The couple broke up around 9 months later.

I’ve asked her multiple times since to come clean and tell him about what happened, but she doesn’t want to.  They’ve stopped all contact with one another for a while now, but I hung out with the guy again for the first time in a while a month back.  

I know I’m an asshole for sending nudes and getting involved in the relationship.  I told myself I will never do anything like that again and so far I’ve done well with the second chance I gave myself, but I still feel incredibly guilty and will beat myself up from time to time over the event for days at a time.

I have believed to this day that it is her responsibility to tell him.  And since she’s refused to tell him, he doesn’t know.

Nowadays, he’s moved on and has been dating someone else for about a year now.  Is it worth it to tell him now so much time later?  Is it my responsibility if she doesn’t want to tell him?  

I’ll admit, the main reason I want to tell him is because of the guilt I feel.  I’ve gotten it in my mind that telling him is the only way I can truly move on, but if I shouldn’t do that, then I’ll have to make peace with that.",11Jan2020,1
378,"I'm 16 and my brother is 21. There are four people in this apartment. My dad, my grandpa, my brother and I. 

My dad is a hardworking man. He always comes home late at night exhausted from all the work and takes up any opportunity to work and never takes days off (even if he does, he works from home). This is all for my school fees, my brother's college fees, his pocket money, and my grandpa's medicines.

but I found out last year that my brother is a smoker as his clothes always smell like smoke, smoke's smell in the bathroom after he's done using it and then one day I finally saw a packet of cigarettes in his backpack. I didn't confront him for a while then one day I asked him how much he smokes in one day, he said ""Oh, don't worry. I've got it under control. Some time ago, it got pretty bad but now it's under control. Only about 5-7 cigarettes a day."" and then he told me he's been smoking since the 9th grade.

I put on his jacket once as it was cold and it was the first jacket I saw that day and found a tiny packet of cigarettes with only one inside. It said ""150 rupees"" on the packet (I'm in India) and that's about 2.5 or so dollars in the USA. Now, it may not seem like much, but in India things are pretty cheap so something of this size and this price made me feel really disappointed in him.

Even though my dad works hard at his job, we're not exactly rich. And my brother takes advantage of the fact my dad *and* grandpa just cannot say no when he asks for money. He takes away 500 rupees daily and doesn't even thank them. Not an ounce of appreciation is shown.

He gets extremely irritated over the tiniest things and starts throwing tantrums whenever he can.

Dad knows that my brother smokes because he found a cigarette on the floor once but he hasn't said a single thing to my brother and he still gives him money without hesitation.

Dad is actually pretty annoyed by my brother coming home late every night, only going to sleep around 3 am, eating unhealthy food, and just taking away so much money every single day and even then, my dad doesn't scold him or show any bit of his anger towards my brother. 

My brother doesn't realize how much money he's burning away hanging out with his friends outside the entire day, skipping college, buying cigarettes and he probably drinks alcohol as well, I wouldn't be surprised to find out if he does that too.

He doesn't take me seriously at all. Every time I try to talk him about this, he shuts me down every single time saying the same bullshit again and again, ""I'm not in the mood for this shit just shut up""

Guys. Please help me out here. His hypocritical, childish attitude is really toxic and my dad can't say no to anything he asks for. Please tell me anything I can do to stop his smoking and have him use money wisely because we are nowhere near being rich.",11Jan2020,1

Unfortunately, my parents told her that I would allow her to use my room for a short time while she took care of business. That would have been ok with me if she had stuck to what she and I agreed to. We agreed that she couldn’t have animals in my room and that it would only be three weeks. Sadly, she immediately broke the rule about animals by keeping dogs in my room. I’ve explained to her multiple times that I have thousands of dollars invested in my furniture and decor that I want kept very nice (paid for with my own hard earned money). We’ve gone back and forth to the point of arguments. My parents have told me to back off because it is only a short time. That would be all fine and dandy but it has now been seven months since she moved into my room. She hasn’t moved into her own house that she has complete access to simply because she hasn’t decided to yet and sits around watching tv all day.

As a result, I have overall poor social skills and I want to fix that as I go into college. One example of this is that I have many close acquaintances, but it seems that my relationships are either superficial or become extremely close friendships wherein I talk about my problems and overload the person. I also have gotten feedback from friends that I have a lot of ""weird"" habits or interests and that can be kind of off-putting. I've been looking into stuff like social cognition or social skills classes and I found some healthy resources related to AAC individuals. The issue is that I feel these don't all necessarily pertain to me because many seem geared towards children or special needs individuals, neither of which I am.  I just want to be able to better understand how people make friends and do well in close relationships as well as what to do to avoid crossing the line from normalcy to being weird. I don't mean this post to be disparaging in any way, I was just wondering what resources I could use to become more of a normal person.",11Jan2020,1
381,"So I have this friend. I've known him for almost 5 years and I've never been able to work out how I feel about him. Even when going through relationships with other people, in the end once the inevitable breakup happens, it gets weird. We tried ""dating"" once about 8 months ago, but whatever it was only lasted three days cause I ended up needing to get mental help for depression etc. 

I'm better for now thankfully. I used to feel fine around him. We'd joke around and mess with each other, but it feels different. I genuinely don't know if its double sided or all in my head. What I really want to know is that if it is both of us and I figure out what it means and it turns out I have valid feelings, should I do something about it. I'm very worried that that kind of situation will ruin any connection we have as friends. I've already lost someone I deeply cared about like that, and also because I have too many issues, and once something evolves issues get harder to hide. I got somewhat better, but I'm worried I'll get triggered again and fall back down the rabbit hole.

384,"A few days ago I expressed to the psychologist that I felt as if I’m going to hurt someone. I couldn’t stop thinking violent thoughts and I wanted to get help for them so I told her. It took a lot of courage from me to ask for help and that’s part of the reason why I’m so upset. 

I was exposed to very violent content as a child and since then, I keep getting flashbacks to it or I get violent thoughts stuck in my head. I wish I could stop it and I’ve tried to stop by flicking a rubber band against my wrist every time a violent thought comes into my head. 

I told the psychologist that I definitely feel like I’m going to kill someone and I’m telling her so she can stop me. The psychologist told the doctor and he tweaked my meds. 

My named nurse is a nurse that is in charge of my care. He was told about all of this from the doctor and psychologist. After the situation had be explained to him, he told all staff that I, his patient, have been threatening staff. 

Threatening! As if I’ve been going around telling people I was going to hurt them for my enjoyment or to get my own way. There’s a difference between being a threat to someone’s safety and actively trying to threaten people. I was just talking about my mental state, not trying to intimidate anyone.

Education wise, im in my 1st year in electrical engineering. To start an engineering major here you have to go through two years of intense education (preparatory school) and pass a national exams and depending on your national rank you get enrolled in a university and choose the available major. Well yeah it all started in those 2 years, it was too much stress and pressure if it werent for my friends and boyfriend i dont know what id be doing right now. but still, i started noticing that my grades have been going downhill and i couldnt do anything about it. i didnt find time for my hobbies and interests and i even noticed that my english was getting worse (english is not my 1st language but i was proud to call myself fluent in english) my memory got worse and i wouldnt be able to remember what i learned that day and i have to review everything over and over again the night of the exam if not a few minutes before, and if i dont id get stressed and worry about forgetting important formulas and stuff. i ended up screwing up the national exam but im still glad i got to major in electrical engineering (it was my plan b)

now that im in my 1st year, im learning the basics of electrical engineering, stuff that ive already learned in high school so i should be able to remember the basics. the thing is... i dont.. and its stressing me out. i also cant do well when a professor asks me a question and im terrified of getting called to the board. a few days ago a professor asked me this basic question and i got so scared i made a mistake. obviously the professor got mad, my brain was telling me the right answer but i was so scared to say it out loud. i ended up saying it though yet the professor was still mad since i got it wrong and asked me what was wrong. i was already stressed because i already received a bad grade that day and i just started overthinking and panicking about my future and just had a full on panic attack right there and had to excuse myself to the corridor and catch my breath.

I'm 21 years old, i'll be having my engineering degree in 3 years so i shouldnt be doing this, i feel like im running out of time. i feel like i should just learn all the basics again, yet everyone is just telling me to enjoy my time and to have fun in clubs and enjoy my hobbies yet i cant get over the fear that i was not made for this major. i love electrical engineering and ive been a good student almost my whole life so why is this happening to me a few years before i start my career. i have not even started my career and i already feel like im going to be a failure of an engineer. i just feel completely lost and i really dont know what to do. i wanted to explain this to my friends yet i didnt know how. my brain is just a mess at this point. i feel lost and i really dont know what to do. im just stressed all the time and i keep worrying about my future constantly and it has affected my self esteem and confidence. please help me.",11Jan2020,1

I am not able to make myself feel better about being alone anymore. I used to try to find meaning in things outside of a relationship but after trying for so long it I understand that it just won’t work. I don’t care about sex or things like that, I just want to have a romantic partner that is my best friend. I’m so sick of being alone and miserable, meanwhile all of my friends are in serious relationships.

I’m in my junior year of college and it just seems like it’s never going to get better. All of my friends are going to be graduating in the next year and I will probably rarely see them beyond then and I will be alone. It makes me suicidal but nothing I’ve done has changed anything about my situation. I thought that if I lost weight maybe somebody would give me a chance but over 80 pounds later I have realized what a lost cause it is. It is so defeating to look myself in the mirror and think about all the work I’ve put in for nothing. When I look at the scale it makes me feel like an idiot, like somehow I really convinced myself I could change anything.

I struggle motivating myself to do anything because it all seems so pointless. It’s hard for me to even think about long term stuff because I don’t think I’m going to drag it out that far. I used to think that maybe I’d give myself until I turned 30 but it just snowballs and gets harder and harder to deal with and now I don’t know how much I can take anymore.I just don’t want to be alive if I’m going to have to endure it all alone. I don’t know how to cope with this stuff anymore, I feel so utterly broken and nobody gives a fuck about me.",11Jan2020,1

We broke up to mature. I had issues expressing myself in a way that made my partner feel he could be emotionally open with me and my partner in turn never expressed his feelings with me anymore and couldn’t be emotionally vulnerable. I realized it was my fear of

396,"So this is my first time posting something of this sort. And, to give a short backstory, I was home schooled from the 4th grade till I turned 18 and first started college. As such, I did not experience middle or high-school. I also never hung around anyone else other than my older brother and adults. I have no issues with social interaction now of course.

Now to start on this situation/experience I am experiencing, last semester in college I met a girl who I have become very very close with. We talk pretty much everyday, and call each other a lot at night to generally talk. Around last November when our final project was assigned, we finally got the opportunity to work together. Film Production class. 

Around November 19th, as we were finishing up our project, I was driving to her house to shoot the final scene. Never before have I been in a relationship, so I figured ""Hey, I like her she likes me, let me ask her out!"" I call her on the way and talk to her for a bit before asking her out. Now to add the part where I am gullible. Very much so in fact. I am extremely nice to everyone, and it's definitely a ""weakness"" sometimes. What provoked me to ask her out was the day before when she called me, we talked on the phone for 7 hours. Eventually the conversation led to fetish talk and whatnot. She explained hers, and I explained mine. Typical stuff, or so I thought/think? Also, she brought up this topic.

Anyways, she tells me she's in a relationship with a guy who inst the best but it works for now. I respect her honesty and continue to drive over to her place. After I was done and was driving home, my mind was in disarray. ""Why would a woman in a relationship tell me (her single friend) about her fetishes?"" Maybe for comfort? This was my first thought. Her bf maybe is not supporting her notions. No clue. So from that point on I've retracted myself. I've been a great friend to her, in her corner if something is wrong but still let her know my honesty on whatever she is going through. She respects that I give my opinion if she is in the wrong sometimes.

As an added information buffer, I've been over to her place non project wise about 3 times and have spent countless hours painting, talking, watching movies and such. Met her parents, played some card games, etc. So me visiting is nothing new.

Fast forward to January 8th, and she calls me at around 9pm EST and we talk till about 2 AM. She was also tipsy this day. Drinking at home, if that is needed to clarify anything. Well, around hour 4 on the phone she says to me, ""I hope this does not offend you or come off weird, but I've been thinking and with your beautiful hair and complexion, and my thin beautiful hair and complexion, we would have the most beautiful daughter! And I was thinking of naming her King. I feel it's an empowering name. What do you think?"" Im fxing APPALLED by this question, but nevertheless go with it. So in this instance yet again, she brings this topic up. Not me.

Recently she has been in Arizona and is coming back today. And on that interesting phone conversation, she says, ""When I get back you should definitely come over! We can go to the store, get some wine cook some food, watch movies and get drunk and talk to each other. No actually, you're coming over, it's not up for debate! haha"" 

I also need to add that her and her boyfriend have been going through a rough patch even before I was in her life. At my current stance, I am her closest friend. I want to remain as such as she's a dear friend to me as well. I enjoy her being in my life as my friend. And vice versa. But I am also highly confused. I have never been in a situation like this, and on plenty occasions she has mentioned that they are not going to be together for much longer. I didn't pry into her current family situation as when we talked that same night on the 8th, she started crying as to whatever bad is going on right now. I've been supportive to her, not for any ulterior motive other than being her friend. But again, I am not use to these situations and I have no clue what to do.

On the one hand, she is miserable with her current Bf. And by no means will anything happen between us if she is still in the relationship with him. This is where I stand right now, if I go over to her place should I bring up this conversation about us again, because I do feel she would be happier with not being in that toxic relationship. But at the same time, I am not the type of person to ""break up"" a relationship. But I feel that if I don't say something it may be a passed opportunity. I have no intent on doing anything sexual when I go over there. I simply want to be in her company.

I know this is long, but the detail is needed. To get a clear picture of my current situation. Any advice is helpful. In the past, I have let opportunities pass me by, by not saying anything at all. A closed mouth never gets fed. My family says ask her if she see's anything between us, I think I should ask her, what do you all think? If anyone comments that is!

Comments or not, I'll think of something before I spend the night over her place.",11Jan2020,1

/TW SELF HARM/

This is such a circumstantial story that I feel like I need some objective opinions from you my good redditors. 

My boyfriend and I moved in with our roommate when we graduated from college this past spring. My bf and I had been living alone but needed a different place and couldn’t afford to live by ourselves at the time. We chose my friend, who at that point seemed to be a great choice! She got along well with my bf, wed never had any friendship issues, and we all needed a place to live. 

We’ve lived together for about 6 months now, and I have hated almost every second of it. Overall, my bf and I feel as though she is extremely inconsiderate. She does not help clean the common spaces pretty much ever. We have to repeatedly ask her to help out with mutual chores. Her own room and bathroom are kept so disorderly that we have to have our guests use our bathroom (her bathroom isn’t inside her room, so we all agreed that it was the guest bathroom, but it is too dirty to be used). She will not pay us on time for bills that we front. I pay the water and electric, and she will wait a month to pay me after I ask her repeatedly for the money. All in all, she is not a good roommate, and we don’t feel like our expectations are that high in the first place. 

Additionally, and more importantly, I’ve struggled with my mental health for my much of my life, and I did know that she had dealt with similar issues. Shortly after moving in together, she (seemingly purposefully) revealed fresh self harm injuries to me. This is hugely triggering for me and was extremely upsetting. Ever since then, I have had unrelenting anxiety every time I see her. I can’t look at her without thinking about it. I wrote her a letter informing her that it was something I can not handle, and asking her to get help from a therapist. She did not respond to the letter. While I haven’t seen any additional instances of this, I think about it all the time. I have also spoken to her about 5 times about getting help (she is seemingly depressed in general), and I’ve even called her mom to let her know she’s refusing help. She has never gotten help that I’m aware of. 
I’ve been trying to find my own therapist to secure myself a bit more, but I can’t start seeing them for about two weeks. I wouldn’t have chosen to live with her if I had known this was something she had dealt with in the past. I know this is a huge trigger for me and I wouldn’t have decided to put myself in this situation if I had been aware. 
Between the household typical roommate stuff and that, living with her has become an extreme source of stress for me. I hate living with her and I am angry about the way we live. 

My bf recently spoke to our leasing office because it had seemed like she wasn’t going to pay her monthly portion of the rent. (She did end up paying). Basically, if she chose to take her name off of the lease, my bf and I could transfer it, without breaking it and receiving penalties, to a one bedroom that we could afford in our complex. Or if she didn’t want to leave the apartment, he and I could take our names off and find a different place to live. The issue with this is that everything is ours. The plates, forks, pots, pans, couch, kitchen table, EVERYTHING in the common areas is ours. Additionally, she would be stuck paying the $1470 that we all collectively pay unless she found a roommate. She definitely can’t afford that. There are still about 7 months left of our lease. 

Would it be horrible for me to sit her down and explain that this is unhealthy for me in multiple ways, and giving her the choice to leave or have us leave? In both instances she is kind of being screwed over. But I am struggling to live under constant stress and anxiety. I need to live somewhere without her for my own sanity. I’ve been so concerned with hurting her feelings that I haven’t been considering my own, and I feel like it’s time.",11Jan2020,1
398,"Hello I have a friend who came down with back pain so severe that she can barely stand and she's hurting really bad. This was about 24 hours ago when she went for a walk and when she came back suddenly her back started to hurt. But this is not the first time she has this kind of pain, and when she went to the doctor the first time she was told to take pain pills and she'd be okay.

I'm learning to be a psychologist, and he's shown symptoms of a mental disorder: Depersonalization Disorder (I won't diagnose him, don't worry) but he feels too guilty to reach out to his family and/or friends to seek the proper help he needs.

404,"New here, so please forgive some errors.. (second language English)

My roommate and I are both coworkers, I knew her for months before deciding to be roommates together. Everything was great, until she got a cat.

First, I allowed her to adopt a cat when she asked me. As long as she's responsible for everything, I really didn't care. Besides, I think it'd be nice to have a pet to come home to everyday. I thought it would be just a regular cat, low maintenance and clean, but turned out she decided to adopt a SPHYNX cat.

I have nothing against the furless cat, all I knew was the cat needed more maintenance compared to normal cat. Okay, as long as my roommate was fully responsible for it.. (Turned she had a lot to learn about sphynx cat and only did research AFTER she got the cat).

Not even a month, our place smelled like cat poop. (Sphynx owners should understand what I mean, sphynx cat's poop smells the worse). The cat would always bring litter sand and poop throughout the entire house after pooping. I could literally see litter sand everywhere on our dark floor. My roommate would dump its poop bag into our kitchen garbage bin and leave it for days (until I threw it out), that the whole house smelled unbearable. We even had 4-5 flies flying into our place through the vents every single day, and I had to kill them because cat didn't know how to.

Not only that, the cat turned out to be extremely high maintenance. My roommate often left for vacation or business for days to weeks, leaving the cat behind for me to look after. She even wrote a handbook on how to take care of the cat with some crazy rules. Some of them are:

1. Cat liked to be accompanied while eating or else he wouldn't touch the food much
2. Food bowl had to be cleaned or else the cat wouldn't eat the food from it.
3. Cat's body needed to get cleaned with baby wipes/hot towel daily, and a bath once a week.
4. Need to run heater so the room was always warm (we live in SF, summer can be about 50- 60°F  here)
5. etc etc etc

She even demanded me to come home early from work to feed the cat, because she's worried it would get sick for being too hungry.. (I left some dry food in his bowl which, of course, he barely touched because no one accompanied him). At the time, she was on vacation.

And the worst of all, the cat NEEDED company so much it wouldn't leave you alone at all. It would wail for straight 30-90 minutes, demanding attention. Sphynx cats are known to be very social and will get depressed when left alone. So whenever my roommate was away, the cat was always miserable because no one's at home, and I was always miserable because the cat wouldn't stop crying to me outside my bedroom, midnight.

Now I know, it's not the cat's fault for being born this way, so I always make sure the cat's still healthy even though I don't enjoy its presence. But I shouldn't be responsible for the cat's well being.

I brought up the issues to my roommate multiple times but she wouldn't listen. She even accused that I hated the cat (true) and my nagging only gave her more stress. So I told her I would stop nagging if she stopped the house smelling like poop, and find a cat hotel if she were to go away for days again. She agreed, but the house would still smell like poop regularly.

So recently, she's going away for 2 months. Before she left, I asked her about the cat. She told me she'd leave the cat with her friend, who's a ""cat person"". Knowing her, I asked if she paid her friend. She chuckled and said no. I knew something bad was going to happen, but I decided not to meddle with her business and I didn't know about her friend much either.

Fast forward 5 days later, her friend reached out to me, pleading me to take the cat back. Aside for being a dirty cat, constantly bringing poop and litter sad everywhere it went, apparently it was destroying her couch, ruining clothes, and breaking glasses. She also got fever because the cat wouldn't leave her alone to rest.

For having to live in a quiet and clean place with no cat poop smell, I refused to give up my happy time and take the cat back. So we decided to look for cat hotels, with my roommate's agreement. At the end, I was the only one looking for the hotels and even paid for it with my own money.

Our joint lease is up in 9 months, but I honestly can't live like this anymore. The house is filthy (poop and footprints on walls), I'm sure the landlord will be unhappy. I don't want to be held accountable when it wasn't me who dirtied the house. But I'm also afraid of the consequences of breaking the lease, and I don't even have a heart to let someone I know taking over my lease and living with the monster. What should I do so I could escape this safely?

If given the opportunity, should I return to my previous job? I took a decent pay cut when I left my last job but it was 30% commission and my current job is hourly. I did not mind picking up OT at my last job and I enjoyed it majority of the time. Should I try and return to my previous job and work through the anxiety/panic I experience or continue with my current place of employment? 😭",11Jan2020,1
410,"I am literally crying and shaking right now. I was in bed with my wife (18f) and we had been having bum sex the night before. Through the night I dreamt that my wife was sucking my boner which is strange as she hadn't done that since I took her breakfast off her a few months ago. But I was enjoying this, and then I woke up and I really was getting my penis suckled. But it wasnt my wife, it was a silly fucking clown! I started to urinate and he recoiled and got pee all over my toes. I tried to chase this bloody clown down the street with my penis erect but he got away.

I don't know what to do, my wife laughed at me so I think she put the mailman up to this as revenge for biting his penis when I thought he was having bum sex with my wife. I've smacked her boobs and locked her in the toilet but I don't know what to do about this little circus act.

I am still erect, I tried to call the police but they told me to fuck off and play with my penis. What can I do about being clown cock gobbled? This is ridiculous",11Jan2020,1

418,"For some background: I’m 22 and so is my husband, we just got married in November - we have a 4 year old daughter (I got pregnant at 17). We’ve been living with my Dad since August 2017, before that my Dad was living with my Grandma to save $ to rent a place as he had switched jobs, and we were living with another family member. We all moved into this place together at the same time, and from month one we have been paying my dad $550 every month. When I was about 14-15 there was a time where my Dad and I lived out of extended motels as he was really struggling with his previous job, so I get very nervous about this happening to him again. 

Originally my Dad wanted us to be on our feet and moved out to an apartment within a year (August 2018), but eventually we all decided on August 2019 - then we told him we wanted to buy a house so he offered us to stay until November 2020, we assured him that since we got married November 2019, we would most likely be out before then to start our adult lives together alone. He even agreed he had no issue with us staying as we helped him with rent. 

January 2018 my husband got a really great job and is now making a significant amount more than he did prior, I’m finishing up my college program. 2018 we spent most of our money on an over the top wedding and honeymoon, so I don’t think he expected us to be out so soon. Our wedding was early November 2019, and we’ve been in the talks with a builder since October 2019. We just signed contracts and put our deposit down and our house is almost done being built, therefore we will be closing the end of February.

When I told my Dad the news, we were ecstatic obviously as we are 22 and our goal has always been to be homeowners and have a place for our daughter to grow up in. My Dad didn’t seem that happy if I’m being honest, he did say he was proud. In the few days since then, he has been in one of his “moods” where he gets angry and annoyed a lot. He even admitted to me today that he is going to have to “figure things out” when we move and heavily hinted it will be putting him in a bad financial position. He then said something along the lines of “this is great for you guys, bad for me.”

I’ve been worrying about this for months, but now that it’s all happening so quickly I feel immense guilt over it all. I worry about him losing his rental (he signed a 5 year lease 6 months ago). I worry about him being lonely. I worry about him being alone and depressed (he has a history of severe depression). How do I stop feeling so guilty and horrible and worried over moving out?",11Jan2020,1

428,"My friend (19F) went overseas a year ago and during that time she's met a guy (23?M) who has not been the greatest to her. They've broken up and gotten back together a few times, all times because he's said something horrible to her, the most recent time was because he was talking to other girls on tinder and offering threesomes even though my friend has told him she's not comfortable with it. He takes advantage of her insecurities and because she has low self esteem she just bends to his words. He talks about how she's kind of ugly and so many other girls are prettier than her and she agrees with him so doesn't see anything wrong with it. She told me that all of the rational parts of her brain tell her to leave him but she still doesn't want to. She's told me that even though most of being with him is shit, the few good times make it worth it, that the relationship is toxic but 'it's about working through it together'. She says she understands his flaws because of his rough childhood and he can't help it. He's the only person she sees or talks to everyday and it would be so easy for him to convince her of the things he says and to make her feel like if she ever left him she would be alone.

I really don't know what to do, I'm too far away and too broke to see her. All I can do is rely on messaging but I could see him convincing her that I'm bad and am just trying to pit her against him so she stops talking to me. She's had issues with drinking and she's been sober for a few months because of him (the only good he's done) but has started smoking weed and even codeine once. I can see this being such a slippery slope for her and I'm so scared, every moment that passes is a moment that irreversible damage could be done to her or she does to herself. I want to message her to leave him, but I've told her that before and she's agreed with me but that was it, my words are useless.

I don't have anyone else to talk to about this because she only has a few friends and I'm not friends with her other friends so I don't feel like I can talk to them about this especially if they know nothing of what's happened. I just really need some advice or something. The similarities between her relationship and an abusive relationship are hard to spot because all I get is her messages but I can see that some of them are there, they're small and I feel like it's just the start of abusive but I don't want them to get bigger.",11Jan2020,1
430,"Even in writing posts, I still catch myself having that urge to lie. 

But I'll really try to keep this 100% honest.

I started having this tendency when I was around elementary. At first, I was conscious of it but as time passed I started to lie more and more until there's never a day where I lie. I lie about my lifestyle, my religion, my personal affairs, almost everything (i think.) 

I am at highschool and due to this really destructive habit of mine, I've ruined countless relationships. I've noticed that my lies are getting bigger and a lot more complicated. I catch myself trying to be consistent with my lies.

My mother recently has noticed too, she told my dad that I lie even at the smallest things. Which is true.

I'm really concerned. Is this some sort of mental health issue in which I should get a therapist or should I just try to deal with this myself?

I really want to better myself as early as now since if I keep this up I might possibly just ruin my life.

TLDR; I lie too much to the point where I do it everyday, should I get a therapist or should I fix this myself",11Jan2020,1
431,"We’ve been together for 5 years and I can’t imagine myself with anyone else. I get annoyed at him sometimes because he doesn’t understand the necessity of alarms, especially if he tends to oversleep. So before we say goodnight over a phone call, I always tell him to make sure he sets an alarm for the next morning since we have a date early. He swears he does, but never seems to wake up because the “alarm doesn’t work.” Now, he’s a pretty simple guy and he doesn’t play games so it’s not like he does this on purpose. Two days ago, he was raving about taking me out to breakfast in the morning and me knowing him, I asked him “are you sure you wanna go out so early? You’re probably really sleepy at that time.” He really wanted to go, so we planned to go yesterday at 8am. I asked him to set an alarm and we went to sleep. Yesterday morning, I woke up extra early to get ready and I waited... called and waited... and waited... no response. At this point, I had genuine concern so I had to call his brother to ask if my boyfriend was okay, and he was like “yeah he’s asleep why?” To which then I explained what happened. He immediately woke him up and made him talk to me despite his embarrassment of oversleeping. I told him to never make me wake up this early again and get ready, it’s disrespectful of my time, and etc. He became angry and “FINE, whatever. I’ll fucking get there soon.” And hangs up. At this point, I’m fuming. I know him and I know how much he hates mornings. I can’t help but cry at the thought of him doing this to me again because I feel like an idiot for even believing him in the first place. He eventually arrived all angry and I asked him to take me home and he refused. I don’t know what to do anymore, it passed, but I’m still so angry. I can’t trust him with dates and it makes me feel so insecure. I love him, but he makes me so upset when this happens.

She is also about twice my age but I am somewhat young. I have seen her husband belittle, insult and demean her on multiple occasions. She is too soft-spoken to say anything back (this does NOT mean she is weak or ""cowardly""). The thing is that he also acts like the nice guy too, so he's not absolutely unbearable to be around. But not great, either... 

She is a very sweet, kind and intelligent woman and she definitely does not deserve that kind of treatment (nobody does). I know she does not like her marriage and wants out. I think she is waiting for her son to graduate before she leaves, and I know for certain she feels trapped and helpless. I'm pretty sure she's keeping the ring on her finger for now for the sake of her children. I think she feels scared to just go for a multitude of reasons. She doesn't have many people to talk to about it since she keeps herself occupied, and so I was thinking about contacting her through Facebook to let her know.

My question is, should I let her know that people actually do care about her? That I'm here if she wants to vent or just talk? It would be somewhat out of the blue but I believe it would definitely help her out in a lot of ways. I just hope it wouldn't be inappropriate, but I almost don't even care since she is so sad.

441,"Sorry if this is a bit poorly explained and confusing, I'm just emotional and angry, I feel rather stupid for even posting to ask for advice but it's really starting to bother me. This has been going on since 1st year but is starting to be a bit unbearable. 

And from the start of Yr 2 it got worse especially with a massive project at the start of the year, I worked my ass off and a lot of people came to me for help with things that shouldn't have been my role but they couldn't do, I never said no and helped with anything that was asked because it had to be done in a time limit. And at the end of that project where I'd done so much it just didn't feel like anyone bothered to recognise or thank me for helping so many people. I know it sounds petty but it really hurts to work like crazy and just feel not valued as part of a team yet again. I know part of it comes down to my own lack of self worth and insecurities.

There was a system that hadn't been touched in 3 years, person 1 tried to get it working again but made next to no progress, they couldn't find anything at all with the system until I'd mentioned curiosity in the kit and offered to help if he wanted it. He accepted and we worked in getting it working. I did like 80% of the work on this easily. Yet no one recognises my contribution to it, I've heard multiple people only praise him for it, and it kills me to hear it.

With person 2, I brought him on to different jobs with people I'd spent time building a working relationship with and they stopped offering me work to go with him instead and I don't see why. We both produce the same quality work and have very similar attitudes but people who I've known for so much longer just seem to favor him over me. But we produce the same quality work, the biggest difference is theyre men and I'm a woman, the industry we work in tends to be male oriented but I can't see that as being the only reason. I just feel stuck in person 2's shadow by the people around us. So many things person 2 couldn't have done without my help but people only ever praise him for them, and I'm just feeling so run down and inadequate in every way.

Recently another big project got announced and person 2 and I both went for the same role. He got the role which was lead and I didn't, I didn't even get a role that would allow me to develop or learn new skills. I got the same as last time where I spent 6 weeks cleaning up and babysitting other people, it's like I'm expected to stagnate myself and my skills just so other people can learn and have me teach them.

But I don't feel that's fair at all. Every single other person got something to develop their skills apart from me. And considering how undervalued I was left feeling last time I don't think it's fair to put that strain on myself emotionally again.

So I want to talk to the tutor and drop out of the project and just see what happens but I'm not sure if the tutor will think less of me for this.

 Person 2 and I are close which makes this all rather hard, I don't want to screw him over but I'm so angry at him, because he's not better than me but everyone acts like he is, it just feels like I'm being thrown in his shadow and he's benefiting from my work. I don't want to be around him it hurts me so much.

The petty part is I'm scared if I drop out I'll be proved that I'm not needed and I don't make a difference on the team by someone else taking my role and doing it just as well if not better. I don't know how I'll deal with it being proved as a fact that I just don't matter. 

I don't know what to do.",11Jan2020,1

When I travel home for the holidays I always make note to stay with his family even if he isn’t there and same to him. Also he is bisexual which is no issue with me cause I really do not care. We get along great usually with some daily arguments here but they never last more than 10 minutes. 

Anyways so he has a weird dating life where he mostly just leads guys on from his phone and almost never actually goes nowhere purely cause he doesn’t want it to and he gets his entertainment off the “sexting” and such I guess. Now there has been 3 occasions when he actually did go somewhere and invited them over. I do not have an issue with him having people over but how it occurs is what bother me.

It has gotten worse, obviously, to the point where she tries to force me to take money off her, sometimes multiple times a visit. I visit her, on average, once or twice every two weeks and every single time she offers money to me. It is her pension money. 

She lives by herself and has nothing to do all day, my mam, uncles and I do our best to take care of her, but she just watches TV all day (forgetting anything that happened more than 5mins ago), if she can be luck y enough to remember how to turn on the TV.

I'm 20, a college student and unemployed, so I have little in the way of money. I, of course, initially refuse the money, but if I do, she tends to launch out of her chair and attempt to stuff the cash into my jeans or jacket pockets. She forgets all of this, of course, and offers me more.

I never bring up money, it seems she remembers that she used to give me money and does it herself. I limit the amount of money I take from her to €50 each visit (only if she offers at all).

I justify taking it by saying that 'I have no money, she will get upset if I decline and what is she going to spend it on anyway?' Though I still feel terrible for taking it. I know that if I REALLY wanted to, I could say that ""No, no, you already gave me money earlier Nan"" or slip it back into her purse when she isn't looking.

454,"Hey I am an 18 year old guy and I suck.

I suck at school. I only get E's which here in Sweden is bad because it is only ""passing"", behind E comes F which is when you fail so I only pass school and suck at doing the work.

I am the introverted ""nice"" guy.. When people look at those people they think that they are smart and all that.
So people usually have two types. The social dumb but funny and dorky guy or the smart keep to themselves self kind of guy.
I am neither.
Or yes I am dumb. I am though not social - only with my close friends but other then that I keep to myself.
You would think that I would at least be smart being this introvert I am but I am not because I suck at school as I said.

I love playing games like overwatch but I am just avarage at that game except the support role.

My personality is so weird (with that I mean I don't have a clear personality. I just suck at everything even though I might seem like I should be smart which I am not at all) and no one will love me. I don't think I am very attractive as well but my friends and family say different but they are again.. Friends and family and can't say I am ugly..

Someone did have a crush on me ones but I think they stopped when they knew I sucked at school.. They got attracted to me because they thought I was that type of quiet but smart guy.

But I am not!! I suck!! I am nothing!! I will do nothing good in this world I fucking hate myself!!
I am not good at ANYTHING!!

I don't even know how to socialize because that is how stupid I am 

And for the record I am gay which some people would be an even more of an dissapointment but who the fuck cares even anymore

I should have never been born.",11Jan2020,1
455,"What I’ve noticed gradually throughout months is that my best friend he would often change his name on discord to things like: “toxic unwanted trash”, “fucking kms lmao”,”everyone’s better without me”, “useless” and so forth. Everytime I notice, it breaks my heart. But, from experience, whenever I ask him if he’s ok he will usually respond by saying this: “stop worrying about me because there is nothing to worry about” “yes I’m ok”. One day, I tried talking to him to make him feel happier since there was so much drama between us and our friend group so I said this: “it’s 2020 let’s all change and get rid of stress and drama in our lives” and he messaged me back saying: “ look, I get it I’m a piece of shit and I’m not even diagnosed with depression and you probably get mad that I’m depressed and not happy but I try to help everyone be happy and not like me” I feel like he seeks attention with all his usernames which for me aid in signs of help. But, he doesn’t want to seek help. He always says things like “even if I’m depressed myself I’ll try to help everyone I can. Notice this he says “I don’t want anyone to become like me”.. he always mentions that... (what’s that mean? Guilt trip? He even broke up with his boyfriend Bc his friend and we feeling left out and he said “ion want anyone feeling left out Bc it’s a shitty feeling”)
the issue is, if he won’t let me in who will he let in. He’s gotta stop pretending that he’s ok. He doesn’t deserve a life full of sadness and I need to know the cause of it. He once even mentioned “I wish my parents were divorced so I could be upset”.. I’m pretty sure his home life is good and school is good for him.. besides getting his computer taken away..
If he won’t open up.. I cannot live with his grief. I need to find a way to help him even if it requires anything I’ll do it. Do any of y’all have tips for what I should message him? I have to get to the bottom of this once and for all.
Pleas post your answers. I really need a guide over here. Thank you!",11Jan2020,1
456,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since September 2018. I already know that he's the one for me. We've discussed out future, finances, kids, have similar goals and aspirations, and he says he knows I'm the one for him as well. However, we live 6 hours apart and we only see each other about 10-11 times per year. We spend the month of December entirely with each other (24/7) because our work slows down. 

I recently finished school in May 2019. I landed what appeared to be a decent job in my field at a growing company. Even though it's 6 hours away from my boyfriend I decided I should take the job and start my career.

However, 6-7 months later, I'm finding there are issues with the company. Small ethical, easy-to-turn-a-blind-eye problems I'm not comfortable with (but I could be involved in), lack of adequate mentoring/training, disrespect to employees (ie. When they fired someone, the company sent a company wide email telling us they are no longer with the company, while the fired employee was still in the building), no appreciation (ie. No Merry Christmas/Happy New Year's from any of the owners or managers. I reached out to one and he just told me when to come back to work). All of this has made me extremely anxious, depressed and unconfident since I started in May and questioning whether or not I entered the right career path. Coupled with the new city where I knew one person, I didn't have any desire to go out. I wanted to be at home where I felt comfortable and not anxious, but this also made me very lonely.

Fast forward to my decision now. Being with my boyfriend makes me signjficantly happier. I feel enlightened and alive. Due to my field of work, there aren't many job postings for my line of work where he lives, and even if I do apply for them I really question if I would enjoy it now I know what really needs to be done (I understand the company probably didn't support me enough). I am definitely open to applying and accepting jobs outside of my initial career path. 

The only thing stopping me is I would be moving to that city (my hometown) because of him. I made a decision in the past based on a previous ex and I regretted it. I'm afraid that if I choose to quit my job, move there, look for work, I would regret it in the future. I imagine living with him, cooking meals and shopping together, visiting friends, getting back into old hobbies and it makes me feel excited. He said he wants me to move in with him and would help support me (financially) while I look for work. Is it okay to move there mostly because of him?",11Jan2020,1
457,"Hi 18 ( F ) here, living in my mothers home as natural, and in my first year of college ( my course has 2 years ), and I have this burning desire to move out...


I will not specifically say why, but I just feel deeply uncontrollable in my house when there is people around and in this country in general, I feel that to grow I need to get out of this ambient and move on with my life... also I feel like a burden to my mother financially wise.


As you can guess I’m pretty young to know: what will I really do with my life, how to do it, moving out implications etc...


But for now I have a goal and a plan which both resonate a lot with me, the goal is to lend a career in fashion forecasting ( or close to it ), and have a second stream of income; the other part of the goal is to move out of the house AND the country... the plan focuses on having good grades, studying subjects extra curricular and starting my second stream on income ( which is pretty unreliable) with a part time job at night.


NOW, I have this great opportunity with my course to internship to wherever I want to and make it count as my “ internship grade”, I made good friends with this girl ( 24 ) that is a model and has contacts in LA and we were just over the moon that we both wanted to go there because it is where the HQ of our dreams live... I felt more close than ever to achieve greater things, but we are in a financial hole, and the trip costs around 6,000$ for 5 moths, if not more.


I bounded myself to work part time at night and study which in my calculations lands me around 3,000 until I have to go which is half of the trip, and in my other stream of income Is unreliable I cant put a more or less to it, but I believe if I work hard enough I can lend at least 1,000... now 2,000 are still remaining which I could ask for bank to lend me money ( and puts me into a tricky situation, and my mother is in one already ).


Help me see, Im so naive about this, is the trip THAT worth? Would I be able to lend a job in a corporation, or even if I ask to be transferred to another location ( was thinking Melbourne Australia ) because LA is so expensive... or get any type of contacts, ANY worthy payback from this internship at all...?


The working hard part isn’t a problem, I just need a reality check, and truthful advice.


1 What can I do to move out of the house and country simultaneously?


2 Will Networking work or getting a job outside of the country?


3 Is this trip worth? Will I have a payback for the cost?


Because 4,000 could possibly enable me to travel to the city I want to move and have several interviews in a spend of a week... would this smarter?

460,"Hello everybody,

I'm reaching out for advice on how to claim a business that my wife is starting whether it be an LLC or Sole Proprietorship. To put it simply, she is an artist that will take one-off commissions for traditional art pieces as well as digital for individuals as well as businesses. 

**A little more detailed description**: She does portraits of people and pets in various mediums such as pen on paper or acrylic on canvas. She provides services for wedding invitations that require interaction with third parties for printing. She is getting into art licensing by making patterns intended for fabrics, stationaries, and the like, which she anticipates will require an art licensing agent. She does murals for local businesses as well as signage, website management, and logo design. She has illustrated children's books and is beginning to do portraits for people's D&amp;D characters.

**Additional details:** We are based in Michigan and curious about the path ahead of us for the best option (LLC or Sole Proprietorship). She has done some research on the name she is considering and has only found one near match in a company named based in North Carolina that is a dance studio, as well as three other companies that similar in name but not from Michigan. We want to get a website and domain while working in parallel with making the business official (LLC or SP). Also, we're curious if a business bank account should come before making the business official, or shortly after. 

Because we're worried that business name similarity might be a problem, here's the examples of the businesses that names are questionable (names altered to preserve our planning):

My Wife's Business: *Hil Jump Co*

North Carolina Dance Studio: *Hill Jump Co*

New Orleans Based Stationery Company: *Hill Jump Ink* (Copyright 2018 Hill Jump Ink)

Australian Based Branding Company: *Hill Jump* 

Florida Based Interior Design Company: *Hill Jump Design*

The question on the name is whether we'll hit a roadblock when trying to incorporate because of the name similarity and, in some cases, product similarity. She chose her name because, for this example, our daughter's name is Hillary, and we call her ""Hil"" and my wife's name is Judith Ursula Michaels (which is a god awful name, but works for my example) making her initials ""JUM"", hence *Hil JUMp co.* 

I feel this is quite detailed, but please let me know if there's anything crucial I may be missing. 

Any advice is appreciated!",11Jan2020,1

470,"So, I need some advice, and I feel like if I ask my friends they won't be completely honest with me. 

Backstory.
I live in Denmark, and my BF lives in Australia. We grew up together, and have been friends for nearly 25 years now. 
2 months ago she told me that she was gonna visit, but I couldn't tell anyone since she wanted to surprise her family, but she asked me to try and see if I could get time off work to see her and her baby. 

Flashforward to now, she is visiting from Australia, but she has so many people to see, who now knows she is here, and she can barely find time to see me. (This happens every time she visits, and I get super frustrated each time, because she gets so busy, and I have to spend a lot of time trying to find out when she has time to see me, which stresses me out a lot) When I contact her, she doesn't reply for at least a day, and it seems like she doesn't have time to see me for more than 4 hrs-ish. 

She doesn't think about the fact that if I take time to go see her for 4 hours it ends up being about 1 1/2 hours of time for me to get to her, and then get home afterwards. So to me it's a lot of effort for a short amount of time.

When she visits I always request a full day with her, since we see each other so rarely (~less than 1 time a year). As of right now I haven't responded to her last text, because she told me that she can't prioritize more time for me, which really hurt. I feel so unimportant to her, and now I really don't even want to see her. 

So what I need advice on is this - should I get over myself and just take the 4 hrs I can get? Knowing full well that this will not be enough, and it would lead me to feeling even more sad since we never have enough time together. 

Or am I in the right, and therefore should stand up for myself since she doesn't seem to value my company enough to prioritize seeing me? 

It really affects me, since I know this will probably repeat next year when she returns, and I will be frustrated all over again if I don't stand up for myself, to try and get her to see things from my perspective.",11Jan2020,1

473,"This is going to sound ridiculous, and it sorta is, but anyway.

I got a switch and zelda breath of the wild for Christmas and as an early birthday gift. 
I love video games and have played since I was like 7 (28 now, soon 29). 
The problem is that I am terrified of playing Zelda. Any other game (except horror, I dont do horror) is fine and I can play.

But with Zelda, i just cant. I get so stressed and I'm so scared to play it. I've always been like this. I think it was the zombies in ocarina of time that scared me so much.

Thing is that this is getting so extremely frustrating. Because I WANT to play and progress. But for several days now I've just been wandering around in the same area where there's no enemies and just collected butterflies and other critters. 

When I was a kid and played, it was always mom who played Zelda and I watched. Other games I played though. 

Yesterday I went to mom's place, brought the switch and sat there to try and play. And even though she was there and could take the controller and take over, I barely dared to progress. I tried, but some enemies came, one rather strong one, which stressed me. I was fighting the strong one, but there was another one there that I didnt see that shot me and I died. Then I didnt dare to try again.
My heart started racing when the enemies came out of nowhere.
I then realized also that I could just sneak to the entrance of the cave they were in and shoot an arrow in there because there were some dynamite barrels there. So even though I know what to do, I just can't. 

I'm still just on the great plateau, I have done 3 shrines. 

But I am so frustrated and angry with myself, and sad. I want to play but I just cant bring myself to progress. 

And it feels like it seems like I'm ungrateful, which I'm REALLY not. I am super happy, it was an insanely nice and amazing gift. So dont get me wrong on that. 

I've been trying to force myself to move forward, but it doesnt work either.

 It's getting so frustrating that I just wanna cry. Because I really really want to play, I just cant. 
Like I said, I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's still a problem. 
No other game is a problem, and I am pretty good at video games as well. 

Edit: also, people never take me seriously when I say this, they just tell me to continue playing and do the things I'm supposed to do and progress.

I have never been the most confident woman in the world even though I get told I’m conventionally attractive/ a nice person etc. 

I grew up being taught virginity is everything to a man. Literally taught this as soon as I hit puberty. so the one thing that I saw myself as valuable was the fact I was a virgin. 

Fast forward to 24 I meet someone who I lost my virginity to while drunk. I was so shocked I did it the next morning I still am shocked to this day. Looking back I don’t know why I was head over heels for him. He treated me like garbage and clearly wasn’t over his ex. 

After we broke up shortly after I met someone at work. We had a purely physical relationship, though I developed feelings for him fast. Turns out he was engaged the whole time. 

After that ends my friend tried to get me a new ‘ f buddy’ but me and this guy end up in a relationship and have been for the last 2 years. 
. 


The thing is, he’s now saying that although he wants a house and children with me he doesn’t believe in marriage as he’s seen so many divorces close to home. I just can’t help but feel like he doesn’t want to marry me because I didn’t give him my virginity. Like how do I know this isn’t the case. I feel like breaking the whole thing off because although I want to be with him and I know he wants a place with me, in his words ‘ this is ultimate commitment ‘ 

The fact we won’t get married just doesn’t  sit well with me.  We are looking at properties in the next two weeks but I’m getting this sad sinking feeling inside me. Maybe I’m being ungrateful and should just be happy I have someone who is good to me and serious about me.

I went on a 4-day work trip, and it was very very tiring. We went to a huge design fair for inspo and talking to people and all the walking all day and having to constantly pay attention to visual information just made me sort of sign off. The last day (friday), we went shopping for some reason, and while it was less mentally tiring than the rest, we still had to walk a whole lot.  Our flight landed at 12AM after a 3 hour flight.

Thing is, my GPA is exactly 3.0. That's The requirement on my school's website for the program I was in. When I first started the program, there was a minimum amount of B-'s I could get before they didn't count anymore and now that I look back at my grades, I exceeded that minimum... (The minimum isn't listed on the website anymore). This spring semester is the end of the program so if my current credentials aren't enough it'll all be for nothing.

I don't know for certain whether I earned my degree or not. I haven't heard anything back from my graduation application and I don't think that will be for another week or two.
 
My family all congratulated me in finishing the program, even giving me money ... Meanwhile I never knew whether to say thank you or admit that it's that close and might be a total failure and waste of money. Worst of all, one of my 2019 objectives at work was to finish my degree (not a requirement but would certainly be embarrassing to admit that I'm not getting a degree).

But about a month ago we arrived in Australia together, for our gap year, and I’ve been living with him every day since. I’m starting to believe he isn’t a real friend anymore in a gradual process of seeing more and more anti social behaviour. I’ve made a list below of the things he does but need some help from the community.


•He lies all the time

-Very frequently, and even over small things despite evidence suggesting otherwise. I keep the truth to myself.

•He disregards my feelings

-He speaks inappropriately about some sensitive issues I have.

•He puts me down in front of others

-This may come from his own sense of insecurity or his ambition for power, but typically he will embarrass me in front of anyone else at any given opportunity.

•It’s always his way

-Most decisions we make as a pair for nights out and other small things end up in his favour. I fee powerless to suggests alternative reasoning.

•He spins the blame

-He sometimes takes no responsibility for his wrongdoings and will turn it on me to revive pressure from himself.

•He doesn’t listen to me and interrupts

-Often when we try and chat over a drink, he will cut me off halfway through a sentence, making me feel unimportant and insignificant.

•He bails

-If he doesn’t enjoy himself when we hang out because it isn’t what he wanted, he will simply leave with no consideration for others.

•He’s jealous and gives backhand complements

-Always giving vibes of being falsely happy for me when I have some minor successes, making the friendship fee like a competition.

•I’m more relaxed around new people

-Part of travelling means meeting new people and some of the people I’ve come across have been so relaxed and friendly it makes me question how I actually feel around him.

•I can’t express my true self or ideas around him

-Mainly out of fear of ridicule/disapproval.

•He reminds me of all his favours

-He always tries to portray himself as being such a good pal.

•He’s selfish and unrewarding

-He never shares and always takes, even over little things.

•He pressures me into situations I don’t want to be in

-If he wants to do something and wants me to be a part of it, he will use intimidating tactics that make me feel bullied into being involved. 

•He points out ‘criticisms’

485,"Last summer I got close to a boy who is 3 years younger than me and at the start of our friendship I mainly wanted to help him get together with his crush, because I thought they were a super cute couple. We hung out so much talking about our crushes every night, it kind of became like a habit to go out after everyone's home and just walk around town. After like 2-3 weeks though I noticed that he kinda started acting a little bit more clingy towards me and he kind of flirted as well. He did confess his feelings for me and of course I rejected him, because age gap and stuff.. Now the thing is I may have also fallen for him as well during the time where he was being all clingy and stuff, and I know it's extremely wrong to like him and I hate myself so much and feel like a complete monster for liking him and I've tried to shake him out of my mind, we don't even hang out since school started, but I know his crush, the one I was trying to help him with, is in his class and I feel so sad that she gets to see him every day.. and during the time him and I hung out this summer I realized she was kind of using him, I guess? Because here's the thing she actually has a boyfriend, but their relationship is very on and off, so every time she's ""single"", she hangs out with ""my"" guy, or other of our male friends, and by hang out I mean making out, but then a day or two later she gets back together with her bf. And ""my"" guy has told me so many times that she's so stupid and such a slut and stuff and that he enjoys my company more, but whatever, because I don't think he likes me anymore, except I do, and I feel like a monster and I want it to stop, but like I mentioned earlier we used to go around town, so now everywhere I go, I keep getting reminded of him and I feel so so terrible both emotionally and morally. What do I do, I don't want to be a degenerate and I don't want it to hurt anymore.",11Jan2020,1
486,"Okay so I have two phones, one at my mums and one at my dads. 

I have a partner my dad doesn't know about as I've been terrified to say it from things my mother has said and done. 

Anyways so my problem is my partner has just messaged me at my mums at 1 am telling me he got a two second call and snapchat saying I was active for about 15 minuets and our last conversations on there were very personal. 

I'm so terrified if someone's gone into it or if it's a glitch. 

My partner called multiple times but it rings out. 

I haven't received a message from my dad and I'm petrified. 

Is this a glitch or something? Please help me",11Jan2020,1
487,"Hey all, not sure what my inclination was to post here, but why not give it a shot. I came to college purely because I didn't have anything else to do. I needed to get away from home because of bad parental relationships and lack of opportunity. Rural America doesn't lead to many avenues I wanted to explore. Because I came out of necessity, I didn't particularly have an idea of what I wanted to do. I transitioned between many different majors, never settling in on one I really fit with. Now, years down the line, I'm doing worse than ever. I just finished my first semester of junior year with uh...a 0 GPA. I failed every single class last semester. I was hardly able to make myself go to class, and I suffer from chronic depression that I can't seem to get past. Now, unlike most of my college career, I've found myself with a really strong support system of friends and loved ones here, I just don't want to feel like an overbearing negative to them that they always have to look out for. I have no money, job, or car and it leads to me always feeling pretty helpless. I just really am not looking to get kicked out of school. I'm taking on an incredible amount of loans and it's the only way I'm staying afloat at the moment. I don't feel like I can go back home and live there. I legitimately feel like I would attempt suicide again back there. I'm just not sure what direction I can take at this point, if I'm even allowed back at school this semester. Any interests I feel I might have I don't have the talent or drive to do them long term for a living, such as artistic expression in many different mediums. I just feel like I'm biding my time, but I'm starting to sink. Any and all advice anyone may have would be greatly appreciated. I know how often people go through and come out of these situations and this seems like a minute blip in the past, but it's certainly hard when you're directly going through it.

488,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23 year old male. I've been in a few Friends with Benefits relationships and open relationships in the last 2 years, where sex was the ""starter"" of the relationship. I am used to sex and sexual intimacy happening very quickly.

However, now, I've started university studies, and met a new girl who I connected really well with. We started ""dating"" a while ago and it seems like it's going into an actual relationship territory. However, the sexual escalation is very slow, something I'm not used to at all.

Does this mean anything about the future of the relationship/her libido? I'll admit, me not having sex for nearly a month is affecting me, that hasn't happened in the last 2 years, and with my studies, it sometimes makes it hard for me to focus. I'm used to being with high libido girls and I'm hoping she isn't a low libido.

I'll also add that I've never been in a monogamous relationship. This is very new to me, I've always declined entering such relationships, but now that I've transitioned into university and could really use stability, I'm willing to try it out for the first time, so the whole concept of ""Building trust and intimacy and then progressing sexually"", and not the other way around, is very unknown to me.",11Jan2020,1

491,"Hi. My name is Em and I’m 16. Since I was 11 I have suffered with severe anxiety that turned into major depression about a year later. I was badly bullied in school and verbally abused every day and people told me to kill myself. Just because I had anxiety and panic attacks and scars in my arms. Also because I was just different and I don’t really know why. I got help but CAMHS then we’re awful and unreliable I tried to kill myself seriously about 2 years ago and more attempts followed but I couldn’t even do that right. I was put in a mental hospital I’m London for a while and when I got out things were fine but then just got worse and the ups and downs were much more than your average ones. I was off school to recover for 2 months and then was sent to a private school. It sucks. I was with all younger girls and there’s only  120 of us in the whole school including sixth form. I know. The girls are so ignorant and bitchy and they don’t understand what it’s like to have gone to a state school and what the real unsheltered world is like. I found out that I had BPD or borderline personality disorder and this shook my whole world suddenly everything made sense why I was the way I was and my relationships.. intense but unstable. I had been in a few relationships one that I am still in and have been for almost 6 months but the other left to join the baby or move away or they just left.. I have a nice family who love me and two adorable cats but I fight with my family and my relationships with them are rocky and not close. I want to give up. School is putting so much pressure on me. The teachers you have no idea they treat it like if you don’t get an A or an A* that you are a failure. I can’t take the abuse I get from a couple of them and the girls are driving me crazy. I keep fighting with my boyfriend and things keep going wrong in every aspect of my life m. I hate my body and the way I am but every time I want to die someone saves me or I stop myself. The truth is I am scared. Terrified. Of living and dying. What a way to exist right? I have mock exams coming up they start on Monday and I have barely revisited I keep telling myself they mean nothing but the pressure is building up and I feel like I will implode. Why does it all feel so hopeless. I feel worthless and like a true liability to everyone. Please someone help me I need advice and often it’s better when they are strangers who don’t know you I don’t know if that makes sense but I hope it does. I pray someone actually reads this because I know it’s really long but this all just came out because I’m desperate. It feels like my fingers can barley keep up with typing as my mins is running too fast. If anyone has gone through anything like this? How did you get through this. I have people around me but I have never felt so alone. I have no friends. I pushed them all away and well I only have three but one is at uni and the other lives far away and is busy often and my best friend is so caught up in their work that they hardly have time for me. I need help. I am scared of what I might do or how things will end up if I do nothing.

492,"Hello there, so I scheduled to get a tattoo about 5-6 months ago and approximately 3 weeks before my appointment, the artist’s secretary cancelled my appointment. The secretary said the cancellation is due to the artist having a difficult month the month prior to my appointment. 
This tattoo shop is in a different country and I had to take time off of work, book lodging, a flight, and pay a deposit. The secretary offered to pay me back for the flight and the to return the deposit. 
I’ve been waiting 2 weeks now and I’ve sent one check in email regarding when I would receive the refund. She said I would receive it this week which I haven’t.
Recently, I’ve checked Instagram and seen the artist working and doing tattoos so I’m kind of annoyed and disappointed.
I think this artist is working in a temporary or rented space in a particular shop. 

Advice needed: do you think I should send another email to the secretary, send an email to the shop themselves and circumvent the personal secretary, or wait a bit more time?

Thanks in advance!",11Jan2020,1
493,"Ive been in a relationship for a couple years now and its always been sort of long distance but we see each other about once a month. We both just started college in the fall and decided to stay together. I really do like him, but lately he hasn’t been very affectionate and I worry that he doesn’t really want to be dating anymore. We hang out still and its enjoyable, but maybe he just wants to be friends. 

So fast forward to last week, my friends and I set up a tinder account using my pictures but a different name just to joke around with and meet people. But I’ve been talking to one person more seriously. I honestly do not have any intention of hooking up or dating him, but I just think he’s a cool guy and would be a nice friend to have around. 

Is this wrong? I’m worried this counts as cheating or something and I don’t know what to do. I also don’t know how to talk to my boyfriend about the current lack of affection. Thanks for reading if you got this far :-)",11Jan2020,1
494,"I am 28 and been in a relationship for over 11 years to a really amazing girl, I started working in an office about 3 years ago, have become good mates with one of the women I work with. This year at the after few drinks at Christmas party we got a taxi home, we ended up as the last two people in the taxi, as she was getting out of the taxi we kissed (small kiss about 30secs). I have not been able to stop thinking about it and have realised that I like her way more than I should, like more than a mate.
She is older than I am she is 45 with two kids and an ex husband, i know that this wouldn't work as a relationship as we would have different life goals (I want kids where as she already has some) 
I have noticed I am quite dependant on my gf when it comes to dealing with life as she is usually who I would talk to about stuff. 
I want to forget this happened and move on but also not make it uncomfortable in the office and don't want people to notice anything happened between us. I do still wanna remain mates with her as I get on with her so well and this was just a drunken mistake. 
My gf and I are about to buy a house and start our life together properly so I need to get my head straight

495,"So this guy I talk to at my job we been dating for about a month almost 2 he took me on a few dates and we hang out at my place before after a party at my house we went to a hotel not to have sex atleast I didn’t have sex with him but we made out kissed and grind a little hand job. Long story short I kinda hated it because it was our third date and I never did anything sexual in my 27 years of life until the month of December 2019. 


    Anyways long story short we haven’t hung out since  December 6th but we see each other everyday at work and we also text so he made up a plan for me to surprise him with dinner. Idk when or where to start I haven’t did anything nice for him which he haven’t did anything to nice for me. That I really enjoyed, Christmas past by and he didn’t buy me any gift but I thought to buy him a gift but it didn’t happened because he’s a guy I thought he would be sweet enough to buy me something 


  So I been skeptical on doing a sweet thing for him but I’m putting my pride aside to plan to cook for him and surprise we really don’t want anyone at our job knowing we dating so I don’t want to cook him food and bring it to work and also I don’t want to cook at my house because I live with too many ppl and I can’t set up a table and have him sit because it wouldn’t be romantic consider a lot of ppl I stay with will be around. 

Any ideas on a surprise? And any advice on what I just said tbh to me it sounds like this dating phrase with him is kinda toxic. Or am I over exaggerating? 

I never been on a date so he’s my first date and I also went on a date with another guy after him but that date turned out to be my worse day of my life with the second guy things happened and I regret it. That guy is horrible to me I kinda hate that I met him.",11Jan2020,1
496,"I need help. Sadly nowadays since nothing is any longer just talking you need to know how to talk in person and over text/snap.

I just need some basic guidelines so I can avoid this happening

I respond relatively fast, I say bro or bruh or whatever here and there but not like in a weird way, I pretty much never just do a few lines or words, I always ask a lot questions about them, I do beat around the bush a lot though, but in my opinion I feel like I’d be the best or easiest to text and it’s the complete opposite.

If my father sees me using ANY device, he will take it away or shut it down through parental control. I can't make friends unless my father personally knows either them or their parents. One of my friend's father is a close friend of mine, yet he won't let me visit her or hang out with her. 

I can't visit the shops nor the GP, which are literally across the house unless if he drives me or walks me there. I can't buy candy or anything unless I tell him if it's alright, and most of the time, he says no because it's a 'waste' of 'his' money. I get a few pounds every week or so for doing chores or just when he's in a good mood, but I can't use any of it infront of him. I usually spend it in secret when my mother goes out for grocery shopping in town. 

I wanted to go for karate lessons, but he looked into it and refused because he can't come with me to watch me. I wanted to do some voluntary work because I wanted to have something I can show in a college application, but he said no because he has no aquantances there. We couldn't go to a restruant we really wanted to go to because there have been news of horse meat or donkey meat traces in meat, so we couldn't go. Another reason was that there were no aquatances he knew of. We were supposed to go to Scotland for a short trip, but he refused on second thought because he had no friends there. 

I have a pet bunny, which I got because he felt sorry for me for not having any friends I could communicate with. I can't take him out of his cage, but I do when he's cooped up in his room, and I put him back when he comes downstairs. I can't read books that I like. It has to go through to him first. I can't watch shows that I like. It has to go through to him first, and he often comments about how uneducational they are and goes on about how I'm wasting my time. 

I can't text my friends. I do that in secret because apparently, it might not be my friend who's texting me, but their father who could be a child predator trying to kill me or take advantage of me. 

At first, I wasn't allowed to go to the back yard without either him or my mother being present because a neighbour or a passer-by could come and kidnap me or kill me. I protested for a very long time till they found that there was nothing wrong with it, but I can't go outside now because it's cold. 

I can't take public transport because someone might be out for me. 

Our house is in no condition for me to stay in 24 hours a day. It's run down, mouldy, rat-infested, and we have no toys or devices we're allowed to play with. My parents are constantly at each other's necks, and they're always throwing things around. My mother ignored me for 5 months after we got into a fight. I said sorry, but she said to stop acting like I'm in a soap opera, and she hasn't talked to me since. My brother curses her, hits her, and talks back, yet she treats him nicely. I've done nothing of that sort. 

I'm really sad. No one is getting along, and everyone is so hostile with each other. Let me tell you, not even my mum can do what she wants. My mother wants to drive, get a job, get friends, and go to college to study, but my father refused. She can't even go to the corner shop across the road without telling him, but she goes anyway, and my father gets angry.

503,"I (mid thirties) live with another girl (also mid thirties). Everything is great....except the overnight guest thing. I have a boyfriend who stays over once a week at most - usually once ever 2-3 weeks (other times I'm at his). We're in bed at a reasonable hour and done having sex by 12/1am at the very latest - we both have things going on at the weekend and can't sleep in too much.

She likes to go out on a Friday / Saturday night and come in at 3am and have sex with a guy until 6 in the morning (loudly) then sleep until 1 or 2pm, wake up and do it all over again. Her bed also bangs against my wall even though I've asked her tons of times to move it just an inch or two back from the wall. The noise is so loud it wakes me up. She once had sex with a guy overnight, then he left and she had someone else come over in the afternoon and had sex with him. I get home on a Saturday afternoon and would like to relax but again...noisy sex prevents me from chilling out.

I'm a bit more conservative in my lifestyle, I guess. I drink, but not too much, I'm active and eat healthy, and have professional goals I'm working towards. On the other hand, she likes to get wasted (and finds it hilarious) and have sex with guys from Tinder into the early hours. I find it frustrating that I am trying to be successful in life and the hours she keeps (and sometimes what she chooses to do in those hours) and having a detrimental effect on that success. I'm writing this from a coffee bar because she has a guy with her and when I got home it was really loud, and I don't want to sit in my living room and listen to all her fuck noises.

Even though this is stressing me out, I feel like I'm being judgmental and unfair. It's her house too, and if this is how she chooses to live her life, she has every right to. She certainly shouldn't change because I don't like it. I've tried using positive thinking and all kinds of mental trickery to be okay with it, but I can't stop feeling uncomfortable.

508,"He agrees to meet twice a month with me. 

Today he said he looked through all his old boxes of stuff (because he lies going through all his stuff before he leaves for a trip?) and said he found our old cards and they were sweet and long and elaborate. That he kept every single note and letter and card we exchanged. He said he never did that with anyone else he has dated. 
We reminisced about the fun times we had together. The sweet notes, the long cards, the nice and Elaborate and sweet gifts we have each other. The things we did as teens to hangout or have sex because we couldn’t do because of parents. He said he went to an old spot we randomly had sex in (it turned out to be a driveway and we always laughed about it) recently when we was looking at Christmas lights and thought of that moment. How we used to go and have Christmas with his family and their games they played every year. 


He stayed up like three hours past the time he said he could stay out to talk with me. He took a while to leave my car and I reminded him a few times that he needed to get sleep for work. 

He texted me this after I said I got home safe: “Good! 
It was great seeing you, I always have a good time:) Stay strong with your heavy schedule this week, I know you will though! 
Take care and I look forward to seeing you in a little while!”

We broke up three years ago. We meet every so often to talk about life and just catch up. I basically was a part of his family and am super close with his family.

We broke up to mature. I had issues expressing myself in a way that made my partner feel he could be emotionally open with me and my partner in turn never expressed his feelings with me anymore and couldn’t be emotionally vulnerable. I realized it was my fear of
Being alone that made me act in a way to tear him
Down. I have been alone for three years now and focused on not making someone else the purpose of my life. 
We dated for ten years so there were some bad habits. 

I texted him a random fact about race and the royal family and said he was the only person who would also appreciate this and he said this: 
      “Oh, I am always down for all the fun facts haha, I champion curiosity and random knowledge haha #student4lifelonglearner
#jeopardylikehashtag
I hope those hashtags made sense haha 
Wow I had no idea! I wonder if they’ve tried to keep that a family secret, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did! I agree, it’s silly to get pissy about racial nonsense like that and it only slows human progression down. That’s on par with like Hitler’s release of that portrait of the “perfect Aryan”, only later to be discovered was actually Jewish!”

I think he mentioned jeopardy because we talked about how we always used to play it together and how I still keep up to this day. 

He also had this rubber band on his wrist that he said he would wear and flick himself with it when he would think of me when we were first breaking up so he wouldn’t think about me so much. He still wears that rubber band and that was three years ago when he told me that.

When we go out to a nightclub or a bar I usually drink a bit more than them because they're not really into drinking and I am, but I never really over-do it or anything, just enough to get me drunk and only on those occasions where we go out partying.
Last night we went to a fancy and special dinner, I decided to get a beer in me (only one) and they immediately started getting mad at me and scolding me telling me to not get drunk, as if I'm some sort of out of control alcoholic or something.

I just put it down all these years that it was probably because my real dad was never there and he never tried to be. But sometimes I wonder if something happened to me that I don’t remember. I am really good at blocking things out. My mother passed away a few years ago and my relationship with step dad is none existent, granted he doesn’t bother with me but on my behalf it’s because I feel awkward about conversing with him and I should be like that with a man that’s been in my life since I was 4. 

I never knew my real dads identity until a few years ago he went onto my Facebook and shared a picture of me, playing this loving dad that had never met his daughter before, he never once contacted me and I wouldn’t know about it if he hadn’t of been friends with a friend of mine. I had the opportunity to contact him but the thought of trying to even have to have a conversation with him or possibly meet him put me off. I just don’t understand. I’m fine with drs and dentists etc but outside of that it’s a big nope for me.",11Jan2020,1

518,"I'm a college student (21) and live with two roomates  one of whom moved in about 4 months ago ( the other roomate is not important to the story). We clicked immediatly (he likes videogames I like videogames, he likes anime and manga I like anime and manga, we grew up in neighbouring towns...), at the beginning my feelings for him were purely platonic but as time passed they developed into not so platonic ones. I know he's straight because we talked about the whole sexuality thing and he knows I'm gay and is completely fine with it to the point where he make jokes about me being his wingman when we go out. The fact that he is straight was sadly not anough to stop me from catching feelings for this dude ( for all of you thinking ""he must look like a greek god"" he doesn't, he is an average looking dude, it's his personality that got me). 
When I moved here i built a small grupe of female friends and one of those friends started hooking up with him (ignorant of my feeling for him) and talking to me about him and asking me advices about what to do and not to do when they hang out. On the other hand he tells me all the things he likes about her and wants to do to her (NSFW) and I just sit there listening to it and screaming on the inside. 
This is a bad situation already but I'm not done with my rant yet. He is also a bit of a ""player"", he started texting one of my hometown friends on the side and also tells me everything he wants to do to her and all the thing that he does (*cue the inside sreams*) . These two girls don't know about each other and I'm keeping it that way because i don't want them to get hurt and I also want to stay on the good terms with the guy ( I am a horrrible friend). I basically keep his secrets and wish I was one of them (how ever pathetic that sounds). Should I tell my friends that hes a player? Should I tell them I like him?

519,"(Kind of long, sorry)

I’ve (23) been working at this place for about 3 months now and and on my first day working here, I met this beautiful girl (24) and fell for her instantly. I wouldn’t say in love but I would say a string crush developed. Now it’s a pretty intense crush, but here’s the thing: I barely know her, and we used to work in close proximity when I first started there but after a week of her training me she went across the building and now I see her everyday but at a distance where we have like no interaction. but I CANNOT stop thinking about her and every time I see her around work I freeze up and get real nervous and sweaty to say anything to her; and when I do say anything it’s something awkward. 

Well I asked some coworkers about her and found out that she got out of a 7 year on/off relationship around when I started working here (obstacle 1). So I figured I’d give some time, but as the time has gone by I realize that she would never be with a guy like me, I’m weird and geeky and into all nerd shit and she’s cute and fancy and an ex theater kid and whatnot. I’ve come to the realization that I need to get over her... but I don’t know how. I see her all the time which sucks and makes it harder to get my mind off of her. Any help on what I could do? 

P.S: I know the usual find “Find someone else... or get a girlfriend” but I lack social skills, highly and with work and school I have no time to meet people anywhere else.... I know it’s a stretch but if you have any thing at all that could help with this very odd problem I am having I would really appreciate it!

TLDR: I know my work crush would never be with me, how could I get over her?",11Jan2020,1
522,"My sister is 24 years old and she just moved back home after living in another state for 4 years while at university. She is close to completing her degree, but the way she is now I don’t think she can have a normal job. She was the type of person to never touch drugs and looked down on those who did. Now I’ve just discovered she smokes weed mixed with tobacco all day and night constantly, like 20+ bong hits per day. I think that’s excessive and I’m really worried about her mental and physical health. She also does whippets/nangs (nitrous oxide) often. She doesn’t have a job right now and even though she is living for free with our parents she spends $300 per week of our parents money on weed, tobacco and whippets. She hates living with mum and dad and wants to move out but can’t afford to rent a small apartment if she spends so much money on her habit. Where we live $300 per week is the average unemployment pension and a person can live off of it easily and plenty of people do if they share rent. So she’s taking the piss. Why can’t she cut down her weed use or just quit all together? Then she will have plenty of money and not be so depressed that she’s poor.

I also just found out she is now a prostitute working at a local brothel because she “doesn’t want a minimum wage job” and needs more money. I’m so worried about her it’s really upsetting to see her destroying herself. She’s seen a psychologist and a GP has her on Zoloft but it’s not helping. 

I’m grateful she isn’t using meth or something more serious like that but also worried her being a sex worker will lead to her using meth or heroin in the near future.

523,"Hello All,  


So, I do screenwriting as a hobby in Boston. Recently, I wrote a comedy script on my Portuguese heritage. Felt confident enough to the point where I reached out to a Improv troupe with some viral videos that are huge in the Portuguese diaspora. In October I reached out, and they said they'd love to hear more on the project. So I sent the first twenty pages. After two weeks I emailed again as a follow up, and they said that they were busy that month. So I waited and corrected my script and complete it. I messaged them again after the holidays last week, to which they said January was the perfect month for them to give me feedback, and to send the updated version of said script. 

I'm now wondering if I should follow up with them again this coming week?  Is there such a thing as being too persistent with topics such as these? Although a hobby, I've somewhat attached myself to this project since I now have somewhat of a, ""connection."" Is it ok to have high hopes now or should I chill out?",11Jan2020,1
525,"So some context, I (20m) live with my friends who are in a relationship (20m and 21f). Myself and the female friend who I'll call Louise have lived together since November of 2018, while her boyfriend of 7 months moved in around October 2019. I have no personal problems with either of them, but this situation made me very uncomfortable.

I came home late last night from work, as I usually do (which they both know well), to hear them having sex pretty loudly. Having never encountered this situation before I sat on the couch and put headphones in, volume on max. I sent Louise a text saying I was home, I tried not to make too much noise because I didn't want to make it a big deal at the time, and I just wanted to sleep. I waited until one of them exit the room and went to the bathroom, then I went to bed. Or at least I tried, I felt very disrespected in a way. They knew I was coming home at this time, as I do every night. They also knew I worked this morning. I was up until roughly 3 am just trying to relax, then, I woke up at 5 to go to work.

I'm still currently at work, but the feeling of uncomfortableness and disrespect is still lingering.

527,"I currently have a really great group of friends, we go out every weekend and have a lot of fun and I’d like to keep these guys for life (even though we are just eighteen). We started going out a lot pretty recently (at the beginning of school year) and in our group there’s this beautiful girl, I used to not like her that much before she was friends with us but then I got to know her and she’s actually a great person. Anyway, when we became friends I used to see her as just a friend and not someone I’d like to be with. But 2-3 weeks ago I realized that I was beginning to develop feelings for her and that is probably due to the fact that we got closer, in fact, during the holidays we would have parties at a friends house because his parents were away for the week, we all (we are 4 btw) slept over there for a couple of days and that girl and I would sleep in the same room and we would watch movies and shit. I think these feelings began at that moment, she began to lean on me during movies, we slept in the same bed (no sex just sleeping) and we talked a lot. Now I know that I have a big crush on her and I hate it because I don’t think she feels the same way and even if she did I probably wouldn’t do anything about it because I wouldn’t want to separate our group. So now I don’t know what to do because normally I become distant with a girl I have a crush on (if it isn’t reciprocal) to make it go away but here I don’t want to, she’s a great friend and if I do become distant, I’m afraid I’ll begin losing my other friends because most of the time, when I’m with them she’s also there. 
I thought about trying to get with an other girl that has a crush on me (she’s pretty btw) but I don’t know if that would be a good idea considering I don’t really have feelings for her and I don’t want to be an asshole and hurt her in the end.

I spent my holidays outside the country. I stayed there for two weeks. My home country is 4 hours ahead compared to that country.

When I came back to my country, I always ended up waking up earliest at 9am and latest at 11am then my body feels so weak and totally sleepy at 6pm and waking up again at 9pm. After that, I won't be able to sleep 'till 2am then the cycle goes on and on...

It compromises my college life. I am studying in a Adventist school so we have worships at our dorms at 5am and 7pm. I missed both of those worships.

About my classes, it's either I missed my first class or I come late. I also have this one major subject that is 1pm-7pm. I feared that I might collapse or fell asleep in that class. Most of my courses are majors so it would totally impact my GPA if I can't find a solution to regulate my sleep.

I got fed up with the constant buzzing that I went to put his phone on dnd when I saw that a girl with heart eyes next to her name had texted him. My heart sunk as I stared at the screen and my crazy ass decided to wake him tf up. We start going at it and yelling and accidentally woke his mom up. His mom comes downstairs and asks us what’s going on and we apologize and go back to sleep. Turns out the girl was just a friend. This morning my bf goes to his moms room to ask to use the car so he can drive me home and she says no and they start going at it because of us arguing. Long story short, his mom says that we BOTH need to leave. More arguing ensues and as he’s packing his bag she says “ you know that you don’t actually have to leave” and then he proceeds to say “ nah I’m leaving I don’t need your sympathy I’m a grown ass man”. I tell him to stop and to put his pride aside and he then tells me that I don’t know what I’m talking about and I am the cause of all of this. ( which honestly I am). Now I feel extremely guilt and bad and I have no idea what to do. I love my boyfriend to death and would never purposefully want to harm him in this way. Before I left he was yelling at me and then after he said that “nothing is going to change and that he loves me” and hugged and kissed me goodbye.

So my friend (I’ll refer him as T) is toxic. T knows he’s toxic and trying to help get rid of it. But he hasn’t changed over the winter break. Me and T are well known to argue in a group chat me and my friends are in. We are 90% of the arguments and the 10% is just the group chat getting upset over a NSFW picture or the topic because some of our parents checks what we do (our age ranges are 12-14 me being the second oldest). 

So T likes to drag me down along with my self esteem in arguments. He tries to overpower me even without advice. T starts them randomly and times I’m not on or playing games. 

One time T got upset about me posting stolen memes when 99% of them are already stolen on my Instagram account. T got very upset and tried to twist it into making it the memes everyone post in our group chat also on there. Everyone in the chat believed T for a good 5 minutes and I bit the bait and went off. I even recorded all the post I have posted to show proof I don’t steal from the chat. After the recording everyone was joining my side and trying to defend me. 

T twist everything to make it seem like I’m the bad guy or overly sensitive. Just like that argument for example. T even tries to bring up old arguments to spite me. 

Ever since then I have blocked him on every social media page he follows me on. He keeps asking what my @ is and I always refuse to tell him so he won’t twist everything I post. 

T doesn’t only argue in the chat but also during class. Yelling at me. Saying horrible things to me. And takes forever to apologize or never even apologizes. 

I have been trying since last year to not be friends with him but it doesn’t work. He has been slowly destroying my self esteem with my art style (mix of cartoon and anime in a way) and saying how it’s weird. How I’m stupid and ugly and laughs whenever my grades are bad. 

I keep getting told that he possibly still has a crush on me but I don’t believe it with all the shit he talks about me. T had a crush on me in 6th grade and it’s a bit of a conspiracy theory if he still does. 

But I don’t want to be a bitch and completely ignore him but at the same time I want my self esteem to not be dragged almost weekly by his toxicity. I want my self esteem to not be damaged any more.

My problem isn't that I'm unmotivated or that I don't try things because I'm afraid of failure or what others say etc. I really couldn't care less. My problem is that I have no real vision anymore. For the longest time I haven't been able to look at something and say 'THAT is what I want to do next' or 'THAT is what I aspire to be'. Because I really have no idea what it is I want in life. To the point where it drove me nuts not too long ago and I fell into a severe depression (diagnosed by psych), got the mental health plan etc. (No meds though as I'm a big believer and follower in self help books, changing the chemical imbalances naturally etc.) 

The hardest part by far is knowing I can do anything I want in life and having that drive... But at the same time not knowing WHAT I want to do fullstop.

HOWEVER! I've definitely had those good moments and I have achieved every vision and goal I had set each time when I had one. I went through a rough breakup about a year after school and went through the whole 'focus on myself' phase.

But since he's not having a party, his friends have been calling since 9 in the morning and he's been on the phone since then. It's now dinner time.

Additionally, the plans we had for today of course went down the drain now. 

I am hungry, annoyed, bored and frankly disappointed with him for acting this way and completely ignoring me and the food issue, and as the shops close in a bit, I won't be able to buy groceries till Monday which absolutely sucks.

I tried to get this across to him of course but he's all about his friends and doesn't see an issue right now. When I plainly told him ""boyfriend, I know you love your friends and don't want to miss any calls but I seriously need to eat something"" he looked at me, confused, and told me he wasn't hungry and I should've bought groceries yesterday if it was that important.

- Ex. She expects a draft submitted to her without ever telling us it was a thing. Or expects drafts of homework assignments, which is even weirder.

2. Doesn’t account for time, so tests are half the time that is allegedly supposed to be, and she starts talking during test time about rubrics and shit

3. Doesn’t explain how her grading works. I did ask multiple times, and she gave me a prepared mumbo jumbo response. 

4. She doesn’t allow students to discuss grades with her as it isn’t in her ‘contract’

5. She doesn’t like to be corrected, and I don’t want to argue with her since she could lower my grade.

I already feel better just typing this out, but I would love to hear from other small business owners, as I know we in particular get hit the hardest with this.

555,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this topic, but I just need some kind of feedback as to what might be going on with me. From the time that I was 18 til right before I turned 20, I was in an awful abusive relationship. I don’t really want to go into the details of it, but he constantly was doing awful things to me then gaslighting me and making me feel like shit. There was nothing he didn’t do to make me more miserable. 
Fast forward to now, almost two years later, I have been dating a new guy for about a year now. He is great and does everything right and is perfect. I have never been happier, and I didn’t even know this kind of love could exist. The only problem, multiple nights a week I have almost the same dream: I am packing up and trying to figure out a way to leave my ex. I don’t know why I keep having them and it is super frustrating to keep being reminded of probably the worst point in my life. How do I stop this? I don’t really want to see a therapist if I don’t have to. Has this happened to anyone before?",11Jan2020,1

557,"I’ll condense the story as much as possible. 

My wife cheated on me last year with her personal trainer, after 10 years together. Whilst I was on the way back to normality after a bad brush with mental illness. I left the house after things ended, she made things unbearable, disappearing without warning and leaving me with our 16 month daughter. Now I am living back home with my parents until the house is sold. 

The thing is, I only found out about the trainer after the fact due to some suspicious activity on our joint bank account showed she had been having days out with him and my daughter without my knowledge before things even ended between us, I think that hurts the most. 

He’s now moved in it seems and despite the only thing I’ve asked for is for her not to have our daughter around him at such a strange time for everyone, proposing that she introduce him when we’re both settled in our respective new homes.

Despite agreeing to 50/50 custody, my daughter is with me or my Mum a good 90% of the time yet I’m still paying for half of the utilities, council tax, Internet, everything on the house they’re both living in and he’s contributing nothing, well not to me at least.

The reason I’m here is to know whether I’m doing the right thing? 

I’m trying to keep the peace and avoid giving her the opportunity to be an asshole and try and take my daughter away, as that’s the only way she could hurt me and my family more than she already has. I’m doing this until I can afford to divorce her and get things set in stone so she can’t do anything later.

The only problem is that I’m really starting to struggle financially. Between paying for that house, contributions to living back home and my daughter, I’m finding it hard to stay above water. 

I had a lot of collectibles and movie memorabilia that I’ve sold to make ends meet but that well is nearly dry, I’ve literally got no more fat to trim or sacrifices to make. It wouldn’t be as bad if she was at all grateful for any of it, or even sorry for the damage she’s caused.

Am I unreasonable thinking that I should only be paying the mortgage? When my only crime is being ill, I seem to have lost a lot while she is still living pretty.

This isn’t a slagging match post, I’m over the worst of the pain from the cheating, I’m just so lost, trying to stay positive is tiring. The house has been on the market since August and my patience is starting to run out.

Buyouts etc... are not an option, I couldn’t live there now, too many memories.

Any advice or stories of people in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated.",11Jan2020,1
558,"I am turning 16 years old and currently finishing my indoor soccer season. I’ve been playing indoor and outdoor soccer for a long while and I’m quitting after the season. My teammates have been putting me down for forever and every time I play is just a toxic experience. I’ve lost all my enjoyment playing the sport and I just want it to end. My parents said I don’t have to play the outdoor season as long as I find a way to be active. This summer I’m going to get a part time job so I didn’t want to have to focus on another team sport. I said that I could take up running or go to the gym (which I would be willing to do), but my parents said “I would just give up” and “I would be forced to attend practices and games in a team-sport.” I’m also pretty much grounded until I find another team-sport to take up and it’s causing a lot of unwanted stress.

559,"OK so I’ve never actually posted on here before but I figured I should ask

Recently my (F20) mom told me that I would have to give up my room and start sharing a room with my youngest brother (11) and she would move in my other brother into my room (M13). 

My middle brother had told me about this before hand but I thought he was bluffing because I’m the only girl in the family and I think I should have my own privacy in my own room but then my mom told me about it today and she didn’t give me the space to put in my input but rather just told me if she doesn’t work next week one of those days my stuff will just end up in the same room as my youngest brother. 

I’ve always had a really big struggle speaking to my parents in general because our communication is really bad but I feel like this is going overboard because I am a full grown person and I deserve my own room especially because I’m the only girl, I also personally feel like my brother doesn’t ever do anything and I don’t understand why he would get his own room anyway.

My mom‘s reasoning behind it is because both my youngest brother and I are messier that we should share a room and then my middle brother that is usually cleaner I guess can get his own room that way she doesn’t waste her time cleaning both rooms. 
I think that’s a really lousy excuse to put us together considering I always clean entire house when I have to clean regardless of who’s room is messy or not.

Honestly I just need some help figuring out how to address this.

TLDR: mom is planning to make me share room with youngest brother and put middle brother in his own room",11Jan2020,1

Last night I literally begged her to stay with me and that’d I’d do anything with her this weekend. She said she feels like my job is more important to me then her, so I said I’d work less shifts, she said she doesn’t feel like I go out of my way to spend time with her, so I offered to take her out somewhere for a date, she said I don’t go out of my comfort zone for her, so I offered to take her skating. To no avail. I really thought I was doing better this week. Other then getting frustrated with her yesterday while I was anxious and really irritable I was going all the things I could think about. I was giving her hugs and kisses and taking her out. I was confessing my love because she asked me to put in more effort because I probably wasn’t putting enough in before. I went out of my way to spend more time with her this week. Idk what else to do! I thought I was doing everything she asked for, I knew I wasn’t the best in the past but I’ve always loved her and I’m trying to put my all into the relationship but I’m stuck. Wwyd to fix my situation??

561,"Im 18 in college currently and I receive and give into pressure from my family with almost every aspect of my life at the moment. The people in my family that pressure me the most are my mother and grandmother. My grandmother is always pressuring me about buying a house early, which I know for a fact im not going to be able to handle. Not saying buying a house early is a bad idea, but I dont even work full time or make nearly enough money to maintain a home and no one else in my family has the money to help me with that. She wants me to use my student loan money to put a down payment onto a house but I dont even think itll be enough because the houses in my area are so expensive so id have to take out even more loans just to cover for it. What i really want to do is travel so Id rather invest in that than invest into a house to tie myself down, and i tell my family that all the time but they dont seem to take my feelings into consideration. I feel like I always need to be away from them so they dont bother me and pressure me because theyre always putting things into my head that i dont really want to hear. Im not even able to relax without them telling me something i need to do. I already have so much on my plate being a full time student and im working part time and i always have assignments to do so i already dont have nearly enough time for myself. Ive also recently moved back in with my parents due to a harassment situation at my apartment last semester and im looking for somewhere else to go. I feel so much anxiety when my family is pressuring me and I give in everytime because they never stop bugging me about it until i give in. From buying things I know I dont need, to signing contracts for furniture purchases  , everything they pressure me into does nothing but stress me to the fullest. I know theyre trying to prepare me for life but i dont like stressing over the pressure, i want to do things my way and I cant seem to be able to do that without just being completely away from them. I dont make enough money to get an apartment and I dont have any friends I can stay with. I just dont know what I should do because im in no position to get myself out of being away from them right now.

567,"I guess I'll start this by describing myself. (18m)  
I am a tall, mixed-race university student who is objectively attractive. I guess it all stems from this, maybe I let the attention get to my head, but my morals have always been to respect others and be kind. But since I got out of a long term relationship before uni, I felt like I have been able to enjoy myself, I guess. So going clubbing, having one night stands, essentially doing party stuff.   
I just don't feel like a good person because during the Christmas holidays I met a girl who seemed very nice, so we got to talking, and I don't know what it is but she likes me a lot, especially as it has only been 3 weeks and she's already introduced me to both her parents. But I just don't feel into her at all, and I know for a fact that if this was me of early-mid 2019 or before I would be 100% honest with her.  
I guess this feeling comes from a situation that involves my ex, but the gist of it is that because people think I got over my ex too quickly (we broke up 6 months ago) and I have been having meaningless sex with people at uni, I must be a fuckboy, and honestly, I believe it. I don't understand what is wrong with me.

I am a person who has always been against cheating, but I've been having terrible thoughts that genuinely keep me up, has her introducing me to her parents after 2 weeks made it harder to be honest? Because I like her parents a lot. She deserves a lot better than me, but I can't tell her that because she will take it as me being insecure about my physical appearance. But I have no problem with how I look. In fact, I like how I look. I just hate what's inside, because I have no clue where to start.

I also don't want to leave because I want to prove that I am not a bad person, I have already led her on, but if I leave then I become that person, and if I don't then I am that person. What do I do? I know it's stupid but it's made me feel like it'd be better if I wasn't here anymore, but I don't want this post to be validation seeking or anything, I just want advice. Or even someone who has been like or felt like this to tell me how they got through it. Am I alone?",11Jan2020,1
568,"I’m probably a hypochondriac because I’m one of those people that starts feeling paranoia about getting an illness after I learn about it. I struggle with myself on this and have managed to avoid convincing myself I have cancer when I google symptoms, and mostly don’t google symptoms at all. However, I find myself laying in bed almost every night hyper fixated on whatever slight pain I might be feeling while my mind works itself up thinking about all the life threatening things that pain could be. 
I’ve developed a few ways to calm myself to sleep, but those techniques are dependent on me going to sleep. So on the off chance that I work myself up during the day, I don’t have any way of getting around it right now. My most recent daytime illness anxiety is my teeth: I went through a rough time a year or so ago as well as about 6 years ago when my hygiene was bad, which resulted in cavities and general poor oral hygiene. I’ve fixed my routine and brush/floss daily but I can’t see a dentist right now. Meaning I need to see a dentist and am slowly working towards that, but for the time being I’m stuck with just brushing and flossing and hoping for the best. 
The hoping for the best part isn’t working out as of late, and sometimes during my day if my tongue brushes on a rough tooth or I become aware of my teeth at all, I start hyper fixating. My mind goes from “man, I really need to see a dentist” to “I bet that’s a cavity right there behind that tooth where I can’t see it” to “I bet all my teeth have cavities and need to be pulled or worse” to “I probably have some deep enough that they mess up my bones” to “my jaw is rotting or filled with disease and I’m gonna die or have to have surgery on my whole mouth” until I’m unable to focus on work and worried to death about my teeth. I don’t look up info on oral health and facts because I’m worried I’ll find something my anxiety fixes on rather than assurance that I’m fine. I also don’t feel pain in any teeth but rather just a feeling of awareness: I can feel my tooth as if its in pain but it doesn’t really hurt. It feels like a wild leap from cavity to jaw surgery, I know, and I fight with myself about it and about how I need to let it go a little until I’m able to get them checked. Like, reasoning with myself that I’m allowed to worry about it when I know what I should be worried about. But I can’t get a handle on that slippery slope and it’s bumming me out. 
Is there anything I could do in those moments (something I can do at work, at home, or when I’m in a car) that will help me regain focus and relax a little? I only know of two methods that are for avoiding anxiety attacks but they don’t feel as effective for this (methods are focus on the physical world around you to ground yourself and one I have for myself which is signing the alphabet/words in ASL until I’ve calmed down).

I still go back to Germany every other summer for months at a time. I strongly identify with being German, because I am. I don’t have an American citizenship, but a green card. 

In Germany my being German is never questioned. People are never surprised to know that I am German, but in America people question it. I am in Highschool now and I have had students ask me, “How are you German? You don’t look German?”.  They just assume German is synonymous with white.

I don’t look exclusively African-American or European. I clearly look mixed race, but I have had someone tell me that I can’t possibly be European, because of the African roots I have in me. This was from a white American.  They told me that I am not European and only black. It seems that a lot of Americans believe in the one drop rule even now. That is outdated and quite frankly perpetuates racism. He didn’t want me to be a part of his European culture just because I am mixed.

579,"Hi all. I still don't have all the facts on what's happened, so I apologize if the story seems kind of fragmented. 



Basically, my parents (~60 m&amp;f, I am 19) have been married for ~20 years. My dad has anger issues but has generally been a very good father who has always seemed emotionally intelligent and mature.


The day after Christmas, they announced to my sibling and I that they were getting a divorce, and we found out my dad has been having an affair for probably a year or more, including taking his mistress on lavish vacations out of the country while we thought he was on business trips or out with his friends. 


Basically, he thinks he's justified. He has convinced himself that because he was unhappy in his marriage it was okay to lie to us and have a girlfriend, and nothing in the world can convince him otherwise. He was genuinely surprised that my sibling and I were upset with him. He treats my mom like shit (they still live together b/c the divorce isn't final), antagonizing her if he's not straight-up ignoring her. He has even threatened to tell my sibling and I about my mom's private childhood trauma in retaliation when my mom told me about the vacations he'd taken his mistress on (that he had failed to mention), which I think is despicable. He feels absolutely no guilt, regret, or sorrow for what he's done, and I'm certain if he could go back and do it all over again, he would. 


I feel like I can't ever heal my relationship with him if he doesn't even believe he's done anything wrong. He's a very smart man in every other respect, but it feels like no matter how much I try and explain to him how absolutely wrong he was and how much it's hurt us, it doesn't get through to him or maybe he just doesn't care. Please, I am in so much pain trying to navigate dealing with a father who I previously looked up to and respected so much but now is wrapped up so deep in his own selfish delusion that I feel like I can't even talk to him.


 I cannot make it clear enough how absolutely out of character this was for a man I thought was kind and had a good heart. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Does anyone know how to deal with someone who is convinced they're in the right when they're clearly not?

It escalated quickly. At the beginning of December, I end up driving over there and we hooked up. It was sort of awkward since we literally had only hung out like a few minutes at the bar in August, but there was no denying the sexual chemistry.

I was just about to move on and say forget this crap when He finally tells me that he is trying to secure a new job that would have him moving out of state and he doesn’t want to get too attached or have to deal with any relationship type drama, but proceeds to say “but we can have fun still if that’s allowed” So I went over there last week and we hook up again. This time is a whole different situation though, way less awkward, he’s super sweet, we talked a lot more and got to know each other a bit. When I go home, he goes back to not really talking again. I’m super confused and can feel myself getting attached and he’s gorgeous and so sweet when I’m there, but after I leave I feel like shit. Meanwhile, yes I still have the asshole bf which is another story for another time. Idk what I should do with this situation. I love when I’m over there but stressed big time when I leave. It’s definitely the weirdest situation I’ve been in, I have never slept around before this or like this. I’m just confused. Thanks.",11Jan2020,1
583,"So in a couple of weeks i have 1 week of vacation.
Last year I was attending university and my girlfriend was still in high school, this caused us to not be able to spend much time together that week, so I figured i would join my parents on their holiday, I also promised my GF we will go on a holiday next year (which is this year obv), but then my parents wanted to turn this vacation into a yearly thing, because we don't see each other that much anymore due to university.

So here i am, i have a week (fri-mon), my girlfriend wants to do a city trip and my parents want me to join them on their vacation. I really want to try to combine both: i would want to try to take my girlfriend to a city from friday till tuesday and then join my parents from wednesday till sunday, but my parents don't manage to find a hotel from wednesday till sunday.

My parents are now thinking of booking a hotel from sunday untill thursday, but my girlfriend has to work the weekend, which will end up us not seeing each other.

What do i do now?? I feel like i have to disappoint one of the parties in this conflict and i feel really bad about letting down my girlfriend, but also feel really bad to let down my parents. Is there any way i would be able to contact a hotel or something to combine it? Do i choose between my parents or my girlfriend? I'm clueless.",11Jan2020,1
584,"Hello, Redditors

So me and my ""friend"" got into a really big fight and she recently ""apologized"" to me about it. The thing is I feel like the apology isn't genuine because

1. She texted me and my other friend an almost identical apology at the same time
2. She doesn't fully recognize how in the wrong she is

So I need someone with no bias towards each person to ""evaluate"" the apology""

586,"My parents have discriminated against me just for my age ever since I was 12. I'm now 15, and it's specifically been my father who has been like this. He treats me as if I am out doing drugs, smoking, or constantly having sex with no background to provide evidence. Genuinely, I haven't done any of that. I'm forced to my house, not allowed to go outside for even a simple walk because he believe's I'll sneak off to do whatever. 

Anyway, I as of recently got my first boyfriend. Him and I have been dating for months, and I'm really happy with him. I feel the love that my father hasn't been able to provide me these last few years. But, when him and I first started dating I asked him if we could keep this relationship from our parents. 

His parents were fine with any relationships, and I wouldn't mind if they knew. However, I do understand that if they knew, eventually my father would be told by his parents. 
Well, eventually we got careless. His mum found out about us, and kept it a secret for months as part of my request. But, my mum saw my boyfriend and I kissing and that's when it started.

She told my dad.

My dad decided to freak out, and hates the idea of him now. He always made it a point to assume whatever guy I hung out with, I have obviously had sex with. I'm a virgin. He blew up in my face saying that whenever I'm with him, all I do is fuck him and that's all he wants out of me.

I really feel as if I should leave him because I don't want my father to ridicule my every moment with him. However, I also really enjoy his company, and he's made me better as a person. I feel loved and cared for, and don't wanna leave his presence.

587,"I'm looking to take up an internship over the Spring semester, and my University has very strict (but very vague) requirements for what would qualify for school credits.

The first one I'm looking at is working for the campaign of a state-level incumbent senator with virtually no competition. They haven't been explicit in regards to telling me what the internship requires and I'm not sure if the work they'll need me to do will qualify for credit...but I'd imagine it would look good on a resume.

The second one is working for the promotional team of a mental health focused non-profit org. They've been very upfront with what I'll need to do (essentially promoting and bringing on sponsors for their various events), it seems like work that will qualify for school credits, and the hours look fantastic. However I'm not entirely sure how well it would look on a resume compared to the senatorial gig.

I suppose what I'm looking for is something that will have long-term benefits, but ultimately I'm unsure what both will offer considering that my ultimate aspirations (being a university professor) don't line up with either field. But which seems like the better option?",11Jan2020,1
588,"I’m on my phone so please excuse any errors. I apologize in advanced as this is long and maybe be a bit convoluted due to being on my phone.

I need some outside perspectives on this situation that just isn’t sitting right with me.

I started working for this blind elderly man. His other caregiver was a bit strange when I met her but not red flag strange just odd. She was in charge of looking for another caregiver. As I started working little things would start to strike me as odd. One time I was cooking him soup and suddenly had to go to the bathroom. I thought the burner was low enough that it wouldn’t matter if I stepped away for a few minutes. When I came back some of the soup had burned to the bottom of the pot. In hindsight I should have turned it off but it’s just soup so I made another can and apologized to the man about my mistake. Only happened that one time. The next shift there was a note from his other caregiver telling me that I can’t be burning his food and I need to be paying better attention when I’m cooking. 🙄 From my perspective it was an accident and was a one time issue. I could see if I was constantly burning his food but I wasn’t. I just kind of brushed it off thinking maybe a previous caregiver was always burning his food or something and that’s where this came from. Then a few shifts after that I get another note left for me telling me not to use the silicone spatula when getting the soup out of the can. Apparently when I did this it made a very small scratch/surface slice on the spatula. It wasn’t a huge or deep slice by any means. I was told to pour the milk in the can and swish it around to get the remaining soup out. I feel this is a little ridiculous but I stop using the spatula and just use a spoon instead but pass on the whole swishing milk in the can because it’s a stupid idea that will take too long with the thick condensed soups. 

Time goes on and there is a lot of downtime. Besides cooking his meals I do some light housework. Wash and put away dishes, wipe down the toilet and sink in bathroom, sweep and mop kitchen floors, vacuum occasionally if it’s needed (we discussed a schedule for this) put away his compression socks, make his bed, deal with his medication, take out the trash. I work a full time job and this is just 2 days a week for me but my shifts are on days I work my full time job so sometimes I’m exhausted and I also have ADHD so I would occasionally forget to do something or not notice something needed to be done. It wasn’t often and I was never trying to intentionally not do my job. When I started I was never given a set list of what to do everyday so I mimicked from previous jobs of this nature and certain things I was specifically told. There is a sheet of what needs to be done but it says “as needed”. When I’m done cleaning and making his food I’ll sit in a recliner and read or play a game on my phone or talk with the gentleman. There’s a cover on the recliner so it’s noticeable when I recline in it because the cover comes untucked (this come up later). While talking with this man about life and whatever he tells me how he met this woman and that she basically forced herself into this mans life. The day she met him she offered him a ride home from the universal church they were at because she supposedly lived near him. He told me that he initially declined the offer but she insisted and basically wouldn’t take no for an answer. She has been in his life since and is his full time caretaker. He says she’s a “god send” and he doesn’t know what he would do without her. When he first told me that I didn’t think much of it.

A couple weeks ago a note was left informing me that the mans food was cold when he sat down to eat and that I need to do better with timing my meals for him. She also ask me to dust the TV stand because it’s a magnet for dust and dusting is on the care plan since *it’s obvious I have no problems sitting around with my feet up*. The TV stand was not that dusty but I wipes it down with a damp cloth, no big deal. Now, I felt that comment about not having a problem sitting around with my feet up was rude and passive aggressive and uncalled for since I do regular cleaning on every shift and when some is said to be done “as necessary” it leaves it open for interpretation to what that actually means. The note also reprimanded me for leaving during my shift on two previous shifts. When I left it was with the permission of the older man. He doesn’t require 24/7 care and he only gets 50 hours of paid help per week. Both times I left I stayed later to compensate the time I was gone and I didn’t get paid while I was gone. Both instances were to run and grab food because I was held up at my day job and didn’t have time to grab something before the start of my shift. Needless to say this note upset me because 1) The food was cold because the client decided to continue listening to his audio book and didn’t tell me. I always prepared his meals to be ready at a certain time that he had to take his medicine in the kitchen and this worked out well. Plus he never told me the food was cold or else I would have quickly heated it back up for him. 2) The comment about sitting around with my feet up implied to me that I wasn’t doing anything on my shift and that I’m not allowed to sit down. 3) I was specifically told I could leave to go get food. In fact, previously the man said I could leave to run to the store and see if they had something I was talking about needing but I declined because it wasn’t important. I ended up having a discussion with the man I work for and explained to him that it’s not fair to me to go and complain that his food is cold to the other caregiver without first telling me so I could fix it and that I’m not a mind reader who is going to magically know when he is going to take his medicine late because he wants to listen to his books. He agreed that if his food is cold he should be telling me but he said it wasn’t really a big deal because his food is usually warm a I do a good job preparing it for him. He said that when he mentioned it to the other caregiver it wasn’t a complaint just a response to some questions she was asking him. Apparently, she always asks him how his meal was and what I do all evening during my shift. She basically probes him for information about me and what I’m doing while I’m there. She’s asked him if I do any cleaning and he responds that he hears me come in and sit down and sometimes he hears me recline in the chair (it’s old and loud) and that’s it. I’m going to remind you here that *he’s blind* so he can’t actually see what I’m doing but because he can’t hear me wipe down a counter or mop a floor or wash dishes 3 rooms back I must not be doing anything but sitting in a chair with my feet up?? I also talked with him about putting together a set list of housework he wants me to do either every shift or 1x week so that nothing was left up to interpretation. I also discussed how it isn’t fair that he said I could leave and now I’m getting this note reprimanding me about it. He said it didn’t bother him, especially since both times I stayed later to compensate for the 10-20 minutes I was gone. He also doesn’t understand why it’s a big deal because if he’s going to fall it will more than likely happen when no one is there anyway because he has to do everything himself when he doesn’t have care. I remind him how the other caregiver took off for almost a week with very short notice leaving him without care for several days and that me leaving, with his approval, wasn’t a big deal but that I won’t do it anymore.

Now this is where red flags start flying. In this discussion I was explaining how I need more autonomy in how I do things because the other caregiver is coming across very controlling and micromanaging by telling me to do things a specific way. He immediately responds that *he knows she’s very controlling* and that she can get “short” at times. He said she apparently is always telling him how to do stuff but on very rare occasions he will assert himself to do something his way. She never lets him do anything on his own and insists on doing it for him and stating that it’s her job to do these things. At this point I’m thinking about how unhealthy the other caregivers behavior is and how controlling she is. This is a huge red flag because this is a sign of emotional abuse. I ended up sending this a woman a text message asking for her to not leave me rude and passive aggressive notes and that prior I’ve always gotten the impression that she’s a nice lady and that I’d like to maintain that impression of her and went into explaining all the cleaning I do, how I time the meals to be ready when he almost always takes his evening medication, and that when I left I stayed to compensate the time along with mentioning how one day I stayed almost an hour extra because he wanted to tell me a story and I didn’t get paid because the client only has so many billable hours. Now, it’s important to note that the client is my boss, not this other caregiver. What he says is the final say. 

On my next shift my client tells me that he wants me to start making his meals once he gets into the kitchen to take his medicine so that they are always warm for him. I think that this is not only ridiculous because his kitchen is small and he would be in my way but that it goes against the simple solution we discussed the previous shift that he would just communicate to me if he wanted to eat later or if he forgets and his food is cold that I will come in and reheat it for him. I ask him if this is what he wants or what the other caregiver wants. He responds that it’s the other caregiver. I tell him I’m not going to do that because it would make cooking his meals more difficult because he would be in my way and that we already discussed he would just tell me if it was cold and I would reheat it. I expressed that I wasn’t happy that the other caregiver keeps trying to control everything I do and make my job harder than it needs to be. I stated that I would put in my 2 week notice if it continues because I don’t appreciate being treated this way and that her controlling  and passive aggressive behavior is ridiculous and borderlines abuse. Later that evening I send the other caregiver another text message telling her that I appreciate her suggestion on how to time the meals but that I was going to continue preparing them my ways since it’s simple and he almost always has a warm meal and that he very occasional times he takes longer to get into the kitchen and his food has cooled I would simply reheat his food and that this was already discussed and agreed upon. The next shift everything is fine we chat as usual then I prepare his food and clean the living room while he eats then clean the kitchen after he’s returned to the living room. The an hour before my shift ends the other caregiver shows up and basically coaches him into firing me. She has no authority to fire me only the client does. I really don’t think he wanted to fire me and that she manipulated him into it because I was asserting healthy boundaries and would let her control me. 

Now, I honestly don’t care about being fired because I had started looking for something else because of this woman’s bullshit but I genuinely worried and concerned for this man. I also noticed one time when I was logging in his audio books that he has $4-5k in debt logged in the same book. I only saw this because the paper clip wasn’t in for the page where we log the audio books and I saw it looking for that page. Now this guy doesn’t have anything remotely worth any value in his home. His laptop is like 10yrs old, his tv is like an old “15 computer monitor, nothing fancy, everything in his house is basically dated. I know it’s totally a stretch to think there might be financial shenanigans happening but something with this other caregiver just doesn’t sit right with me based on her behavior towards me and what the client told me about her. He also doesn’t see his family ever despite them living in the area.

Does all of this seem off to anyone else?",11Jan2020,1

Fast forward to this past week, i was home for christmas break from school and home alone one evening, around 7-8. My brother and sister were both at friends’ houses, and my mom was at the gym. No clue where my dad is. We had recently decided as a family to turn on our locations for  each other. I check everyones location and my siblings and mom are where they should be, but my dad is in a city about 30 minutes away at a random apartment complex, in an area that he doesnt frequent too often. I decided to give the benefit of the doubt. Until earlier this week, my sister headed back to school. So like any brother, i checked her location to make sure she made it back ok and i see that my dads location hadnt been updated in nearly a week. I think hes turned his location off.

I’m a Junior with a 3.44 GPA at a somewhat prominent business university in New Hampshire and have been applying to *literally* over one hundred internships on Handshake. 

I’ve received three responses - all from insurance companies - including Northwestern Mutual. However, after three interviews with NM, I found out they basically wanted me to sell insurance to my closest friends and relatives. That for ME is a big no no. The last thing I want to do is involve my business and career goals with my relationships with friends and family, as this could be seen as kinda shitty. 

However, if I drop the opportunities with these insurance companies, I don’t have anyone else. My family doesn’t have a whole lot of contacts and I’ve exhausted my options on Handshake.  I won’t bother with Indeed.com as I’ve already tried them for years with no success. So here I am, disappointed and discouraged with far too much drive to quit.

604,"Hi fellow Redditors,

I have been considering launching a delivery service in my home country that would allow my fellow countryman buy products on Amazon (/Prime) UK for cheap and quick delivery (if successful the aim would be to expand to couple other big platforms). The reason I the choose UK is because I live here now (studied and now works in finance in London) 

Ordering for items online is very popular back home (18-35 yrs) but the key problem is that delivery is costly and it takes time. Secondly this will give my people access to a wider range, better quality products at a reasonable price compared to ordering online at current costs or buying it locally (if available at all).

My idea is to rent a 'Warehouse' in London, give that address to people ordering from home to ship to, and then I ship it to them via another Warehouse which I will rent locally close to the airport back home. My thinking was to find an arrangement  with a commercial aircraft that flies frequently to my country to deliver packages for me to the warehouse once a week. It will be as if I am just checking in  some suitcases in a plane on a weekly basis. I am basically trying to bypass traditional post offices. 

I understand there are other important considerations such as import duties and other local taxes, forming a legal entity, scan goods for content and ensure conforms to rules and regs and so on but let's ignore this for now. 

Do you think this is feasible and what would be the best way to go around doing this?

Are you aware of other companies offering such services in other less developed countries? Myus.com I know offers a similar service for international buyers importing goods from the US. 

I am very confident of the market demand home after a survey I did with my brother. I choose not to mention the country but the population is only about 1.5 million with internet access (+computer litetacy) in most homes.

606,"2.5 years ago I was dating my first boyfriend who I fell head over heels for. I was 24 and he was so obviously not into me but I was too stupid to know. Being brought up conservative messed with me so I didn’t date until I met him despite having great guys approach me. It’s just a shame when I was ready I met such a douche. 


I was too head over heels to tell him I was waiting for marriage to have sex as I didn’t want to turn him off. This is something I was brought up to do - be with one man only after wedlock. 
You only ever wanted to get drunk so that’s all we did. But that night. That night in May. After getting drunk I don’t know why but I told you to get a condom and we had sex for the first time. You didn’t even hold me after. We broke up shortly after and I’ve cried ever since. 
To erase the bad experience I started sleeping with someone from work. 


And then I met my now current wonderful boyfriend a year ago. He’s the most wonderful person and I feel so bad for not waiting for him. We speak about marriage all the time and it hurts that I won’t and haven’t  been able to give him my first time. He’s the only man to ever love me back and he’s the only one who deserved to have such intimate moments with me.

612,"Months ago I had a disagreement with a teacher. One of our test there was an Essay part and I answered it like a normal essay. During the checking I got zero on the essay because this is his reason ""This is a special essay because we are a history subject and the answer must me word for word from the book and if you got the wrong words then your answer is wrong""    


so I retaliated with ""But sir it will an Identification type of question already sir and not an Essay""   


he answered immediately ""As ive said, We are in history class and you cannot change history so the essay must be word for word from the book""   
\-""But Sir...""  
\-""Don't fuck with me mister""  


So I just shut my mouth because I know arguing to this dumb teacher will be pointless but then later on I realized despite the situation I got low grades on his subject.

613,"Hello everyone, first of all I'd like to clarify that English isn't my native language, so I'm sorry in advance if I make any mistakes.

I'm a girl in my mid teens and my mother isn't really the nicest person alive, so to speak. She's sort of a perfectionist, so she expects a lot from me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind it at all, in fact I'm glad that she cares about me so much, but sometimes the way she expresses her expectations to me isn't really something I feel comfortable with. She's been nagging me about my weight since I was 13. Back then I've tarted getting REALLY insecure, I actually thought I was fat back then, looking back; and judging by my pictures from when I was younger: I was not fat, at all. Also I'm not trying to fat-shame or anything like that, I think fat people can look beautiful, just like everyone else, I just don't like myself as much as I'd like to. Currently I actually am chubby, but I've started fasting and exercising a bit (I've lost 3 kilos already and I'm proud of myself, so I needed to brag about that here), hopefully I'll get to my goal.

Now the problem is that when she mentions my weight, she does it in a very offensive manner, once I made her angry because I stayed too long in my room getting ready to go out, so she called me ""a fat swine"". On top of that I got beaten up, so that's a great experience. Once she even said that she's ashamed to be seen with me, that she's ashamed to be my mother etc. She's just too honest, but I know she has good intentions so it's hard for me to hate her, the thing is just that sometimes she makes me very sad. Recently my mom even pointed out that I lost a bit of weight, so it just made me super happy, but of course she couldn't be too nice about it, so she said ""you need to lose more"", like I didn't know that already. 

I want to know how to politely tell her that the things she says to me affect me more than she thinks?",11Jan2020,1

617,"I am 16(M) and I know that by the title most of you will say ""NO"" or ""Just forget her and move on"". I know, I know. But here is the situation. She broke up with me with one of the main reasons being that our convos didn't go really well and she thought we didn't have much to talk about. I didn't really understand before I thought about it and it made snese - we were missing the funny convos and all the jokes and stuff we made BEFORE we got together. That, I am pretty sure, is shat she was missing. It might sound stupid but those casual chats lasted till 1-4 AM and were the majn reason we got together. She misses these. There was another reason I can't really explain but I am working on that too. So here is my idea:

I don't want to get my head fully focused on this and I don't wanna get high hopes for us getting back together. What I will do is I will chat with here like before. We broke up fairly soon, like 5 days ago so it is pretty fresh. One of the days after we broke up I texted her (cause we both agreed on being good friends and casually chatting like I mentioned earlier) to see how she is doing and told her if she wants to chat she can text me later. I didn't want to pressure her. And later she did text me. I was surprised as I didn't expect to kick things off that fast after a break up so it is a positive. We texted till 1 AM and it was one of those silly casual chats we used to have. And I actually found out I missed that too. 

I will act like this - I will keep those casual texts going for a while and see how things turn out. If they are lasting for long, I mean if the convo just doesn't go well I will drop things. If they do I will eventually ask her out so we can talk. First time we got out just the 2 of us I kissed her and we got together. If things go well and we go out, I dunno if I will kiss her but I will talk with her about us getting together. If she rejects, we remain friends and we move forward. If she accepts, I will fix my mistakes and try not to repeat them.

I keep chasing this girl not because I miss the intimacy, or because I am lonely or bored but because I actually love her and she is really important to me. And this might sound stupid but my intuition is telling me to not give up.

What are your thoughts? Just to clarify - me and this girl (16) have a good bond and our relationship lasted 1 year and 5 months with no toxicity whatsoever. We broke up without any drama and had no problems, no drama. So blocking her off everywhere and all that stuff is not gonna happen, even if she rejects me.",11Jan2020,1

I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out.

He got my social media and does the same thing.  Everytime the weekend comes around, he texts me to hang out. I try to push it out and say Im busy, but then he plans ahead asks about another time, giving me a specifc date. I dont have much in common with him. Our interests are polar opposites.  I know I sound like an asshole but I need to tell him somehow that I'm not that interested. He sent me a message as I was typing this asking me to go to his house. I have not replied yet.

I told him no. Now, originally, he had also asked my parents for €20 (for a total of forty euros) but they declined, and he left them alone about it.
However, he keeps pestering me and trying to “persuade” me (mostly just saying please a lot) and he knows it annoys me. He refuses to stop bringing it up.
I asked him if he wanted to *borrow* 20 euros (no interest obv), but he said no, that was not the point. He just says: “I have enough money to buy it, but I don’t want to use it so I’m asking you”.

I do a tremendous amount of work and have improved many processes throughout the department. I’ve also improved communication and morale significantly. While I get continuously recognized for this by other departments and other leaders, I never hear anything from my boss (or his boss, for that matter). It’s like no matter what I do, he refuses to acknowledge that I count, that I matter. He makes everything about him and brings everything back to him. 

To top it all off, I have taught him a huge amount, in both hard and soft skills. But all he’s done is taken that knowledge to advance and benefit himself, claiming it all as his own, as if he feels entitled to everything that I produce.

622,"Hey everyone, I'm sorry if this isn't the perfect subreddit for this, but I hope to get some opinions. This is something that's been going around in my head for years, but I never dared talk to anyone about it because its a bit embarrassing and I don't want them to think badly of my grandpa.

I (29F) grew up with my grandparents (80M and 77F). All in all it was a happy childhood. My grandma stayed home to take care of me and the household, my grandpa was gone all day for work.
Sometimes when I was in primary school, on the weekend, I would cuddle in bed with my grandpa, lying in top of him. I remember sometimes seeing the head of his penis stick out of the top of his underwear or pajama pants or whatever he wore; in hindsight, I would say he probably had an erection. I would point it out to him and I assume he covered it up then - I can't remember. This didn't happen often, I don't think, but it was also not an isolated incident.

Is this weird? I feel super silly asking this, but it has been bothering me for a long time. I get that men get erections in the morning, but my partner also manages to keep it in his pants, but maybe those pants were super loose... I just really don't know.

Apart from that, there was never any sketchy behaviour that I can remember except for once. I went on a holiday with my grandpa when I was around 15 and we slept in one bed. One night it was super hot and I feel like he was naked and touching himself, facing me. But it was dark and I was not sure, but it scared me. Maybe this was completely harmless.

I'm sorry for this confused post. TLDR: my grandpa sometimes had a visible erections sticking out if his pants when I cuddled with him in the morning when I was a little girl. Is that normal?",11Jan2020,1

625,"Hi, 26F here. I work full time in the insurance industry, typical 9-5 I accepted a second (part time) job at a private school around 4 months ago, working nights and weekends in the main office. I needed to alleviate my student loan debt, and the job seemed perfect. The pay was excellent, the gig was easy (I can read on the job and basically sit on my phone. All I do is monitor the phones and keep track of students coming and going), and I was ASSURED I would be given full weekends off at least once a month, in addition to rarely, if ever, being scheduled more than 20 hours a week. I was told to expect around 10-12 hours, as the shifts would be split amongst a team of 4 people. This seemed like a reasonable amount,  so I accepted. 

Fast forward 4 months, and this job is taking over my life. If I’m not there Friday, I’m there Saturday/Sunday. Not there Saturday, I’m there Sunday and Friday. You get the picture. This is in addition to at least one,  but usually two, weeknight shifts. Obviously, this is more than 10 hours a week. We are understaffed, and my boss will not hire a 4th for reasons that are too lengthy to really get into here. I’m exhausted. Haven’t seen my friends. Haven’t seen my family. Can’t have any kind of romantic life. 

The issue is, if I leave, I’m really screwing over my boss and other coworkers. Big time. They don’t have coverage, they don’t have help. My contract is up in June (will not be renewing). I would feel really awful leaving them in the lurch. At the same time, I am not sure the onus is on me to carry this team. If the hours were more manageable I’d suck it up but the thought of giving up another 5 months worth of weekends is unbearable. I’m at a loss here. Any advice?

TL;DR - took a second job and was told it’d only be 10 hours a week. It’s usually more like 20-30. It’s taking over my life and I want to quit but we’re severely understaffed. If I leave I would really be screwing good people over. I’m conflicted as to what I should do.",11Jan2020,1

I’ve been friends with this guy for over a year now and we’ve had a strange relationship. We both liked each other at first and we went on a date but it didn’t really work out. Between the time frame of then and now he’s dated two other girls while I have stayed single. During the periods where he was single I have always heard rumors from friends that he still liked me, but I always denied liking him back.

We just decided to start a friends with benefits type situation on the low. We have good chemistry but we just can’t manage to date well.

627,"So i recently got my first job out of college. I do a lot of different things and im very busy. I was given very little training and oversight as this is a small company. But i prepared reports for clients, help the financial analyst with looking over account transfers, gather statements for insurance and annuities, make sure theyre healthy, update information for clients, open account paperwork, and the list goes on. 

I've been struggling with the account paperwork because i have to many things to do in a day and ive been trying to ca and get statements while doing paperwork. Most the mistakes were small (missing middle initial, phone numbersmissing dashes), but they were frustrating the lady who was checking it, so i started just doing them alone and the last one i gave was perfect, though i have 6 more and it takes so much time the other tasks need to be moved back. 

I also missed an account in one of my reports for the first time and that made me look really bad. In my defense,  ive only been there 6 weeks and the guy had like 12 accounts.

Well they posted a picture and i wanted to see it so i googled they organizations name and i noticed they posted and closed a job post on LinkedIn in the last 5 days. It is 100% my position. They haven't said anything and theyre still teaching me new stuff and getting things ready for they future, etc. 

Im in ""probation"" until i hit 3 months. So the only thing i can think besides theyre firing me is they're preparing for me leaving or deciding against me after my 3 months is up. 

I could tell i was annoying them with questions and with paperwork mistakes, but i really dont know what they expect. Ive used old paperworks as templates and they have mistakes on them. I know they arent as perfect as they make themselves out. But i dont really defend myself because its not really productive to be like ""oh this old paperwork is wrong, so bleh"" like a kid. 

Now i want to know what yall think i should do. Do i start job searching? Do i ask them about it? Do i defend my mistakes? Im really frustrated. I know ive made silly mistakes but i am very new and i am handling multiple tasks from multiple people who do not know what i am working with all the time with the others, etc etc.

We’re both in college so for winter break I went home and didn’t see him for a bit, and I sort of realized I didnt really want anything and I sort of wasn’t interested, so I grew distant and he continuously texted me over and over again. When I came back it kept escalating to the point where he saw me in real life and started talking to me so I decided to be upfront and apologize if he felt I was leading him on but that I was in a different place now and I was no longer interested. He responded very kindly. 
However since that day I had noticed he had been posting extremely alarming things on his twitter account, I am not narcissistic enough to believe his suicidal thoughts are because of me, but the timing makes me feel the need to do something. He recently tweeted something that was blatantly suicidal, and I am sort of at a loss.

Meanwhile, I'm always wondering if they're alive or dead since they're not talking to me...and I have to wonder if it's something I did or didn't do...and if it's not...if we were as close as they said we were, then why won't they talk to me about what's going on with them?",11Jan2020,1

643,"I (f18) have been friends with a girl (17) for about four years throughout high school. Now I'm not sure if I should even call what we have a friendship. We do not text at all, only small stuff like ""are you coming to [class] tomorrow?"" or stuff like that. We never meet in the afternoon and never go out together.

But when we're together in school, it really feels like we're best friends. We have inside jokes together, laugh together and spend all major breaks (breakfast and lunch) together. But when school ends, we basically go no contact again. It's not that we suddenly hate each other, we just don't talk, but when we meet the next day, it's like we've never been apart at all. 

We will graduate in May and I wonder if we will stay friends after graduation.

644,"Hello, 
This lady is helpful to do paperwork and part of her job is freelancing. Recently she started to hang out with the same online groups that are available in the city. Most of the people are young (20-30) tourists like myself.  Claiming that she is looking for clients. Part of me understands because she is never married nor have kids so she thinks she can hang out and act young with people half her age. 

I feel uncomfortable whenever she asks me to hangout in those groups and I made the mistake to introduce her to one of those groups that she is now all over the app now. I dont feel comfortable around her hanging out with me or me talking about my life style around her. Obviously because she is super conservative and I am a liberal homosexual. I want to keep our relationship to limits of business only just not to get deep into social discussions.

646,"Hey y’all,

Posting here because this is a new one for me... ok so, I was traveling (I’m a 28/f) and I ended up in a bar late before going back to the hotel. Ended up striking up a conversation with another girl there. She was sweet, even if she’s kind of one of these people where you can’t seem to get a word in. We ended up talking for awhile, and she walked back to the hotel with me before jumping in an Uber. Before she left, we exchanged numbers and said we should hang out sometime if we’re ever in the same area (we live in the same state, but on different ends.)

Well... she’s a chronic texter. And I’m anything but. She’ll text at least once a day, and I’m just not into heavy texting unless we’ have a close relationship. If I do text back, it’ll be a barrage of texts. Not to mention that with my job and my ADD, I tend to forget to text back or be so tired that I procrastinate on it. My friends all get that, I go from radio silence for a week to texting 5 memes in a row with the ones I’m close to. 

She’s also an oversharer. We hung out for 2 hours, and she’s already told me a lot of personal details about her family that make me a little uncomfortable. Not to mention she’s already texted about wanting to travel together! But I’m having a hard time because I tend to be an empath and I can kind of sense that she’s lonely? That’s just the vibe I get, that she needs a friend. 

I mean here’s the thing. I’m an introverted, codependent people pleaser who has been thrust into a friendship with an extrovert who appears to have jump started a casual friendship into BFF territory when we haven’t even spent the time equivalent of one Lord of the Rings movie together. I have no idea how to tell her “Hey back off” without hurting her feelings which I don’t want to do. And I wouldn’t mind being friends with her! I just... need it to go slower. I need her to give me space. Haaaaalp.",11Jan2020,1

649,"I really messed up and have no clue how to proceed. Twice a year every employee at my job must electronically fill out a pdf file and submit it to HR. It's located in a shared drive, that all the employees can access. Basically everything in the drive is shared (files, folders, etc). It was 15 minutes before I got off and as I was sitting at my desk I decided to fill out the form (they're due in a week). 

I filled it out and without thinking I saved the file overwriting the original with all my information when I should have pressed ""save as"". This pdf contained private information so in a panic I deleted the pdf from the shared folder, not thinking anything of it. When I went into the Recycle Bin it was no where to be found. I began panicking even more and looked everywhere for it. I grabbed my phone and began Googling how to get it back, and if anyone will know I deleted it. 

Obviously it was a complete accident, but it's such an important document and deleting something in general does not fly in a professional environment. I'm new to this job, but that doesn't make it okay. I have no clue what to do. I told myself to stay quiet in case saying something will get me fired, or written up, and luckily we don't work Fridays so I wasn't there yesterday. I've been on the verge of a panic attack over this. I'm so nervous. 

According to google shared folders, files, etc do not show who deleted anything or made changes, but I'm still on edge someone in IT will be able to figure it out. I really don't know what to do. My gut is telling me to not say or do anything, but part of me thinks I should act like I went to fill out the file and it was gone, honestly I don't even know.",11Jan2020,1

So like the title says, I really have a hard time showing emotions. Its just something I am not comfortable doing. My wife has pointed out that many times I am like a flat lined heart monitor, and that she can not tell if I am really happy or just acting happy. I never show sadness, and in all my years I can not remember the last time I cried but it has to have been in grade school. My wife pointed out that its not healthy to not express what I feel and that emotions are a good part of life. I guess I have just been ""mono-mood"" as my kids call it, for so long.

651,"I know this sounds really dumb, but my life has become hectic again and I’m having trouble keeping track of my AirPods. 
 
I bought them for myself at the end of last semester because I got all A’s even though it was a really, REALLY stressful few months. 
 
*Usually I’m very good at keeping track of my things. I always put things in the same place (keys on my dresser, glasses on my night stand, shoes under my bookshelf, you get it).* But now that my life is back to me: going to class, going into the studio at random times for unknown &amp; inconsistent hours, spending 2 nights at my boyfriend’s house, then back to mine, going to friend’s houses, etc etc. I’ve found it difficult to keep track of only one thing: my AirPods. 
 
I know they have a “Find My” feature, but this seems to only want to work sometimes (in relation to it making the noise), and the visual-GPS feature is useless if they’re lost in a messy room (my bf’s room usually). It’s nice to know that they are indeed in his room, but means nothing when his room is very messy/dirty and there’s piles of clothes and things everywhere. 
 
They already have a bright blue water-protective case. Is there anything else I can do? Should I make “their place” somewhere I always have on me, like my backpack? Would it be dumb to keep them on my keys? (The case has a key chain thing on it, so I could snap them to my lanyard).

So there’s a group chat with 4 others in it. I will give them numbers so guy 1, guy2, guy3, and guy4. I am also a girl in a group of guys and it has been that way for a long time. We just got into high school this year and there have been problems in the past with guy 3 talking behind guy 4’s back, and guy 3 even lied to me saying he was sick so he wouldn’t have to go to the amusement park with me. The whole toxic friend package. So back to the story  I decided to send a random text to the group chat  that said “frick the flowers” and in another text “ToMmY dOnT f**k ThE fLoWeRs” exactly like that and I would send random things time to time like TikTok Tok thought we’re funny and gay 3 said TikTok is dumb and I messaged back ok but besides that guy 3 blew up after I sent that and messaged back “NOBODY F***ING CARES” “WHY” “JUST WHY”  I asked him why he did that and why everything I do offends him  and he said “because it’s random  and for no reason”  fast forward some bickering  and I said “Why tho were friends who should be able to joke around and not be forced to talk a curtain way or text a curtain way just how ever we want to” and then they had problems with me sending “lol” “ok” “oof” “yeet” a lot because my old friend group texted like that but we all had a falling out. But they started all saying that and then guy 3 said “let’s all just go to the other chat guys”  and guy 4 responds with “good idea” and guy 3 sends a gif saying bye. After that I got a message from guy 2  saying “that was all guy 3” and I said “ i know but why did everyone else play along” and he said “don’t ask me” so I decided to text guy 4 and ask why he played along with guy 3.  Then he said it was a joke and followed up with “you sending random stuff makes you look dumb that’s all” and their I said “everything’s a joke ig” and he said “(my name), we are high school boys your playing with fire.”  Then I asked how and he said “Because it’s kinda weird that a bunch of highschool dudes have one chick in there friend group ya know. That likes girls” then I said “I don’t even know if I like girls and does any one else in the group have a problem with me and it shouldn’t matter my gender it should matter on the friendship if you actually cared abt our friendship” then he said sucks to suck. Then I asked why are u being like this and he replied with “ because I’m curious why u gotta say stuff like that in the chat of course your gonna get dunked on for saying that stuff it’s dumb.” At that I point I was already crying and felt worthless so I messaged him “I just don’t understand why your getting sensitive over a dumb thing I said in the chat or any chats bc it’s dumb that ur getting pressed over words. And I am dumb I feel dumb everyday and even right now I feel like a dumb good for nothing but making her friends annoyed all the time.” Then after that he said “I’m not being sensitive. In fact I speak for all of us when we say that it’s old and annoying. You do it all the time and it makes you look dumb.”  After that I said “I’m sorry I don’t know what to do to make you guys happy all the time like I said I’m a dumb good for nothing who is just a waste of space and time”  then he said that not true just don’t send dumb things  and then repeat of me asking why I can’t send what I want and he said “Do what you want but we are just saying it’s annoying and this is why people argue with you because it stupid and nobody cares sorry it’s the truth.” And I said “no one cares  but I just send stuff like u guys do and no complains when u guys do it.” And he said “cause it’s weird” (Note: I just sent like tik toks from time to time) then I said so you guys can make jokes but I can’t and he said “saying random stuff in a group chat isn’t funny it’s annoying. Then I sent this “I’m sorry I’m annoying I try not to be but everything I do is annoying to u guys so I’m sorry I’ll just stop” and he hasn’t responded since then.

Back home it's just a failing economy that squanders the market for my skills so I always have to rely on my parents for expenses which is something I am not very comfortable with considering my age and also the fact that I have the ability to take care of myself so sometimes i feel as that person who uses daddy's money to survive

So I took off and went into therapy but then I got mono on top of this and I was pretty much an isolated mess with nothing to do which has led me into a moderate depression. I have faith that I can get better because this is more so situational I believe. 

Life has been hellish due to not being in school, not having many friends right now, not having a job, having NO energy, bad anxiety, and feeling trapped due to boredom. 

I’m lucky to have 2 best friends, an amazing boyfriend, and my family. 

But I don’t know where to turn. My energy is extremely low. I need to start exercising. I also don’t know if I should go back to school because I absolutely hate schoolwork but I feel like I have no other way to turn except cosmetology which is a last resort because the schooling is so quick. 

I want friends. I want to be involved in life again but my lack of motivation from having no energy / moderate depression is making it difficult.

Some background: my best friend has a pretty standard routine. We talk everyday and normally she messages me between the hours of 10 am and 11 pm. Yesterday night was an exception. She started self harming after a fight with her fiancé. She hasn’t contracted me today and it’s out of the norm for her. The fight between her and her fiancé was over them talking to other people and being on their phones when around each other so I inevitably got somewhat roped in. He stormed off after saying no phones in the living room, at the dinner table or in the bedroom, which was broken immediately when he went to bed with his iPad. She went to bed with him without solving the fight and continued to message me because she needed the comfort. He got up and left the room around 10:30 pm and she went to check on him at 11 and I haven’t heard from her since. She has previously stated that he is jealous of her relationship with me since we talk all the time. I’m just worried about her. She hasn’t self harmed in over a year and with a relapse it put her in a bad place. She told me the marks weren’t deep, not even deep enough to break the skin. I’m going to give her a day but I’m still very concerned, something in me tells me to be worried. Is there anything I can do? I’ve messaged her already a few times in our discord server and she hasn’t answered. The only way I can reach her is through text, call, discord, twitter or mail. I can only reach her fiancé through Twitter but he hasn’t been on there in several days.

675,"I’m a 24-year-old female. I’m trying to self-study programming so I can eventually get into the field and have a better life/job prospects/earnings for myself. I know this process will take 4-5 months of dedicated study at first. 

The only thing is, I’m a bit worried about the prospect of putting off finding love. 

I’ve dated in the past, and been interested in men, but it never worked out for various reasons. Every time I’d be heartbroken over a guy, afterwards I’d close myself off from other experiences. After breaking up with one guy in particular, it took me 2 years to get over it. Which was maybe a lot of lost opportunity, as I’d be asked out by men out and about, but would never go for it. 

I’m worried for myself that I’ll continue going down this road of being independent, focusing solely on myself and isolation as I work towards my goals. My worry of ending up alone. In addition, I’m a virgin, so never experienced the pleasure of sex. Which I’d really like to, and have gotten chances to, but I don’t want to mindlessly do it with anyone. Without an emotional connection at least. 

I care about my future, but I do care somewhat about finding love too. I’m at a crossroads. Does anyone happen to have any advice on this situation? Thank you very much in advance.",11Jan2020,1
676,"I recently went to college last fall semester and that is where I met J. She was starting college and I came back after a break from school. I came into college not expecting anything, just going to classes, doing my homework, maybe make some friends and just get high grades. I eventually start hanging out with J and what started out as a friendship became infatuation and then love. 

She was originally from Las Vegas and her family came to New York a couple years ago. She always kinda resented the move and how different the community is and so forth. On top of that, right before college started her mother passed away and resulted in breaking up with her ex because of it too. After her mother's passing, the rest of her family moved back to Vegas and she was left alone here in New York with no one but an aunt. Until we became friends and so forth, she was alone in New York. We spent almost every single day together. Eventually I asked her out but she said no to an official relationship because she couldn't focus on it and make me a priority when she was still figuring so much out with her mom passing mostly and being alone in another state. We talked and we continued to date in hope for the future. 

Fast forward to present day and spring semester is starting soon. Real life was making it's way and she had to figure out about schooling, money and housing. She had limited options and after talking to her advisor. She decided the best course of action is to go back to Vegas where she will be able to pursue a degree there for free, a living space being planned out and her family's friend is able to get her a job. Everything just lined up for her to go back to Vegas. I cried in her arms finding this out, she cried in mine. Talking about the relationship again, how she can't focus on one still because she is going to be living on her own trying to make a living and establish herself. A long distance relationship isn't for her right now. We are going to spend as much time with each other before she finds out when she is officially going back to Vegas. 

I am so happy for her because things are working out, but at the same time, selfishly resentful because she's leaving. She mentioned how we can always try later down the road for a relationship after she officially moves on from her mother's death and establishes herself. But she says how it isn't guaranteed and doesn't want me hanging onto hope just incase it's a no. I hate how true it is but she is right. I shouldn't wait for her but I can't help but wish to hold onto hope. 

I am just asking for advice, guidance, and perspective on all of this. No one in my life fully knows what our relationship is, her issues and our choices in being together. I am always told we are in a relationship, just marry her already and so forth. I have a lot going on in my life and then this happens in my love life and feels like everything is coming apart again and it's time for me to make a decision. 

TL;DR - Girl I am dating is moving back to her home state after her family left her in my home state alone. Left emotionally devastated of her leaving soon and our relationship ending.",11Jan2020,1

678,"REALLY LONG STORY AHEAD. SORRY IN ADVANCE.

I met my first actual high school girlfriend freshmen year (she went to the religious school up until high school and I didn’t). I was obsessed with another girl at the time tho who was my ex and we dated once more before we broke up forever. My first love (let’s call her Cat) liked me all of freshmen year even though I wasn’t really interested in her because of the other girl.

Well at hoco for freshmen year she pulled me to the side and we slow danced to what is now our song. I didn’t realize how much I loved the moment until after it was over though. But I think that’s when I truly started liking her.

The rest of the year, I started catching feelings for her,  especially when we went to one of her friend’s (who was also my friends) party and we hung out the entire time, but I only told one person I liked her. 

Sophomore year, I reallyyy started catching feelings for her. We took a picture together at the end of our school’s spirit week (the day before hoco) and that’s when I knew I wanted to be with her. I didn’t go to hoco because I was nervous. I knew she’d ask me to dance like freshmen year, and at this point I really liked her so I went fishing instead. 

Not even a week later I asked her out and she said yes. Flash forward 10 months later. We were at an all time low. We had just went to Six Flags together with her and her family (which WAS one of the best days of my life. We had sooo much fun and I won’t ever forget that day) but her friend (the one that had that party that I hung out with Cat all the time) was changing her. Her friend just broke up with her bf (my best friend) and I felt like she was forcing Cat to break up with me too.

Eventually, I was with my friend at a baseball game and Cat texted me HOURS after the last time she texted me. I asked her why she took so long and why it feels like I’m not important to her anymore and she FLIPPED on me. She got so pissed and turned it all on me. It was one of the best days of my life, but one of the worst nights of my life.

Like 4 days later, we broke up. I went fishing a lot, and she started telling lies about me such as the fact that I had to know where she was at all times (which of course isn’t true). So that’s when I started getting over her. I started talking to this girl from the next town over, and Cat got phased about it because that girl was apparently her best friend (they weren’t). They got in a fight and blocked each other. Like 3 weeks I decided not to go out with her because of something I found out about her I didn’t like. 

I talked to another girl and at Junior hoco, we hung out a lot. And we started dating not that long after. But it didn’t work out and we broke up too.

After a while, the friend that I thought made Cat break up with me wanted to be friends with me again, but I still hated her. So she called me and tried clearing everything up. We did and I went to bed. The next day at school, Cat was telling me and my best friend how everyone hates that girl now, and I decided to text Cat and ask about the truth of why we broke up

Everything that Cat’s friend said was a lie. She DID force Cat to break up with me, and she was always against me. Cat told me she never stopped loving me and if she could take back the last month of our relationship, she would. So I decided to give her a second chance, and after a little while of talking, we got back together, which she seemed really happy over. Which made me happy.

We’ve been together for 2 more months, and she’s a whole lot better this time around, but things are kind of going back to old habits. She texts me for a bit, then basically disappears for HOURS and then comes back like nothing happened (I know I didn’t mention this earlier but she used to do this too). And act like it was okay. For example this morning; I texted her good morning and like an hour later she texted me gm back (nothing bad) we talked for a short while and she’s completely disappeared. It’s been a while and she still hasn’t replied or anything. If she would just lemme know like “hey imma be busy I can’t talk for a while” it would all be okay and relieve some stress. But she doesn’t. She told me she’d fix that if we got back together. 

I’m always trying to be the type of boyfriend that she brags about yk. I always try to be #1 and I go all out on a lot of things for her, like her Christmas present. I went ALL out this year for her. But I just don’t feel like she appreciates me as a boyfriend like I wish she would. I always wanna hang out with her because of how little time I feel we have left together until high school ends. She is going somewhere in life with volleyball, and I’m afraid that after high school, she’s moving away and we’ll be over (which I also made a post about). But I don’t feel like she’s wanting to be with me as much or wanting to call or FaceTime as much as I’d like to. I feel like she avoids some things, like taking a picture together. We’ve been together for 2 more months and we haven’t taken one together yet.

And don’t get me wrong, after her basketball games she waits for me and I walk her to her car and I get an I love you and a hug and a kiss when I can, but I feel like that’s it. I want her to either come to my house or I go to hers and we watch movies and just hang out like a high school relationship, but we don’t ever do that. She’s always busy with basketball and her select volleyball team (WHICH IM REALLY OKAY WITH I can’t control it and I wouldn’t want to. I want her to choose that over me because it’s her future) but when she has free time, I don’t feel like she wants to hang with me when I’d like to. 

I want to be happier with her, but I don’t know how to bring up a serious convo with her like that, and I feel like I forget all the good times I’ve had with her when I ask her something like that. What do I do.",11Jan2020,1
679,"Hi,

As the title implies, I am very afraid of spiders. This fear began about six years ago when I moved into an older apartment building that had a ""little bit of a spider problem."" Turned out to be a significant deal; mounds of them nesting inside the window frames, emerging when the weather turned to spring. Big black fuzzy terrors. The worst was when one crawled out of my coffee grounds.

Before this, I didn't have a fear at all. I would relocate spiders from the indoors to the outdoors with ease.

Anyway.

I recently find out, through my brother's Twitter that he is probably dating.

And they seem to be in a distance relationship too. My brother is 21 yo and as far as I know this is his first girlfriend. He was always introverted and reserved (just like me). Also, we aren't really the closest siblings out there: we talk a bit everyday about common interests we have, but we never really get into deeper conversations. So I'm not really surprised that he didn't tell me. I was wondering if I should ask him if he's dating or not? I don't want to be invasive, I actually wanted to be supportive. I'm also kinda frustrated that he didn't tell our mother, she definitely would be happy if she knew (and would overflow him with questions too, which is probably what he's trying to avoid).

687,"So to give a bit of context, (For Simplicity BF will be best friend and GF will be girlfriend) so, My Best Friend and my current girlfriend used to date before my girlfriend and I got together and they used to fool around all the time from December of 2018 to February of 2019 or so I thought. They were platonic. after that, I admitted I had feelings for her in April to him, and he told me to go for it, so asked her in May, she shot me down. I still had feelings for her and he told me multiple times that he doesn’t have any for her, so I played it cool for the next couple months and we even went to homecoming all as a group, She was my date but she thought I lost feelings for her so we went as friends. And mid November, I asked her out again and she said yes. BF also asked out his crush an hour after I did. But 3 days later GF broke up with me with no explanation and so we tried it a few more times, never lasted more than a week. Up until Late December we tried it again and now we’ve been together for 2 weeks. But we were talking the other night, I told her some of my emotional baggage because I don’t want any secrets and then she told me, That from Late September up until Early November, they fooled around. I reminded him the Monday after Homecoming (Late September) that I still had feelings for her, and he helped me with her up until I asked and reason why GF broke up with me is because she thought BF wanted to get back together with her but instead asked out his crush. GF also said when they would meet, she’d be doing all the work. BF told me he’s sorry and it’s a huge regret of his and if he could take it back he would and how she ruined his experience. Now I feel betrayed and I’m pissed. GF and I both blocked him on everything but I still feel unfulfilled. What should I do. I’m not forgiving him because this was really shitty. What should I do?

688,"I work as a Product/Project Manager for a US division of one of the worlds ten largest companies. It's an unusual company in that its attracted a number of ""lifers"". I have been there for 16 yrs. We got a new CIO about a year ago and they kicked off the slowest most agonizing full reorg in history.  
  
In that year the CIO regularly said to me ""I see you heading up the Salesforce division"" and I began to be invited to regular C Level meetings. I won a few awards and had a stellar performance review and started pursuing SF certs. That said, it was clear that my promotion would be dependent on the decision of a new hire. A role between myself and the CIO. (Let's call them Sr. Exec)  
  
Long story short this new hire came on about three months ago. I've had a total of about 4 hours of conversation with them. This week came the day that my whole department learned of their new roles under Sr. Exec. I expected to lead X group and thought - worst case scenario...I keep my current job. Instead I was demoted to an analyst role keeping my same salary, benefits etc. 1/2 my team was fired to make way for new hires etc.  
  
To a person all of the other exec's in the company upon learning the news were aghast. ""You were baited and switched / fucked etc.""  
  
My question is what now? I have a family to support and great benefits (company car and crazy vacation). I can wait three months (working in somewhat humiliation) and try to move back to my old role in another team or I can go.  
  
I have 25 years of PM experience and every related certification you can think of PMP, masters, CSM, CSPO etc. I don't really enjoy the work though and was greatly looking forward to changing to a more strategic role.  
  
I also have an admin cert and a few other SF certs that are very trendy. I am in general a very technical PM but I got these certs through classes and have very little to no real experience. It was my intent to learn the technical side to help manage technical teams and I'm not sure that I can live up to the certs. I can stay on as an analyst (with some humiliation) and get some hands on and Then go but....woah that's hard.

- Me
- John (old roommate)
- Steven (current roommate) 

I currently own a place and am renting out one of my spare rooms. Back when I first bought the place, I put an add out for the room which is when I met John. Immediately he seemed pretty cool so we signed a year lease. He lived with me for about 7 months and over that time we grew to be pretty close buddies and I would definitely have considered him one of my close friends. 

Unfortunately a few months ago, John was involved in a freak accident that took his life. It was, to be frank, really rough to deal with. His family came by, moved all his stuff and I had this empty spare room again. 

While trying to cope with the grief, I put up an ad for the room again. I was probably okay for a couple months but money was really tight and I just needed to get someone in that room. 

I had decided beforehand, that if I advertised that the last tenant died, no one would be interested so I committed to avoid the topic with a future tenant unless they asked me, in which case I would explain that John had to move out of state. 

Steven was one of the first people interested. He came by, looked at the room and while asking questions, asked about my last roommate and why he left. I gave the above answer. He seemed to be responsible (I really wasn’t worrying about friendliness because after John died, I wasn’t too interested in forming any new friendships) so we signed a year lease. 

Well Steven has now been living in my place for a couple months and honestly he’s way better than I anticipated. He’s very responsible, easy to live with and just all around a really good guy. When Steven moves out, we will probably stay pretty good friends, but I feel terrible for starting out our friendship with a pretty big lie. I’m also worried about the truth coming out at some point and upsetting him.

696," 

My (24m) close friend (22m) and classmate suffers from anxiety and depression. He’ll sometimes go though depressive episodes and has explained that he doesn’t have much capacity to socialize when this happens. 

I’ve noticed that during these times he seems relatively fine with talking with other people in our core friend group at school but doesn’t really talk to me at all, and seems more dismissive of me when I try to initiate conversation with him. He also occasionally will make jokes saying “strangestbeard is the reason I have anxiety disorder”. 

I’m sure these are meant to be just coping jokes otherwise why would he even talk to me at all, but the combination of these two things can make me feel like him being around me makes his mental illness worse. Not that this is an excuse but I also have ASD which sometimes will make it difficult to distinguish when someone is joking or not, especially when it has to do with an insecurity of mine.

The past few months have felt like we aren’t as close as we used to be, so I’ve asked before if everything was okay and if I had done anything wrong. He’s explained that this isn’t the case and that he’s just been more depressed lately. I’ve been trying to be mindful of this and give him space when it seems like he’s going through a depressive episode but it does still hurt to see that he’s ignoring me but talking to others. I’m sure I’m just overthinking but I would hate to be someone who he feels he needs to specifically avoid when he’s feeling depressed. 

The other day I texted him asking if I actually made his anxiety/depression worse. Later in the day after class he responded seeming upset. I won’t share the exact details of the text but he responded saying he “never said that” and that he’s going through another depressive episode and that when he read my text he almost had a breakdown in class.

I feel shitty that I ironically gave him anxiety by asking a question like that so suddenly. I responded back apologizing, but he did not respond back. I’m sure he just needs to be left alone for the weekend but now I’m worried that I may have fucked up our friendship. I was considering asking if I could ask him something before popping the sudden question, but I was worried that being vague would only make him more anxious. 

In the future, how should I deal with these feelings I’m having? Should I just deal with them myself and not ask him about it? Should I have asked him in person rather than over text, or just eased into it more? I’m trying to understand and not be so insecure about our friendship but I think my own mental health issues are making that difficult. I’m scared to bring it up again for fear of pushing him away, and I don’t want to overwhelm him with depressing subjects while he’s already depressed.

705,"I have a tendency to ramble so Ill try to keep this short as possible. 

Im a 27F been in college off and on since 2010 mainly due to cluelessness amd possibly fear choosing a career I wouldnt like. 

FF to right now, I was in nursing school couple years ago but dropped out because I didnt wamt to be a nurse. I currently owe the school money so they wont let me back. I picked up some classes at a cc to transfer to another school and deal with that balance when I could pay them. 

As of right now, I want to go for Physician Asst so Id be transferring to a univ with my cc accumulated thus far. I reckon Id have about a year prereqs before I get whatever degree and then apply to PA school. However, a dear old friend has contributed a large amount of money to my first school and is recommending i do nursing as I was somewhat close. If ingo this route I know in some years Id want to go for something else as I hate nursing. But im wondering if I have a choice as Id like to have a decent paying job already. 

I seem to have a tendency of making non logical decisions so I would appreciate some input. Is it irrational I go for PA?  the only drawback I can see is paying for it and essentially being some time before I get into a school. If i go back to nursing its an expensive school so it may be the same cost but I may ahve to retake couple prereqs and reapply to the program.",11Jan2020,1
707,"So I am in the process of training for my new job.  My manager had me scheduled to work one day but that was one of my unavailable days and he was ok with the change. Now I am being scheduled to work on another day but like the other day, It's outside of my availability times. If I had nothing to do, I would have taken it but I am a full-time student and I am getting off 20 minutes after my class starts and it's a 30-minute commute so by the time I get to class, I'd have like 15 minutes left.

This is kind of a much-needed class too so I can't afford to miss it. I kind of deal with a lot of anxiety when it comes to social interactions and it's stressing me out to know that my manager will probably be really upset with me asking for another change especially since I let it sit for two days.

My options seem to be:

1) Let the manager know that I can only work up to 5 on that day and risk being removed from the position and/or upsetting the manager

2) Just go this week with the hours given and let them know for future reference my avaliability hours (again).",11Jan2020,1

Both are great companies but Company B has better benefits, pays better, and the position is closer to what I went to college for.

710,"I shared intimate moments with my SO to my friends due to peer pressure.They had started off by listing how far they went with their girlfriends.And after persistent questioning,I succumbed and told them some of it but not all.I ended up confessing to doing so to her because I felt that she would find out eventually so it might as well came from me. Well,she got furious and scolded me for doing so which I understand. She managed to calm down after I apologised a lot of times but admitted that she may not ever trust me ever and that she probably would not want to engage in any sexual activities with me(which is secondary to the damaged trust between us).I resorted to gradually building back the trust but I honestly don’t know how I should embark on doing so. I’m meeting her for dinner tomorrow. What should I do or say? Btw, I offered to buy stuff as an apology gift for her to make me feel better about the guilt and also to cheer up her abit.But,she stated,’it won’t change anything.’ I expected that reaction but it hurts and all I have to blame is myself.",11Jan2020,1
712,"I’m going to try and make this as short, yet informative as possible. 
My friend just started a new job working new hours. Unfortunately, she does not get off work until her daycare closes at 5 and has a 1 hour commute. Her and her bf have been back and forth on whether they are together or not so she asked me if I could start picking up her LO after work before her daycare closes. Being a working parent myself I felt the need to help her out and agreed. She said it’d be every day and she would pick him up from my house.
Well, I was told I can NOT pick LO up until 3:30. I get off work at 3. Daycare is 5 mins from work. I have to commute 30 mins to my daycare to pick up my youngest and then another 15 mins home to get my 7 y/o off the bus at 4:15. So, I have to hang around town until 3:30, then FLY to my daycare and then FLY home to beat the bus home. I usually barely make it. Instead of her picking him up, her bf/BD has been picking him up. Here’s the thing....he gets off work around 4:30 and comes from town. Where her daycare is.....*hmmm* So if I were to get my kids first and then go back for hers then BD would be at my house waiting on me. 
I haven’t really said much because I thought she really needed my help and I knew they’d been having troubles. I’m not being paid (wasn’t asked to be) and this has NOT been a daily thing like she initially said. I usually get a text at work mid-morning asking to pick him up. So I can’t even make after work plans because I don’t know if I’ll have her LO.
This past Friday they were not communicating at all. He said he couldn’t pick him up. So she asks me to. I said sure. At 3:28, literally as I’m pulling onto the street where the daycare is, she’s texts me that BD is getting him from daycare. So I had wasted 30 mins in town and then had to do my entire rushed trip to get my kids on time. I was pretty frustrated. 
I feel like they are not communicating between each other and I’m the monkey in the middle. I’m feeling a bit taken advantage of as well. I can’t keep wasting time after work and then rushing to make sure I get my kids, especially if they’re going to tell me last minute to not worry about it. 

Should I tell her I can’t help any more? I don’t want this to ruin our friendship, but I’m not really feeling the love anyways.

715,"Hello!  


For various reasons, I had a terrible social experience in college. I had a lot of problems at home that kept me from maturing into an actual adult by age 17. I only really feel like I've developed social skills now, at age 27. I only reeeeally started trying at age 23.  


I really regret not having had the chance to have a college social experience. I wish I could join a bunch of cool extracurriculars for my interests, do scientific research, maybe join a band or something. I was wondering what I could do to re-live that as an adult?  


I've lived in several major US cities. Some cities have more social oppertunities than others, but honestly the ones I've lived in (Boston, NYC, Seattle) are all fairly work focused these days. There is stuff to do, but not nearly at the scale of what I'd ideally like - a high density of nice, smart people living to do interesting things rather than make money. I'd love to exist in a society like that for a few years.  


Is there anything I can do to recreate that experience now, at age 27?",11Jan2020,1

717,"I don't think it would be traumatic for her at all. She is an incredibly sweet, intelligent and ambitious person. I love her a lot. But I don't think my life has worth if I can't ever become friends with my cousin. She is very special. I don't care if you say ""bullshit, there's millions like her"", because I just know there isn't. She treats me so nicely, almost always very friendly. I also felt pretty proud when she was watching a TV show, and she asked my younger cousin if she could look up the actors, then she didn't respond so instead my older cousin said to me ""can you look up the actors because [my younger cousin's name] doesn't seem to know how to do it"". Honestly I felt really proud she asked me. I just want to hang out with her, I would also actually feel really cool because of hanging out with her. 

My cousin also already has a boyfriend, so I’m sure that if I ended it using an exit bag, he'd saying something like ""fuck him. he was a little shit either way"" and then he'd probably kick me and encourage my cousin to kick me. I also sometimes wonder if, instead of placing flowers, my cousin will piss on my grave once a year. 

Currently my cousin doesn't want to hang out, either she just leaves me on read or she says she's busy (my friends just say she says that sometimes instead of saying a flat out no, as she has never done that before). But I have a plan. I will see her in a little less than two weeks, on that day I will have already  bought two tickets to a music festival (one ticket costs 130$), and I will ask her if she wants to come. If she says yes I will cry tears of joy, sing, and dance, and if she says no I will cry tears of sadness, hurt myself and starve. However, her birthday is in less than two months, so I will buy a gift for her for 60$, and after I give her the gift I will ask her if we can plan a date we can hang out on. If she says that she's busy all the time, then I know exactly what to do. I will go to her bed, use my exit bag and I will be no more.

724,"I'm a paralegal for a large firm, though I work at a smaller satellite office. I have a 4 year degree and I'm currently the main paralegal at the office. When I started, they did not have a paralegal. She had quit prior to my arrival and I pretty much trained myself. Since being there, I've worked very hard. We've also grown and have added two new legal assistants. Around September, we decided to have one of the legal assistants take on a few cases for paralegal duties. I trained her and I continue to act as her ""trainer"" as she is  still not quite grasping all of it. I basically manage two partners and an associate's work and complete all discovery, expert packages, etc. Since late April (when I started), I've billed probably around 700 hours - if not more. I'd have to add up my billings. I manage and complete discovery for around 100 cases. I have went through training to complete Case Manager duties so that I'm able to open cases etc.  I also handled all shipping/mail concerns for the entire office. When I was interviewing, I had asked to start at $45k/year. They offered $40k and considering it was closer to my home than my previous job, I took it. However, I was also told by the interviewer (head of HR) that I would ""probably make what I asked for by January."" January is when they do raises firm wide. 

I just checked their site to see if anything and been updated and my salary was adjusted to $41,500. I am feeling rather disappointed because I feel like I've taken on a lot of responsibilities and roles this past year. I have done a little research and it seems like this is a pretty average raise, but I think I do deserve more. 

Should I ask for more of a raise and if so, should I mention what I was told during interviewing? I figured I would also calculate my billings and touch on key points of what I've done. I'm nervous though and I don't want to sound unappreciative.

725,"I really really need help with this one. 

I am 17 and my little sister is 15. Every February our high school has a week-long mid-winter break, during which my dad usually stays with us and my mom goes to Las Vegas with her sisters to visit their mom’s grave and have a little reunion. Last year my mom couldn’t make the trip so she is very excited to go this year. While my parents are not divorced or separated, my dad recently got a job far away (Washington D.C.) and is moving in the first week of February. 

The law in Ohio states that minors age 17 can be left at home unsupervised for up to two consecutive nights in a row, and 15 year olds cannot be left at night without supervision (however in that case I would count as supervision since I am legally responsible for two nights). 

My mom posted an ad on a community facebook group for a BABYSITTER! to stay overnight with us every night for 10 days while both of my parents are out of town. She says she’s worried that if there’s an accident we won’t know what to do, that we could end up fighting, or that we will forget our responsibilities and let the house fall apart. I would understand if we were maybe two years younger or less experienced, but I think it’s ridiculous that I’m going to move away to university in less than 9 months and she thinks I need some 40 year old to watch my every move.  I have a driver’s license, I take myself to doctor’s appointments, I can go grocery shopping and take care of my two cats; and my sister and I are both responsible and independent about household and personal chores, we are both good students and we stay out of each other’s way when one of us needs privacy. Furthermore, we know how to keep ourselves safe and how to lock down the home if we aren’t there, we live in an extremely safe and tight-knit community (all of my best friends are a 10 minute WALK at maximum) and if worse comes to worst, we have emergency contacts. 

I first tried to compromise and ask if my sister and I could stay at a friend’s place every couple nights and my mom would not budge. I’ll see if I can reason with my dad. 

What on earth should I do?",11Jan2020,1

I got butterflies with him almost instantly, which I’ve never had before with anyone and haven’t had since. It was almost electric, supernatural, like we had met in a past life.

I was raised from a bible thumping family and was consequently never allowed to work because my role is to be a good daughter and someday a wife. Working is a fruitless thing for women to do in their eyes. I want to just get a job and to have a career later on though. I don’t want for myself to be a housewife. 

But I can’t go anywhere because I have no income. I go to college but I am not allowed to do any clubs or something. So it pretty much is kind of pointless.

734,"So I know that the world has become a lot more accepting of all body types, and I couldn't be happier for it.  As someone who's always been a little bigger (US Women's Size 14/16, 200ish pounds), it's nice to know that I feel more accepted in my skin these days.  

I have a long time dear friend who is also overweight.  We will call her Maggie.  Maggie is not just ""curvy""; she is well over 400 pounds.  When we were younger it didn't really have an effect on our friendship, since she still did everything without any physical struggle.  However, in recent years I can tell that her weight has really become an issue for her.  She complains any time there is a short distance to walk or a couple of flights of stairs to climb.  She has been dealing with joint pain and increasing difficulty with mobility.  At this point she does not go out often except to go to work.  She orders almost everything online and has her groceries delivered too, so that she doesn't have to leave her house.

A few years back, she had a health scare.  She put her mind to it and actually DID make some significant weight loss progress.  The weight came back unfortunately, as it often does if you're not diligent.  I saw that she could do it though if she found the motivation within herself.

I know she is very sensitive about her weight since she was bullied in school.  I understand this well because I was picked on mercilessly too.  However, she doesn't like hearing me express my own challenges with body image.  Since I'm not as overweight as she is, she won't listen to me when I try to relate to her.  Even so… I feel like as her friend, I need to say something.  I feel that when I stay silent, I am enabling her.  I've made offers to exercise with her but she has never taken me up on them.  I'm getting really scared for my friend and I feel like if she doesn't make significant changes soon, she is going to face far more extreme health and lifestyle consequences.

735,"Hey reddit, I’m a southerner who just moved up from Louisiana and am currently living in Kenosha. Need some help with all these northern things I have to do now. Anti freeze? Snow tires? Winter clothes? 

I just made my first foray into the wild Kenoshan outback about a half hour ago. As a southerner, this was my first wake up call. It was absolutely frigid. 32 degrees (that’s a whopping 0 degrees for you non-American lads). I went out with just a hoodie and some jeans. No gloves, or hat, or anything of the sort. I quickly came to the realization that I was in over my head.

I bravely fought my way through the elements towards the terrifying but awe inspiring shoreline of Lake Michigan, being battered the whole way by some light snow and brutal 15 mph wind. 

At last I made it to the shore to glimpse the tall waves crashing against the shoreline. But the cold was too much. Just as I thought I had taken my last breath, I mustered the strength to walk the 30 seconds back to my apartment. 


Ok so now that my shitpost is out of the way I gotta ask some actual questions. Is 32 degrees too warm to put on a heavy down jacket? Will I look like a stupid southerner? After my first little trip I did go out again with a down jacket, gloves, and boots which made it much more enjoyable than just a thin hoodie, no gloves and tennis shoes. 

Also how long do I need to let my car run before I start driving? Isn’t it smart to let it run for a few minutes when it’s cold outside? Obviously it’s not that cold rn but I’m asking for the future. 

Also, I’m debating whether I should become a packers fan or bears fan. I’ve liked the packers for a long time because my grandfather was a fan of them forever, but I really like the idea of being able to go to a game. The bears kinda suck so I can probably actually get tickets for the bears since they’d be cheaper. Never really got to do that for the saints since they’ve been relatively good since I was kind of young. I imagine packers tickets are super expensive considering how dedicated and huge their fan base is. I could also say I became a bears fan before the band wagon as long as I don’t let anyone know that i just became a bears fan for cheap tickets. Im kind of leaning towards the bears but what do you guys think?",11Jan2020,1

My boyfriend, who’s been separated from his wife for a year and a half, isn’t able to finalize their divorce because she’s a suicidal, manipulative maniac. She finally filed for divorce a few months ago BUT he’s been unable to sign the papers. She’s incredibly unstable, threatens suicide, screams and cries, begs and pleads and basically holds him hostage through emotional extortion on the few times they’ve met up to discuss the divorce. Is there a way he can get a COPY of the papers to sign so this can be finalized without any further communication or contact with her? I know people get divorced without having to communicate so there has to be a way because it’s too emotional for her and pretty much impossible for them to meet up. What can he do?

Instantly I was berated with insults and how I don't pay for my child's expenses when i clearly and with my daughter most of the day. She told me she was claiming her. I don't get a say? I offered her half and she said she didn't trust me. She started berating me with texts of yearly expenses she paid for my daughter and she deserves to be reimbursed. Well I have nothing to say to this nonsense because I have receipts to prove I've paid for school clothes/supplies, groceries, field trips, etc. Basically shes nonnegotiable and this is why we can't coparent.

We've been friends for four years; I've had feelings for him since the beginning, and while that may have been why I first became friends with him, my motives have been lost to time. What I did realize after becoming friends with him is that he's such a fun person to be around, and I love being friends with him. I don't want to be in a relationship with him, and I don't want to have feelings for him. Yet here I am. For a long time I just accepted the fact that I had feelings for him, and just ignored them. Eventually I told myself that the crush went away, and lived in denial for a while. The feelings have not gone away, and it's starting to become frustrating.

I’ll be visiting my new apartment in a new city in a new state (~6 hr ride) using the Amtrak to meet the landlords on my initial day of the lease. I can bring two carry on bags through the Amtrak.

So I'm quite young in the freelance world of animation \[Japanese anime\] I've not yet built enough clout to really keep a constant flow of working coming in \[**UK has 0 job opportunities for me in that field and I wish to fly else where in future\]**, something I'm working on networking with other animators and really grinding my skill/building a social media presence \[as Twitter especially is one of the key ways for us to get Japanese animation work\]

So my skills are increasing quickly and I'm learning alot, however I was working at a bar for 2 years, I got into a situation that caused me to have to resign, bearing in mind I was getting more and more angry the time I spent working and watching the others succeed and working on all types of anime, meanwhile I was loosing many hours feeling unfulfilled.

So after I quit/got fired I spent my free time in the gym and animating, drawing and studying as much as possible, I landed a couple of freelance gigs which paid handsomely, but When it's a low period I dont really have much money, I still have a long way before I can even live off this work, so I will keep drawing and animating as much as possible.

I live at home, but I usually do my own shopping, my mom doesn't buy anything for me so when theres no food, theres no food, Christmas/new years ate up the little money I had left but I'm not upset.

Problem is I NEED money, but most the regular jobs are just, well, kinda lame. I have no idea what to apply for because I don't care about any of them, I only want to animate, I have a personal trainers course coming up and would happily do security, but again I would need money for the badge.

So the situation is I know what I want long term but for now I need this paper, but no jobs interest me.

756,"So this is kinda a long story... my ex and I met in sixth grade (2011ish) and we became bestfriends. I (girl) felt bad for every guy that asked me out and would always say yes because I knew how hard it was to get the courage to do that. Truth is I loved my ex, I always liked him I just thought we wouldn't work out because we were just friends. eight grade rolls around and turns out he really liked me too. so we started dating. he was the jealous type. I didn't like how girls interacted with one another so I always had guy friends. He didn't like this. He never told me I couldn't be friends with them, I could just tell it was bothering him. It hurt to tell you the least. So my ex was one of those people that had anxiety and he'd help anyone he knew was struggling, but he got involved with this one girl and I could tell something was off. turns out she started telling him I was flirting with other guys and she was sending him pictures of me just dicking around with my friends and made it into something it never was. He didn't tell me what was going on, but I finally figured it out through one of my friends. I knew that girl was trying to take him from me because she was in the same english class as him and (he has CVS important later) and everytime he'd miss a day she would say shit like ""Aweee, you're back, I was so lonely without you..."" and always touching him. So back to the picture thing, he got so anxious that he broke up with me because he couldn't handle it anymore. I understood. I gave him time, it lasted like a week before we both couldn't handle it anymore. so we got back together. now with the CVS thing, it stand for cyclical vomiting sydrome, I would explain it here but honestly it would take too long. He was just always sick and everytime we planned on doing something he would usually cancel because it was so bad. His anxiety would spark it. I never blamed it on him, it was out of his control, but that's when I started realizing the lies. we had been dating for four years and he had met my family once... I on the other hand wasn't really invited to any of his family things so I barely knew his. I caught him lying one day after my brothers wedding. He said he couldn't go because he had to work. I asked him how work went the next day and he said ""What? I didn't have to work, I played online with james..."" he had forgotten what he told me. I would have understood if he just said he wasn't comfortable, but this hurt. The lies hurt. Eventually (because my family situation was not good) I moved into his house when I was 18. He had left his binder in my room (we had separate rooms) and I decided to leave him cute little notes everywhere. That's when I found his writings. They were writings about me, ow he couldn't trust me, how I was selfish, how I was a bitch, how I was a slut among other things. I asked him if everything was alright and he said yeah. I didn't tell him that I read those letters. you see he writes things that he's feeling in the moment, unfiltered things, then he thinks about them more and sees why he was wrong but the fact that at some point this is how he felt hurt. I felt so bad. I loved him so much and he said he loved me but... Then, eventhough we were living together he barely talked to me, when everything was falling apart he said it was because he just felt comfortable with me, but I don't know. A bunch of other things happened through out the years, but honestly it's too long to explain. I suffer with depression, I have for many years, and seeing me destroying the one person I loved I acted irrationally. I thought that if he hated me fully he would be better off. So I cheated on him, and I went back to his house told him, then I planned to just off the bridge by his house so he wouldn't have to miss me, and honestly I thought I couldn't live without him. well my friends called the cops because they somehow found out. I didn't even get to explain myself to him. I got put into the health crisis center for three days. when I came out I couldn't contact him because he blocked me on everything. When I say this hurt, It fucking destroyed me. So two months go by and I'm back smoking weed, and just not giving a shit. and I meet this guy at a new years party. He had been my stand partner in orchestra for awhile now but we never really said much. we ended up getting close really fast, like we were perfect together. I told him I wanted to take things slow, but I didn't. we've been through a lot together, and I really like him and his family, but I'm still stuck on my ex. I stopped feeling much for my boyfriend. I always do that, I just shut down but I don't know what to do. I wrote a letter explaining everything to my ex and I asked his bestfrined if I should even try to talk to him, and I guess he's gone off the rails. He's just in horrible shape and it's my fault. he said I should talk to him to see if I can help, because he needs it and I guess im the only one who really understood him. It's been a year since we broke up and I don't know what to do. I just miss him. Or maybe I just feel guilty I don't know, I just want him to be okay. What do I do? Please help...",11Jan2020,1

I'm 18 years old, soon about to be 19 in February. And i always live in the future. I keep myself so, so focused on my goals and my future plans that i forget to live the present and it happened to be pushed away from some friends.

I'm so preoccupied trying to make a business, achieving financial freedom, making multiple sources of income.

I think of how can i start a business using European funds, idk invest in real-estate, buy a studio apartment and rent it or idk.

I got so so so many things written down. I don't know what to do, or what to focus on. and this is all i think about, 24/7.

When i'm out together with my friends, idk they talk about other people, talk about what they look like, what they dress with, they talk about what's going on at the moment, football, idk stuff like that, and i obviously just sit and listen :))) because that doesn't interest me, you know. i also don't know what to say.

I don't know if i'm wrong or something is wrong with me. I just feel like i'm alike people my age. I'm assuming they think i'm a weirdo. I mean most of them are waiting for the weekend to go and fuck up the monkey of their parents in clubs.

Things like that, they all live for the moment. and is cool you know? i wish i wasn't so aware sometimes about life or what's happening around me, so i can also have fun like they have.

The question is, how can i find myself a circle of people with the same interests as me? or how can i ''integrate'' myself better in my friends circle?",11Jan2020,1

761,"To make a long story short, I am a 30 year old who has been working as a server for the last few years. I mostly fell into it as a profession when I dropped out of grad school and was desperate for a job. I was recently let go from this job of almost 2 years (boss got sick and could no longer run the operation). I tried to pick up another serving job but I quit after 2 weeks. I just don’t want to do it anymore. I have a degree. I graduated at the top of my class. I am highly qualified and skilled with a variety of strengths. I am employable, dependable, respectable, and smart. I feel like I am not learning or growing anymore as a server. 

I am considering doing a year of service, like AmeriCorps or something like it. Maybe I’ll build houses with Habitat for Humanity. Maybe something else. My fear is that if I make a big life change like this, I will regret it. For instance, when I was 27 I went back to college to get my teaching degree and it was the most miserable experience of my life. I dropped out after 9 months and fell into a deep, suicidal depression. I’m afraid of uprooting myself and leaving the support system I spent years building for myself here. I’m afraid of the low pay associated with AmeriCorps. 

But if I stay, I’m afraid that I will get stagnant. I live in a college/tourist town with little room for career advancement and a high cost of living (and meager dating options (and arguably the gloomiest weather in the USA)). I also feel very civically-minded and service-oriented. I want to make a difference in the world. I want to do something bigger with my life than just working for a paycheck and playing in my free time. I feel like there is more to life.

I tried to do this once before but I chickened out. Looking for advice and guidance.

I’ve been in a relationship for 7 years now, and we have a son together. Our relationship for the first 3 years was great but fast forward to 2016 and he started going out drinking a lot, one night he didn’t come home and it lead to our split, within a week he was in a new relationship and he was with her for 4 weeks, we got back together but I found out a few weeks later she had been pregnant and unfortunately miscarried which was a little hard for me since I had at that point been diagnosed with secondary infertility, anyways over a 3 days bank holiday weekend he went awol and dumped me on his return a few weeks later we were already back together at this point I found out he cheated on me that weekend and then found out he had also been seeing the other girl behind my back...within days of this information I started to get sores down below and was told I had herpes and following testing he’d also given me chlamydia. Now he denies giving me the herpes and is convinced I got them some other ways but considering the area the blisters were (my bum) the drs told me that was how I was infected and we had only done it that way for the first time days before I got the blisters. Anyways because I have herpes I freaked out convinced myself no one would want me and we stayed together. We were ok for 3 years then he started drinking heavily, wouldn’t return for work, our child was going multiple days without seeing him despite living together. He also pushed me off the bed onto the bedside table and cut and bruised my arm when he was drunk. There was mental and emotional abuse in there too. So we split again. I started building myself back together and he decided he was quitting drinking. We got back together this was back in July. He hasn’t drank as far as I’m aware there are a few times I’ve had doubts because we don’t live together. Anyways we don’t live together I’m happier living on my own, no drama, me and my child have our routine. My partner stays over once a week. Ever since we have been back together my depression has been getting worse I was happier when I was single. I don’t know if it’s the depression or not but I don’t feel the same for him. I feel like we are friends who have a sleepover once a week. I haven’t got the desire to be intimate or affectionate towards him. I’ve tried to talk to him about it but he straight away jumps in with the I lose everyone I love and I have changed my life for you etc and by that he means he quit drinking. So I feel fully responsible for him not drinking like it’s as if he doesn’t do it for our child. And there’s the herpes thing I can’t even begin to imagine me meeting someone else and telling them I have herpes. I’m shy as it is, and I fear the rejection and if they went around telling people and I know it’s because of the herpes I stay in my relationship and I honestly don’t know what to do.

I recently started dating someone and we hit it off. She decided she wanted me to know about her difficult past; different cases of un-consensual sex with different men. I thanked her for feeling comfortable enough with me to share that side of her life with me and comforted her. While she was talking to me about her past she mentioned something odd. She mentioned that while she was in high school she and a teacher grew close to one another, and that eventually he began to touch her. She mentioned that their “relationship” lasted the duration of her senior year of high school, and that he would send her money in exchange for naked photos and sexual intercourse. I’m confused and unsure of what to do; her past “relationship” makes me uncomfortable but I really like her. I don’t think any less of her but I’m just upset and confused. I recommended that she speak to a therapist for this sexual encounter as well as her past encounters with men. I want to help and be a friend to her but I also want this man in jail or at the very least away from other children where he could possibly do this again. I suggested going to the police but she mentioned her fear because of her status and because of the wealth of information he has on her.

778,"Scared to drive on the motorway for the first time (UK)

Hi all,

I have had a licence for around 3 years and in general I’m a confident driver. When I drive to places I know I never worry. However, with new places I get a lot more anxious. I have never driven on the motorway and have only been on A roads for a short amount of time. 

I have agreed to pick up my boyfriend from the airport which will involve an hour long drive on the motorway and I am terrified something will go wrong. I haven’t stalled in years (manual car), but suddenly I am afraid I will stall on the motorway or I’ll mess up a lane change or I’ll just panic and no one will be able to help me if something goes wrong. I’m also worried I won’t be able to control the car at those kinds of speeds. 

How do I get over this fear? I am determined to pick him up tomorrow and know that this is an unreasonable fear, I just don’t know how to make it seem less scary in my mind. 

Thank you for any advice!",11Jan2020,1
779,"I’m not sure if this is the best sub for this, but I’m confused and I’m not really sure who to turn to or what to do. 

I recently started dating someone and we hit it off. She decided she wanted me to know about her difficult past; different cases of un-consensual sex with different men. I thanked her for feeling comfortable enough with me to share that side of her life with me and comforted her. While she was talking to me about her past she mentioned something odd. She mentioned that while she was in high school she and a teacher grew close to one another, and that eventually he began to touch her. She mentioned that their “relationship” lasted the duration of her senior year of high school, and that he would send her money in exchange for naked photos and sexual intercourse. I’m confused and unsure of what to do; her past “relationship” makes me uncomfortable but I really like her. I don’t think any less of her but I’m just upset and confused. I recommended that she speak to a therapist for this sexual encounter as well as her past encounters with men. I want to help and be a friend to her but I also want this man in jail or at the very least away from other children where he could possibly do this again. I suggested going to the police but she mentioned her fear because of her status and because of the wealth of information he has on her.

780,I thought I’d post here and see if any helping words can help me out. I’m a 25 year old woman. I’ve been in a relationship with my s/o for 3 years. About 6 months ago we decided to break up. We were having issues. The relationship was long distance. We just needed to be alone. But he decided to start seeing a girl right after it happened.  I didn’t react well to this. I felt like this was the reason we broke up and he couldn’t be honest with me. I was so heartbroken he was replacing me and couldn’t just be honest about it. I was constantly lurking the girls Facebook. Of course a lot of us go through this. A few months after we broke up and all this happened. We decided to get back together. I missed him terribly and just wanted him back in my life. We moved in together and it’s going well. I just still can’t move from the fact  that he dated this girl. I don’t know what to do. I still look at her page. Bringing myself down. Thoughts running through my head about how she’s more successful and beautiful and I really wanna be out of this rut.

I'm balding already, I'm not tall or anything and I'm considered a below average looking dude where I live. I have friends who are into relationships and they are pretty happy with their partner. I have friends who are single but people approach them for relationships, these people are also pretty happy and confident about themselves. I have friends who are neither in a relationship nor trying to get in one and yet they are happy and confident about themselves. All three look good and seem happy whereas I am feeling like shit on a constant basis. 

In all these years no one has once asked me out, told me they like me or tried to be friends with me. Its not even limited to romantic relationships, I can't even seem to make friends anymore. I feel so insecure about myself that I'm rejecting myself just by looking at other people. 

All this has made me such a bitter person. I don't ever show my insecurities irl though. I talk to everyone , people usually laugh when they talk to me, I also maintain above average academics and dress well. I groom and maintain myself. I may not be jacked but I'm not fat or anything. I do have bad hair but that's something i cannot change.

I was to drunk to think any wrong of this.

792,"
Recently a good friend of mine [M/17] took his life on the 10th of December. I knew he was struggling a lot and had talked him out of suicide a good few times but that didn’t make the news of his death any less shocking. I don’t believe I have fully been able to process the situation yet, it’s the first time I’ve ever really lost someone close to me (other than my grandfather). 

Then on Tuesday, 7th January - I had had the worst day in awhile, only then to come home to missed calls and a message from my friend to tell me that my best friend of over 4 years [F/15] had took her life earlier that day. It didn’t feel real when I read the message, I was like what the hell how is this happening again!! Even typing this right know it’s like my brain still isn’t acknowledging the reality of this. 

To add some context:
My good friend who I mentioned first was my best friend’s boyfriend , which is how I met him. Before his death, things weren’t so good between him and my best friend, nor were things very good between my best friend and I. I won’t get into the details of what went down because i think that is too personal to share, honestly this whole post is too personal for me but it’s killing me knowing my best friend and I left things on bad terms. I’m hoping maybe some people on here have experienced something similar and can give advice on how to forgive yourself when feeling like you should’ve done things differently and how you’ve managed to cope without having the person around. Also how to avoid letting the grief eat you alive - as that’s currently where I’m at.

793,"Currently at my 3rd year at university, and most people, even those who know me quite alot as a friend, seem pretty concerned whenever talk is made around my inexperience around dating. My history with women romantically is literally non existent. Literally. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I'm not really trying in the first place (I'm not into dating sites, I'm not really asking anyone out, I don't really discuss the ""issue""), I just focus mostly on other stuff (work, studies, hobbies, gym) and I'm not actively trying to get laid/a girlfriend. I honestly never felt weird about it, I was just following the advice ""just let it happen, and eventually it will"". I wasn't even thinking of the possibility something is wrong with me. And I was completely fine with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point though, other's comments and concerns are starting to get to me it seems like. I went out with a few buddies the other day (at a club) and my friends tried to ""set me up"" with a girl I didn't even know. I didn't respond at all, I got pissed, and let it pass. My buddies came back to me, were sincerely dissapointed, and told me (in very clear words, and I can be certain of their honesty since they were drunk) ""There is clearly something wrong with you"".

&amp;#x200B;

That hit me. Really badly. For the first time ever I seriously thought that something might be wrong with me after all, and that's why I haven't gotten into a relationship as a 22  year old.

&amp;#x200B;

798,"Context: I (24F) live at home with my parents. I graduated from university last May and moved back home because after graduating I didn't have a car of my own, and I also had student loans to pay back. My parents agreed to let me live at home while I was getting back on my feet until I had enough saved up to move out. 

My parents for the most part have been treating me as an adult for as long as I've been acting as one. I make responsible choices and had never gotten into trouble at school, or stayed out partying or anything like that. When I was dating my college boyfriend, they allowed for him to come visit over here, I went to visit him, and he and I even went on multiple vacations together. Recently, I bought my first car a few months after saving up enough from the serving job I took on and am still currently working at, and the loan is in my name. I'm paying back my student loans every month (also in my name), I work evenings 5 days a week and I'm working an unpaid internship during the daytime 4 days a week. I have two bachelors degrees as well, and except for being on my parents health insurance and on their family phone bill, I've largely become financially independent.  

Recently, I began dating a man I met at work. He is significantly older than I am (about 20 years). Because reddit has discriminated against this relationship before solely due to the age difference, I want to clarify that our relationship is very healthy with no existing power imbalance because of our ages. He has never dated anyone more than 5 years in age difference from him, and so dating someone my age is not a pattern. My parents have met him, invited him over to dinner, I've met his family, etc. It's a healthy relationship, and we balance our time together well, and we don't let our relationship affect how we work together (fortunately as servers, when we get busy there's not really time for anything other than doing our job). Both of my parents have expressed that they like him. 

My mother, however, is extremely upset with me when I sleep over at his place. It's 1-2 times a week, and I always tell her when I won't be home that night. The last time I slept over, I texted and told her and she texted me back ""That's it."" and has hardly spoken to me since I got home (2 days ago). I find this to be unfair behaviour on her part, as it is inconsistent with how she has treated me in the past regarding my boyfriends. As I said, my parents would let me go visit my college boyfriend while he had his own place, so it's assumed that we'd be sleeping together. We took vacations together, obviously sharing the same room/bed. And now my mother is upset that I'm sharing a bed with my current boyfriend, supposedly only because of the age difference (since she likes him otherwise).

How do I convince my mother to treat me as an adult in this aspect of my life, as she treats me as an adult in every other aspect? I'm close to moving out, I have enough saved up to find a place, but in the meantime I feel like we can't live together in peace because of how she feels about this and how awful she makes me feel/guilt trips me whenever I come home. 

FWIW, we are not a religious family. My parents were both raised catholic, but neither have been to church in over 25 years.",11Jan2020,1
799,"My 2 friends (one male 19 one female 20 they're a couple and have been together for 3 years) offered me a room in an apartment 3 hours away from my original home. I pay rent, and keep up on things pretty well.I enjoy it here. I met a girl, we really like eachother. I also have lots of friends and an amazing job. My problem is this. The female roommate well call ""e"" is very toxic and mean to everyone, including male roommate well call ""t"".

E has created a DND campaign for me, t, my girl, and our 3 person friend group. One guy (well call him ""b"") out of that friend group can get a little carried away in DND and do what e calls ""cringy stuff"". I on the other hand, think he's just having fun. It's gotten to the point e,t, and one of the friends (well call him ""k"") will stay behind after b leaves and just shit talk him and make fun of him. I have expressed how much I don't enjoy that cause I wouldn't want people to be talking about me behind my back. E has forced t and k to do this cause she's manipulative and toxic.

One day, my girl came up with a little list of the people she liked out of my friend group. e wasn't mentioned on it cause my girl doesn't like her because e is very mean to me. I brought up my own list back to her and e overheard it, but not enough to know where she was on the list. I ended up telling e that k is at the top,and that's all I'm saying cause everyone loves k he's a sweetheart when he's not being forced to be mean. E then looks at me and says ""You don't deserve peoples kindness at all"". My girl will forever hate her for that.

My past is painful to me. my mother's passing,  my many many horrid relationships, e brings them up all the time to get a ride out of me. She also belittles the things I enjoy in life, for example. Me and my girl like country music...e has threatened to kick me out if she ever hears me listening to it (she believes she has the power to kick me out but I know she doesn't it's funny to let her think she has power over me when she clearly doesn't) t has a PC with a guitar hero game on it that lets you make your own songs. I made my girls favorite country song on it for our 3 month anni and played it for her right before our DND session. E stood up once the song started and began to mock me and my girl before leaving out into the cold cause she ""didn't wanna hear two siblings fucking in the back of their dads pickup truck"" (the song was ""write this down"" by George straight in case you were curious) I got furious and grabbed my girl went into my room and locked the door. Can't play DND with two main characters gone. We stayed in my room until my girl had to go home.

There's alot more stories, but the conclusion is this. E is very toxic and very cruel to me, her own boyfriend, and to her closest friends. Our lease is up in August and she wants us to upgrade to a better place. I would love to...... without her. I don't wanna go back home, but I don't wanna be stuck with her for another lease.

Ok, this is going to be a long post, but I’m just lost. This is also my first post so bear with me. Been through a lot and I just want to be detailed to give a full view of things. Because of this there’s going to be a lot of details but vague enough for obvious reasons. (btw I may have the years wrong so sorry)

We start roughly back in 2014/15 and I was a freshman in HS, so roughly 15. I was in the CoD clan, nothing serious just guys and gals roughly the same age just having fun. I went on a trip and came back and met this person who we will call H. When I got online the clan introduced me to H and we were playing search and rescue (back on CoD ghosts). She died and so I said to the clan leader “she uh sounds kinda ” and he quickly replied “yea” which is guy talk for hot or cute. This is how her a I was acquainted.

I was in online school, so I was online a lot and she got on a lot after school. We lived far apart but still lived in the US. Also we were both the same age. When we talked, I could tell something was wrong in her voice and later I would find out. When we played, she would make comments like “I just want to die” or “I just want to work and McDonalds and just be dead”. I would tell her there’s more to life, but I would later find out what was going on. You could tell that she was depressed even though at that age I didn’t know really what that was just that she wasn’t well, so I would just treat her as another friend and just see what happens. We just played games and just talked and got to know each other as well as the clan was great to be apart of. Everyone respected everyone and we had genuine friendships (back in the day and may as well now, girls be actively harassed by dudes so not seeing that was nice). To skip irrelevant details we became close. One day I suggested to the clan that we all take pictures of our face and send it to the group chat on KiK (back when KiK was a thing) and the clan did it and H said to me “I like your face” which I replied “I like your face too”. She was cute and I loved her voice and I knew she thought the same of me.

I helped her get into a relationship with another guy since I was just starting to have feelings for her and long story short the guy was needy and they ended it off and the despair, depression, or just sadness remained in her voice, but we kept growing closer. It was roughly around maybe January of 2015ish maybe when I made a comment that I wanted to work for certain companies around were she lived (she lived in a city I wanted a software engineering degree which works damn near everywhere) and said that maybe Ill live near her and she said we should live together. We officially dated a week later.

The relationship was like nothing I’ve seen before. I instantly fell in love with her. We talked for months about what kind of apartment and what style and chores. I remember she said “all you need to do is take out the trash and ill cook and clean and everything else” which I replied “this isn’t this 1950s I’m obviously going to help you” and she loved that. For months, MONTHS, we would start the day with a phone call, text throughout the day, phone/skype during lunch, Xbox when she got home (even if she wasn’t playing we would still talk) and then later on in the relationship I would skype her to bed. She even mentioned that a little out where she lived her grandparents had a farm and she might want to renovate it and have a giant family which I was all for. Also (maybe during this time or later on) she wanted to get married where most of her heritage was from (like if she was mostly German then married in Germany) which I loved the idea too. But later on she told me what was going on. During this time she confessed to me why was there so much despair in her voice, why did she constantly say “I just wanna die” and I promised I would never tell anyone which I will take to the grave but doing it anonymously is the only moral workaround imo. So here it is:

We she was roughly in 6th grade she dated a boy either a grade above or below her and on her birthday H and him went to her bedroom and he begin to touch her sexually, which she didn’t want and he persisted to the point is was obviously assault and getting close to rape. She told me she was terrified what he would do and if would even listen to her. luckily, He stopped but would later berate her on how stupid she was to reject him and so on. A lot of mental abuse that did a lot of damage to her.

They broke up and later in the 8th grade she dated a different guy, although it wasn’t on her birthday, the same thing happened again. But I don’t remember if guy #2 berate her at all. Guy #2 would later confess (over text to H) while H and I were dating that what happened haunts him and he deeply regrets it and profusely apologized and what he did was unacceptable, I told her not to reply. Still more damage was done to her and her mentality and her body image, etc.

Finally, after guy #2 H met guy #3 on Twitch, which he did A LOT more damage. They became affectionate and once that got there, he would question her loyalty, test her with him creating fake accounts to see if she would cheat. You may think “why did she just end it” but she thought after what just happened that she was literal trash and she doesn’t deserve anyone and that she should just die, so being affectionate with this guy meant a lot to her, and the mental abuse did a lot to her. He would demand nudes, which she sent, and later deeply regret, and he just left her. Broken, distraught, depressed, etc. This was the worst relationship for her since she was always controlled by guy #3 and was never allowed to make decisions. He was the worst out of all 3.

She was depressed, had bad anxiety, body confidence, panic attacks, anxiety attacks. She also had severe decision making skills since she wasn't allowed to make them in the past as well as bipolar.

She never told anyone about any of the three events except me. The clan, even her parents were unaware. Her parents didn’t know she was depressed and slightly suicidal until I encouraged her to seek help. They still dont know what happened other than she was slightly depressed which is not even close to what is really going on. When she was caught cutting herself by her parents, she played it off as her being bored. When she did see a doctor about her depression, she got meds that were always way to strong and made her a little loopy so I was basically her meds/doctor and I didn’t mind at all. She would also see what her limit was on Advil, I think it was. I was her first not abusive boyfriend, and everything was going perfect for her and for me. She kept saying how she didn’t deserve me and how much I did for her, but I told her that wasn’t true, and she was perfect. After hearing this I told her everything was going to be ok and that I would work with her and stay with her until the end because she was my dream girl, H was everything to me, and id be damned if i wasn't going to make her happy again. I didn't care what happened, I only cared about her and I was there for her 24/7.

I made her promise to stop with the cutting, then she later confessed the Advil and so I made her promise to stop with that and she did for both. Over the next few months I got her body image back up slowly and encouraged her to make decisions on her own to rebuild her confidence like asking questions like “what do you want to do”. I never really knew what I was doing but I was doing the right thing.

The only bump we had, the only issue we had was when she started hanging out with an older guy (guy #4). I think she was 16 and he was 18. She asked if I was ok and I said sure if nothing was going on and she assured me there wasn’t. long story short while I was playing Just Cause 3 she broke up with me saying I deserved better and I didn’t get the memo the first time until she had to explicitly state it. I was basically cheated on and I didn’t know what to do but I was distraught. She said she needed someone physically there and we did play Xbox afterwards (during the breakup), but I just couldn’t with her. I still loved her like no one would believe. I thought of ways to get her back but did nothing in the end. Three days later she came back to me saying how she did soul searching and she profusely apologized and begged me to take her back. We talked for two days and began dating again. She wanted me to call her names or demand something to prove her love/loyalty, but I didn’t want that and said you feel bad enough, lets work from there and put it behind us. Yea I was hurt she did it, but she was my everything to me, I could overlook some hiccup for literally my dream girl.

We became VERY close after this. She knew I didn’t care about what she did or what happened to her, just that I loved her, and I wanted to be with her. Our sense of humor, personalities, sass, etc. all sparked like I never see it before. It felt almost scripted like a cliché Jim and Pam thing, but it was real, and we both loved it. I began skyping her to bed and she wouldn’t turn on her camera because she thought she was ugly, which I always told her she wasn’t, but I did and she always thought I was adorable, and I said the same to her. Everything was just so perfect. we have never argued, and we only had that one bump. There were times during our Skype sessions where she was just be quite and I could feel her staring at me since her camera wasn't on, and I would look at the camera do the quick up and down up and down of the eyebrows and she would just squeal into her pillow. I can still her that in my head, along with hearing her laugh, red cheeked smile, etc. again she was perfect to me.

The following December one day I was felling iffy from the beginning of a sinus infection, and when that happens to me my body temp. fluctuates, and I become slightly paranoid. When there was some confusion between her and I over something small she broke up with me. We literally went from talking on the phone ending with I love you the night before to now it’s over. I couldn’t tell you how much I apologized to her. How bad I felt. I was trying everything to get her to talk to me. When I asked for what did I do, how can I make it better, she replied “personal reasons”. I’m going to be honest I got low. Damn near close to depression if not at there slowly over the next few months. We did get back together for like 2 days and then she broke up with me again saying she did a lot of irreversible damage (referencing back to decision making and bipolar. I believe that her bipolar hit along with her thinking shes not good enough, and made a rash decision and thought I would never take her back and just double downed on the breakup)

I remember for the next 6 to 8 months I check my phone hoping she would text me but she never did. I hated myself for doing something. I didn’t know what I did but I did something. I also remember that during this I convinced her to answer yes or no questions where I found out that she still loves me, there wasn’t someone else, she misses me, it wasn’t my fault, and we cant get back together. This didn’t help me at all since I still blamed myself for months, years after it ended, but some major things happened:

She over the next few years would all of a sudden talk to me like we might get back together and everything would be ok, and we gave attention to each other for like two or three weeks then bam I would get nothing from her. This happened like 7 times over the course of 3 years and it just made be feel emotionally used like she was using me to get over me and wasn’t allowing me to really get over her or really move on since when I became close to the idea she would pop up and all this affection and attention I missed. In the beginning I accepted it attention but later I would play it back.

During this attention spree when I was playing Just Cause 4 (I really need to stop playing those games huh) and we were chatting through the Xbox app and she told me how much she missed me and loved me and even wrote a poem for me basically saying the same. H was 17 I was 18 at the time and I just didn’t know what to do or say but later as I said before the attention would just stop suddenly. There were other things that she did but that just added on how much she still felt for me. OH side note during one December she told me that guy #4 was starting to get mentally abusive and at the first sign she ditched him and left. She never told me what it was but still she lied to me when she said he wasn’t abusive the day prior (she told me after because she said she felt bad lying).

I did send her two long angry messages and told her that I don’t think she appreciates what I did for her over the course of these years which I have apologized a lot for. I still feel bad for them and she understood what I was going through. I was basically depressed, missed her and didn’t like the fact of being emotionally used and just put on hold until the next attention session. But I did miss her and its not an excuse for what I said out of anger or emotion.

When we last talked or right around there was during me senior year and we would makes jokes dating again. When she dated a guy, she told me how he demanded sex, or he was breaking it off and she ended it off I just felt terrible. Just wanted her to be mine again. When I told her I was talk to a girl she would get jealous like we were dating. Wanted to know who was prettier, who had bigger boobs etc. but again she was perfect in my eyes after everything. We ending off this final time by her saying that she felt bad for me dad getting sick ( he was for a year and a half but is now recently healthy again) and that we have gone down different roads and been through so much and we should just not talk, which I replied “very mature alrighty”. That was on October 25, 2018.

Can’t tell you how much I miss her. I tried to get myself back out there since now I’m in college and meeting people in class and on tinder but with on success yet (which is fine) but I can’t stop comparing every girl I talk to (in my head) to H. H was perfect for me and I don’t know what to do after all these years.

I don’t know if I’m in love with her or in love with the relationship or with the idea of her. But every time of think of her I think of us being happy in that apartment or on the land her grandparents own and just having kids and being happy. So I thought off four things and I want advice on what I should do:

Option 1: Give up and walk away. This one is straightforward and just me moving on. But for some reason I can’t, I just feel like I need to be there for her or that one day we will be back together. I know what if she wanted me, she would message me, but I don’t think she would with her bipolar and I’m not good enough mindset. Even if that’s over, I don’t think if she wanted me, she would message me and that scares me.

Option 2: In about a year I’m about to start applying for internships next summer (2021). Seeing as she lives in a big city my degree would work there and I could work there. I would say hey let’s meet and talk as i would apply for jobs there (whether I get an offer or not). Just to give it one final face to face and just talk. tell her how i feel and just get feedback from her if she decides she wants to meet. We have never met in real life, but I think If we did it would go well (hopefully).

Option 3: With the whole internship thing in maybe just sending her a message in roughly in a year saying how well we sparked, the life we dreamed of, the apartment/house can be real during and after my internship. if we don’t work out id rather fail with us giving it a real face to face shot then spend the rest of my life wondering. Along with if she is ever in trouble again, whether it be tomorrow, 1 year, 10 years, or even 100 years, just text me and I will always help her. If she doesn’t reply, then that’s it I would be go to option 1, if she tells me no then option 1, otherwise then I’ll see what happens.

Option 4: When we were dating, she sent me her address and I have the screenshot on my phone still. Maybe I would just show up (if she still lived there) and just be like hey let’s talk. I think this would be way to pushy or just weird and would just want feedback on it. I would just tell her how I feel etc. I don't want to come off an an incel/""nice guy"" so yea.

This is roughly everything with me skipping over some minor details for simplification. I just want to know what to do. What do you guys think, I been grieving for years and I just want some advice/guidance. I’m 20 now and still can’t get her out of my head. Some days/maybe a few weeks I can but I can’t other days. Maybe if you love something it will come back right?",11Jan2020,1

807,"Hi. I'm 18F and a huge lesbian. Ever since I was sexually assaulted at 15 by a close female friend my idea of love has been tainted. 

I knew who I was long before that and when I came out at my conservative school... lets just say it caused a lot of mixed emotions. This person (who assaulted me) acted as a ""savior"" when I was suicidal from the harassment at 12 and struck after 3 years when I fully trusted them. And yes they did psychologically abuse me and blackmailed my name to everyone they could in town, even getting others to help them. Ever since that and other traumatic incidences, I felt the need to tell everyone my story so I took to social media because my family didn't seek justice and I was stupid. 

Now I catch myself lying to avoid telling the truth about my sexual interests when I'm around a potential partner. I crave attention and affection in a loving relationship but even going to therapy now, I'm terrified of dating apps or getting close to someone who knows they could possibly have sex with me. I've dated since the incident thanks to substances but all of those relationships just make me question girls my age more because most of them sucked. I feel like I don't belong and I feel like I don't deserve anyone. Especially after my family took me out of public school because of the harassment and I deleted my instagram after being stalked. Blocking people just wasn't working but I can't go back on that. 

I hope going to college will make everything different but the wait is agony. I do have friends who respect me now, but they have boyfriends already and they have eventful lives. I'm trying to get antidepressants and I'm trying to make my mother take me to get a license to go to work again. I just hate  this battle I'm having with finding someone who is like me who will respect me and love me.",11Jan2020,1
808,"I would really appreciate some feedback. I'm very confused and need advice. I am 18F and my best friend is 18M, we will call him Tom. Tom and I met online through mutual friends when we were 12. My friend group that I played video games with had eventually led to us talking and becoming best friends. He became like family to me, as my other friends did too. We would play games and skype all the time. I grew up in an abusive household and sought the internet for comfort. I also struggled with bullying at school. He could relate, so we helped eachother grow. He became the brother I never had. 
Flash forward now, I'm finally a legal adult with my own place and my own car. I planned to go drive 11 hours to meet my friends in person, something I had dreamed about for years. Although as of last night, things became rather difficult and made me revaluate my course of action. Tom and I were talking about my writing as he asked to see some of my poetry. Long story short, he read it and started saying how he wanted me to write about him and he wanted me to love him romantically. Keep in mind it has always been platonic and it was well known and clear that I had no romantic feelings for him. I truly love him, but just as how you would love your sibling. I tried to politely tell him that I wasnt interested in him like that, in which he started to get a bit agressive and say things like ""why not. I want you to love me romantically, you know this now.""  Over and over, even after I asserted my position.  He proceeded to say this:

""I've loved you for almost over 5 years or so. when I see girls who are blonde it instantly makes me think of you and there's a lot of blonde women in the world. I say prayers every night for you. I'd be okay with just having sexual relations with you. I don't care ab dating or anything like that. don't want kids or nun, I just want to feel like I can connect with someone like minded and who makes me feel like I'm supposed to be here.""

He also started randomly bringing up any of my friends who were male and saying very mean things about them, claiming they were ""chads"" or more attractive than him, and making me feel guilty for saying I dont reciprocate the feelings. I dont know what to do. I am at loss. I do not want to lose one of my closest people in my life, but I cant go on like this, it feels very manipulative the way he pressures me about not loving him and repeatedly asking why I cant, or why I cant just have sex with him. I know this is starting to be toxic, but at the same time I struggle to see what is an appropriate move from here. It hurts me, and I also feel bad because I know he is also hurt.

818,"This is more of a personal issue than it is about relationships with others, its about my relationship with myself.

I (22M) will make this really short, cos there's a lot to explain. When I was 18, I went off to university in a small city. I was fat, socially anxious and depressed. I then discovered drinking, learned how to socialize, lost a lot of weight/got into shape and made new friends. 

However, I still had mental blocks. I wasn't able to have sex with any girls who showed interest cos i self sabotaged. My dependency on alcohol grew worse. I began to fall out with friends. Etc. By my 3rd year of undergrad, things got bad. My alcohol drinking turned into alcoholism, and my best friend basically betrayed me. I still didn't fuck any girls, and my self esteem was in the toilet. I was trapped. 

I was able to somewhat pull myself together to sit my final exams, but the day after my final exam, I went back to my hometown and never went back (only went back for graduation, then quickly went home).

I've since quit alcohol (474 days sober), went to therapy to deal with my traums and improve self esteem, confronted uni friends who betrayed me and resolved things with them, and increased my sexual confidence (nofap + seeing prostitutes, dw they're legal in my country). 

I did my masters degree in another city. Basically since summer of 2018, I never went back to my original uni city. Most of my friends from that place have since graduated and moved on. I still have some friends there though, so I can go back and get a place to stay.

**Basically, I feel like its 'unfinished business' with my university city. I feel like I ran away from the place. Things got hard for me and the place seemed like a prison, and I just sat my exam, went home and never came back. However I'm beginning to remember a lot of nostalgia for the place. I did have many good times there. I never wanted to end my undergrad on such a sour and depressing note. But I did. Most people went through their drama at university but graduated on good terms with people. I didn't. Even though I feel better now....I still look back and have an urge to go back to the place, but hold myself back. What do I do?**",11Jan2020,1

821,"Basically I matched with someone on tinder a while ago and spoke with them briefly before I unmatched them as they way they were talking to me turned me off them.
Then a while afterwards on Instagram I recognised the guy from tinder in a tagged photo, except he had a different name. Completely different name same exact pictures, the guy on Instagram is a DJ he’s legit and posts regularly. The tinder account used 4 photos of him from his Instagram that were all about a year old. 
I’ve recently got tinder again and this fake account came up again. Now I know the actual guys instagram I don’t know if I should message him with screenshots to let him know someone’s created a fake account with his pictures. 
Also the way the fake account was speaking while using the others guys identity got pretty creepy/gross at a point, that’s why I unmatched, so it could be particularly bad for him if someone recognised him from tinder in the street but obviously it isn’t actually him.

I feel as though it’s the right thing to do to message the actual guy on Instagram but I don’t know him personally and I’m not sure how he’ll respond, I thought it could possibly be him on tinder but maybe he’s using a middle name or just using a fake name.

828,"Hey everyone, this is my first post on reddit ever, but i figured this is the only place I could find real advice.
So I was at an institute for 3 years, and my life was really just not great. It felt like I won the lottery when I was told, that I could move back with my dad. (He was an alcoholic prior, before people start thinking I'm a troublemaker.

So I started in school close to where I live now, and life was great. I quickly joined a group of friends that I had great chemistry with. Now, I look a little different than your norms, and one of the friends mother saw me once. All of my friends parents are really close, and already there they were all told, to not be with me. They ignored it, because they obviously liked spending time with me.

Fast forward a bit, I was throwing a party, and I invited all of my friends from that group, and 15-20 more people too. We had to make up a lie about visiting me, since their parents would not approve of it. We were caught before the party started, but they all decided to give me a chance at proving myself, and we had a great party! (I only experienced a smashed door, but we all came together and fixed it the next day).

Now, my dad came home and was a bit drunk from a night out. He claimed that it looked like shit, and there was no way me and 5 friends cleaned it up. (It looked exactly the way he left.) He quickly messaged my teacher, who ended up talking to every single one at my party. Now for some reason, 2 or 3 people claimed that there was drugs at the party, which there was, a guy with weed who i threw out. My friends' parents quickly banded together and banned me from being seen with them. I thought i'd try myself and talk to them individually, and It went well. They were only banned from being at my house, which was perfectly fine and acceptable.
We hit christmas, and we all had to spend new years away from each other for different reasons. One being that I was banned from partying with my 2 best of friends. We'll call them Jay and Peter.

So Jay's mom is a school teacher, and she never really liked me. I've been at Jay's house a few times, and talking to her, she didn't have anything against me. Neither did Peter's mom.

So I had a conversation with Peter, because he was throwing a birthday party in a few weeks from now. He mentioned that I again, for some reason, was banned from being seen with them again, and that I was influencing them all in a negative way. (I only smoke cigarettes, and I never forced them, and I'm even attempting to quit.)

Here I am now, I have no friends, and I just feel like I still live at my institute, a reall hell to say the least. As I'm writing this, they're all together with the same people who were at my place, without me. It just makes me feel irrelevant, and I honestly don't know what I can do. I don't know how I an influencing anyone in a negative matter, and even taking it to my own hands, just ends up getting worse apparently. 

What can I do? I hate this feeling, I'm honestly getting depressed because of this. It's like being handed freedom for the first time in 15 years, and then it all get stolen. I feel like I fought with every tool I can, but I always end up being left alone. Like I don't matter.",11Jan2020,1
829,"So me(F15) and two of my friends (F15) and (M15) used to be a group. I have noticed that the girl is a bit weird, for example; she said that she thinks that it's not important to love your parents, becuse they are only there to make food for you. 
So the school started and after one week she stopped coming to school. She wasn't active on her phone, and after about 3 weeks she said that she is hospitalised becuse of depression. And then.... the boy found her secret reddit. She was making a bunch of texts in which she was idolising Dylan &amp; Eric(mass school shooters) and other weird stuff. So we created a catfish profile, and chated with her. She said that she wants to bring a knife to school, STAB as many people as possible and kill herself after. 

 So the boy stopped talking to her, she still doesn't know about the catfish and she is becoming more and more selfish. For example: she only wants to talk about her problems and wouldn't listen to mine. So now the problem is THAT SHE WANTS TO GO TO THE SAME MIDDLE SCHOOL AS ME. I can't go to any other school. I don't like her. WHAT TO DO?!",11Jan2020,1

831,"I[31M] dated my ex [28F] for almost 5 years. We lived together for about 3 years of that time. She ended things with me in February due to my drinking and behavior. We briefly decided to reconcile in the summer, and it didn’t last.

I have two children from a previous marriage, [9F] and [13M]. I have joint custody(1 day during the week, every other weekend, Christmas breaks, summer break, etc.) My ex wanted to continue to stay in their lives when we broke up, but I wouldn’t allow it. I couldn’t handle her being in their lives if we weren’t going to be together. It was too hard for me.

During our time apart. We’ve both improved ourselves. She’s gotten a place of her own. She moved about 20-30 minutes away to the town she works in. She went back to school. She spends a lot of time with friends and family. I’ve gotten a really good job. I got help for my drinking. I have been diagnosed with PTSD(due to a past accident) and depression. I’m about to buy a house for myself and my kids. I am focusing on my children and making memories with them. My ex always tried to help with these issues. She did a lot for my family and for me. 

We didn’t speak for months due to my drunken behavior. But I recently reached out to her to tell her my diagnosis and all the changes I’ve been making. I wanted to thank her for all she did. She blames herself for everything and I wanted to apologize for the things I’ve put her through, because it’s been a lot. But most of all I want to start over. I want to marry her. I want to be a family again.

She says that part of the reason she left was that she didn’t want the kids to see an unhealthy relationship. She misses them very much but said she doesn’t know how we could ever explain her being gone for almost a year. She is very supportive of me getting help and tells me to focus on my kids and staying sober. We talked about PTSD and I hoped it explained why certain things happened the way they happened.

She’s the best thing for me and my kids. I want to completely start over. But she says she doesn’t know if it would be healthy. I want her to know it will be.

Is starting over possible? Or is this a lost cause?

Also, what is the best way to handle this with the kids?",11Jan2020,1
833,"This may sound kind of silly and unimportant but I’m at a crossroad. I’m 20F and my boyfriend is 23M. He has been out off college for a couple years and is currently working as a teacher. He enjoys it and I’m glad. We have been dating for a little over a year and a half, started dating right after he graduated from school. I am still in college and will graduate next May (May 2021). 

We met through a mutual friend a year prior when he was still seeing an ex, and when we started seeing each other it was more FWB than actual dates. I would show up at his house after work we would hang out, he played video games while I just scrolled on my phone, then we would have sex go to bed then wake up and both go to school/work. 

Eventually things went on and we started to have more feelings and started “dating” after a few months of official dating he asked me to move in with him. I kept saying no because I was in school most of the time which is 3.5 hours away from his apartment. But during breaks I stay with him.

Here is the issue. We have no hobbies. He says his work life is work and social is social. Which is cool I understand. So he doesn’t really tell me much about his job. And he doesn’t really like when I tell him about my schooling or stuff going on at my campus or stuff with my college friends. So a big portion of my life I don’t often get to share with him because of this and he doesn’t share with me. 

When he gets home from work and if I’m at the apartment we eat dinner and then sit around then he will play video games and I just sit around or do school work. 

If it’s the weekend he does coach and I go to all of the games because I like to support him and watch the students play. This is the second “school year” of me going to the games and I actually really enjoy them. But I also get confused with the rules so in our spare time I ask him a lot of questions about the game play and why certain things happen. He will usually answer one or two questions but then will get annoyed and very snippy. And I know i could just go online and look them up but I figured it would be a good bonding experience if he helped me understand or explained them to me. 

He’s also a know it all. If I bring anything up he always corrects it, or says he knows about it. Or if I explain something and get a little portion of it out of order or wrong he has to correct me. And I really struggle because I consider myself smart. Not to brag but I go to college and in high school I had very high grades, I’m currently studying mathematics and anthropology, studying to take the first of the Actuarial exams, and looking into a masters data analytics program in a very good school recognized around the country. And no matter any of my accomplishments or what I know, he always makes me feel dumb. I am ditzy, and I know that, but he legitimately makes me feel like I’m stupid. 

I really like to do things. Not like go out and do extreme and expensive things all the time. No sir. I like to play card games, go for walks, go on hikes, play bird games, go to museums, take pictures, etc. When I’m at school I’m hanging out with the other math majors and going to hockey games or other sports events just to be around people. If it’s late at night we literally just walk around the grocery store by our campus to do something. 

In my relationship we really don’t do anything. We will play some video games together but other than that we don’t do anything. And I’ve been in winter break since the second week of December and everyday he goes to work and I stay at the house. I clean get stuff ready for dinner, do my applications for summer, coordinate with my friends at school about events and what we need to do for the clubs we are in. It’s when he comes home and we do nothing. And weekends we do nothing. And he tells me he’s just bad at planning things and that’s fine but when I bring things up he still doesn’t want to do them. 

Doing nothing every once in a while is fine but when you do nothing for days it gets excessive. He also had is winter break for two weeks for Christmas and we spent from December 26th to January 6th in the house doing nothing besides sleeping in, eating, and the occasional video games. 

TL:DR

My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit now. We have no hobbies and limited time when we are together because I’m still in college and he is 3.5 hours away. I’ve tried to bring it up to him before but he doesn’t seem to recognize how us sharing nothing makes me feel. I don’t know how to communicate and he gets extreme irritated when I get quiet and “depressed”. 

Any advice?",11Jan2020,1
834,"So I’ve liked this guy for almost 2 years  (yikes) and he is the sweetest. He always does little things that make me so happy. For some backstory we are both swimmers and get around the same times(him being slightly faster), but he has been swimming for 7/8 years and I have for 4 years. All of our friends have always said that we should date for years now because we are so close. Recently, one of my friends said “aren’t you and J dating” I responded “what no?” Being honest I stopped liking him for about 2 months before this happened. I then learned from that friend that B (another friend) kept saying that we were probably secretly dating. I got so shy because those feelings started coming back after I talked to him again. I then saw her again at a swim meet recently where she came up to us (interrupting our conversation btw) and said “you guys should be a couple” and ran. We both acted like we didn’t hear what she said and things haven’t been awkward because we have heard it before. I honestly had pretty much sorted my feelings out after all of this that we should just stay friends, then I walk by him and hear him tell his friends what he knows about me.(extra info - we’ve had conversations on dating (not about each other) but both have said we don’t feel ready) (also his friends have implied he likes me )

This is really embarrassing so that’s why for obvious reasons I’m on a throwaway

TLDR; I like a boy, he’s shown signs of liking me back, but everyone keeps pressuring us and neither of us feel ready to date.

Should I wait to ask him out when he seems more ready ? 
Any ideas will help lol (sorry if this is cringe I just needed to get it out)",11Jan2020,1

837,"This past September, my parents and I made an agreement for me to come live back at home after living with a friend for a year. It was an oral agreement that I am to pay $200 a month, and would have until September 1st of this year to move into my own apartment. I have been at odds with my parents for the better part of last decade, and a recent argument has lead them to constantly telling me I have until March now to move out or I’ll be kicked out. I’m 21, and I just got a well paying job in august after being stuck at a Dunkin Donuts for a year, but money is still thin because I’m trying to pay off all of the school debt I accumulated. They know that I am planning with a friend to get an apartment in June, after he graduates.  It would also help to mention we live in New York State, so I would just like to know what my rights are and if they are allowed to just change the end of the oral agreements original date.",11Jan2020,1
838,"There’s a boy that I was very interested in, but he was dating, so I simple forgot his existence. But then one day I found that he had broke up (It was a 2-year-old relationship) and I asked to a friend that we have in common to invite him to a little party that I was throwing at my house. 

So he came and we drank a lot and he hit on a bunch of friends of mine that refused him until he came hitting on me, and than we kissed for the whole night and he said that I am beautiful and hot and that he was going to send me messages asking me out and these kinda things (we live very close to each other) - deep down I knew that he only said that to make me do things with him so I stayed strong and did not let it happen, but I said that I would like that he messages me.

So the party ended and i feel asleep with the hope that he would do what he said.

oh
my
god

I’m so dumb

He didn’t.

But I was so deluded by him that I tried to make the first move and follow him on Instagram, that was private (omg such a big steeeep :O). 
Okay. He followed me back like i knew he would.

The other time that we met each other was at another party, we complimented like total strangers and I was hoping for him to hit on me again, but it was getting late so I decided to take the wheel. Okay so I don’t remember exactly what I said because I was a little bit really drunk but I guess that I said “Man, are you going to kiss me or not?” I *think* that he responded “I don’t know”. CAN YOU BELIEVE 

I DON’T FUCKING KNOW

But 2 seconds later he kissed me anyways, but this time it didn’t lasted long and he went away saying that he was going to the bathroom or whatever- I really don’t remember.

Okay so in the next day I was thinking about making the THIRD move (jesus i’m so dumb) and send a message to him but at the same way pretending that I wasn’t that interested in him so I asked If I hit on him last night and what did I said to him. He said that i did and it and that he wasn’t in the mood that night and that he wanted to be with his friends.

Okay, he was very nice with me, but in fact I wanted him to invite me to his place so we could FUCK lol, because I live very close to him and my dad isn’t letting me do anything far away from here. So I said it to his friends at that party when I was drunk and they advised me to say that to him, that he wouldn’t refuse a proposal like that.

So It took me A LOT of courage to make THE FUCKING FOURTH MOVE, but i did it.

That was a success for a moment, even his friend confirmed to me that It was right that he was going to call me to his crib.

BUT THEN, when I sent a happy birthday message to one of his friends that I talked to, he asked me how it was going on with him and I said that I didn’t know exactly, so I asked him what he said and he said that he wasn’t going to call me because he didn’t wanted a relationship at the moment.

Okay I got it but the problem is: I don’t want a relationship neither, I WANT SEX, just it, but I got the message and forgot him.

UNTIL

I FOUND THAT

HE  HAD UNFOLLOWED ME AND TOOK ME OUT OF HIS FOLLOWERS FOR NO REASON, so I freaked out with myself like what did I do that made him do that??

So that’s the part where I need advices, because I don’t know if he thought that I was crazy or something and wanted to be away from me or if he was afraid of liking me, by the fact that he had maybe got traumatized by his last relationship. In the second case: I didn’t meant to have anything further than casual sex with him.",11Jan2020,1
839,"This post is not the usual ""Oh I got rejected I'm sad help"" 

Long story short I've been crushing on my female friend. After 2 months of crushing my Male friends pressured me so much to ask her out after they figured out that I had a crush on her. So I did about a month ago (December 6th) if you look in my post history you'll see on that date I posted some posts to seek some advice. 

Well I'm just going to face it now because I am tired of trying to deter the fact. Yes, she rejected me. But that's not where the story ends. 

During December I was hit with a constant bad heartache and often I'd get sick thinking about how she rejected me and that meant more than just another girl refusing to date another guy. Our agreement that day was to forget about it and move on as friends, but doing that is another fight itself. I'm just always fighting with myself and this is really impacting my life in all sort of ways, academically and socially. 

When I picked up some clues that she might be crushing on someone else and starting to distance herself away from me, I felt like I got rejected by the same person not once but twice. If she begins to date him it would be the third rejection from a single person. 

Those thoughts just terrifies me and I'm always trapped in this endless list of thoughts like ""what does he have that I don't?"" ""Am I not good enough?"" ""Was he the reason for my rejection?"" Etc. And one thing good here was that he wasn't my close friends but still. I know I shouldn't be jealous of him but I can't help myself do the right thing and think and act the right way. 

I miss the feeling of crushing because crushing can be really enjoyable most of the times. I miss being her friend, I miss being free not locked in this room of rejection and these endless thoughts that terrifies me. 

Please tell me how to get through this a better way than how I am handling this right now. Any suggestions and advices would be a blessing.....",11Jan2020,1

846,"So my friend (Liz) has been with (Tyler) for 2 years. Well before tyler was with liz he was dating (Carly) who was 3 months pregnant by someone else, they dated her pregnancy &amp; until the baby was 6m old. Tyler &amp; Carly got married but Carly ended up getting back with the childs actual father. So thats when Tyler started dating Liz. The baby came maybe two more times and then fizzled out. (Carly ended up having another baby with the baby dad) 

A year goes by, Liz &amp; Tyler want to get married so they reach out to carly, they get divorced, its over. Oct 2019 Liz randomly adds Carly as a friend on fb just to see if shell accept it cause she wants to rub in her face that Tyler and her are getting married Nov 2019. Carly accepts &amp; messages to find out why she added her. They talked for a week and it gets brought up about hanging out and letting the son who is now 3 yrs old get to know Tyler &amp; be back in his life. 

Liz has talked so much smack to and about this girl to anyone that will listen. Tyler has told horror stories about how shes manipulative and so on. 

They keep talking through nov, liz and tyler buy them (the two kids &amp; carly) tons of christmas things and they finally meet up and hang out for a few hours. Carly tells them she wants to move closer so both kids can see them more. She comes back one more time to let theses two random kids meet &amp; hang out with liz and tylers families. 

I should mention that Liz wants to have a baby but she hasnt had any luck..So AITA for thinking this is all just totally weird and theres no reason for it? 

These poor kids have no idea who this man or their whole families are. He cried and cried when Carly &amp; Liz forced Tyler to change his diaper to “catch up on the diapers he missed” They facetime every now and then &amp; not even 3 months later they are trying to get BOTH kids to call them mom and dad? 

Maybe I just think its weird cause im a mom myself and I couldnt imagine introducing my son to practically strangers and being like ya take em both for a week, the weekend, or out to do whatever alone. ESPICAlly knowing the mother has said some pretty nasty things about me.  

Its not even been three months and Carly has asked them to borrow money, be towed, pay her phone bill, to keep the kids for a week cause she cant afford the baby sitter &amp; they did it all.It feels like shes just using them &amp; my friend is so desperate for a baby she’s ignoring all the weirdness 

&amp; tonight really annoyed me to the point of saying all this. The older child is sick and was rushed to a major children’s hospital, Carly messaged and asked Liz to come up there and sit with him while she ran to get food &amp; Liz did.

851,"im 19 and currently in community college, i was going to transfer to a university in japan to finish my academics for about 2-3 years next year in december, until i realized i may not be able to bring my dog with me for various reasons. my dog is a major part of my life, as i've grown up with her and she has formed an extremely close bond with me. it would break my heart to even be away from her for more than a few days.

information about my dog if it helps, she's under 18 lbs, medium/small dog. never bitten anyone before (unless you're playing with her, she'll play bite), absolute sweetheart. she's turning 12 in 3 months from now.  chihuahua/basenji mix. life expectancy for her breed is about 13-16 years, but she's still flawless with health problems and runs around like she did when she was a puppy, so i'm hoping she'll last another 3-6 years. 

i've done prior research about bringing dogs into japan, and the process is pretty lengthy and takes about 10 months to complete to ENSURE she doesn't end up in quarantine for more than 2-3 days since japan sometimes keeps animals in quarantine for months. my parents are trying to convince me that she's too old to get several shots done, and it will stress her out with quarantine. they also keep bringing up expenses, but i will pay all of it as long as she gets to be with me in the end. what should i do about this?? 

here's some pics of her just because lol https://imgur.com/a/WEKAegj

any feedback would be much appreciated, as much as i want to move asap my dog's wellbeing and happiness is one of my top priorities and i'd never trade her for anything else in the world. i know some people are probably going to see me as stupid for holding off my education for a dog, but she matters a lot more to me than most people in my life and i want to be there for her, as she’s always been there for me.

what i’m asking for here is advice, should i stay where i am now until my dog passes away to continue my academics, or leave now and hope she’ll still be here in 3-4 years. i don’t have too many options, unless she’s actually not “too old” for shots and i can bring her along. sorry for the wall of text, many thanks in advance.

853,"Throw away account because I just need some help. TL:DR will be at the bottom.

My husband and I have been together for a very long time. 7 years. Doesn't seem like a lot, but I'm only 23 so kind of is. When we first got together I made it very clear that there were certain things I needed in a relationship to make it last long term. I had an extremely abusive childhood so certain things in life I am completely against as a result. The basics were No drinking around kids EVER. No smoking at all, and no illegal drug use. My husband was very understanding and very about that as well.
When we moved out of our parents house we moved in together. Right away we had problems. We were in a tight living space and neither of us had a lot of friends to get away from each other so we were together every second of every day. We had a lot of fights and they gradually started to get physical. When I got pregnant with our first I assumed things would change at least a little. They did not. Because I was pregnant I did not start an fights with my husband, but he would still sometimes get angry enough to hit me. Very shortly after we found out I was pregnant my husband quit his job and refused to get anything different. He was just home all the time with video games. When my child was born I barely took any leave I literally went back to work the second my job would let me, and very soon after I got a promotion so we were making more money so we were able to move out of our tiny apartment. The new place gave us both space and my husband has not once hit me since that first apartment, but it changed how I felt about him and I hadn't even realized..at the same time he turned 19 and he got extremely angry about my no smoking rule because he was an adult and wanted to do whatever he wanted and I told him to do whatever he wanted, but not to expect me to stick around as I had made my feelings clear for years. He started smoking anyway, but after a lot of fights and me getting ready to leave he decided it wasn't worth breaking up over and stopped.
Over the next 2 years my husband still refused to get a job or do anything that lasted longer than a few weeks he didn't cook or clean and sometimes I would come home after 7 hours to my child being in the same diaper. I threw myself into work trying to make enough to support us entirely, but as a result really burned myself out and I had a hard time leaving my child knowing my child was not being cared for properly. I ended up getting pregnant again and told my husband he needed to step up and get it together because I could not do it on my own. My husband got a low hour low pay job, but it was something so I was happy. He kept up with it and seemed to like it, but the literally day after our second child was born he quit his job.  Again I took a very short leave and threw myself back into work before I was mentally ready to go back.. He turned 21, and I had been beaten down enough that I let him do whatever he wanted. He was drinking literally every single day just not when I was at work. He was rarely getting drunk, but just drinking beer, seemingly just to spite me and see how far he could push me. I really only stood up for myself when he started bringing pot to my apartment (This is not a debate I support weed, but it is illegal in my state so I am against having it anywhere near me) like flew off the handle threw 60 dollars worth directly into a dumpster and told him to get out of my apartment which didn't last long because he apologized and said he would never do it again. And surprise surprise he did. And again I lost it told him to move out immediately threw everything away and I got the same shit never again. And of course being the way I am I let him stay. Around this point it has been about 4 years since we moved in together and he still has refused to get a steady job. After the upcoming holiday he had a job lined up that seemed really promising he seemed excited about it, and really went for it for a few days, then out of no where he refused to go. That day something broke inside of me. Something just pushed me over the edge I realized that in 4 years I had only gotten gifts (birthday, Christmas, etc) if I had bought them myself. I realized that I had only gotten dates if I had rallied for them and paid for them. I realized that I was working my ass off and getting no where in life because I had a huge weight attached to my leg. I realized that for 8 hours a day my children were ignored and not taken care of and that I was being used. I gave him 30 days to get out of my apartment, but he didn't seem to take me seriously. Nothing changed he made no plans he tried touching and kissing me and letting it all go. For 5 days I let it continue and then I told him to leave immediately. I cut him out completely while he dragged out staying with me, we didn't speak I slept on the floor in my childrens room I didn't cook him anything I packed all of his things and had them waiting for him to go. I felt so much anger. And pain. Another week went by with him living in my apartment before he moved out. I immediately felt better. Like good. So good. On top of the world independent and free. I didn't need any additional support. Nothing in my life had to change to accommodate him not being there. It has been around 3 weeks now since he moved out and I still feel so so good. Well I feel good when he is not calling or texting me. Every single day we argue without fail. He'll call me 15 times in a row and text me over and over again. He got a job and is working towards getting his drivers license finally, and insists on showing me he has changed, but It all feels like a show. Feels like he is trying to get back with me just to go back to how it was. He is always saying how much he misses me and loves me and wants our family to be whole again.. But I just can't buy into it. I realized I have been so truly unhappy in my marriage for so long and now I feel so good. I do recognize that he is trying, and I do very much love him still and even in my good feelings I do miss him.. So the advice I need is what to do next? Do I wait on him to see if he can actually change? Do I let myself go back to what it was? Do I keep pushing forward and hope I feel even better hope I stop loving and missing him? How do I get him to stop calling and texting me over and over without blocking him completely as we need a way to communicate about our children? Any advice on making a divorce cost less as I can't afford much?

TL;DR I had a shitty husband for 4 years who challenged my morals daily and refused to work, I kicked him out, he ""has changed"" and I don't know what to do next..",11Jan2020,1

857,"Hello everyone! So my dilemma has taken me back and forth. I'm currently a college student with 2 new jobs (for one of them i'm still waiting to be scheduled). They're both quite shitty with shitty people but I can rely on them for hours and stability, the last job I had closed down the week of Christmas, and my boss told everybody the day of. I am a fashion major and have had a huge passion for streetwear ever since I could remember. The biggest streetwear store in town offered me a position at their downtown location. They are known to have amazing service, amazing vibes, have weekly events full of creative minds, collab with clubs down the street, and often have celebrities swing by. The problem is, I would be getting less hours there vs. the two jobs I have now, that promise decent hours. I'm still an adult with bills and school debt to pay off. Another huge thing to consider is that i've isolated myself for the past four years due to something that broke my heart and took so much out of me... which, I'm still healing from. I also have an eating disorder I'm trying to recover from. So I would be malnourished, deal with hiding my horrid social anxiety, and get paid less. But, I would be working somewhere I find super awesome and a place where I could network with cool, creative people. I often find myself in positions where opportunities come to me no matter where I am, but still, I would love to be able to work somewhere with people who have things in common with me and where I could constantly make connections.. The answer may be obvious but I guess I just need the guidance, it's just killing me to think of passing this offer up, I really wanted it and thought I was ready to work there but I didn't think I had a chance and have been self destructing for the past 2 weeks due to multiple things. I don't normally ask anyone for help, and I know everyone has their own lives so any input is genuinely appreciated",11Jan2020,1

She also told me that the scars on my arms were disgusting but I still deserved it because I was disgusting myself. I know she was probably thinking irrationally and out of anger, and let it out on me, but I can't shake the feeling that she truly thinks those things about me. Surprisingly, those words didn't even make a dent in my soul, or so I thought. After my adrenaline deescalated it actually started to hurt, both physically and mentally. It hurts a lot, yet I feel numb of emotion, I can't feel anything anymore.

A high school friend of mine who has always been a prick has sent me a message shitting on me and calling me a loser and everything.

This shit honestly irritates me. Why do women allow themselves to be objectified by guys and acc end up giving them what they want in the end?

By no means am I a wimpy, geeky, angry, unattractive guy. I’m acc pretty popular, good looking, athletic, smart... but the difference between me and 99% of guys like me is that I’m nice and not a pig.

I see these attractive women dating the assholes at my high school (I’m in gr12) and it just pisses me off that I can’t get a gf. They entertain me for a couple weeks and forget about me completely.

So the situation is as follows, my family has a couple of credit card debts that they are paying off and I'm a 2* year old college student. I have money from my loans and a little bit from my shitty work. So my parents have asked me if I can give them all my saved up money to help pay off a credit card (they also borrowed 1k for my younger brothers birthday which I don't care about but they promised to payback and so far only 400 ish came back and they also borrowed 2k to pay off another credit card last summer). Now you would think like no problem just give them the money. But you see that money is Majority loans I was planning to use for my next year and partially saved up for my certification exam that costs between 100 200 bucks and also I was planning to buy a new phone because my current one is on its last leg (served me for 2.5 years, but the screen is destroyed and the battery lasts for less then an hour on a good day), I also have college books to buy still as the books are in 100 dollar range and to top it all off I just started dating this girl and she is a borderline amazing in my eyes and I wanna take her on her second date, so overall I need money too. 

Here is where I wanna ask you guys. People wo dont know me and don't know my family, I humbly ask you guys what would you do in my position or just what advice would you have for me.

862,"This morning I was doing schoolwork whilst eavesdropping on a conversation going on downstairs. Around 1 year and a half ago, the apartment was infested with bedbugs. The infestation was on the top floor of the apartment and it was going on since september of 2018. Longstory short; the landlord wanted to do their own DIY treatment of the place, and I was pushing for an exterminator to come in and properly treat the place. The landlord got his way after he threatened me with an eviction notice. 

The tenant  called me insane because of my fear of the bedbugs still being present on the top floor. They live on the bottom floor, and the bottom floor is 100% bedbug free. They played no role in my mission to convince the landlord that they need to hire a professional in order to truly get rid of this problem once and for all. I feel that it is also worth stating that they decided to convince their brother to occupy one of the vacant rooms on the top floor while this was all going on. I am also an introverted individual who suffers from social anxiety and as a result I do not go out that much. She tried to connect my insanity to the fact that I am lonely and do not go out much (which frankly while I spend a lot of my days alone I rarely ever feel lonely). 

Frankly I am furious of how ignorant she is of the entire situation. Not only did they reject my efforts, but now they're trying to convince others in the house to subscribe to their claims. On one hand I want to confront them because this is getting to me and I want to explain how ignorant their claims are. On the other hand, however, I feel that responding will just end up making it worse. I also rarely ever speak to the tenant in question.",11Jan2020,1
863,"Okay, so this is going to be a long story, but I will try my best to describe what happened to me during my first semester of living on a college campus.

It begins with three girls, one of them is my roommate (let's call her Hannah) and the rest live on the same floor as us (let's call them Amy and Olivia). We all became friends very quickly, and we spent almost everyday together. Whether that was going to have dinner or lunch or just hanging out and watching movies in the lounge on our floor, we were always together, and it was amazing. I was so scared on finding friends in a new place, and I was so happy to find people that I felt like I could trust.

Well, here comes the weekend before Thanksgiving break, and we all decided to have a Friendsgiving in Hannah's hometown. While it was stressful, it was also really fun, but I could tell something was off. Everyone started to not talk to me and ignore me when I tried to join the conversation, especially Amy. I started to think over the weekend on whether I did something wrong. I have severe anxiety, and being in a new place, my anxiety was off the charts.

After coming back to the dorms, we started to do homework, and I was in the room alone with Amy, so I asked if I did something wrong and apologized if I did. She told me in a couple of minutes that it was a stressful weekend and I didn't always have to ask if she or the others were okay. I decided to go back to my dorm, and that's when Amy messaged me saying to come back to the dorm so we can have a talk, like adults, with Hannah and Olivia. I walk in, and what came next was the longest two hours of my life.

It started off with them saying that I say ""Are you okay?"" and ""I'm sorry"" way too much and asked why I say them so much. I told that that it's mainly for two reasons. Mostly this one, I'm concerned that something happened to them and they look upset, or two, I somehow did something wrong and I want to see if they would tell me. These are pure anxiety things, which they know I have, and I know that I say them often, but I didn't know it was to the point where it was annoying them. Well, they took that offensively and twisted it where they made me out to be the bad guy. They told me that I should stop saying it. Amy even mentioned that when someone bumps into me that I am overly apologetic. I asked how long have they thought like this. Hannah said a couple of weeks. Next, they started to point out all of my insecurities that I know I have. From my speaking too quietly to me being too much like a marshmallow and how I'm going to get crashed in the real world, no stone was left unturned. Hannah kept on saying ""I know this is going to sound mean, but..."" and continues the statement with another one my flaws and how it's bad. She even said to me that if they didn't address this now, I probably wasn't going to be in the friend group after winter break. I was silent basically during the whole thing, and Hannah kept on asking me how I was feeling. I wanted to shout at them that I feel like fucking shit, but I was silent. I was crying. I felt like such a horrible person. They kept on saying this because they loved me. That they want me to see that I have value. That they don't want me to get hurt. That they wanted me to come stronger. Was this the way to do it though? The one thing that got me the most upset was that they said I didn't open up enough to them, and since they talk about everything with each other that I should open up more to them. I remember opening up about subjects that I only open up to people that I trust and about my mental health. It made me feel like what I told them was insignificant in their eyes. When it finally ended, I was silent and hurt, and they started to make jokes and laugh like nothing ever happened. Other things happened between that and the start of winter break, but this post is already getting really long.

Now, the winter break is over, and I have to go back to the dorms to a roommate and floormates that I don't consider friends anymore. I have two things. One: am I overreacting? Two: Any advice on what I should do?",11Jan2020,1
864,"As I've gotten older since becoming an adult at age 18, I have realized that I am more and more often content with things rather than truly happy with them. I often look to the worst in situations rather than the best they have to offer. It has reached a level of self-awareness where I know I am being so cynical that it is actually turning in to unhappiness with nearly everything. This is not to say things are objectively bad per say, but I haven't felt truly happy about something in a long time.  For me, I thought I would feel it when I got the dream job out of college, it didn't happen. I thought it would happen when I was able to buy my dream car so early, it didn't happen.  I thought it would happen when I finally got in shape and achieved my workout goals, it didn't happen. I take care of myself, dress well, invest, read and educate myself nearly every day. Still no enjoyment. 

Objectively I have so many great things going for me, that to someone on the outside, they think everything must be going great for me, but in reality, I am not happy, and I don't know why. I know many other people have much bigger problems, and I'll be upfront and say I probably sound like a humble brag ungrateful guy, and I acknowledge that, but the end result is the same. I basically have everything I have ever wanted at such a young age and I'm still not happy. I have no goals to really work towards anymore. Maybe I have been too objective with my life and now have no idea how to actually enjoy it. I guess it is akin to what the Joker says in the Dark Knight: ""I'm like a dog chasing cars, I don't know what I would do if I actually ever caught one"".  I find myself at age 26 having accomplished many of my life goals early in life, and now have no idea what to do. 

Most things appear boring or not challenging to me. My personality limits me to avoid spending money or time on things that are not objectively better for me financially or for self-improvement. When I do step out of my comfort zone to try those things, I often find it hard to enjoy them.  I have been working so hard for everything in my life so far that it makes me feel uncomfortable to stop and smell the roses. I can't really relate with my peers around my age with their problems or goals, because they don't apply to me. This makes socializing difficult in my view. I always feel like I don't belong when at social events or similar.  I refrain from pursuing women I am interested in because the only thing I have to offer is having my life together but with no actual interests or personality (at least that is my own view of myself). Not to mention the pool of women I am interested in is very small largely in part because of what I believe to be my ridiculous standards and ego.  Between potential platonic and romantic relationships, I often write others off before I even get to know them, maybe to subconsciously protect myself, or maybe I feel like the people I want to become friends with or date should be just as high quality as everything else in my life is, which makes my standards way too high. It's ironic, because I take pride in what I accomplished but at the same time deem it not good enough to develop relationships with people, because I didn't LIVE life, rather I WORKED through it.  I often laugh at myself and say that I would make a great husband but a terrible boyfriend. Despite all this, I never put anyone down or highlight what I deem to be their flaws, just smile and wave, but no one really knows how much I am being eaten away at inside.

All in all I want to stop being this unhappy, cynical, egotistical guy and actually enjoy life I guess. i want to actually being happy with life, rather than just existing in it. Maybe I am overthinking things, and maybe I am not. In the end, my life seems to have no direction after finally reaching the mountain's peak. I realize there is not a straight forward answer, but I am looking for similar life wisdom and experiences from others they are willing to share. If this is too general or open ended I apologize to the mods in advance.  Thank you.",11Jan2020,1
865,"I am totally lost and am trying to figure out the best thing to do for my baby. I have six year old Irish Setter mix who is the sweetest girl in the world. My mom and I got her from the pound when she was little and we've done everything in our power to give her the best life possible.

Unfortunately, out of desperation we signed for an apartment that was no pets but we've had her in here for several months.

866,"He agrees to meet twice a month with me. 

Today he said he looked through all his old boxes of stuff (because he lies going through all his stuff before he leaves for a trip?) and said he found our old cards and they were sweet and long and elaborate. That he kept every single note and letter and card we exchanged. He said he never did that with anyone else he has dated. 
We reminisced about the fun times we had together. The sweet notes, the long cards, the nice and Elaborate and sweet gifts we have each other. The things we did as teens to hangout or have sex because we couldn’t do because of parents. He said he went to an old spot we randomly had sex in (it turned out to be a driveway and we always laughed about it) recently when we was looking at Christmas lights and thought of that moment. How we used to go and have Christmas with his family and their games they played every year. 


He stayed up like three hours past the time he said he could stay out to talk with me. He took a while to leave my car and I reminded him a few times that he needed to get sleep for work. 

He texted me this after I said I got home safe: “Good! 
It was great seeing you, I always have a good time:) Stay strong with your heavy schedule this week, I know you will though! 
Take care and I look forward to seeing you in a little while!”

We broke up three years ago. We meet every so often to talk about life and just catch up. I basically was a part of his family and am super close with his family.

We broke up to mature. I had issues expressing myself in a way that made my partner feel he could be emotionally open with me and my partner in turn never expressed his feelings with me anymore and couldn’t be emotionally vulnerable. I realized it was my fear of
Being alone that made me act in a way to tear him
Down. I have been alone for three years now and focused on not making someone else the purpose of my life. 
We dated for ten years so there were some bad habits. 

I texted him a random fact about race and the royal family and said he was the only person who would also appreciate this and he said this: 
      “Oh, I am always down for all the fun facts haha, I champion curiosity and random knowledge haha #student4lifelonglearner
#jeopardylikehashtag
I hope those hashtags made sense haha 
Wow I had no idea! I wonder if they’ve tried to keep that a family secret, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did! I agree, it’s silly to get pissy about racial nonsense like that and it only slows human progression down. That’s on par with like Hitler’s release of that portrait of the “perfect Aryan”, only later to be discovered was actually Jewish!”

I think he mentioned jeopardy because we talked about how we always used to play it together and how I still keep up to this day. 

He also had this rubber band on his wrist that he said he would wear and flick himself with it when he would think of me when we were first breaking up so he wouldn’t think about me so much. He still wears that rubber band and that was three years ago when he told me that.

When she is upset with me for not spending time with her or talking to her about things she will use things I have told her as ammunition to hurt me. Or she will put me down and say everything she thinks is negative about me. She never does this to my face, she always says it loud enough near my door for me to hear it (and she does this when I'm sad). I've asked her why she does this and she says it is because she loves me and to snap me out of my sadness.

874,"The contract would open a new aspect of the business and bring recurring work into my employer's doors. Additionally, the first ""job"" as part of this contract would be worth $90,000 - $100,000 in just labour at the bare minimum.

 It's a type of work that I and perhaps one or two others in the business can perform, and the person offering this contract definitely wants me to be doing the majority.

At the same time, taking the contract can bring jobs in that I can't do but others in the business can, therefore I wouldn't be making any sort of wage in that situation.

My current plan was to offer the contract, and with it ask for a percentage of the labour revenue for the first big  job as opposed to my usual, lower wage. Other Jobs that come in that are in my specialization I would perform and ask for a higher rate than what I make doing the more general work. Finally for the work that comes in due to the contract that I can't do myself, I would let that work go to the employer without a cut for me, it seemed impudent to ask for some percentage of the profit from that work, and I don't want to build resentment over time from my employer.

What can I do to fully enjoy my twenties (and also form a clear identity)?",11Jan2020,1

I've seen a baby cockroach atleast once the past 2 nights and don't know what this could mean as it's the first time I've ever seen one that's not an adult.
I've googled what this could mean but every forum or article I've read says I should contact an exterminator immediately because it will only get exponentially worse. I cleaned out my room today and saw no signs of other roaches tho so I have no clue where they could be coming from.

I'm scared to death of them and would really appreciate some advice on how to proceed and whether or not I should call someone in.

Ps. I do have a ps4 on my dresser and have seen that cockroaches have been attracted to the heat it gives off, I'm not sure if they're coming from there or not though.",11Jan2020,1
