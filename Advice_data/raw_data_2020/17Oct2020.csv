1,"I just want to give up. I absolutely hate college. I feel like I'm wasting my time and money. I don't understand anything I'm learning, despite how many times I go for extra help and go for tutoring and put in so much work. I don't enjoy what I'm learning. I just want to give up. I hate math, I hate chemistry, I hate calculus, I hate physics, I don't understand any of it and I feel like puking every time I have to do anything related to any of those subjects or any related subjects. I need help.",17Oct2020,1
2,I haven’t been able to make it to work because roommates got COVID and then i got sick right after for 2 months and I have a rent payment to make on the 1st. I’m also in college and a tuition payment came out unexpectedly so now I’m negative in the bank. I’ve already pulled out my 401k and used my savings but idk what else to do. I can’t get a credit card because no credit and my parents are no help. And I’m going to try to ask for an advance at work... any other advice on what I’d be able to do would be great. Thank y’all.,17Oct2020,1
3," I’m looking for advice on how to find motivation to stick to things and develop a healthy routine. I’m also wondering if anyone has had similar experiences to mine and how you learned to overcome it and actually stick to changing and getting better. 

(Backstory homeschooled, mom left me mostly to my own devices, went back and forth between being overly solicitous and overprotective and being emotionally abusive. Dad worked all the time, was rarely home. Anytime We had conflict with people, or lost interest in an activity mom would just pull from it. Rarely had a consistent schedule growing up.) 

I struggle with major depression and anxiety. I’ve been struggling a lot lately feeling lost and unable to find motivation. I have a long history of getting obsessed with something, spending recklessly on the hobby till I get competent at it and then losing interest and moving on to something else. I’m always coming up with plans to improve my life, take better care of myself, or improve my home, but I never actually follow through. I may start it with really good intentions, and may even stick with it for awhile, but eventually I hit a wall and just lose all motivation and desire to continue and just quit. I genuinely want to change and be better, I just can’t seem to stick to a routine. I even struggle to do things to care for myself on a regular schedule.  I’ve been in therapy, but it doesn’t seem to help. I’ve just been in such a low place lately, and just feeling hopeless that I will ever be able to really change.",17Oct2020,1
4,"I am currently 16. I’ve always been the “good kid” so to speak, i follow most of the “rules” out there. I listen to my parents, like if they tell me to be home by 8 I’ll be home by 8. I don’t cheat or try to cheat on tests in school even when most of the class is cheating (because the teacher doesn’t pay attention) I haven’t had alcohol and probably never will, I haven’t tried any street drugs. Etc etc

Now it’s not that I don’t want to do any of those things I mentioned, it’s just that I’d rather do the thing that is safer and has less consistencies. 

I always hear people say “it’s good to make mistakes because you learn from your mistakes”. Is it bad to not make mistakes to begin with? Should I take a few more “risks” in life?",17Oct2020,1
5,"So, I got a boyfriend at the end of July. 
We started staying together almost right away, but he lives in a 2 bedroom with his cousin and brother and his brothers gf. We have been sleeping on the pull out couch. 
That’s besides the point. 
Once I left to stay with him, my mom started being... well... she would text me the rudest things about me and my boyfriend and our relationship. 
I took him to meet her once but that didn’t go over well. 
So now, my bf and I are moving out together at the end of the month and I’m back at my parents place for the time being and now my relationship with my mom is not the same. 
I’m just wondering if I can do anything to make it better and to talk to my mom like we did before. I don’t want to move and have us not talk at all.",17Oct2020,1
7,"Hello, I am a 26 year old man and I recently started seeing this 23 year old girl. We met more than a month ago and we really hit it off. We’re taking it slow for now and getting to know each other but the more I see her and talk with her the more I feel that I’m really liking her a lot. She is really amazing and I feel we have a really good connection. She’s really Amazing. 

The problem is I was in a long term relationship that ended almost two years ago. I married my ex but our marriage only lasted one year and then we broke up. Its been almost 2 years since we’ve been done but we still haven’t started the divorce process. I was young and stupid when I married her. I was supposed to start the divorce process earlier this year but then with the whole pandemic it put my plans on hold with many offices closing and the uncertainty of what was happening.

I’m not sure where things will go with this new girl I’ve been seeing but I do know I like her a lot and if things get more serious I’m going to have to tell her about my past eventually. I just don’t know whether the earlier I tell her the better or wait sometime. I just don’t know when the right time would be to tell her that I’m technically married but I’m going to be going thru the divorce process. It’s so nerve wracking a part of me thinks she will be understanding because she is very mature and open minded but another part of me feels this will bother her and I’m afraid it’s a deal breaker.

Any advice would be appreciated.",17Oct2020,1

10,"I have a teaching job an hour away. The daily commute is taking its toll, but mine is our only income. Moving will leave us short on money, but on each of my paydays, we have had to do yet another repair on our 12-yr-old vehicle. We do gig work, but it’s not available in the small town we are looking to move to. 

We absolutely hate the house we are in, and with winter coming the house will be even more uncomfortable as well as cause the drive to be longer on icy days... Not to mention more toll on the vehicle which also does not have a fully functioning heater.

I have a loan available for $1000 which would help cover our move, but it’s a ridiculous interest rate so would leave us struggling for longer.

I also have a suspicion that the school might possibly be going full virtual again. If it does, it might only be a few weeks or until January... there is no way to know. But with one vehicle, if we stay and it goes virtual my husband can do more gig work while I do school from home &amp; the commute issues get dropped. But if that doesn’t happen, then we are stuck with a long drive tearing up the car.

Also we have 2 small children - 1 school-age and one not, so childcare costs are a big reason we are somewhat stuck with one income instead of 2.

Do we struggle for a few more months and hope for the best, or move and struggle for longer but in a more comfortable way with more sleep and time together as a family? 

I feel like we are in a lose-lose. After all is said and done, the rent and bills will end up being a wash. The rent is higher, but we will save on gasoline... But of course moving has some upfront extra costs :-(",17Oct2020,1

13,"So I recently ended my friendship with someone for personal reasons. We had planned to go on a trip with another friend a while back, but it never happened because of covid. We decided it would be best if I didn’t go on the trip with them, so I asked to get my money back from the plane ticket. I was told by them that they wouldn’t pay me back until they found a replacement (the tickets are non-refundable, so I didn’t mind.) it’s been about a week now, so I texted one of them to ask if they ever found a replacement and apologized if I sounded pushy at all. They said they did but hadn’t even asked yet. It kind of bothered me, but I really want my money back to pay for other expenses. They told me they wouldn’t pay me back and I had to wait.

Hi, so I don’t really know how to explain this well but lately I’ve been realizing that newer friends tend to see me as disposable. I don’t expect people who are new friends to automatically feel like we’re best friends or that they should have any sort of loyalty to me yet, but it seems like people don’t value me as much as I value them.

I’ve found it hard to make friends in college these past couple years. When I try and befriend girls it’ll go well for a while, but always ends with them seeming like they’ve decided they’re over me. I genuinely don’t think I’ve done anything to offend them, as I try to be very sensitive to others feelings. One day we’ll set plans and then they either repeatedly cancel or just straight up dont show.

I’ve found it easier to befriend guys, but oftentimes I think it’s because they’re mistaking my kindness as romantic interest. I’ve had multiple friendships end when they realize our friendship won’t be turning into whatever they thought it could be. It hurts when you thought someone talked to you bc they liked you as a friend when in reality that’s never what they saw you as. :/

Does anyone have any advice for how to break the pattern and meet new people who won’t treat me like this? I’m getting pretty bored of not having many people to hang out with haha

Thanks! :)",17Oct2020,1
21,"My roommate hasn't left his room barely at all in the past two days. When he did come out to make a sandwich, I could tell he had been in bed all day because he smelled kind of bad and had bed head. He didn't talk to me at all and looked totally dead. He's pale, expressionless, and didn't say anything to me when I asked him what was up. 

I snooped a bit and listened at his door and I could hear him talking to himself about how he's an idiot, a failure, an unmotivated useless person, etc. 

I haven't heard his shower going in a few days, he is barely eating anything, the light in his room is never on, and I haven't heard him laugh from his room once. When he laughs, you can hear it through the whole apartment. It's loud and funny and booming. I haven't heard that it three days now. 

I tried sliding a note under his door telling him that if he needs someone, to talk to me. When he left to throw something away earlier today, I noticed the note was still on his floor. 

What can I do for him? I talked to his Fianceé about it earlier and she said he seemed normal over the phone and while they've been texting. She said the only weird thing is that he's texting less. Which makes me think he's hiding whatever is going on from her. 

I don't want to confront him in a way thatll make him defensive. I just want him to be okay and happy again. He changed from a bubbly, social butterfly who talked a lot and laughed a lot, to a hermit basically overnight. I'm scared for him.",17Oct2020,1

The problem is that I have a bottom K9 tooth that is dead. The tooth rotted and it was very painful to eat for a while until I got a root canal about two months ago. But ever since I got the root canal, my tooth has felt very wobbly and easy to pull out. Now, nearly every day I wiggle on it and feel the urge to rip it out of my mouth.

29,"I (27M) have a 26 year old girlfriend who has a twin brother. They are the same age, and they have this connection that I can't put into words. To quote my girlfriend, ""he is literally a male replica of me, and me ignoring him is like me ignoring myself"". I asked him separately, and he says something similar about her.

He lost his restaurant and place due to covid (the owner was a dear friend of his that lost his life to covid, and the new owner had different plans with the property). My girlfriend told him he can live with us. I used to love having him in the house because he is a chef who makes my house smell like my moms cooking almost all waking hours of the day. Before covid, during ufc events, we would always grab a drink and wings to watch the match. It was fun to watch him and my girlfriends reactions to the fight.  

My issue is that recently I miss alone time with my girlfriend since we mostly spend time with him. I told him, and he told me to tell him when I plan a date, and he will disappear for a few hours and leave us alone with dinner. He does live up to his word, and says that he has some work or is going to a friend's place and leaves. He currently has a deal with another restaurant where he can work and pay for a partial ownership of the restaurant, so he is saving up money. My girlfriend told him that he can stay as long as he needs to for saving up the money. She did consult me when she said this, and at the time I thought it would just be a few weeks or a month or 2 and he would find a place where he can save and be by himself. But I might have heard wrong or something, he is apparently planning on staying till next spring (the scheduled opening of the newer restaurant) as by then the deal he planned is gonna go through. I dont mind helping but I didn't realize it was gonna be this long. How do I tell him that I miss my privacy in our house and tell him to find his own place without looking like I am going back on my word? To be fair, he is a good roommate, cleans up after himself, helps me with repairs around the house, cooks, and gives me alone time with date nights.

30,"A little background - I have been with the company for 2 years and recently (1 month ago) transferred to another plant. I feel like I have been underutilized, and under more scrutiny than any of my peers - it came to a head today when I received a text from work after hours about why I did not check in before I left for the day. I replied with a very simple message stating I had worked longer than usual and got caught up having everything in order for Monday morning. 

More backstory for those interested - I work as a supervisor for a uniform company and have been singled out for the following - not being able to make it into work an hour before my normal schedule (I have tried to compromise at 30 minutes before, and been told it’s unacceptable) not wearing a mask while in my office (alone) not assisting people with tasks that they do alone 99.9% of the time, throwing away ratty (unusable) product, not obeying the big brother system of checking in and out multiple times a day ( my work requires leaving in an instant and traveling as much as 90 minutes away) 

At no point have I been asked for my input on work related matters and less important, has my boss made an attempt to get to know me as a person - so I have a sit down scheduled on Monday bringing the big boss (plant manager) into it, and am looking for advice on how to present my case without (too much) emotion coming through",17Oct2020,1

However of recent we have gotten to know each other and bond really well and feel comfortable already, however past 2 days we have been cuddling and then last night we slept in my bed and cuddled all night and watched films today.

Through the night we got a little playful but all PG-13 (no kissing) and same in the morning but for the 3rd time when I finally went for a deeper move, after 10 or so minute she said “we shouldn’t do this, let’s not complicate shit”

36,"TLDR: My mom surprised us with a puppy with no preparation and then her bf moved in with our dog’s sister from the same litter a month later. Now, no one in the house believes in training but me and it’s hard to train two badly behaving dogs on my own when other members revert to yelling or swinging at them. And I can’t afford the expensive classes by myself as a college student out of work either and my mom can’t or won’t pay for them. 

Now for the long version to give context and hopefully explain myself so it doesn’t look like I’m condoning bad behavior (on the human end). I don’t swing at them. Ever. I’ve pushed them off of me when they bit me before but NEVER have I ever hit them. Clearing that up right now. I’d never hit a dog. The other adult members of the household will in their words “tap” the dogs if they jump up and scratch in the process or bite. I’ve tried to say that it doesn’t help every time something happens but they shrug it off as “no they’re just stubborn”. But luckily that’s rare and the dogs have never been hurt except one time when the two dogs fought and one of them was pulled by their leash. It seemed like it really hurt her I felt so bad. That night I snuck behind my moms back and let her sleep with me bc I felt so bad. I gave her extra treats🥺

Next thing, I’ve brought up the fact that they’re poorly behaving because no one other than me attempts to train them and I started late because I didn’t know how to train them. I would’ve researched that before adopting a dog. But, my mom surprised us with Kilo when she was a little pup at the beginning of quarantine. She hasn’t even bought a collar, dog food, a dog bowl, or ANYTHING yet. Immediately, I took to trying my best with what I already knew to train her and, when my moms bf moved in, Biscuit as well. I taught both of them their names, come, sit, and leave it. But I found that because I was taught the wrong way to train them they only listened to me when I had treats in my hand. And slowly, they stopped listening to me when that happened too. They’d just instinctually sit when they saw I had food and didn’t listen to other commands. 

I also started walking them together early in the morning before I workout because they started fighting really bad (like blood was drawn) and I helped them stop fighting again. But I’m at a plateau. They won’t stop jumping up, the won’t come on command unless they see me with treats, they get aggressive toward other dogs, they pull with their leashes (I’m planning on working on that specifically starting tomorrow), they bite when they get super excited, and they chew EVERYTHING. They destroyed the bottom of their crate they sleep in and started tearing up the cheap tile from the floor too. I’m of course continuing to try my best with new techniques I’m learning online but everything if for puppies who aren’t as bad as my adolescent dogs. Any new advice or resources would be seriously appreciated. 

I’m dealing with mental health issues that affect my day to day, full time school schedule, working out to help with my insomnia and fatigue (I know it doesn’t make sense, hence my frustration), and trying to combat a 2 year bout of disordered eating all at once plus these two dogs. I love them so much I won’t give up on them but I’m starting to lose hope that I’m enough to even help them...

37,"My father passed away recently due to quarantine. Since then, I have learned that my brother recorded video of our father delivering a farewell message. I have never seen this video. I know only of its existence and that my father would have liked for me to see it.

Distressingly, rather than share the video with me, my brother instead gave it to a group of people whom I refer to as a ""cult."" My brother then deleted his copies of the video so that the cult would have full control over its distribution.

The cult have made some demands of me. Although these demands seem to be relatively mundane, I took personal issue at their attempts to control me. When I did not comply, they made threats against me, including the threat to destroy their copy of the recording. I know enough about the group to believe that they will follow through with this plan if I don't adhere to their requirements.

I have not discussed this with my brother. I worry that if I do, he will simply deny the existence of the video in an attempt to avoid the confrontation. I believe that the cult will not require me to do anything that puts me or others at risk of physical harm or financial strain. They are taking a more gradual approach to controlling my life.

I don't want to be under constraint of their whimsy. I also don't want to lose potential access to an important part of memorabilia from my father. I'm already upset with my brother for what he's taken part of, but I remain optimistic that our relationship can be rebuilt in spite of it. If my father's farewell is destroyed as a result of my brother's actions, I don't think I will be able to mend the emotional rift that would be created.

If I don’t come home after work she sends me messages about how I am not helping around the house and how she is my maid even though I literally do all of my chores myself and make my own food and pay rent? I do my laundry I keep my room clean I wash my dishes and then I do additional chores around the house when I have time but she wants me to vaccuum at least once a day right when I get home or sometimes right when I wake up before I get to eat. 

She never listens to any complaint or issue I take with things she does, she turns the conversation into how I am not helping out enough or whatever she thinks I am doing bad at that time (Which usually doesn’t make any sense bc she’s grasping for reasons to complain about me when I’ve already adjusted to meet all of her expectations. There is always something wrong with what I am doing.)

So for such a long time after my grandmother passed, my fat bitch cousin that goes by the name of Tara. Which her number is 609-534-6267, has fuck my mother over by lying to her father (my moms brother) and turning that side of the family against her and us. My Grandmother left the house to my mom and her brother and legal troubles issued. As of August 2019, he passed away suddenly and out of nowhere under mysterious circumstances. We were banned from the funeral because of that bitch did that. Well since that happened the house is now in a legal battle between her and my folks. Well besides letting her child go days without food and same for her little brother, she has sucked family members and family friends of there money saying she didn't have any to pay the funeral and the house bills as well as no money for the baby to eat. So she proceeds to spend money on alcohol and clothes for her because she weights like 400 pounds and has rolls upon rolls, so clothes are expensive. She also forged a loan out under my dead grandmothers name and is forcing it on my parents saying ""it was for them"" via the legal battle. So fast forward to last week when my folks went up north to visit the grave. Well the fat bitch didn't even get a grave marker and is blaming it on Covid. Which Covid didn't exist in August 2019. So my mom posted a status about this and asking why the hell there isn't one at all and one of the turned family members gave my moms number to Tara and she is now harassing my mother.

My mom is a sweet and innocent woman who bends over backwards to help people and would give her shirt off her back to help a homeless person be warm (and has done so before) and helps charities whenever possible even though being disabled and can barely walk. 

I need help proving a point to the whore of Riverside, NJ. She needs to stop fucking every guy in that small town and stop harassing a poor lady but I don't know how to do this or proceed.Thank you all for the advice/help and love you all",17Oct2020,1

42,"I’m 18 years old and hate the ‘work’ thing, I have worked a few jobs and it simply makes me depressed.
My parents want me to work and so do I but nearly nothing that is available to menwill be able to satisfy me, Since corona my whole life has been a mess and I started only playing games and wasting my time.

Only recently I started picking my passion up again which is creating my own stuff through 3d, or even my own game.

I definitely do NOT want to be in the regular ‘life’ i’m someone different and I won’t make it, I am in my second year out of 4 for a degree but I’m not gonna study even higher after this degree because I can’t take college.

I’m currently decent with blender (3d software) but not really good to do anything, because I spend alot of time on learning an engine (ue4) now I feel like I need more money then I already have, to buy things and atleast try to get outmof the state I am in now, I am looking so hard for a job that will not depress me but can’t find one, should I just apply to one and go through it while Inspend the rest of the time on learning more and improving more on blender to sell things there? 
I’m just totally lost and don’t know what to do now, I’m not in need of money since i’m smart with using it so i never run low but time will run out and in a year or 2 I will need to do stuff, also have money, anyone that’s on the same train as me?
I want to work so hard, but picking packages or calling people just makes me depressed on a 9-5 thing, It’s not even that I’m weak to it I can work a 40 work week with college combined but making me so.... feel bad isn’t worth it imo",17Oct2020,1

44,"X-post from different throwaway on r/relationship_advice

My [18M] sister [23F] keeps on putting off plans to hang out and it’s absolutely destroying me

For context: I just moved to LA around 3 weeks ago for University, my sister has lived in LA for about 2 years. We see each other on holidays typically, but I’d like to see her more now that we are both in the same city. We live about an hours drive away from each other.

I love my sister very much, and absolutely adore every second we spend together, and from the times we hang out, we always seem to enjoy eachother’s company.

I saw my sister once the first night I was here, with her boyfriend and my parents. We met in our hotel room for dinner, as we were celebrating her birthday a week prior. We interacted a bit but it wasn’t the same as just hanging out with the two of us individually, which is alright but not ideal. The next day I moved into my college dorm.

To add some info: I’ve had trouble eating before, and the first couple days being at University I didn’t eat at all, and called her for some advice, which ended up working great and I have been eating much more regularly. My sister then invited me to join her during one of her lunch breaks. 

I made the drive up, met her for lunch and was excited to talk to her one on one, but one of her coworkers came by and she invited them to sit down, and spent the majority of time just interacting with them until she left to go back to work. Mind you, I spent 2 hours total commuting to and from her place of work to be largely ignored for 45 minutes with only a few individual moments here and there. I thought okay, we’ll hang out more often I suppose, so it’s not a big deal. She suggested that we meet up for lunch every other week to which I gladly accepted, to which I also suggested we do something that weekend, which was three days after our lunch. She agreed.

Come the weekend, I asked if she was free and she said yes, she was not doing anything the next day. The next day arrives and I ask when I should swing by. She said that she had some errands to run, including picking up a nintendo switch that she ordered from gamestop. I offered to come with, to which she replied that she had a busy week and just wants to chill. I was pretty upset with this considering she confirmed she was free after work had already ended for her, but I just wrote it off as me being overly emotional and that I should respect her tough week, so I wished her well.

Fast forward two weeks to yesterday (Thursday), the day we were supposed to get lunch (I guess she forgot, but I understand her job is stressful, she’s effectively a permanent shifting substitute teacher at a progressive private school.) We were texting about politics, and I asked her about one of her stances. She called me after work and explained it, which was about 20 minutes of interesting recommendations for books and philosophers to look into. I offered to drive up and buy her and her boyfriend dinner to see her for a little bit, but she said they had to get groceries that night and if we can do tomorrow (Today, Friday). I gladly accepted, making sure to clear my schedule for Friday night (tonight).

I texted her about an hour ago (4:00) asking when I should come over, as it is an hour commute and I should leave early to get there on time. She replied with a simple “I am tired and have had a terrible workweek”, no apology for canceling plans (again), no follow up to meet another time. 

I am completely devastated and have been crying for the past hour. Our father also made similar promises to do stuff with us when we were little, and always made the same excuses. Several of my previous friends have done the same thing to me, and she knows all of this and has told me that if people aren’t willing to put in the effort they are not worth your time. I am more than willing to spend my own time and money if it means getting to see my sister for an hour. I just want to spend time with her.

It’s not my place to say anything, I don’t want to guilt trip her, and I want to respect her personal feelings if she hasn’t been having a good time at work, but I’m still very emotionally distraught, and it’s bringing up all of my bad past experiences with people repeating the same things. I just want to curl up into a ball and die, I feel terrible.

What should I do? Should I tell her how I feel? If I do talk to her about this, how do I communicate with her on this without coming across as guilt trippy? Any help would be appreciated.

TLDR; Sister has been repeatedly cancelling plans last minute, am very distressed and anxious as a result.",17Oct2020,1
46,"So he (16M) and I (17F) have been dating for about two months now, so not very long which is why I wanna get advice before we’re together long term. Here’s the issue: His parents despise me. They’re crazy overprotective and hate that he’s dating an older girl. His mom directly told me she doesn’t like my “aura” and a couple of weeks ago they (his mom and step dad) took his phone and car away from him as a result of us dating (he now has his car and phone back but he can only use his phone to text his parents and be tracked or it’s taken away). They even threatened to send him to his dads. At one point, his step-dad followed me home. His step-dad follows him everywhere now to make sure we aren’t seeing each other. We aren’t allowed to see each other outside of school, so we can only hang out about 20 minutes a day considering we have no classes together unless we hang out with mutual friends and he doesn’t tell his mom I’m there (but we really don’t wanna lie).

Now I know I haven’t made a good case for staying with him yet, so here’s that side. This boy has made me happier than any single person in my life. He makes me laugh hard when I feel like crying, and when I’m feeling insecure he makes me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world. I’m a very long-term serious relationship girl and so is he, so we really know we’re in it for the long run. He’s “broken up” with me because he hated seeing how sad I got when his facial expression would change and he would say “I have to go, (stepdad) is here”, or when he would show up to school after crying and having anxiety attacks at home. His family is having family counselling now and he wants to file for emancipation when he’s 17 (next may).

Anyways, we “broke up” but we still walk each other to class, constantly flirt, and sometimes cuddle. We know we aren’t supposed to because we agreed to be friends til he gets more control in his house but we both care about each other so so much. Cutting him off would be the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. And I’ve broken up with a guy I dated for a year. 

I don’t want to leave him because of the awful things it’ll cause to both of us, but ever since I’ve been in his life, it’s just gotten worse for him at home. 

TL;DR
My boyfriend comes from a borderline abusive home and his parents hate me so they’ve made his home life harder since we’ve begun dating, but he’s singlehandedly the kindest and most selfless boy I’ve ever met and I’m head over heels for him, so I don’t want to break up with him. It’ll cause us both indescribable pain, even if his home life gets better.",17Oct2020,1

Another example is she doesnt seem to show equal enthusiasm about the relatioship as I do.

54,"We just had a conversation where she told me that she had found out that she was Bisexual. Now, I am a very anxious person. Of course the first thing my mind went to is that if she stayed with me she would be unfulfilled or always be wishing that she had tried a relationship with a female, but she told me that it would not be the case. So after processing that, I decided to tell her that with this new information about her in my head, I would request that she would treat her female friends as she would her male friends in our relationship.

Beforehand, if she let a guy kiss her hand or cheek I would definitely feel uncomfortable even if they were just friends (this never happened but is to illustrate my thinking). She did do these kinds of things with female friends occasionally, just kinda joking around. It still made me a little uncomfy but I had accepted that it was how she was with those friends. But with this new information, it makes me a bit more uncomfortable. So I told her that if she thinks it would make me uncomfortable if she did it to a guy, then she should consider the same if it's a girl.

I'm not trying to ban her from hanging out with her friends or anything, I'm fine with her hanging out with guy friends and girl friends. My perspective has just been altered to include women into the category of ""something flirty being said to this person could mean more, regardless of if it does or not it makes me anxious.""

I’d love to be able to express myself freely and not be afraid to share my true feelings and opinions, but I’m worried that it may be really hard to change when i’ve been this way my whole life.

63,"
Throughout most of our relationship my ex (28 M) was suffering from depression. He had/has a dream of making it in the music industry so we moved to LA together. We dated for 3 years. 

When we first started dating he was fine. Romantic, sweet. We had many differences (in an extravert he’s an introvert) but I could deal with them. 

Couple of months in the depression/mood swings got bad. He would get mad when he had to work &amp; hated it. He would treat me shitty by being dry or getting annoyed by any little thing I did or said. 

This went on for 2 years. I would do my best to help him, i would help him pay stuff when finances stressed him. I would meditate with him, I would constantly ask him to get help. I would make plans for us to have fun and sometimes it would go through and we would have fun but most times we would go and fight because he was forcing himself or we wouldn’t and I would just sit home and cry because I am young and felt like I deserved more but I didnt leave because I knew it was out of his control. 

Fast forward he finally “let me go” after 2 years. I moved back to my hometown and I felt so liberated. I carried all of his worries and pains with me for so long, I was finally able to be happy and do what I want. 

During our break up he went and got help and started seeing a therapist. A couple of months went by and he asked for a second chance and said he was better &amp; I mostly said yes because maybe it was the depression that was hindering us but we spent the time during quarantine arguing &amp; just seeing how different we are. We broke up again. 

He left me alone for a few months but now he is back. I have never seen a grown man cry before, I had never seen my ex show as much emotion as He has, before. He was my best friend so seeing my best friend hurt, is killing me inside. I have been very honest with him &amp; told him straight up he needs to move on because I am fine without him. He can’t believe me and cries and says that he wasn’t that bad and says it was out of his control &amp; says he regrets and hates himself for how he treated me. It breaks my heart honestly. If i could love him again I would but I just feel drained by him. The love is lost. I wish I can gain it back but I don’t associate him with romance anymore. He doesn’t get me &amp; says he thought I loved him. Anyways two questions.

1. Am I a bad person
2. Can I ever love him again? How? How do you fall back in love with someone who drained you. 

I told him maybe in a couple of years once the wound is healed and he cried more and said I would forget him and find someone new. 

Because I’m an extrovert I click with people very easily.

67,"Guys, I wish to begin by stating that I am a sensitive type person. I wish no bad will on anyone.

I am also a privatized lawn care provider and I will also seek advice through this avenue as well.

**My issue:**      
I have a client who owns a public business where I mow the small amount of grass that exists there. As I was mowing yesterday the elderly woman came up to me complaining that I was blowing leaves onto her property. ***The property I maintain HAS NO TREES. Secondly, her property adjoins it along one side and there are many trees.***

**The back story:**      
She approached me about cutting the grass on her two yards. Initially, I told her I didn't have the time within my schedule to add her yards on. Secondly, her reimbursement offer wasn't even close to what it would cost to cut the grass. (It was very seriously insulting.) After several phone calls and voice messages from her I agreed to cut it ONE SINGLE TIME for the amount of $100 which again is nowhere near enough money (Nearly 5 acres spanning her two yards). At the time of this agreement the grass had been neglected for well over a month. It was very tall and heavy.

I spent 3 hours one afternoon/evening and a full 8 hour day following (ELEVEN HOURS TOTAL) to get her yard cut. She stated that I had worked a long time cutting that grass (NOT to mention the wear and tear on my mower). She offered to double the money and added an extra $35 as well. I told her that we had agreed to $100 and $100 was the deal. She insisted because the grass was over grown. Her reason was because it took so long.

Since then she has harassed me about cutting her yard again. She told me that she over paid me. She has harassed me most recently about the ""leaves that I blew onto her property"". I told her that the pile of leaves I'd made was going to get vacuumed up into my mower and it would be gone when I left. These leaves weren't even on her property! I did exactly what I had promised

She has approached my employer trying to get me fired over the leaves. She has called the police about the leaves. Folks I ask you to remember that the leaves are coming from her trees. What can I do about her harassment? If you approach her, she takes this defensive ""little old lady"" approach and acts very innocent as if I'm the bad guy. 

I'm just trying to earn a living. I fulfilled my agreement with this woman. 

I'm not seeking anyone's judgement here. I'm asking for advice on how to handle her harassment through the correct legal channels.",17Oct2020,1

When asked to do it, she yelled at me for having a rude tone and calling her useless.  She talked about how I’m not collaborative when working with others and don’t listen to other peoples’ advice. She got mad at me for not giving her input when she was working on my portfolio, but when I did try to speak she told me she already knew what I was saying and that she didn’t need me to “backseat drive.” She then said I wasted her time because she could’ve hung out with my grandma, but one, I never asked her to help, and two, she never told me her plans and I would’ve been willing to let her go spend time with her mom. 
This has continuously happened also with my dad, where she would get mad at him for everything he does and constantly degrades him. In public, she actively tells everyone that he does everything wrong and has no friends. She compares him to all her friend’s husbands, but when he acts like them she gets angry. He offers to help her cook and she says she is fine, but during dinner she will yell at him the whole time that she made the meal on her own and no one helped her and he is not thankful enough for what she does. She constantly tries to convince me that my dad doesn’t love her or me, and that he is wasting all of our time. I don’t understand any of this, and I have so much hatred towards her and I’m scared I will do something I will regret. My dad is the only reason why I still deal with her and will stay in contact with her in the future, as he says that it is best for me to have a relationship with my mother as she will trash talk me to the whole city otherwise. Half of what she says are lies, and when she tells them in public or to go against my dad she will look to me or my sister to confirm those lies even when we all know they are not true.
Additionally, she won’t let my dad visit or speak to any of his family. She tells me all the time that his family hates him and only likes her. She also tells me that they just feel bad for him because he is a loser. I don’t understand why she does this.. going back to his “lack of friends,” my dad is no longer allowed to speak to any of the friends he did have. She monitors all of his texts and calls. When he accidentally texted one of the moms from my sports team instead of me (because we have the same name), she accused him for cheating on her with him. I understand this behavior she has with my dad may be an insecurity thing, but he literally has no friends because of her. What else could she want? 
This morning I had a meeting this morning with my school counselor and my mom insisted on sitting in the room and would whisper things for me to say that were not necessary to the conversation.  Then when I wasn’t saying what she was telling me, she came into the frame on the zoom call and started saying the information herself. 
I could go on and on about other situations, but I think for now this is enough text. Sorry about how messy this is, but I honestly don’t know how to act in this situation- I wanted to start recording my conversations with her and expose her but I realized its not fair.. I’ve been tempted to speak to her friends but that is also not fair to her.. I’m scared to make any friends where I live/build up any personal relationships because I don’t want to feel the need to ever come back here to visit after I’m gone. This control has affected my mental health and I’m feeling so tired of life now. I know my situation really isn’t that bad but I’m so lost. Please help!",17Oct2020,1
71,"Sorry this is so long, also throw away acct. 

I need some advice on how to navigate my relationship with my ""mother."" To be clear I have never had a relationship with my mother, I call her by her first name. She was extremely emotionally and physically abusive growing up to me and all my siblings/rest of my family. She has had all of her children taken away from her except my youngest sister who has been put in foster care twice. The only reason I put up with her is for my younger sister or I would not have any contact with her. I got married almost 2 years ago and we're expecting our first child in November. My grandmother called me (her mom) to start discussing coming to help. I'm very close with my grandmother and was excited she was coming (I live in a different state). However, than she informed me my ""mother"" also wanted to come. This idea is horrible. I have zero relationship with her and she drives me crazy. To be clear she knows nothing about me or my husband or my life in general. I spoke with my husband regarding what to do. I finally told my grandmother she could come but there would be rules including that they were not allowed to stay with us, she wasn't allowed to be alone with our baby or me/my husband. I didn't think she would come to be honest because she always bails on everything but I got a call from my grandmother that they bought plane tickets. While on the phone with my grandmother my ""mother"" came on the phone and said how excited she was to see the baby. She started talking about taking care of the baby and taking the baby to where her and my grandmother were staying. I shut this down. I told her under no circumstances was she allowed to be alone with the baby or take them anywhere without me or my husband. They are coming mid January and I'm so conflicted. If she didn't have custody of my sister I would completely cut her out of my life but for now I have to put up with her.",17Oct2020,1

76,Im unsure what to do. The last couple of years she smokes weed to help with her appetite and that has stopped working as well as it used to. There was a point in time where she couldnt get any weed when we first moved into dorms at school since she didn’t know anyone that had any and things were swell. She could eat on a normal basis but only after losing about 20 pounds did things turn around. It’s almost like a weird cycle where the first few months of moving into a new place she stops eating unconsciously or something. We moved into new apartments this year and it’s like the same thing going on. I never noticed the first time and I feel so yucky that I didn’t see her losing all the weight. She’s 5’4 and was 120lbs the first time she lost her appetite. Right now she’s 115 and I’m noticing that she’s not eating.

78,"Okay, so I'm a freshman in college and I live in a suite style dorm with 3 other roommates. We have  two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room that we share and then we each have our own room. At the beginning of the semester, one of the girls ended up going to live at home instead and got out of her contract. Two weeks ago, we got another roommate assigned. She's usually pretty nice, but the problem is that her boyfriend is over literally all the time. Like I said, she's been here for about two weeks, but he's been here for like at least 10 days out of that. He spends the night and seems to be here pretty much all day. He's not a bad guy or anything, but it just makes me kind of uncomfortable that he's there all the time. My other two roommates have also said that it makes them uncomfortable, so we tried to sit down and talk to her about it. She essentially just blew us off and said that since she's paying to have her own room, she's allowed to have whoever she wants in there. Which, I do understand where she's coming from, but even if she has her own room, we are still kind of living in a shared space?

81,"First point, I'm not used to male attention, since I've been obese my whole life. I've lost a significant amount of weight and haven't been out seeing friends or people since it has been lockdown for a few months.

Ive recently starting to see my friends again and I'm totally shocked about what happened. I got drunk a few weeks ago and at the end of the night we all went to my house. Some stuff happened in the room with me(F21) and my friend(M20, Pete) while my underage friend(M17, Mike) and my sister(F15) was in the room, which I don't remember. Pete did some stuff I'm not comfortable talking about. The thing that saddens me most is that I feel like I instigated the whole thing and that everything is my fault. I don't want to confront anyone about this because I don't want to ruin any friendships. We have talked it out. But it still happened and it screw me up because it one of my friends.

I had a breakdown tonight and I just need some advice on how to handle the situation. My friends and I had a few drinks and decided to go to a soccer field to sit there. We got a few blankets and layed down for a bit since it was starting to get cold. The one guy (Glen, which I've been in high school with about 5 years ago) decided to lay next to me. I've known him for 5 years and he never gave me any attention until I've lost weight.

He layed on my pelvic area, I've felt uncomfortable but just thought he didn't know what he was doing since he was drunk. I should mention that Mike and Pete was with us. 

They all made jokes with each other while Glen layed there on top of me, they all thought it was funny since I was feeling ""cold"" and he was just trying to keep me warm. Next thing I noticed he slipped his hand underneath my t-shirt and started to rub around.

I felt TERRIBLE because I didn't know what to do. He started to get closer to my breasts and I just tried to keep attention away, kept talking to my other friends and crossed my arms around my breasts so he can't get any closer.

The thing that messed me up the most is that the same guy that Pete, the same guy which touched me a few weeks ago, was encouraging his behavior. I just layed there and tried to get Mike's attention. As soon as he noticed what happened he said we should all go home.

What saddens me the most is that Mike has to witness al of this. I feel like an older sister to him and each time he's with me a new guy assaults me in front of him. I've talked to him about this and he keeps thinking it's his fault, which I told him is not. I have no clue how to say no to a guy because I don't want things to be awkward for us in the future and I don't want to hurt anyones feelings, but in the end it's always me who's getting hurt and my friend is suffering about it. I'm either considering dumping ALL my friends or gaining weight. Neither is a reliable option but in so hurt and in tired of gettig taken advantage of.. 

Ps. Im not suing anyone as they just touched me without my consent. 

TL;DR: got assaulted 2 times in a few weeks after losing a lot of weight, and both times happened infront if my underage friend and he's starting to feel like it's his fault.",17Oct2020,1
82,"So my Dad's got a new girlfriend. He and my step-mom divorced two years ago. I figure great for him if it makes him happy.

83,"So over the past month I just kind of got distant from the friend group that I had, and it happened around the time I stopped smoking weed and I was just kind of going through a lot. I’m really only pretty close with one of the dudes from the group and the rest of the guys I’m cool with and have known for awhile but I’m just not as close.

And what really hurt me is when everybody went on a vacation trip and I wasn’t invited, and nobody ever really told me anything. I was kind of salty about it but it just made me realize that I probably just wasn’t really fitting in with them and wasn’t as cool with everybody as I thought. I feel like hanging out with these people is just a waste of time, since why am I going to dump energy into people who really don’t give af about me or my feelings.

I’ve never explicitly said anything since I’m not trying to start drama or anything, and I just haven’t hung out with them for 2 months or so. We used to hangout like 2-3 times a week and I thought they were you know like my bro’s, but I was pretty much the only one who didn’t go on this trip, and I was starting to get invited to less things and I just didn’t say anything and was like fine. 

Now my one friend is starting to ask if I want to play some pick up games with everybody again and I just honestly don’t want to, but the insecure person in me feels like a douche for declining. I also don’t think I can honestly have fun with them knowing that I’m only going to be there if they feel like it, and not bc I’m good friends with them.

93,"So, I recently moved to a REALLY small town(population around 20,000) and got out of the big city with my girl and our kids, to get away from the old life and start new. I have no family here, but my girlfriend has some aunts and cousins out here. Just a little history for context...Let me begin. My girlfriend has had family issues in the past, where her father was accused of doing things to her and her siblings when they were younger, way before we met. Many years past and he was never arrested, no charges or anything like that, everyone just forgave him...fast forward to us moving out here, everything is all good when all of a sudden her father is getting “evicted”. And he calls my girl all the time during this period, trying to get her to feel bad and let him move in with us saying things like “I’m going to be homeless/in a shelter soon.” “I’m going to be alone”....etc. Her and myself knew what was the reason, he’s obsessed with her, like attracted to her, she voiced her opinion on it on many occasions but I kept my mouth shut for the most part, but we both had the same mindset, which was he’s not staying here. But the man still found a way to come move in with his sister in this town. I should add that when she was younger she moved out here with her aunt to get away from him but a week later he moved up here as well, she went back to the city and he went back. Basically wherever she goes he ends up there as well. I thought my girlfriend hated this. Until now, he’s constantly calling her, they’re gone for hours while I’m at home with our kids, sometimes when they come back there are stories about her having to go to his house real quick, never any explanation to me, just gone for another hour or so. One day he told her in front of me “I’m going to be leaving, remember that thing I told you” with a perverted looking smile. I wish I could describe it better but it made me uneasy. I can’t stand this man anymore tbh. Now, anytime he’s around, my girl has a weird attitude towards me, mad for no reason, talking down to me or just acting weird. Here’s where shit gets crazy, she was on her menstrual cycle about two weeks ago. And anytime we have sex, it extends her period. It’s been three weeks and she is still has her period(yes I understand sometimes illness can cause irregular bleeding) she has these sores on her arm that she told me the doctor said was chemical burns, but instead of an ointment she gets prescribed herpes medication for it. I don’t have an std, never have so she didn’t get it from me. Her dad calls her “mamas” which translates to “sucks” from Spanish to English. I’m Spanish myself and I know calling a loved one “mama” is a term of endearment but “mamas” is something completely different. As a matter of fact when I’m about to get a bj from her she calls it mamas....strange? I think so. He calls her everyday and there are only short answers from her “no” “yes” “idk” “ok”...never any full complete sentences, as far as I can tell when I’m around. Idk what to feel because when I mentioned it to her she gets super defensive, and if I’m being frank she never denies it, but she has an excuse for every point I bring up. 

Now, I’ve been cheated on before so I know the signs but am I looking to deep into this? Is this just normal father daughter relationship or am I justified in feeling like this? How do I approach her?",17Oct2020,1

I don't know but I just wanted to write.
 I feel like a bad person. I'm a bad friend to everyone that knows me. I feel bad for spirit but if I tell her how I feel people will think I'm seeking for attention, if I'm subtle or just talk how I usually do I'm gaslighting, if I don't say anything im being secritive and bottling up my feelings and nothing I want will ever happen. I don't know what to do anymore but I have no one to talk to who would listen. I can't talk how I do normally because I'm rude, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll explain what happened. Today my friend spirit was finnaly gonna play a game with me for the first time in forever and I was so excited I couldn't wait, I love to play games with spirit it's one of my favorite things to do but she can't very often because of school. So I was very excited because she said she could today, but she had to wait about a hour for it to update, for me it only took 10 minutes but I believed her so I waited, this was around 6. 6:30- I messaged her to see if it was done, because sometimes it over estimates, she said half a hour so I waited. 7:00 I noticed it should be done but I didn't want to sound like a asshole so I didn't message her. 7:20 I messaged "" I know I'm probably absolutely annoying as shit rn but ur (the game) should be done updateing"" no reply. 7:30 ""k"" 8:00 ""I'll leave u alone, have a nice night"" had absolutely no intention to be rude in these messages, it was just me trying to get her attention. 8:10 she messages ""sorry I was playing among us"" so I thought, among us isn't a long game? But as we talked she implied she was playing with other friends, and this...... This really hurt. I know I'm not her only friend but I hadn't played a game with her in months and she knew how much I wanted to play with her and she decided to play with someone else. Imma be honest I cried I honestly cried. I genuinely think she just didn't want to play with me and ignored me for another friend and or friends. And I think it's me. I know the way I act is terrible and I don't blame her but she could have told me. She didn't say she was open to play so I just said goodnight and logged off. I feel like a terrible person.

97,"My roommate’s kitten and my kitten play hard sometimes. My cat had her eye scratched some time between last night and this morning. When I noticed, I checked for debris/damage as her eye is watery (no discolored discharge, just tears) and irritated. I have been periodically flushing and applying a warm compress to her eye. 

I currently have the flu with a 102 deg fever so after doing some research, I thought it would be best to ask my mom to take my cat to an appointment I have scheduled for Monday if the issue didn’t resolve on its own. 

My roommate came home for work while I was asleep, saw her eye, and immediately took her to an ER appointment. While the scheduled appointment with my vet would have been around $90 dollars, the ER visit was $360 and he made sure to let me know this after he got home.

While I so greatly appreciate him taking initiative and doing what he felt was necessary for her health, I believe going to the ER might have been a bit overkill- especially with her appointment on Monday.

How do I work out finances with him on this? I don’t want to seem stingy but I am a little butt-hurt over the fact I feel inclined to foot this bill without discussing it first.",17Oct2020,1
98,"So I am going to college for cyber security and i’m weighing out my options for after college and was thinking I could get some advice from you guys. I have narrowed myself down to 2 options:

1.) After I get out of college I can enlist as an officer in the Navy for a couple of years doing cyber security stuff. This would be for benefits that i’ll have for the rest of my life and when I get out of the Navy I could get an actual job doing cyber security at a company or a federal agency or something. The downside to this is that my parents really don’t want me going into the military and they get really aggressive over it and telling me I won’t see family for a long time etc, which I get, but I have talked to my girlfriend i’ve been dating for 3 years and possibly my wife in the future and she thinks for the benefits it might be worth it, I know it is up to me but I also have another idea.

2.) After I get out of college I can get a cyber security job making base pay somewhere and slowly rank my way up like a normal job, this would be a lot less risky but I wouldn’t get the same benefits unless I got like a state job or something. I also like this plan because I will be able to start my life and be able to start a family and stuff. 

Thanks to anyone who gives me advice, also please don’t judge i’m still a teenager and am trying to find my way around life lol. Thanks everyone.",17Oct2020,1
99,"Beforehand,  I wrote this in a note so it isn't exactly ment for other people to see. I'm female, my friend is female, we are both 15. So have fun reading. 
I don't know but I just wanted to write. This is my alt btw.

 I feel like a bad person. I'm a bad friend to everyone that knows me. I feel bad for spirit but if I tell her how I feel people will think I'm seeking for attention, if I'm subtle I'm gaslighting, if I don't say anything im being secritive and bottling up my feelings and nothing I want will ever happen. I don't know what to do anymore but I have no one to talk to who would listen. I can't talk how I do normally because I'm rude, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll explain what happened.
 
Today my friend spirit was finnaly gonna play a game with me for the first time in forever and I was so excited I couldn't wait, I love to play games with spirit it's one of my favorite things to do but she can't very often because of school. So I was very excited because she said she could today, but she had to wait about a hour for it to update, for me it only took 10 minutes but I believed her so I waited, this was around 6. 6:30- I messaged her to see if it was done, because sometimes it over estimates, she said half a hour so I waited. 7:00 I noticed it should be done but I didn't want to sound like a asshole so I didn't message her. 7:20 I messaged "" I know I'm probably absolutely annoying as shit rn but ur (the game) should be done updateing"" no reply. 7:30 ""k"" 8:00 ""I'll leave u alone, have a nice night"" had absolutely no intention to be rude in these messages, it was just me trying to get her attention. 8:10 she messages ""sorry I was playing among us"" so I thought, among us isn't a long game? But as we talked she implied she was playing with other friends, and this...... This really hurt. I know I'm not her only friend but I hadn't played a game with her in months and she knew how much I wanted to play with her and she decided to play with someone else. Imma be honest I cried I honestly cried. I genuinely think she just didn't want to play with me and ignored me for another friend and or friends. And I think it's me. I know the way I act is terrible and I don't blame her but she could have told me. She didn't say she was open to play so I just said goodnight and logged off. I feel like a terrible person.

That's what I wrote in the note. Im open to answer questions in the comments because I'm not super discriptive I just want to know what I did wrong and what I should do. I'm not good at talking to people so I just want someone's opinion. Reddit, am I the asshole?",17Oct2020,1

101,"I'm a 21 M virgin and incredibly insecure about my situation in life. I wish I could pinpoint why I'm like this to some specific reason, in reality, I think it's a combination of things.

I've always excelled academically but struggled socially. I grew up in a pretty sheltered and religious environment. I've been insecure about my lack of experience for a long time, and it's taken a toll on my mental health.

I want to get better, but I can't shed the hopelessness I feel. Part of me feels as though a significant portion of women wouldn't bother with me at this point. The other part struggles to figure out why I can't find intimacy when it's something I've wanted for so long. 

My actual situation is very at odds with my ideal one, and at the end of the day I feel like I didn't do enough to pursue romantic relationships and now I'm too late.

104,"Hey guys, long time lurker here. Sorry if this is long but I don't know what else to do.

I won't go into much detail about prior events to me moving, but I (20 f) decided to leave a very strict, conservative college and go to another one. This resulted in me moving off of campus and eventually into my roommate's (19 f) house. Prior to moving in, I knew it was an older home, and she had told me there were a few ""projects"" she had to fix and I was definitely prepared to accept that things were not perfect.

Well, when I moved in, things were definitely not. As was expected, the house was falling apart, but I chose to accept that because rent is cheap (we split 50/50) and I had to prove to my family that I am an adult. 

However, when I began inspecting more clearly, things were much, much worse. I'll just type a list of some of the things:

\-the smell. There's tons of her animals in the house that pee and poop everywhere that sometimes go for days without being cleaned. As a rule, when we leave, dogs stay outside. However, while I was at work, she left her dog in and he broke into my room (my door is broken) and pissed in 5 different spots on top of my clothes, rug, and makeup. He then shit on my makeup. lol. As well as that, she hasn't seemed to have cleaned a single dish in the month and a half I've been there so the sink is constantly full of moldy dishes and flies. She also leaves her empty yogurt containers in the sink. She has a ""junk room"" where the pets freely poop and pee and it's not cleaned up. The smell is so strong that if you crack the door you can smell it everywhere. As a result, I haven't been able to eat in the house and either eat in my room or my car because, well, if I breathe too deep I gag.

\-her stuff is everywhere. I don't mean disorganized. I haven't been able to cook because there's so much stuff on the countertops and stove. Can't sit down in the living room anywhere.

\-mice poop. I am aware that houses can have mice, and that's not her fault. However, there is poop EVERYWHERE that she refuses to clean. It's literally on every piece of furniture in the living room, all over the rug, in the cabinets where we keep food, I found some on a fork the other day and upon further inspection I found more poop in the silverware drawer. There was a lot in the original sheets she had on the bed (I changed them). I don't mean a few little pellets, I mean TONS of it.

\-Broken fridge. There is a fridge that has been full of food for who knows how long, at least since I've been there, that's broken. All the food has rotted. She has literal raw chicken breasts out in the open that she hasn't thrown away.

\-Chicks in the laundry room. Lately she's had this new thing where she's been breeding chicks. I have no problem with that, they're cute. However, she keeps them in the laundry room and doesn't clean their poop or pee. So it smells really bad, to the point where I can't do laundry. Sometimes the chicks hop out of the laundry basket they're in and I find them amidst the piles of clothes and have to scoop them out haha.

\-I don't think this is her fault but there is lots of mold everywhere. All along the walls, the floors, etc. There's dirt piles on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the basic stuff. I love my roommate and she's been a good friend. I am concerned for her because there's so much stuff everywhere and I don't know if she sees the problem. I don't mean to sound like an insensitive person but her room looks like it could be on hoarders.  I really wish I was exaggerating. If I would have known things were this bad I most likely wouldn't have moved in; but, I really have no choice.

Recently I tried to approach the subject to her lightly without judgement and with acceptance. I said things such as, ""Hey, roommate, I am in no way judging you, but we cannot live like this. It has gotten to be a health hazard. I love you and want to support you, what if we came up with a plan to where we could both start cleaning it and tackling some of your projects?"" She got very defensive and told me there was no problem and I grew up in a nice house so I'm ""not used to it"" and don't accept her for who she is, mice are just a part of living in the country, etc.

A) My family is pretty lower middle class. Wasn't exactly a castle. B), I myself am disorganized but I know the difference between mess and filth. C), I feel like being rich or poor doesn't affect if a house is filthy or not. You can be dirt poor and still clean up after yourself. BTW, she's not poor. and D), my family had mice in our old home. We set traps. We immediately cleaned any fecal matter we saw.

So, redditors, what should I do? How do I approach it to her *again* and actually see some progress? Am I overreacting or is this pretty bad? I am willing to help her clean, even though none of it is my mess. I really don't mean to sound judgy or entitled, it's just that it's that bad and I don't know how else to describe it. I want to be able to study, eat, and breathe in my house without feeling uncomfortable or being confined to my room (which I keep clean). I also want to let her know that I support her and want her to get help.",17Oct2020,1

I’m  a 28F  I need some advice on buying a car. I’m planing on getting a Honda hybrid 2016 or an old Honda that about 20 years old. The old car only have 53,000 mileage and other car around 30,000.

108,"16(M) here and I work at a pizza place. So I have mixed feelings about my job and want to know if I should just go ahead and start looking for somewhere else to work?

So  I'm gonna list all the negatives and then the positives

Negative

Pay: I make minimum wage which is 7.50 an hour Right now. Since my job promotes you as you go through the training I could potentially make 8.75 if I did the training to do makeline and doughslaper which is up to me when I do said traning. right now im only doing the minimum which is work cash register, put stickers on boxes, and fold boxes so that's why I don't make much

Hours:since I only do the minimum I get little to no hours for example we get paid every other week, last time I got paid I was supposed to work 16hrs one week and 11 the next well since they only calulated it until Thursday instead of Saturday like they usually do It wouldve only been 5 for the second week which means I wouldve walked away with around 145$ now I stay as long as I possibly can with my one manager having to ask me to stop doing my job and clock out a couple of times through doing that I was able to walk away with 226$ that one check out having 34hrs instead of the 21 I wouldve I gotten if I didn't do that.

Co-worker: my coworkers don't talk to me really ig I could be part of the problem since I don't try to start a conversation with them but I'm honestly really shy so I don't know who's be at fault tbh. So far I've had two co-workers start up a conversation with me ig. Bob says hi and always asks how I'm doing and I always say ok and that's the end of that. John tried starting up a conversation with me the other day and I feel like we've been getting along by he hasn't said anything to me all day so ig that was a fluke. No one else says anything. I don't if I'm the problem since they may be intimated since I never try to start up a conversation with anyone but I'm just a shy person so really need advice on that

I don't feel like part of the team: Ill use drinks for a example: the gas station across the street gives us free drinks. Sometimes my coworkers will go and get drinks for everyone and as long as there's only a few of us they'll bring a drink for me. If everyones here I'm always the odd one out.
Another thing is I'm blamed for every thing that goes wrong for example I've had problems with the orders before and cost the company some money because of that but like yesterday orders were getting mixed up and alot of other stuff, and because of that we were missing 137$ and the blame was put solely on me and now I'm on probation again even though again for example my coworkers litterly gave someone there wrong order. I'll admit I might've got a order worng once yesterday but that's it.

Tips: I make very few tips very rarely. What's supposed to happen is that when we make tips we put it into the tip jar and it gets split between me and 3-4 of my other Co workers.
I've been working there since like September 4 and only been offered a portion of the tips once even though most come from me since I'm the one at the register. Eventually one day a lady ended tiping 10$ and since then I've just been pocketing my tips. But again that was after like two to three  weeks of putting tips into the tip jar and getting none.

Positives

Job is super easy

Job pays on time

Co workers although they don't talk to me are fairly helpful if

Job works around my school schedule and never schedule me before 430 which is very good for me especially while being in school

Job is really close only like a mile and a half away

I just don't really feel like having her in my house at the moment, especially since I want to get a police officer to come out here first to keep the peace in the home while she's doing the inspection. But the problem is that she said she was going to do the inspection at 794 ***\*\*Classified address\*\**** but my  number is 792, meaning she wrote down the wrong address I live at.

TW advised now.
I remember being at a neighbor kids house, I was sitting on the couch that faced a bathroom door. The other kids were downstairs and I was waiting for someone to arrive. The neighbor kids dad walked into the bathroom, took out his member and started at me the entire time he peed. I was in shock and didn’t know what to do. I wrote it off and as he just didn’t care and forgot to close the door but now i’m thinking he did it on purpose. Everyone in the neighborhood always said he gave them bad vibes. (I was 7 or 8)
Okay next memory. My mother has always walked around the house naked, she would always pressure me into being naked all the time. She wanted me to shower with her, show her my boobs and pubic hair. I was extremely uncomfortable with this and shit did not respect my boundaries. She told me that moms and daughters were supposed to show each other things. I don’t think that this was okay. This was from ages well 5-13. 
Last one...which i’m more sure of my thoughts but looking for what other people think. My first boyfriend basically pressured me into losing my virginity. I said no multiple times and he still did it. I didn’t realize this was rape till probably a year after. I was 16. 
I still have trouble saying no to men, and showing anyone my body now.

115,"Hello everyone I hope all is well with you! I intend for this to be an advice/discussion post about living in the moment. So a little about me, I’m 16 and I’m a male. Growing up wasn’t easy for me personally, when I was a kid I was sexually abused multiple times by two different people once by a family member and another by a family friend. On top of this my father was a drug addicted person who on multiple occasions tried to murder me. Because he was never in the picture, it was hard for my mom to raise me and my other two brothers. She had all of us before she was 25 and she had me at 19. It was hard to see her struggle to put food on the table and she still has a hard time doing so. 

All of this happened before I was 13. Regardless of how hard it was mentally, I always enjoyed simple things in life. It might sound very cheesy but I loved things like putting my toes in the sand or having a picnic by myself. I also love the warm breeze of the San Francisco Bay especially at night time. The city looks so magical it’s a really pretty place. Anyways I’m getting a little sidetracked, but I feel as of late I can’t live in the moment. Stuff like that made me feel more present and made me appreciate the present but I can’t do it now for some reason. I feel this type of on and off sadness because I’m going to be 17 in a couple months and feel like I haven’t had enough time to enjoy my teen years. I dread becoming an adult sometimes and sometimes I don’t. I feel I was robbed of a childhood honestly. All I ever wanted was to be a normal child who got to go out and explore. So this is the question I have for all of you; how can I not think so much about the future and just live in the now?

Or are they mistaking the area code of the number? I figured, we'll just wait another week to see if we get a call. 

2 weeks later. 

I decided to call up the company to see what my status was on being employed. The line had reached a manager that was on duty for the day. First off I stated my business and my name. She seemed shocked, telling me that they've been calling me all last week, but the number was actually an unavailable number and was not connected. 

Just as I thought. THE AREA CODE! 

To keep my location anonymous; the key: 
 - Area code that everyone in the area has: X2X
-My area code from a different state: X5X

Now these area codes are similar in a way. I didn't completely blame them, but the only thing that really grinded my gears was that even after all those attempts to call the ""correct area code,"" why not call what was on the actual application?!? 

For sure, I knew I put the right number on the application, because they have called me before on the ""correct number, with the correct area code"" to call me for an interview. 

The Manager on duty told me to call in 3 days. So, now I'm conflicted on if I'm still qualified or not, or if they already got someone to replace my position. But I'm also angry that they were so unprofessional about all of this. 

Any input on why they wouldn't just use the number I put on my application? Will I still have a chance to prove myself?

123,"For the past two years, I’ve been drifting away from my normal friend group. Ever since I switched schools, it hasn’t been the same. I also can’t seem to make good friends at my new school. I feel like giving up and accepting that I don’t have any friends, because I’ve tried multiple times to rebuild the old relationship with my friends. Every time I’ve failed.

125,"20 y/o (male) and current/now to be ex-girlfriend is the same age; Im in a soon to be a 2 years long relationship and I’ve been having this problem where I’m half in and out the relationship, almost like I want it sometimes and I don’t, I know it’s not fair for my partner, I’ve been dealing with this for some time now and I’ve left her multiple occasions but found myself starting to feel regretful or sorry about my decision in ending it. So let me explain a little more on why I’m feeling like this, I’ve always had a thing with being lockdown to someone and just commitment overall, I get less interested the more I’m with someone and I start to not feel the same about certain things I used to enjoy such as the sex, going out and etc, I don’t post my partner on my social media and I almost feel confused about whether I want to be in the relationship or not, it makes me feel like a lack of confidence within my decision making and myself, I love this person but I can’t understand why I can’t get myself to feel completely in the relationship. Partially I feel like I lose out on opportunities when I’m committed such as seeing/talking to who I want without hurting the person I’m with and being able to work on myself to understand what I want better, I’m just so confused and don’t know how to go about it, I recently vented all this to my gf and I made her break down which leads to me feeling like shit but she was very understanding about it and is willing to accept whatever I think it’s best but wants to be friends on the side. Can anyone relate or give me their input on whether they ever been through this before and what’s the best way to go about it?",17Oct2020,1
126,"My boyfriend is 30 y.o owner of small manufacturing factory. We are dating for little over a year.  
  
The thing is he is extremely straightforward, non-pc and doesn't give a fuck about manners. Sometimes it becomes really embarrassing during meetings. He can say that food is okay, he can grab something and eat it with hand. He can interrupt people talking and say they are completely wrong. He is also very open and honest about usual taboo topics like religion and politics (he is libertarian atheist). Regardless of who he is meeting, be it his friends or investors, young or old, men or women, American, Japanese or Indian, he acts the same careless, indecent way.  
  
Somehow, he manages to get away with it every time and run his business successfully. It seems that people are used to his behavior and know that he is not coming from a bad place. Still, how can I influence him to change his behavior a little bit? Make him little bit more pc. We have very important meetings in November-December, and I also want to introduce him to my parents before new year. I know he is not someone who lacks social skills, he is more gallant with me, for example. He just doesn't care.

127,"I am not able to manage a functional life. I am isolated and have no social life. Recently my ex and I broke up. Now I am realizing that maybe she never loved me the way she always claimed. Hindsight, you know ?

Anyways, I live at home with my single parent who refuses to go out and have a real life outside of the 4 walls. I blame myself for this because I asked her to come help me settle on the other side of the world when I was 19 years old. Because of that she lost the ability to practice medicine and, now it feels like an inextinguishable debt.

On top of that I got facial palsy, which never fully recovered and I lost the ability of basic functions like smiling. If I do try to smile, I look…hideous (objectively speaking). 

How do I get my life together? How do I manage a social life again and also try to help my parent, who refuses all help.

I feel like I will always be burdened if I am unable to give her life back again.

Plus I have 0 friends and she has 0 fiends where we live.

128,"So the other day I was supposed to meet my girlfriend after school, and we chose a Time. But we go to different schools, so she took the subway uptown to see me. Then she told me that she was going to take the subway uptown with her male friend (not really great friend just kinda friends) and I thought oh ok that’s cool. But then she was 20 minutes late to seeing me because she decided to walk him home (out of her way) after they got out of the subway.

This just felt weird to me. Like she chose to go be with him instead of me and be late to seeing me. But whenever I take a step back and think about it doesn’t seem like a big deal but for some reason it just upsets me. 

maybe it’s because in the past she was dating my friend, but then she started talking to me (I didn’t know they were dating). They broke up like a week later and we started dating about a month after (he was totally cool with it). But she told me that when she was dating my friwnd, she wanted me to like her, which didn’t seem important at the time but now kinda does.

Then also whenever some guy flirts with her or does something like she won’t ever just leave it and not respond or block them because she says she feels bad.

Those two things didn’t seem like huge deals but now it’s kinda making me worried.

Does it make sense that I’m upset or is it not justified?",17Oct2020,1

At first, I was basically dropping everything to help him. But then it progressed. he told me he had feelings for me so now I can’t really go to him with my guy problems as I did before because he’ll get mad and say “well I’m right here but you just talk to jerks” or something along those lines. He mentioned he wanted to become FWB with me. Then this past week he has been texting me late at night multiple nights, saying he is feeling so low and just needs to be with someone and fall asleep next to someone. 

Last night he send me a text saying “is there anyway I can see you right now? I feel so low and need to be with someone and you’re the only person I can ask” at 11:30 at night. A few nights prior he sent a text,”I just want to fall asleep next to someone and hold them”. I work in the mornings and he doesn’t work until late. I honestly am starting to feel like he’s trying to manipulate me into into seeing him late at night. I asked him and he said he’s not trying to come across that way but he knows not being alone helps. I have been trying to be understanding with him but I have my boundaries and needs too. Part of my needs is being alone a lot and I don’t like sleeping next to people much because I was raped before while I was sleeping and sleeping next to someone can trigger my PTSD.

This morning I told him I’m not available late at night and I suggested he see a counselor or his doctor but he said it’s too expensive, he’s tried it, they’ll just put him on pills that don’t work, and then he stopped talking to me for the rest of the day.

Short story - I joined the military, she broke up with me because she couldn’t handle the long distance relationship.  We dated for a couple years.  I haven’t had any real contact with her since, but still think about her often.  When she broke up with me is the last time I cried.

135,"I am a landlord and awhile back a tenant of mine got their window broken by a fairly large rock. 

Some pertinent history, the tenant was on and off with their significant other and originally rented the apartment during a break. A few month later, they got back together and these complaints and non-compliance started happening. (Ex. Not using a dehumidifier for moist air or locking doors properly while complaining of mildew and items being moved) which I took the time to change locks and purchase a second humidifier. Then the broken window incident happened, which cost me a pretty penny. 

I have some education in criminal justice and psychology, so my brain itches on why someone would break the tenants(my) window. Is the tenant trying to break lease? Is the SO trying to get the tenant to move in with them? Did the tenant or SO get close to someone during their break and is seeking vengeance? Is my tenant an asshole with enemies? 

There has been no information from law enforcement since this incident. I could use any advice or theories as to what could lead up to these issues?",17Oct2020,1

Now, don't get me wrong, the kissing went great, I haven't felt such feeling that I can't describe for a long long time. But there is one issue, I'm not sure if it's me or her, but when we kiss, I did kind of smell some kind of bad smell, mainly from the saliva, I can't describe that smell, it's not the smell from someone who smokes or eaten garlics etc, it's just when we kiss, and we stop, then we kiss again, the smell is there. It's probably just my nose playing tricks on me but is this known as the infamous bad breath ? I do keep a good decent oral hygiene as far as I'm concerned. My gf does as well, but still, when we kiss, I do notice a kind of smell that quite turns me off.

138,"A former friend of mine died last year.  Suffice to say, I was not invited to the funeral, as were several other former friends of his.  This guy had a long, long downward spiral where he alienated most or all of his friends.  Starting in HS, he got into drinking, then became extremely racist.  He would use his size to intimidate people but managed to lose more fights than he ever won.  He was a mean drunk the same as his dad was, and this son of his was the result of a hookup from high school.  He tried abandoning the girl and the kid, she had to sue to get him to even acknowledge him.  He skipped off to the navy and was stationed some place overseas.  He tried reaching out to me on Facebook about 5 years ago, and by reaching out I mean contacting me through messenger.  The first few messages were fine, then he started making comments about my wife and job.  When I started to stop responding to some of the more lewd comments about my wife and sister, he asked for money.  When I said no, Facebook messenger got flooded with a bunch of nasty, racist stuff attacking and threatening me, my wife, etc until I blocked him.  One mutual acquaintance(he was adamant he was not friends with this guy but was stationed at the same base somehow) told me he had issues on base like picking fights, insubordination, etc. So now, I'm getting contacted by the son, who apparently had limited if any contact with him wanting to know about dad.  I'm torn between just telling him I hadn't spoken to him in years, or actually telling him the truth about his dad's decline, in hopes he doesn't go down that path.

140,"My grandfather has always been extremely abusive, and he was a huge alcoholic which ended up giving him dementia. Before dementia, he would scream at us, beat us, break our bones, me and my grandmother are both deaf in one ear from being choked and punched, and my mother was anorexic and addicted to heroin because of how much he tortured her. I begged my teachers to call CPS and they came, walked right past me when I tried to talk to them, and went directly to him and he lied and said I was a brat who was trying to get him in trouble. They believed him without question and never came back. That was around 2007 or so. I have memory and brain issues now so I can’t quite remember. 

Now he has dementia and insists he has to go to work, which he was fired from like 15 years ago for slicing himself up with a butcher knife at work and he was in a mental hospital for 2 weeks but has never been successfully charged with anything no matter how much we reported him. We tell him he doesn’t work so he kicks, punches, screams, spits in our mouths, and purposefully keeps everyone awake. His doctor has given him the maximum amount of sedative she is allowed to give but they don’t work. He fights them and stays awake for days and days and days. The cops are always here because the neighbours hear him screaming and he calls people on the phone and tells them my mom and grandmother are beating him and he’s bloody and dying on the floor. When they see he isn’t they leave. My grandmother is afraid to report him or put him in a home because she says MaineCare(?) will take the house away from them when he dies as payment. Social workers visit also and they don’t do anything and they basically believe everything he says. He poops himself (he always has), never showers, forces my mom to cook him food and stuff but he tells the social worker he does everything himself and that he’s clean and great and they just say “ok great!” And then leave.

141,"I’m 20f. Im 100% sure that if I move out of home away from my parents, my mental health will improve a lot. 

My parents always wants to know where I am. Tells me I’m not to stay out late or stay over at someone’s house. Tells me I can’t dress a certain way. They treat me like a child. They are not perfect, one of them is really toxic and they fight all the time. I rarely interact with them anymore, I just tolerate them around. But I am prone to feel very guilty for doing something they don’t approve of because they guilt trips me since I was little. This stops me from living my life. 

Even though all that, they were parents...not perfect...but they were there to pay for school and the essential things. They sacrifice a lot to build a better life for me. And I know they just worry about me. 

But the constant fighting and control over me is making me so depressed. I have to lie about where I am, who I’m seeing and what I’m doing to be able to have some fun in life. I feel so trapped. And it’s not like I was a bad child or anything. I did my school work, I don’t go out party a lot through school and I don’t do drugs. 

I really want to live my life the way I want to. I want to be independent. Haven’t got a lot saved up but I don’t mind not living a lavish life. I’m graduating soon and will hopefully get a job to pay rent and the necessities. I’m just stuck on that guilty mindset of whether I’m selfish and ungrateful for not staying with them and helping with their business much since I’ll have my own job. Plus, it’ll be extremely hard to break it to them when the time comes because I know they will definitely say no.

Yesterday was my chemistry exam. We have to sign up for an online proctoring session and I could’ve sworn it was at 6:30 and even wrote it on the fridge. I studied super hard for it because I really needed my grade to improve. Turns out the exam was actually for 5:40 and I missed it. I emailed my professor as soon as I found out and she still hasn’t replied. I understand if she wasn’t checking her emails after five on a Thursday night, but she had all day today to reply. Today I emailed her again at around 3 PM asking her what a good time would be for me to retake it so I could fit it into my schedule and still no reply. 

I feel like this is pretty rude. It’s an urgent matter and a genuine mistake. This professor has absolutely no leniency when it comes to online teaching so I don’t even know if she’ll allow me to take it, but at the very least she could get back to me? I don’t know what to do now.",17Oct2020,1

145,"X and I have been friends for ~15 years. We get along great and think the world of one another. Seeing X makes my heart skip a beat and leaves me smiling for days, always has. We always have so much fun, we have so much in common, share the same hobbies and want the same things in life. 

When we were younger, we would sometimes flirt and I think there was a little tension there. We slept together once, about 8 years ago, we were both pretty drunk, but to this day, its some of the best sex I've ever had. Shortly after, X met his partner and they've been together ever since. 

A few years ago, I realised I'd always had feelings for X and they have only gotten stronger over time. This is way past infatuation or just feelings, I am truly in love with this person and believe we could make each other blissfully happy. 

For years, it killed me, but I always thought he was really happy with his partner. I just want him to be happy. But, in the last 12 months, I have reason to believe he is no longer as happy in that relationship as he once was. Although I have no doubt that they care very deeply for one another, I don't think they are right for each other, they don't have a lot in common and they seem to want different things in life. He feels a lot of pressure to settle down and commit. I think he is starting to realize all of this but she suffers badly with anxiety and is heavily reliant on him emotionally and this makes him feel even more pressure. X is the sort of person to go down the path of least resistance, even if it doesn't quite feel right. He would readily sacrifice his own happiness not to hurt someone.

Earlier this year, X's partner was away, we consumed a lot at a new years party and I crashed over. In a drunken stupor, half asleep, X made some minor moves on me. I wanted more than anything to turn to him and reciprocate but I ignored it. The next day, X was remorseful and profusely apologetic and we've never spoken of it since. 

I've always told myself, I would only consider telling X if I thought he wasn't happy. The other thing holding me back is I feel telling him would be selfish. Our friendship means a lot to him, if I told him, he wouldn't be able to see me anymore so we'd both lose out on a really important friendship. I don't want him to lose out. I'd never want to hurt him. 

But saying nothing, I may regret it for the rest of my life. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.",17Oct2020,1

147,"My friend and I (18M) are high school seniors. Since a few months ago, I've noticed some new behavior on my friend's part. I'll call him Ben from now on.

- Ben likes to be funny and considers it a big part of his personality. His brand of humor consists of puns he takes from me and the internet, roasting people (most of his roasts are stuff I've said before), and saying things in absurd voices. There's nothing wrong with that, and I really like that he's always trying to make things fun and relaxed for people around him. However, I find that his humor often falls short for me and can't manage to elicit a laugh. I see nothing wrong with that as well, but he seems to take it personally after repeating the joke multiple times, ask me why I'm not laughing, and explain the joke to me until I react positively. 

- I don't know if this is intentional, but Ben keeps trying to include himself in conversations that I'm in. Yesterday, when things between my ex and I got a bit heated, he took it upon himself to include himself and try to take a few jabs at her, which annoyed me a bit. After she left, he inexplicably told me that he ""backed me up a lot."" When my statistics teacher asked me to explain my racket specs to him (I'm on the school's tennis team), he took it upon himself to answer the question after grabbing one of my rackets. I did manage to relay my teacher's desired information to him, though. 

- When I'm telling a funny story of when I'm in the middle of a joke, Ben tries to finish what I'm saying, even though what he's saying is totally wrong. 

Am I being self-centered by being annoyed by this? What should I do if my concerns are legitimate?

Back in March, I got laid off from my job permanently and it's been a long stressful road for me between now and then. Luckily, I have 4 very good job leads right now that I think will pan out. Anyway, my sister who is 7 years older also got laid off at the same time. However, about two months ago she got rehired by her company and is now able to work 100% remotely. Because of her being unemployed and her apartment leasing running out, she is now living with me until moving into her own apartment again in late November. I was originally in a studio apartment  but my landlord had a full sized unit and asked me if I'd like to move into at no additional charge, which was a huge blessing. I moved into my place in late August and my sister moved in September 1st. Since that time, my sister has contributed to exactly 12% of the rent. Which I find interesting considering she's the one with a job and I'm the one without a job, burning through my savings. I'm also housing her two pets, which I wasn't too thrilled about. Am I right in feeling extreme resentfulness towards her for this? She moves out in just over a month so I'm hesitant to bring it up.

One of my only friends (out of about 3) dumped me for a new boyfriend, and I’m left alone again. And I wouldn’t necessarily say any of my current friends are close enough to be my “best friend”. All I genuinely want is a small circle of friends who want to have nights in together, or go out places (eventually, since, COVID), and just be there for each other.

Stock up not done properly both cafe and presenter box.  Cleanliness standards not upto the mark. Timers on the sheet for the products we dont even have in the store. Its complete negligence/ cutting corners. These things will not be accepted moving forward. Get the Manager to print cafe close checklist and that needs to be completed before you go.

I have hired more cafe crew recently. Everything will be based on performance . You perform well you get shifts , you dont perform well you wont simple as that.

155,"First time reddit poster, so please bear with me on my rant.

Today has been an absolutely draining day on top of this mess. 

I'm routinely hearing from one person in my marketing department that the entire team hates.

Backstory: Our boss got fired a month ago. The consultant, our CEO hired, is tasked with setting us up for success as they find a replacement. He has made it very clear we all need to step up.
I'm not going to lie. Before we were released to the the consultant, it was a shit show. I'm genuinely trying to build our processes and structures so we can actually work, not spin our wheels in how we work.

In the last few weeks as q4 planning was going on I was not included in the meetings, or was reluctantly included after I asked. I run our analytics. We are trying to bring our department (and org) to be data driven. So I feel in most strategy sessions I should be included. I definitely don't want to be involved deeper campaign development as it's too granular for my limited bandwidth. Not that I would want even if that wasn't the case. That is their wheelhouse. 

Cut to today. We got great feedback to the progress we have made since our manager left. Our CEO and interim manager said keep up the good work. We're planning for Q1 with a longer runway, thus need to elevate our thinking even further to ensure we have a solid strategy with enough coverage and so on. After a shitshow meeting of a format I'm proposing we use to make sure we cover everything. We get fully derailed and destroyed about who's meeting is it and who should be leading it, etc. Which is kind of pointless as usually our manager would normally but we don't have one.

Then afterwards, I heard more feedback from one team member (who happens to applying for the position of our new manager) about how I ""dictate"" what we should do and the rest of the team essentially talks shit behind my back. (Note: I do voice my opinions, but not nearly as much as this person who is telling me all this. Also, I'm not applying for the manager position. I just want things to be better.)

I work nights and weekends do to the overload of work piling up bc I'm not involved in the conversation until the end or when it's way too late. And yet, I still make time to be active and engaged in my meetings. When offered the opportunity to provide thoughts and new ideas, aside from only a handful of us, no one else voices their opinions. 

The ones staying silent are apparently saying these things. Since hearing this information, I've been trying to get a read on how accurate and bad this is as I never want to make anyone feel this way. They haven't said anything to me directly before and have said nothing since I've asked. 

I have to note, I'm the youngest person in my department. I'm also a woman. The next person is a solid decade older. We are all on the same level in terms of org structure.

I'm now not sure what to do. Do I keep being the passionate team member I've always been, especially seeing as the consultant trusts my opinion and believes we are making good progress due to my contributions? I'm not saying they are all my sole contribution, but they things I've brought to the team have driven us in the right direction according to the consultant.

 How do I even know this is true if those who seem to have a problem with me won't even say anything to me, even after asking?

Why do I have to down play my hard work and competence, when all they have to really do is speak up? 

Is this team member just saying this so I ""back down'  and they can look the better as they apply for the role.

I'm constantly left feeling like I'm the bad guy in their story.

Any advice around another way to see this situation and potential fixes would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.",17Oct2020,1
156,"I plan on going to college in the upcoming fall of 2021 and I've always wanted to join volleyball. I didn't in high school because I grew up in a small town and the volleyball club was ruled by the rude prissy girls, which terrified me as the shy quiet kid. Volleyball has always been my favorite sport and I was hoping to join possibly the intermural volleyball club at my college.

I guess I'm asking for any tips or advice? I'm not exactly fit anymore thanks to quarantine and I've never been on an actual volleyball team. But I would also be up to do practically anything if it made it more likely for me to be able to play volleyball.",17Oct2020,1
157,"So I met this girl when she came into my job, she works on the same street so I’d see her a couple times a week, and she seemed really cool/cute and I thought she would be cool to get to know more so I got her number. So the first night we texted I asked if she wanted to go eat after work that night and she said she had plans already, which was obviously fine. We texted a little more than a couple days later I said if you ever want to eat after work let me know and we can make plans and she never responded. 

So I saw her today and she wasn’t nearly as friendly/bubbly (I saw her twice first at my job I was busy so I didn’t get a chance to talk to her and once at her job and they were kinda busy so we didn’t talk any other than asking about what I was picking up) I’m not new to the are but I live 25-30 minutes away and have been looking for friends and I thought she would be a good one. 

Would it be ok to text her tomorrow (my last text to her was Monday) and say “Hey, sorry if the last text came off awkward/weird since we don’t really know each other, I’ve just been looking for new friends in the downtown area.”? Would this maybe clear things up? I’m not trying to date her and I don’t want her thinking that was my main intention.",17Oct2020,1
158,"I(20) got involved with a girl(18) in college she said it wasn't going to have strings attached and I was fine with that. She told me there were others and I just asked that she didn't tell me about them we've been seeing eachother for a month now and she kept bringing up the people she hooked up with and I asked her if she could stop mentioning a girl and she said ""well would you rather head about the guys?"" I also found out that she took my phone and used it too send nudes from her snapchat and I asked her kindly not too do that because I liked her alot. So today she took my phone and was on her snapchat we were in class so I couldn't say anything. She was sending guys messages and old nudes she had I told her too give me my phone back and she later did. When we were leaving she told me she had a friend visiting her and I said oh okay I'll wait with you. I assumed it was a girl and we were talking about a bunch of stuff we kissed and etc then the person called and it was a guy. She used my phone too hook up with a guy... and later she admitted she just did it too hurt me for some reason. She seems guilty but I'm not sure I trust her.

159,"So about a year ago, a lady moved into the apartment upstairs. She has a little boy who is an absolute joy to see. He smiles and waves, and will always try to come say hi personally by walking (and falling, he's just barely learning) up to you and high fiving you. 
     They seem really nice, but every day almost all day she's constantly yelling at the little boy. Swearing and stomping her feet, she yells at him for making messes and not sleeping. The not sleeping one is probably the worst because she yells at him starting at like 7 to go to sleep, then he cries, obviously, which just makes her yell more sometimes this has gone on untill 11! It breaks my heart that such a sweet kid is treated like that. I don't have kids and I am baby of the family, so I don't really know what it's like to parent one. However, the kid is just barely learning how to walk now, and it's been almost a year of this. Seems to me he's too young to be doing something that merits that much anger. Surely this is excessive? Is there anything I can do to help the kid?
      My mom tells me to never tell a parent how to raise their child, but I'd gladly make an exception to that rule here.",17Oct2020,1
160,"Hey,   
I don't even know where to begin. An old friend of mine was extremely toxic and racist in our circle, we decided it was time for him to change or we couldn't associate with us. The words he had said were too much, it was consistent the way he dropped racial slurs and other homophobic terms. This was months ago, we all moved on as he was unwilling to change. Recently, he made an instagram post explaining he was going to talk about us, his ""controlling"", ""manipulative"", and ""bullying"" group. I wouldn't think much of it, but if he name drops us, things could get rather scary. If somehow my employer, or anyone were to get a hold of this video, its their word over mine, and that can cost me so much in my current field.

163,"I have this dilemma where i ha e this friend group, I’ve know most of the people there for awhile, but ever since a couple months ago it’s like they were no where to be seen. 

Long story short, there’s this one friend A and this other friend B, and A and B started getting closer which I have no problem with and could care less about, but after I got into a little scuffle with friend A (he’s always tried to kind of test me even when we were like 12) it’s seems like A didn’t want me around anymore and so B just went with it. 

I was pretty hurt when I was the only one not invited to this vacation trip, and I didn’t get a text or a message or nothing, and that let me know like ok like they don’t give like two shits about me. It was a slow decline but I went from hanging out with these friends like 2-3 times a week to just nothing for like 2 months, and barely this week friend B is inviting me to play basketball again. 

And I just don’t feel like spending time with people who probably don’t even care about like a single thing about how I feel, and they’re taking so much headspace in my head but I doubt I’ve ever even crossed their minds. 

It seems like since I stopped smoking weed and got into that altercation with friend A ive just basically haven’t heard a word from them. As I said before today friend B invited me to play basketball, and he invited me yesterday to play as well but I’m just saying no bc I don’t really want to waste my time anymore.

We both always played games together like gta,cod,Minecraft I just miss it he always talk about ours future him coming to visit me in Thailand. When I panic he’ll calm me down by sweet talk.

The thing is that a few of my friends are apparently trump supporters and big Christians. They follow everything trump says and also says that a bunch of random things I think are ok are sins. For example, I was over st my friends house the other day and they had a baby sister and they randomly said “the only reason she’s around is because us Christians believe in pro life no matter what” and I just kind of looked at him surprised because I have another Christian friend who is pro choice and not pro life. Then, tonight, I was texting about something that involved Biden and one of them went “Biden supporters are horrible and evil people” not knowing I was a Biden supporter and all of them started saying how trump was a million times better than Biden and yada yada yada. I just kind of sat there and didn’t say anything until I said I was a Biden supporter. Nobody has said anything since then besides the other Biden supporter in the friend group saying something about how her cat just ate an entire stick of butter and that it was terrifying but that isn’t important to this story. So then I went and asked one of my other lgbtq community friends what happened when they openly came out during  school this one time (she’s very open about her sexuality) and asked her specifically what my friend’s reactions were and she said that she only saw two of their reactions and that they said ew and made a grossed out look. So now I’m sitting here as a closeted bi dude with probably my closest friends hating on the entire queer community including myself.

174,"I’ve always been someone who bases my time around having things to look forward to. The easiest example is tea. If I’m stuck in school I just look forward to having a warm cup of tea and watching YouTube to relax, and that’s at gets me through the day.

This same thing applies to my week. I look forward to getting high or drunk on the weekends with my friends and that’s what gets me through the week.

But recently, I’ve noticed that it’s a problem. I need things to look forward to other than drugs, and I need to find enough enjoyment in the moment that I don’t have to look forward to things to get through the day. 

My looking forward to drugs has led me to over-romanticizing them and hanging out with people I wouldn’t normally do stuff with because I want drugs. I don’t think that drugs are a form of escapism for me, because I never do them alone, but they’re just the same as anything else I looked forward to.

I don’t need rehab, I only drink or smoke like 3 or 4 times a month. But I realize that I do need a change in mindset and I need to figure out how to enjoy things in the present. I also probably need new hobbies.

I’m also not under-achieving in life right now. I have a girlfriend who really makes me happy, I have friends who I like (I don’t even necessarily always get drunk or high when I’m with some of them), I’m going to be able to go to a good university and get a degree in something that I find super interesting, though my relationship with my family has suffered a little bit recently.

I have a dresser from Ikea I want to bring to my apartment but nobody’s willing to help even though I ask. I don’t drive and my plans to get my license and car got ruined because of corona. Last time I went in my old bedroom my sister had drawers opened, stuff all over the floor. She even put the cat litter box and one of the cats in the room because according to her the other cats bully this cat (not true). Everytime I go over to visit shes always in the room so I cannot retrieve the rest of my belongings. I do not know what to do as I am at my wits end but my apartment is small and has my husbands stuff in it. We need my Ikea dresser for more storage and dad says I can put stuff in the attic at my grandparents we never sold after they passed away but i feel like they complain when I ask for help. (I can take the stuff out the bedroom into the car its just I have to have my parents drive the car for me).

I been trying and asking for help since I moved out and everytime I go in my old room it either smells bad because of the cat litterbox or it looks like one of those “cleaning my bedroom at 2am” youtube videos because my sister put her stuff in the room. She doesn’t clean the room at all and she actually has a bedroom in the basement not cleaned either. Instead of cleaning her room she moves into my old room without telling me, takes a storage box my mom brought me to personally put her stuff in and when I go to get my stuff “little by little” (when my sisters not home) I get mad seeing the condition my old bedroom is left in. I actually cleaned it up a few times because its horrible. I am actually afraid to get the rest of my stuff out and going inside the bedroom but like I said I want my stuff either in the apartment or in my grandparents attic that my dad said I can keep the rest of my belongings in until I either get a bigger apartment or a house.

I was new to the weed scene so I didn’t know what one looked like. Later that night my best friend had me take hits off of the “vape” pen, but she later confessed that it was a dab pen. I expressed my feelings to her and I her I wasn’t happy. Her apology was something along of the lines of “I’m sorry. But if I didn’t lie to you then you would’ve never tried it.”

So the next time I see him It’s about a year later and I’m at a friends house and he shows up through mutual friends and such fourth and we got along this time nothing weird just chatted that was that in the next time he hit me up on Facebook and he was offering me money to have sex with him I made it clear to him that was not gonna happen even though he kept offering me larger amounts of money.So then I stop responding to him but I felt like kind of bad because even though it was rude of him to do that I’m a nice person I’m a Libra and I forgive people pretty easily so I said hey man I don’t want you to think I’m ignoring you I’m just really busy and somehow slimy as done typed that comment and he thought that I was calling him a slime ball The reason I’m saying that is because that’s his nickname that he made for me . Moving on to another year that goes by he hit me upAsk what I’m doing and let them know that I was just at a hotel chilling right and he hit me up again and asks if he can he could come charge his phone and I was like sure why not man he gets there and we just chat talk nothing weird right I said hey you wanna watch a movie man and he’s like porn? And I was like no man  I put on a stand up comedy. He went and took a shower after that and I fell asleep I woke up he was gone so now this is like another right now I would like three years in total have gone by right and I go to jail for doing something stupid And when I got out which is like October 1 this year . 
So when I go onto my messenger 
This dude hit me up hit me up right away right now my gosh I’m so glad you’re out and he sent me a link to this video but I had not watched it because I thought it was a picture that he sent I wasn’t really paying attention and if I would’ve saw the video right then and there I would’ve said something way different than what I said then . he had let me known that he was sober and I said yeah me too man that’s cool I’m trying to stay sober too and then he got  really weird he started talking about this other guy that I know that I really do not like and as well start being very sexually suggestive and he wouldn’t stop so I stop talking to him rightPurple days latermy dad had let me know that there’s a YouTube video app and some guy sent an apology to me Posted on September 9 2020 The video is a 30 minute video of him talking about me how he l is in love with me and honestly if you watch the video you can tell he’s a stray psychopath.  In the video he said some really mean things apparently and that’s why I sent Make an apology to me because he sent me a really mean text that I never got to see even beciase blocked him back in the  the day 
After soliciting me for sex. 
In the video he reads 
How much he wants to kill me and weird shit oh cause I wouldn’t allow him to have sex with me But After he reads of the text he changes his mood into about how awesome I am and what kind of person I am and I’m just really cool and like other stuff and actually says some  pretty nice things about me about me that  a very charming smile is just really good rapper and that he decided I was gonna be his best friend and blah blah blah In the end he started talking about how he has a lot of cooking videos and then he talked about me and everyone One as well So then my dad sent me that video iMessage and said what is up with that man can you take it down my dad didn’t even know that I was just the slightest bit gay bro open my family you’re really affecting my social life can you please take that down he refuses and then he starts acting all crazy now even changed his picture to a picture of a black Jesus and his post or like every hour is it about me or the guy that I don’t like And he’s changed his profile picture to a black Jesusc.

So I adopted a second cat two days ago. A little black cat that my mom fostered until he was the age to be adopted, and I adopted him.

We did it a few times on Saturday and there was one instance where I was worried that I either shot some inside after I pulled out or if some came out before I pulled out. 

She's 3 or 4 days late on her period (it was supposed to happen Monday) and I've been told to give it a week and a half before I panic. It's too late for plan b and we can't get an abortion pill because our state requires that an adult be present.

192,"Hi, 

I am 19F, attending school full time (online due to covid), and moved in with my grandparents after my dorm was shut down in March (also due to covid). I have a bad relationship with my parents and will never move back with them, which they know. I am however very close with my grandparents, and am so gracious that they let me live with them. So, I have been living here since March and overall it has been great. However, I have severe depression and it reached an all time low this summer, I came very close to hanging myself (they don't know that, but they know I suffer with mental health problems). Covid has been rough for everyone, but I feel like it has really been bad for me. The only place I have been in the last 7 months is walmart to pick up my meds, and my parents house to visit a few times. I was already isolated at my dorms (I self-isolate when I get depressed, and also have social anxiety) but I was at least able to go out. I also reconnected with a friend in April and have really been wanting to hang out with her, but I can't because of covid and not wanting to potentially expose my grandparents (which I totally understand). I also have a long distance long term bf who I'd like to visit (there is also an age gap which I've chosen to hide..complicates things even more and I can't really be fully open with them about it). I was going to visit him this october, but postponed it as the covid numbers are increasing. I'd really like to visit him soon, but again, I don't want to expose by grandparents.

ANYWAYS, I have been looking into student rentals and feel like I hit the jackpot. I found a newly renovated place (basement apartment, but I can deal with it) 5 minute walk to a mall/groceries/pharmacy. It's a quiet neighbourhood, and the 2 other female tenants go to my school and are also in the sciences! It just seems so perfect. It's only $550/month all inclusive. I currently have a little over 8k in savings and make about 500-600/month from freelance work, which I am trying to continue growing. I only plan on leasing the place until the end of the school year (April), so I could easily afford the 5 months rent + groceries, and if I decide I don't want to tap too much into my savings or the freelance work slows down, the mall is always hiring part time workers. 

I think the pros outweigh the cons, which are that I'll really miss my grandparents and their dog, and that I am nervous about it/slightly uncomfortable (only due to social anxiety and depression, so really, challenging this could help). I am hoping to move out mid November ideally, so about a month from now. Because of this, I need to tell them ASAP. I will likely be seeing my bf shortly after I move out (early december), so it does look a bit fishy. I don't want them to think that this is just about my boyfriend, and I don't want them to be hurt by my decision.. It really is mostly about my mental health, but I feel like if I bring that up they may blame themselves for it. 

Anyways, my head has been so jumbled these last few days and I just want some advice/reassurance. I already made a list of the pros and cons, and the pros seem to far outweigh the cons.. but I am still working on my cognitive distortions, so my depression and anxiety tend to give me a lot of guilt/a very pessimistic outlook. Am I making a good decision? How do I tell my grandparents without hurting them? 

thanks! :)",17Oct2020,1
193,"So my mom died when I was a baby. I’m 17 now and every year since she’s been dead I’ve been given $3000 from the government. I think it’s called survivors benefit ? Maybe. Idk. But anyway I pay income tax on the money and it actually goes to my parents. I kind of assumed the money would be eventually used for school and me. Cause I’m paying for it. But today I asked my dad and he basically said it’s not really for school. I’m not sure how much is left but I don’t think there’s much. Should I push further? Should I see where my $48,000 went? Or should I just leave it. I know things were rough for him when she died but he had a good paying job.

195,"F(15). I've tried to find other posts for something related to this but I haven't been able to find anything for my particular circumstance so I figured I would try this sub. Anyway, for some background I'm a lesbian and my coming to terms with that was over the last few years. I was around 10 when I realized I liked girls but I went really on and off with labels until about 2 years ago when I started developing more sexual attraction and eventually accepted that I am a lesbian. Since then, I came out to my sister a long time ago and I came out to my dad about a year ago by now. Coming out to them was honestly really difficult for me because they were constantly doubting me about it and trying to convince me that I wasn't gay or even that I wasn't into girls at all. When I came out to my dad, I was having a full on panic attack and bawling my eyes out and the whole experience brought about an insane amount of stress and anxiety for me, and unfortunately that still hasn't gone away since I still haven't told my mom. When I was little I used to say that I had crushes on boys (for reasons that are unnecessary to the current situation) but because of that, my mom is deadset on me being straight. During my whole questioning process from ages like 11-13, I was always open about it and always told her that I was questioning my sexuality and I even admitted to her when I got a girlfriend in middle school. But despite that she still always disregards it as a phase and doesn't believe I like girls at all. So it's just causing a lot of anxiety for me and making me super insecure about it because I feel like I have to be so secretive about something that I literally can't do anything about. At the same time though, I don't know how to come out to her because she just won't accept what I tell her. And honestly, I really don't want to deal with all the doubting and frustrating comments that my dad and sister made again so I'm just at a complete loss. Do I keep it a secret and live with the anxiety for who knows how much longer, or do I come out and have to deal with my mom's bullshit for the next few months or so? I just feel really alone and I don't have anyone I can talk to about this so if anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.

196,"Is my jealousy about my friends unhealthy?

So idk if this makes any sense, but I’m weirdly weirdly jealous of my friends. Always have been. I have trouble getting close to people, and when I make a friend or someone genuinely tried to interact with me, it’s a massive deal to me and I don’t get *obbsessed* with them, but I have irrational reactions about things they do sometimes that I KNOW are irrational but I can’t help.

Like I can remember a couple of years ago getting close to someone, and one time, it’d been a few hours since I’d texted them and they hadn’t responded. I basically had a panic attack and couldn’t stop crying for hours and spent hours in a spiral of “she hates me, she doesn’t want to be my friend, no one wants to be my friend, I’m so lonely, I’m always gonna be alone.” 

And yeah that’s kind of indicative of what I’m like in friendships. I never tell the other person how much they mean to me or that things like that mess me up, because like I said, I know it’s irrational.

Anyway, earlier today (I’m a college freshman btw) I had plans to go somewhere with the one real friend I’ve made, and we were FaceTiming and gonna leave pretty soon. I went to the bathroom but another person from my dorm was in the common room, and they will talk and talk and talk and I’m not assertive enough to be able to leave the conversation. I always try to do body language things like stepping away and trying to end the conversation organically, but it still ended up being a forty fuckin minute conversation. The friend I was gonna go somewhere with left their dorm and walked past me and ended up going to the place with another person (who I want to be friends with but I don’t know how to initiate friendships oof), and I’m literally obsessing over it. 

Like, I don’t know how to explain that going somewhere with them meant literally so much to me and the fact that they didn’t even like...try to rescue me and just left with someone else hurts. I know it’s my fault for not just leaving the conversation (which, btw, does anyone have tips for leaving a conversation for someone who is not at all assertive? Bc I’ve literally been super late for classes bc of talking to this person and still don’t know how to end conversations), but yeah.  

I obsess over shit like this with every friend I have. Is that like...really unhealthy? I know it’s irrational, but I get super attached to people and when they do stuff it makes me feel embarrassingly shitty. Like, even the way small stuff. Idk

How can I get over myself and stop becoming useless for three days after a friend punctuates a text message weirdly? I’m sick of being so volatile I just want to be able to deal like a normal person",17Oct2020,1

198,"Background: I've had the same part time job in retail for the past 5 years(Currently 21). There's a core group of us around 8 people who've become a main friend group. The only thing is that I'm the only guy in this group/at work in general.  


So over the years we've all hung out on a bunch of occasions and have all these group chats. Obviously there's been tons of group chats made over the years with myself not being a part of them because they either weren't relevant to me or I was excluded because I was a guy. Completely justifiable. Now I like to think I have pretty thick skin and not much people do or say can really do too much to me so little stuff like that never bothered me.   


So either I walked into the stock room at the wrong time today or they just blatantly didn't care that I showed up but they were all talking about how they were going to have so much fun tomorrow... weird, to my knowledge there weren't any plans to hangout until a couple weeks from now. So they kept talking and turns out that a bunch of them are hanging out tomorrow.   


Now it's obvious to me that sometimes being the only guy does get me uninvited from the occasional hangout, that much is obvious and I have no issue with that. But am I justified in being mad that they so casually exclude me and don't bat an eye at it? Is it weird that I'd be ok with it if they said, ""hey a bunch of us are hanging out over the weekend but it's gonna be a girl's night thing sorry""  


Even without them saying it I do understand that part, but there have been other times when its just felt like a kick in the head. Two years ago at Christmas we had a work dinner where the entire store went out, not just the part timers. We had a good time, everything went well.... Then I head home and about an hour later one of them posts a picture with nearly every other part time worker at her house having their secret santa. I was the only one not there. They went through the process of organizing a secret santa, hosting it, and then no one even mentioned it at work or around me. I'm a pretty non-confrontational person so I registered that it happened and then suppressed it. It didn't even surface until last December when I was having a conversation with one of them and they mentioned how excited they were for secret santa again this year. Now I've been told I have a monotone voice and people can't tell the tone of it very well, but when I said, ""oh cool, maybe this year I'll actually get invited"" her face went pale. She actually didn't believe me for the first bit insisting I had been there to which I managed dug up the picture of everyone minus me at secret santa. She started apologizing and saying how bad she felt (a year too late in my books) but I accepted the apology because I had already gotten over it by that point. My main issue was the fact that they either intentionally excluded me or that I was somehow forgotten... their friend of 4 years at that point.   


There have been other instances of this that I catch every once in a while, a group lunch I never got the text for, a ""small"" birthday party that I never got the invite to. It starts to add up after a while and at this point I'm really wanting to just cancel on them every time they invite me at this point. If I'm getting the invite this time, odds are I've missed the invite the last two times and fuck that.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: coworkers of 5+ years have become a close group of friends in which I'm the only guy. I have been forgotten or selectively not invited to some (that I know of, there's probably more that I don't know about) group hangouts, some justifiable, a lot not.   


Idk, am I just dwelling on isolated instances and making them bigger than they are? or do my ""friends"" only care to have me around every once in a while and ignore me for the rest of it?",17Oct2020,1
199,"So by the end of the year, my savings will have surpassed 10k for the first time in my life. I wanted to plan a special trip. I wanted to go to Italy sometime after January. It would be many firsts for me. First time going to Europe, first trip by myself, no parents, etc.

However I have begun to doubt myself about this possible trip for many reasons. I often make pros and cons lists for these kinds of things. Here’s what I have so far.

Cons: 
Covid-19 issues: For all I know travel issues might still be going on by then. I might not even be allowed to go due to it.

Europeans hate Americans: I am apolitical but based on things I’ve heard from both traveled-Americans and foreigners online, Europeans are extremely unfriendly to Americans. Idk if I could handle that. Also I know that this one might be blown out of proportion but then again maybe not, who knows because I don’t.

Language barrier: I can only speak English and I’ve tried learning other languages but they have never really taken to me. I’ll keep trying, and I’ve heard that it likely wouldn’t be an issue, but it would still embarrass me being so inept at trying to converse through a language barrier.

Expensive: Trips are cheaper than usual right now for obvious reasons but still pretty expensive internationally.

Culture Shock: This can be a good thing and a bad thing. I’ve only ever been to Canada and have not experienced a truly different culture in my life. Idk how well I’d adapt. But I’m interested in it and believe it is good for the soul to experience other ways of life outside of home.

Pros: 
Culture Shock: See above.

Engaging in my interest in history and architecture: I very much enjoy learning about history, particularly medieval and Renaissance history, and Italy is a hotspot for that. Same goes for architecture.

Checks off many firsts in my life: Like I said above, this would be my first trip by myself, and my first trip to Europe.

203,"Made new friends a little more than a year ago in my last year of college. These news friends were pretty much all from a city a couple hours away from me and after university finished, a majority of them went back to their home city. I haven't seen the ones that went back to their city since March before the lockdown and graduation. They always said that they were going to come up one weekend. This weekend, my brother in law, his brother, and I are going to that city and I told the friends with enough time in advance that I'll be going to the city and that we should meet up the night I'll be in the city. Initially, they enthusiastically agreed and they said they'd tell me what they're up to that night. After a while, I checked in and they said that they're actually going to be in my city that weekend. In that moment I was really disappointed but I didn't think the worse, I guess it was bad timing, they don't have to plan when they're coming to this city around me. Now, something in the back of my head is saying they took the opportunity to come to my city when I'm going to be away to avoid me. Out of ALL the weekends, it had to be this one?? On Instagram, I see that they're having a party in my city tonight! (Don't worry, it's not a big party, more like a small get together with drinks and beer pong). Before graduation and the pandemic they used to always invite me to these parties. I'm really confused as to why I wasn't invited, because I'm here in this city today and I'm pretty sure they know that. Here is a conversation the optimist in me is thinking there was a miscommunication - as in he thinks I'm in their city today:

Me: So did you guys decide what you're doing tomorrow?

Him: We are in (my city)

Me: Ok even sunday?

Him: We will be back Sunday afternoon. How long you in (his city) for?

Me: Haha damn that's when I come back to (my city)

Him: Shit. Im sure we will be up soon

Anyways, not really sure what to make of this. If he knows I'm in my city today and they hosted a party today, how come NO ONE invited me? Does anyone else think it was a miscommunication and he just thinks I'm in his city today instead of mine? Really not sure why they wouldn't invite me after all this time of not seeing them?",17Oct2020,1

We talked and made out while cuddling the whole time, and even admitted to being really attracted to one another. Seemed like a great night!

The rest of our friend group knows we spent the night together, but we agreed to keep what we did and talked about a secret. However, I started to catch feelings for her, but I cant tell if it’s reciprocal  

While walking her back to her dorm, though, it felt kinda weird - like it didn’t have the same vibe we usually have when we’re together. She hasn’t messaged me at the same rate as before, and she had dinner with only one of the other girls in our friend group instead of all of us together like we always do every night (which I assumed they talked about what happened, even though we agreed to keep it a secret). In fact, now I’m scared that she’s spreading stuff to our friend group and they no longer look at me the same, including her.

Was all of this a mistake, or am I reading into this a bit too much? It seems like she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, so I’m scared that I ruined our friendship and perhaps the group dynamic. We have a “date” scheduled for tomorrow, to which she has not asked to cancel (so I guess that’s a good sign), but should I be concerned about how awkward it might be? Should I just tell her how I feel? Should I just ask to be friends like we used to be?",17Oct2020,1

208,"Sorry for the format, I’m on my phone.

I want honest advice on this if I’m overreacting or if I’m reasonable for feeling like this. I am a 17F who has been in a relationship for a while now and today my bf came over to drop something off that he got from his trip and I walked out in a tank top to grab it. Afterwards my dad came to me and said “I love you but you need to watch what you wear around your boyfriend because I know how boys think” 

This isn’t the first time that he’s brought this up to me, but both times it’s made me uncomfortable. The fact that my own boyfriend doesn’t even comment on what I wear but my dad does feels so disgusting to me. He’s the type of husband that tells my mom that he doesn’t love her unless they have sex, and growing up I’ve heard these arguments so in conclusion I’ve already come to the belief that my dad has no respect for women or even his own wife. A couple years ago I even had to start wearing padded swimming suits since I was obviously growing and he even commented on it, he said something along the lines of “you know your daughter is growing when she has to wear a padded swimming suit” and that honestly made me so uncomfortable? Even my boyfriend knows how to control himself and that’s why I’m comfortable wearing a tank top around him, a tank top for crying out loud. Am I just being dramatic?",17Oct2020,1

But I hate my personality particularly the way I think...

I will gave you examples 

I love video games I've been playing since I was 4 maybe but Instead of just enjoying the game I start thinking 
(Why am playing) (what is the benefits)
and I start thinking about stuff like that until I loss all the fun, I used to fool myself by saying that I can learn english from games(not my mother langauge) I learned english when I was 14 so I lost this benefit so I started fooling myself be saying I can learn other stuff like biology if the game is about those stuff and things like that 

I WANT TO JUST ENJOY THE GAME!!!

I'm also an artist and a writer (I want to creat my own manga) but I always ask myself is it worth it ? I have zero talent in drawing but I became a decent artist only through hard work I bought courses and books about anatomy and every other skill until I almost mastered it all

213,"I’m gonna try to make this as short as I can so here we go....

Yesterday, my sister (14) was looking through my brothers iPad and was shocked to see the messages he has sent to his friend (11M). They are both in 6th grade. When I asked to see the messages, I was just as shocked as my sister. Messages included calling girls hoes, making threats about my sister (14) wishing she died in a crash all because she didn’t let him use her skateboard after he made a hole in the wall when he was riding it in the house, and he also said things about f*cking girls and has said some more extremely sexual things no 11 year old should be saying. That’s not all, he has also sent a photo of his......well his you know what hanging out. My sister and I were super shocked about it and we denied the fact that it was his until we noticed that he took the photo in our parents room since we recognized the dresser. We were super shocked and disgusted and also angry that he did that. His friend said “is that yours?” My brother dodged the question and kept talking about sexual things. My sister was absolutely shocked and just broke down crying. 

I really didn’t know what to do at this point and I had no choice but to delete the photo he sent from the conversation. I also found the friend’s phone number and immediately sent him a text message explaining that we were looking through his iPad and found their conversation. I also told him about the seriousness of keeping such photos and he could get in serious trouble for it. At first, the boy denied and said “I don’t have a photo. And if I did, I would’ve deleted it.” He then confessed after I told him that he could get in serious trouble if the photo was passed around and if his parents find it, they’ll contact my parents and things will be a whole lot messy and worse. He fessed up and admitted that my brother did send the photo and that he deleted the photo the second he saw it. I apologized that he ever had to see such things from my brother and that my brother will apologize to him as well. 


As soon as my brother came home, my sister (18) told me not to tell him the real reason why his iPad is taken away. I was confused and said that he should know the real reason and she couldn’t fathom to tell him and didn’t want me telling him either. My brother has a lack of online safety skills and he put himself in jeopardy by sending an inappropriate photo. I believe by telling him, he should understand what he did was wrong and incredibly dangerous. 

Later, he wanted to use his iPad and at this point, he had no clue that his iPad was taken away. He began rummaging through and yelled at my sisters and demanded that he gets it back. They refused and he acted hostile and disrespectful towards them. This afternoon, the same thing happened again, he was walking around and yelling about his iPad and how he wants it back. My sister told him that he was not getting his iPad back because of his “grades”. My brother was not having it at all and got even more angry. When my sister (14) was telling my brother she had voice recordings, my brother got anxious and demanded that he hears it. She also was looking through photos of the screenshots we took from his iPad that contain the conversations between him and his friend. My brother got paranoid when he saw a glimpse from far away and tried to take my sisters phone. He got angry at her for supposedly “spying” on him and he looked incredibly anxious as if he had something to hide. I read the tension from his face and he clearly did, since we already saw what he had sent. 

Part of me wants to tell him the real reason why his iPad got taken away but the other part of me is worried that my sisters will get mad at me for telling him in the first place. Should I tell him anyway? What should I do at this point?",17Oct2020,1
214," (tw// possible mention of minor abuse)
On mobile, apologies for spelling or formatting errors. Also to keep this as anonymous as possible I'm changing the years and my age so if the timeline doesn't add up, that is why.(I repeat, I am not actually the age specified)
 (I'm not sure if what happens is technically even considered abuse, but I just want to warn people in case this triggers something)

To start this off, I'm a 20f and my paternal grandmother died before I was born, and my grandfather remarried a different woman when I was  very young. I never really formed a bond with her, so I can't say a whole lot about her. I have never had much contact with my grandparents, as my dad distanced himself from them pretty soon after his mom died. When I was around ten, we moved closer to his house and I had to stay at their house a lot more than I ever had. (For reference, I had only seen them a handful of times in a controlled environment, and then it went to spending a week at a time with them over breaks) I hated going to their house. They wouldn't allow me to lock the bathroom doors, because they thought I would die and they wouldn't know it. My step-grandmother would also bathe me, even though I was capable of doing it on my own. I'm a very quiet person, so I tried to voice my concerns directly and they kind of blew me off, so I assumed this was normal behavior for grandparents. They also took no interest in what I liked to do, and I would generally stay on my phone the entire time I was there, unless they took me out. I realized a while later that it was weird that I wasn't allowed to lock the doors or shower alone, and I told my parents. My grandparents were made aware that what they were doing was wrong, and they stopped. 

A few years later my parents had a big falling out with my grandparents, and went no contact for about four years. I would still get occasional texts and checks for my birthday, but that was it as far as contact. Now that there is a pandemic, my grandparents have started to contact me through Skype, and texting more frequently. I usually make sure my dad is supervising, because I still don't feel comfortable around them, even if it is completely online. They pretend to have interest in my hobbies, but then will quickly jump to something political like the presidential race. 

I know the only reason they have started to contact me is because they fear they are going to die from the virus. If this virus never happened I know we would have been no contact until someone died, and we probably still wouldn't have consistent contact.

I don't know what to do. I have absolutely no desire to continue speaking to my grandparents. I don't know I'm being petty for holding a grudge against them. Should I continue contact with them because they are still technically my grandparents? Or should I cut contact because they only want to be in my life because they are scared?",17Oct2020,1
215,"Soo I’m battling with some internal issues, mentally. And it’s hard to deal with on a daily basis especially at work and stuff because I have triggers. I’m a former PTSD patient. And at work, the symptoms tend to flare up. Some close coworkers know this info because I confide in them a lot. But lve realized that some times people do not understand my “triggers” and have no knowledge of how to be around me.  Everyone is not responsible for my wellbeing and the world doesn’t necessarily revolve around and I understand that but another thing when people know delicate info about me but choose to ignore. There’s this one coworker in particular who likes to “scare” people jokingly. I Am not a fan. I’ve told her that. She also likes to pretend like she’s gonna hit me and she ended up hitting me with something on my head today and she joked about it. I ended up getting a panic attack But I was discreet about it and left to take a break. 
I use to get beat and yelled at by my father and flinch really bad and loud sounds are like terrifying to me. 
She does it out of nothing but play and I understand that but I’m 23 and she’s 31 and it feels quite childish. I had to let her know she hurt me by telling me that “everyone steps on me for being quite and shy”. And when I let her know she was the one that was HURT for saying that and she ended up making it about her than about how I felt. So I’m not understanding how I’m suppose to let her know about the other two incidents following the first one. I’m annoyed and very upset. I feel soooo sensitive and stupid already with myself and having to explain again to someone is almost more exhausting than ANYTHING.

216,"In general, my sexuality is seriously fucked beyond repair. Part of it has to do with me discovering porn WAY too early, at age 9, and seeing a lot of not-vanilla stuff, and im sure some of it is inherent. I've watched way too many, very, very wrong things. Forced sex, monster porn, incest (specificallt daddy-daughter, this is the one that makes me want to slit my wrists because I feel so guilty for liking it. I dont watch it anymore, havent in 3-4 years, im 18F, but every time I remember SEARCHING for it I just want to very literally die because I feel like an awful person), some at the very least borderline necrophilia stuff but I dont remember if Ive actually fantasized about actual necro shit or if im making it up in my head and Im scared because thats so wrong but maybe I did do it?

I am in therapy. My therapist keeps telling me that since I dont condone any of that in real life, I dont want any of that in real life, and I clearly distinguish fantasy from reality and have not myself done anything to anyone else that would be abnormal, I shouldnt worry too much. But God, the guilt eats me up inside. I dont see how Im supposed to live for the rest of my life knowing that this is the stuff I either am or have been into. There is vanilla stuff I like as well so I could ""fake it"" in a relationship but I dont think I could lie to my partner like that. No one is ever going to love me because of this. How could anyone ever accept me? I certainly fucking wouldnt accept this, and I dont. I just feel awful. I legitimately wish I was dead so I wouldnt have to deal with this anymore, but Im too scared to hurt myself so I wont. What the fuck am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to pretend like Im normal and a good person when I KNOW IM NOT? All my friends would be disgusted with me. They would abandon me if they knew. I cant deal with this.",17Oct2020,1

219,"Long story short, last year my boyfriends family had their world turned upside down. His sister got pregnant with her boyfriend while they were living under my bfs parents roof, and they didn’t tell them for six months, and then it came out that his older brother had molested her when they were little kids.

This happened around the end of the year, it was a lot of painful long talks, a lot of distancing, but around Christmas his parents wanted us to come have dinner with them and the older brother, and his new girlfriend.

His new girlfriend had no idea, and she had told my bfs mom that she was a victim of sexual abuse by her own brother.

So my bf and I both told them that we felt like we couldn’t get close to them until she knew the truth about what was going on in the fam. Christmas rolled around and he still hadn’t told her, and my bfs parents invited us to dinner with them, and I told my bf to stand firm in saying no because his parents kept begging us to come have dinner with them. They were fighting with his sister at the time, so they didn’t want to have dinner with her, but I still felt like we should have considering she was the victim and the one who just had a baby. 

The next day I called his mom and tried to talk to her and hear her side to smooth everything over, and that I would talk to my bf about maybe talking to his brother when he felt ready, but honestly had no intention of doing that. Idk. The whole thing was so convoluted and I just didn’t want them to take advantage of how kind my boyfriend can be by pretending like everything was okay. Like they wanted us to come break bread with them and act like everything was fine, and I feel like they should have considered how this affected my boyfriend.",17Oct2020,1

222,"For context, this is my first time living on my own and I’m not masterful at conflict resolution. I want to see how others might initiate a conversation.

Now to the important stuff:

Our apartment complex has a pretty strict no-smoking policy, to the extent that they’ll fine you up to $500 for violating this rule. 

The past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lingering cigarette smell creeping into my front door. I am quite sensitive to it, to the point that it worsens my nausea. I know for a fact it’s coming from his apartment. 

My neighbor also has a rather large Great Dane puppy. This in and of itself isn’t an issue. He just doesn’t leash him like he should. He said living on the third floor makes it difficult for him to keep him harnessed when going down the stairs. 

Normally, this doesn’t bother me. Today, though, as I was leaving my apartment and attempting to lock my door, my neighbor’s dog came barreling ass up the stairs. He saw me at my door and jumped on me. He knocked me over and was on me for several seconds before my neighbor got him off of me. Strangely, my neighbor didn’t say anything — he just pulled the dog off and went inside. Not even an apology. (Maybe he was embarrassed?) 

I have been having back and hip pain and this didn’t really help. I am quite sore now. 

I thought about talking to my neighbor. I don’t want to involve property management unless he has an issue with me suggesting he keep his dog on a leash and smoke outside. I also hate feeling like a busy body. I would care less if these things weren’t directly affecting me.

224,"I’m a senior in high school and have been invited by a friend to drive down to a big party school on Halloween/ game day weekend to visit his brother with him and a few others.  The problem is that my last Cross Country meet ever will be on the same weekend. 

If I do not attend the meet the team will realistically not be effected much. I am one of the better runners on the team so my absence would worsen our score and drop us a few places, but since there is no state meet and we do not qualify for any third party tournaments, little else would change.

Deep down I don’t really mind missing the meet as I’ve had dozens in the past and I could treat the regional meet the same as I would treat the sectional and feel perfectly contempt about my running career. The issue is that I am a team captain and my coach is writing one of my letters of recommendation. The coach has been known for holding the entire team out of meets for missing practice so I genuinely fear he could refuse to submit my recommendation letter or deny that I was a captain if a potential college I was hoping to attend were to ask.

The school I’d be visiting is really wild and my friend’s brother’s fraternity has a big house off campus on fifty acres where no one can bother us. It would probably capitalize my high school experience as one of my most memorable moments.

My choices are to attend the meet and miss out on the time of my life with my friends and probably one of my most memorable experiences from high school or to go have fun and possibly throw a wrench in my college application process and upset my friends and coaches.

With quarantine going on it’s hard for me to keep in touch with most of my friends at university, especially when they already have their own social lives besides hanging out with me. Also being on campus (walking to class, going to the library, etc) was one of the ways I could “bump” into someone I knew, and we’d hang out. But of course that’s gone now because of COVID.

I do plan on studying on campus eventually (I’ve been studying off campus so far) and found a list of safe places to study, so that will be one of my action plans. 

We’ve just finished midterms though, so there’s not much point in studying on campus at the moment. 

How would you keep in touch with your friends during this time? I’ve asked some other people before about how they keep up traditions with (for example) movie nights, game nights, and stuff. And it always seemed like they just “happened” to get together to do things. (what???)

I’ve tried texting some of the people I know, asking how they’re doing, but they don’t respond.. or only respond after a long period of time. Which I can totally understand if they’re busy, but it’s also like.. they’re not putting in the effort to hang out.. which makes me wonder if it’s still worth asking them to hang out...

I don't like the label of asexuality/aromatic because I really *want* to have sex, it's just if it actually comes down to it, if it's outside of my head, I lose interest. Also, if I start to like someone, as soon as it becomes more ""real"" by them liking me back and whatnot I lose some interest. 

I used to date my current best friend and I have never felt such strong feelings for anybody. I am generally not very touchy feely but I was very touchy with him and I loved it. We broke up because I didn't like the idea of kissing him/being sexual with him and I also wanted to kinda experiment.

Last time we talked was Wednesday (Saturday today). He still sees and likes my posts/stories on Instagram. I’m new to all this. Do guys usually do this? Or has he lost interest? It felt like it was going okay and he asked about my feelings and thoughts on long distance, said he would want a relation in the long run and not just a fling etc. I’m confused.

234,"And i really dont want to considering that my friend (lets call him max) has always been a jovial borderline asshole for a really long time around me especially during my depression periods so that rubbed off on me now im pretty much doing what he does which is ignoring problems by making fun of them.

so this is what he wants me to apologize to her for:

i went over to his house to set up some music equipment and every like 2-5 minutes his gf on his bed keeps calling him over to make out which i didnt mind when i was setting the stuff up. but then it got to the point to where she would straight up interrupt us in the middle of recording just to make out with max again. i literally called her out and told her to just hold off at least until we were done recording or in between takes and she started crying.

this is the same bitch that cheated on max so many fucking times over speculation that max may be cheating on her which is next level petty. the relationship is extremely toxic im 80% of the time caught in the middle of her arguing with max about her suspicions of her talking to other girls. they broke up and got back together so often i honestly cant wait for when they get married so i can go to multiple weddings.

so max kicked me out of the house and told me to take the equipment with me but i told him ""either burn it or keep it here"" because music was his passion and eventually became my passion but nowadays he sees it as a privilege for me to even have the equipment there.

some things to keep in mind here: max lost his virginity at 11 or 12 and hes been in multiple generic high school relationships since even if he wasnt in high school. 

me, this other girl who initially had a crush on her, and max became really close friends but he uninstalled discord and cut her off, and he blocked me on snapchat and my number. all because his gf doesnt want him socializing online anymore.

to put the nail in the coffin on how much of a simp he is, he spent $200 of his child support money to buy her jewelry just so she could stay with him. did i mention hes 15 and shes 18? i know theres like a romeo and juliet law teen morality shit, but theres so much other shit wrong with this relationship the elimination of pedophilia is overshadowed by alot.

(if you're wondering how old i personally am, by the time im writing this i am currently 17 years old. unimportant but i feel if im bringing up ages i should take myself into account)

he has a seriously warped sense of value it seems cause he was ready to cut me and my other friend off just for this girl who has done so much less than we have ever did for max. i took him out to eat, movies, i called him lyfts home, he was starving once and i postmated him some food. i cant say i didnt cry when i came to terms with that.

and its not as easy as saying sorry to her and everything will be fine no; he wants me to be a borderline emotionless mute around his gf while recording the music which is serious bullshit. 

because of her, the fun and the adventure of creating is now sucked out because max's ADULT GIRLFRIEND is sensitive.",17Oct2020,1
235,"**TL;DR:** *Ok so my mom has been asking me what possible part-time jobs she can apply for, or certificate programs she can complete to find a part-time gig, and I'm honestly not sure so I hoped one of you out there could help us by sharing some ideas.*

My mom has been working since she was a teenager, mainly in the restaurant business. Unfortunately, the pandemic caused her recent restaurant to shut down prematurely and she has been unemployed since Spring. Next month she is officially set to retire, but she isn't sure what to do with her life now and she needs more income. There seems to be more urgency to figure out what to do with her future now that I have plans to move out. Her nest will be empty, she has no partner, and doesn't hold many friendships outside of her bonds with her siblings. She also is bilingual (Spanish and English) but struggles to communicate much in English due to a lack of confidence and anxiety. However, she is also very amicable, upbeat, and practically an expert at customer service from her decades of experience. 

Has anyone else's parents' experienced something similar? Or does anyone have any suggestions for possible routes she could take (again, preferably part-time jobs or short, free programs she can gain skills to apply for a suitable part-time job)?

Me and my friend are planning to sneak out the house and go to an abandoned house about half a mile away, getting out of the house is easy, but soon after we run into some problems.

Outside the side door, we would go up this hill to a set of houses, go around them, pass through his dads open garage, sneak past our ex-friends house, go back down a second hill, and make our way to the abandoned house.

Except when we go do down the hill, just across the road is a dog, a very loud dog that likes to bark, behind that house with the dog is a bunch more pit bulls caged up, so the plan would’ve been to go to the left of the house down that road, go through about a 1/4 mile of bushes that have been cleared, and go straight to the abandoned house, there’s some dense bush to the left when we go down the hill that could possibly help us secretly make our way down the road to get to the clearing, but we don’t know if it’s a viable option, we need help to get those past those dogs, we’re planning to leave in About 40 minutes, so any help is greatly appreciated!

But one day, I began to text a dude i met here on Reddit, and we eventually agreed to hang out and jerk off together on call. Now, I got on the call but by that point I was already so horny I finished before we could start. The guilt and horror I felt after that moment was insurmountable. Not that there’s anything wrong with being gay, but I’m not gay. And I wouldn’t consider myself bisexual either. I’ve watched gay porn on multiple occasions but I’ve watched more straight porn, and generally I’ve been into women. But ever since that day I’ve felt like something was off. Now I still get horny to women but not as much as usual, and I often find myself sometimes thinking about having sex with men, and I’m fine being bisexual and all but I need some way to deal with my past of jerking off and being a horny fuck all the time, using sites like omegle to try and get nudes (I’m a minor btw) and watching a lot of porn. Now, I’m fine being bisexual, I don’t think I’m ever going to fuck a guy but I don’t care that I find a few men attractive (I generally have a much wider variety of female attraction as opposed to male) I just want to feel pure again and not forget my past but move on from it and learn from it.

239,"Hi all. I (29F) have had this on my mind for a while now.

When I was a teenager I was always sure I'd never want kids. I was one of those teens who ""couldn't stand"" them. As I got into my twenties that changed. I found I liked kids and they liked me, and that I'm really good with them (at least to the extent that you can make a blanket statement about people like that). I still wasnt sure that I wanted any, though.

I guess all this time, I was clinging to the notion that once you reach a certain age, you just know one way or another. But I'm almost 30 now and that hasn't happened. I've thought on it long and hard, and I'm genuinely not trying to force myself into feeling one way or another. I truly don't know. When I think about having kids or not having them, I feel kind of good and kind of anxious about both scenarios. Like having kids could be too overwhelming but not having them could feel empty or sad.

The thing is, my boyfriend really wants to have kids someday. And y'all, he is the one (provided we end up on the same page about this). I've never been so sure of anything. I definitely am not going to talk myself into this (someday) if it's not really what I want, but maybe it is! I just feel some pressure to figure it out sooner than later, because he's so sure he wants a family, and if I decide I don't, I don't want to waste years of his time by waiting too long to figure it out.

So, has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you decide, and do you regret your decision or feel good about it?

Rather than help them I ended up \*literally\* running around my house. I scrambled up the xbox game cases but didn't turn it on, and turned on Disney+ but never put anything on.

Luckily about a month or so ago he made a group chat with me and some other friends he was about to hurt himself we had stopped him and he said he would try his hardest not to have those thoughts anymore. 

At the time I thought me and my friends could support him out of feeling that way. At the time me and my friend talked about telling someone he was feeling this way but we ended deciding not to mainly because we didn't know who and we thought if we did if would just make him feel worse.

258,"Okay..... I divorced my narcissistic husband in 2015. Due to trauma drama, I didn’t demand anything from him (alimony, child support for our autistic son). Everything was based on a handshake. He would provide a monthly stipend and pay my car payment/registration/insurance. It wasn’t much, but livable. My super GENEROUS parents have provided me and my two children shelter, so rent wasn’t a problem. 
Then my ex gets remarried. His new wife has decided that since my kids are of age (over 18), my ex no longer has to provide for them; no more monthly stipend. 
Now comes the f***ed part. Before we divorced, my husband (at the time) and I claimed bankruptcy for the second time. Included with that was a loan my mother (bless her) gave us. This this the second loan she has provided us. She took out a second mortgage on her house to give us money to live on! 
After the bankruptcy cleared, he announced we (he) didn’t have to pay her back since it was ‘cleared’ in the bankruptcy. So now my mother is stuck with the mortgage loan instead of us (him) paying her back. The reason I keep saying it’s his fault is because I’m not employed and he has income. (Hence me and kids staying with my parents). 
The issue I’m struggling with is: do I tell his wife how he f***ed my mother over? He owes her thousands of dollars. She is retired and little income. The money he paid back would greatly benefit her (and me, I’m not gonna lie).

So I jumped out of bed and ran upstairs to say goodnight. I noticed he was off of the Playstation 4 in the living room and asked to go play in there with my brother. (Im living with 2 other brothers) and my dad said no, I had asked why and the answer I recived was because we would be loud. I tried to reason and say that we have played in there in the past and had no issues with, anything, really. My dad pointed out that if we have been on it in the padt why woukd it matter if we played now? I just wanted to play and didnt feel like waiting was necessary. I asked why we woukd wait for morning if we have done it in the past and no problems? This is where things get bad.

He told me why I cant just accwpt no for an answer, why I cant just accept it and move on. How when, he was a kid, we would just accept their answer and wouldnt argue. He mentioned his job, how he doesnt question their desicions. I asked if life is that bad and he said yes. I then asked if it had to, if life had to stay that way and if it coukd change. He said that some things dont change. I said that he could easily change it if he wanted to. Again, nothing. He said that I have 0 respect for him, how I dont respect his rules or what he says. Ill admit. That line hurt. I greeted him at the startvof every day, always said goodnight to him and gave him a hug. I hung around with him, and chatted with him. He was one of the best people to be around and generaly a wonderful person. I asked if he really thought the worst of me, if he really thought I had 0 respect. He accuzed me of argueing again and I said to stop avoiding my point. There was a long pause. 

 He mentioned how he was under a lot of stress. He is fighting with my mom, my mom is fighting wih his dad and now im fighting with him. I stayed silent, I didnt know what to say. I didnt want to make it worse. He said he is this close to a divorce and the only thing that is stopping him is us. His kids. But if we dont care, if we arent greatful for the things we already do have, then whats the point. Why would he keep fighting. Appereantly other people have seen his situation and asked why he doesnt just leave. I dont remember his answer but I dont think he gave one. He mentioned that we dont even have much money and hes trying to keep together what little we have.

""We, her and her dad, were already promised Cat. I don't know how much I trust you to take care of him. You could adopt a different cat of your own to live there. I miss him too. I think about him every day and love him so much. Had I not been the extra push, you and brother wouldn't have had Cat around. Brother agreed that he doesn't know how he feels about you taking good care of Cat. Can you afford the down payment for a pet (yes)? Are you sure your apartment allows cats that still have their claws (yes)? Can you afford the damage payments and cleaning fees when you move out (I don't know. That won't be for at least two years)? Where will he go when you finish college (MY PLACE)? Your mom doesn't want to keep him and if you end up moving back with her he may end up having to be rehomed again (Not a chance. My mom loves him and said that if I do end up moving back that he can totally stay). It isn't that I dislike you or don't trust you (see the SECOND sentence), but he isn't your cat (or hers. She paid nothing for him), and your brother already made a promise. If he told you to message me to ask if I'd change my mind, then I'm upset at him, not you. If I had him, it isn't like you'd never see him again. If you or your cousins had him, I'd never get to see or visit him again. I am not comfortable contacting you or them for visits or pictures (just stupid, I take SO many pictures and would happily send her pictures and let her see him, but she lives about four hours away, and I can't drive due to extreme anxiety and autism. I can't focus and have severe sensory issues). Brother made an agreement. I have it in writing (seriously?). I like you a lot, but I don't see how you're monetarily able to care for him (I have a job). He needs vet visits on top of the extra money your apartment will require for having him there ($15 extra a month). If you're in a studio, (I'm not) he'll barely have anywhere to go. Here we have a cat-loving dog to keep him company, and my dad can afford the vet bills, get him the right kind of food, litter, and entertainment (the right stuff? We already have toys and stuff for him).  And he'll have other animals around so he isn't alone (animal, and I currently am almost always home, and I will have roommates to pet and entertainment him).""

I really don't like not having animals around.  I have almost $2,000 saved up.  I just don't even want to get into with her. With everything she said even before this message, she is just rude, contradictory, kind of spoiled (see her saying her dad will be paying for everything), and frankly, I am quite certain she has uncontrolled mental issues.

264,"When I was just a tike age 4 to 7 my grandfather used to scratch my back while I sat on his lap.  During these episodes he used to scratch and eventually go down to the crack of my butt and goof around there. I always hopped off when that happened and eventually stopped going for scratching. Another thing I hated was he used to “ goose” me and my sister too when we were ahead of him on the stairs. My question is do you parents consider this sexual abuse? What would you do if you found out your father was doing this to your own kids?   
My grandmother used to get drunk and  go into the closet, come out do a can can dance throwing up her house dress with no underwear. Parents, same question.  This is the first time I ever told these horrible events.",17Oct2020,1
265,"(This my first post sorry if my grammar is off) So I am 17 living with my father after my mother divorced with him 10 years ago (I still have a really good connection with my mother)  until after a few months ago my dad remarried. Me and my dad moved out of the state 2 years ago while my mom and my sister are staying in state. The woman my dad remarried is kind, brings food to the table and fits well with my dad. With me not so much, for a year now she has been living with us with her daughter, her daughter is nice she does what every little girl does. But with the mother, she sometimes irate me so much, she thinks she can fit the role of a mother too me and I hate that feeling because she is trying to be something she is not. Here something to know about me too, most of the time I do not call people that are not blood related family, friends I call family sometimes but only good friends and there a reason there a good friend. I do respect her and be kind to her because my father taught me that and I do respect my dad wish to marry her because I do love my dad a lot and his words are always first before hers, but sometimes I just want to run my mouth and tell her that I will never consider her family and never call her any more than my dad's wife. But I kept my cool and didn't because she is also carry my dad child which would mean my half sister, I will take care and treat my half sister well.

After that background information my question is how to deal with her and am I suppose to care about her? Do I confront her? If she past away one day am I suppose to care about her or even grieve? Do I have to fear about my relationship with my dad if I confront her? Also I am usually easy going, rarely have any problem during school, nice to everyone unless they did something bad towards and when I talk about my feelings or issues it gets me to tear up. This is just incase you guys needed to know what kind of person I am to help with my situation

If its too much to ask I also have a scenario I would like to ask and answer on how I should of done it better or if I did what was right. 

Scenario 1: My room is a mess and I try to clean it up but I just can't, no excuse and that's one of my flaws. When I was gone for a few hours I seen that my computer keyboard and mouse were gone and asked my dad if he seen it, then my dad's wife said ""I took it because your room was a mess"". I said ""I have a meeting!"". (It was to meet with an army recruiter to join the air force because I had a big brain XD and I didn't yell at her at the top of my lungs, I just raised my voice a bit). She then proceed to say ""I told you if your room is a mess I will take it"". I said ""Ok, I have a meeting!"". She said ""Don't talk to me like that I'm not your friend"". All I said after that was ""Ok"". When she said I'm not your friend just like triggered me and I wanted to just tell her that she was not my mother but did not say it. Did I do the right thing and say nothing or should I said something?

Thank you in advance to the people that answer with this, I been holding this in for a while and there are times where I just tell my dad that I want to go with my mother and sister and go back to the states and never come over to my dad when she was around. I think this is a toxic relationship but she doesn't know. Thank you for listening to my concern and I hope everyone is having a better day then I am.  :)",17Oct2020,1

In march 2020 i was about to leave my hometown to go to college, but suddenly the pandemic striked. During this 7 months of cuarantine i did a lot of self-analysis and i came to the realisation that i'm a BAD person. But what did i do to end up having this thought?

Throughout my love life I have been cheated on in almost every relationship. I’ve been hurt so much that I don’t trust what people say, and I tend to be very bland when it comes to describing myself.

I know this issue is a lot more complicated than others, and I know that there’s not one simple solution. I just need some guidance, I don’t talk about this stuff with my friends. I’m 18 and I’m still young, but it feels like I’ve never felt love before.

268,"My wife [25/F] and I [29/M] just moved into a new house about 5 months ago. We chose it because it's closer to where we work. As a downside, we're also closer to my wife's parents [45/M/F].

My wife and I have been together for close to 7 years and have been married for nearly 5. We are very happy together. Through this all, her parents haven't really liked me all that much.

Since we moved into the new house, her parents have taken it as an invitation to come over whenever they please which is very often. They have also walked in on us having sex in the living room twice now. Our house is a decent size, larger than her parents. They even once asked my wife if she would consider letting them move in for a little while. Not wanting to cause trouble, she said she'd talk to me. I said no. 

They have also become a lot more hostile towards me. Everything I do or say to my wife is wrong. A week ago, my wife, a social worker, got pretty upset due to how mentally exhausting her job is after a rough day. I asked her if she would like to take a break from work for a little while, take a few months off, then look for a new job. She's been considering it. When her parents came over (uninvited) earlier this week, her dad asked me why I didn't want her to work. I explained why I suggested it and he just kept going on and on about the lack of respect I have for his daughter.

My FIL isn't just rough on me (although he did asked me if I ever planned on getting a real job-- I'm a surgeon). He's getting increasingly worse to my wife. He pokes fun at her schizophrenia and depression which she is incredibly self conscious about. He asks all the time when we plan on having kids with the full knowledge that we tried really hard for about a year and when we finally had luck, we lost the baby 6 months into the pregnancy. This was and still is extremely hard on my wife despite it occuring nearly 3 years ago. We still think we're going to wait a couple more years before trying again.

They take stuff from our house too. We needed to leave town one weekend for a funeral and they never returned the key despite us asking. They take simple things like plates. They've also taken my wife's vibrator, her meds, my computer mouse, several pairs of my scrubs, and even once took all of my wife's work polos. When she called and asked about the polos they originally said they didn't have them, but she went over and found them in their basement and her mom said she was just washing them.

They came over one morning and started yelling at us for sleeping in so late. It was 9am on a weekend. What did it for me though is when they came over one morning after my wife had gone to work and told me that my wife was off her meds. I knew this wasn't true because I set them out with her breakfast and watch her take them almost every morning and evening.

I'm done with this and so is my wife.

I plan on changing the locks this weekend. I also ordered a ring doorbell and a couple of security cameras to put around the house. I would like to talk to her parents about our issues, but I worry about my wife who hates confrontation and despite everything really does love her parents. We had a conversation with them when they first walked in on us in the living room. It worked for a while, but things are getting a lot worse.

Is there any other advice anyone can offer? Anything is appreciated",17Oct2020,1
269,"This happened yesterday and I'm still a little shook about it.
My younger sister whose about 8 had been sneaking around and all that and saying how she was going to video call a friend she met in an online chat room. Obviously my parents didn't know about it if not it would not have led to what happened. 
She was using my mother's phone which was in my mom's room which she then attempt to go sneak in and get when my dad caught her and told her to go to bed. I was completely unaware if what was happening as she had told me earlier that she was going to videocall a school friend that she claimed my mom knew about.
After she got sent back, the so called ""friend"" called and my dad picked up only to get faced with a naked Indian boy.
My dad came into the room in a rage and slapped her and started to hit her. My mom came in and stopped him.
Seeing that triggered me because something similar happened to me when I was younger. Around 13. Mind you I live in a Muslim household. 
My dad had gone into my bathroom for something and found these smutty lesbian things that I had written and confronted me about it with a slap. He then proceeded to beat me with a belt and call me names like whore..slut..asking if I wanted to ruin my life and go and write such things. My mom intervened again then. This caused me to go down a mental spiral.
Yesterday I had bad flashbacks about it and just broke down. I eventually calmed down by watching cartoons (which might sound like a weird coping mechanism).
It's currently morning. I haven't said good morning or anything and I have no idea how to act. I have this urge to just hide away and never come out again. I worried I might have another episode.

Even if it's the smallest passive aggressive comment, it feels like humanity thinks of me as a punching bag. I cannot stand when people stare at me. I think of everyone as untrustworthy and possibly sadistic. White men scare me, especially if they appear well-muscled.

271,"ADVICE So I used to be sorta friends with this girl when we were in elementary/middle school. Its been many years since I've seen her or hung out with her. We are 17 now. Her mom just unexpectedly and suddenly passed away about 3 months ago, and obviously she is having a really hard time. I reached out to him and asked if she wanted to get coffee, and she said yes so we are meeting next week. Apparently she has lost a lot of friends who couldn't stick around during this hard time and she is struggling immensly. I'll just be honest- I want to be there for her. But I'm so nervous. i have no experiance with this sort of thing and I desperately want to be there for her and not make her feel at all uncomfortable or like I'm being insensitive. These are my main questions-

1. When I see her, do I bring up her mom? like ask how shes doing with it/if she wants to talk about it?

2. Do I bring up stuff about me/ tell her what's going on in my life? I'm on the border on whether this would be a good release from grief or super insensitive and bad. Ya know like her mom just died, is it wrong of me to tell her about my soccer team and how school is going?

3. Can I ask her questions about her life right now, when I know that it's not good? I always ask people questions about school, their sports, what they're up to, etc. But it's different now because I know she and her family are spending a lot of their days in grief and struggling so is that insensitive of me?

4. Just like, what do I say in general. to be a good, kind, supportive friend without making her feel awkward or like I'm walking on eggshells around her. 

Pls give me real advice, I'm nervous and want to do good for her. Also side note I never met her mom.",17Oct2020,1
272,"On mobile, sorry for formatting issues and grammar and please don't steal my post. OK, so I know that sounds weird, but honestly I'm at the end of my tether here.

Basically I have no idea what is wrong with me, am I depressed? Am I just distant? Am I worthless? Or am I just invisible? Who knows.

But what I do know, is that I'm tired all the time, I feel so under appreciated by my family, (I (31f) my fiance (31m) miss 6 and Mr 3). I am a stay at home mum and honestly I feel like I have completely lost my sense of self, like I have no idea who I was before my kids. The worst bit is I have no idea how to find me again.

I'm a bit of an introvert, meaning I don't have a lot of friends but the ones I do have are great (however, due to my nature I don't like to bring them down by telling them this) so I can't really talk to them.
I feel like even though I try my hardest for my family, its never enough. My oldest I'm sure hates me since I am a little hard on her (trying to emphasise that she is a role model to her brother hence why she can't do certain things) my son is lovely. I love them both dearly and wouldn't change them for the world.

However, we are not financially sound, nor have we been for the last few years, they have been pretty rough for us (we had good jobs when the kids were born but when I got pregnant with the second we found it more financially viable for me to stay at home to look after the kids rather than spending my entire paycheck on childcare) , fiance was off for 6 months with a horrendous eye injury, so I picked up working nightfill at the local supermarket to supplement what he was getting from acc. This was great, I started feeling more like an individual again. Not one that mattered (as I was working in a very cheavanistic environment). But it helped.

Now am I depressed, I don't think so, I'm not sad all the time, more like blank. All the time. I only get 'happy ' about things that happen or are about to happen, just not for no reason. But then I listen to random songs and suddenly I'm tearing up, like I have no idea why, these songs aren't really significant in any way, I just like them, and it won't happen all the time, just sometimes.

Now I feel invisible in that no one listens to me, I always put my family and kids first, so much so that in the last 10 years (my relationship length) I have put off getting new glasses which I desperately need, going to a dentist, getting proper health checks, the list goes on. It's very rare that I do something or get something for myself.

My question now is what is wrong with me? Why am I not just a normal person who is happy for the sake of being happy? Why do I feel like I'm constantly drowning in this life we have created? I love my fiance with all my heart, I really do, and he is a fantastic supporter of mine, but I feel invisible to him, a bit like I'm the maid.

Bare in mind also, I do not have money for a therapist, though I know I probably need one. So please tell what's wrong with me.",17Oct2020,1

I want to go work on a farm all next year in NorCal to get out of the city, save some money, and prep to go build a life in the wide open spaces of Wyoming. I have been studying and experimenting for years, and my homie who is kind of a mentor to me wants to open a gym with me where we mix movement/locomotion/mobility, lifting, and boxing. He is in Milwaukee but open to setting up elsewhere, so my first thought was Wyoming. 

With how beautiful it is, and how many outdoor recreational sports there are, and the main town I have interest in (Cody) has a small population, so I am curious if that culture/demographic would find value in mixing those movement principles? Was told there’s a chance in Laramie or Cheyenne, but the weather and aesthetic of Cody just seem super legit and without any real context, that’s where I see myself going. It would just be nice to get some feedback about gym culture in Cody, or Wyoming as a whole.

I respect people’s problems and the stuff they’re going through and however the might feel.

They complain about being lonely and sad, yet they make no effort to have social interactions with any of their family members or friends. They bi*ch about online classes being too difficult, yet they make no effort to learn and ask everybody for the answers to assignments. It’s annoying as hell that they’re throwing themselves deeper in a sh*thole and complain to everything else in the world besides themselves. However different their home and family situation is than mine they don’t seem to understand that they are in control and can change their life around. But they’d rather let it get worse. I’m tired of acting supportive and saying false compliments to them. All I really want to say is for them to stop being a bunch of fu*kheads and to get their sh*t together because that’s exactly what they need to do, but if I did they would get mad and/or view me differently and not ask me for advice anymore as they have gained some trust with me which means a lot to them.

He may have too many hours so next week I’m giving him less hours (he asked for more hours so I gave it to him).

I’ve tried my best to be supportive and help him but nothing is working.

Him being slow and quiet is not that big of a deal. It’s the attitude. I don’t want to waste my time and try to teach him if he doesn’t want to learn.

The other person I am training seems excited, willing to learn, and follows rules. The other guy does his own thing.

My boyfriend, his BM and their son, and what I need to do.

Recently, I've started dating this man. He and his BM have a son together.

I have my suspicions that She's trying to get him to leave me and get back with her for their son's sake. Which I completely understand. However. He does not want to get back together with her, and he keeps reassuring me that he loves me and he won't ever love her again.

But what am I going to do if she tells him that he can't be part of his son's life if he refuses to be with her? 

Basically, if I tell her that she needs to back off, would I be overstepping boundaries? I don't want to risk saying it because she can revoke his rights instantly if I say the wrong thing..

I've heard rumors that he has a diaper fetish, crossdressing fetish (which I do believe as the whole school has seen photos of him dressed in women's clothing), and a kink for black women.

And despite being a teacher's pet who answers literally every question in class (to the point where our math teacher refuses to answer him when he raises his hand because he needs to let other students speak), he constantly acts like a brat. When a black girl was giving a presentation in science class, he blasted this incredibly gross and racist song (since links aren't allowed here, look up ""Paulsego - You Got A Friend in Me parody), he's screamed during tests to annoy people, and once took a balloon to school, filled it fake blood, and pop it over a girl's desk on her birthday. He's only still allowed because he ""has ADD."" He and his friends constantly provoke food fights in lunch and blast metal music in the middle of class to annoy everyone.

He's also been arrested before. His dad is a rich lawyer in our area and seems to pamper him, telling him that's so much smarter and better than everyone else, and that we're all just jealous of him. And then his dad just bails him every time.

For whatever reason, he targets me especially. He spits on me, pours water in front of where I'm walking to make me slip, and insults me all the time. I remember this time in like spring 2019 where he and his friends were shouting nonsense in the middle of lunch, and I walked over telling him to stop.

292,"The company through which I get my health insurance sent me a $20 rewards, prepaid Visa gift card in the mail for a survey that I took for them. 

I just made a $200 Amazon Prime order about 5 minutes ago. While Amazon does not typically allow split payment, I at least wanted to try the $20 gift card first and see if it would knock my Amazon order down to $180. Instead it just used the $20 gift card to buy the entire $200 order. The order did not decline. I keep refreshing Amazon to see if the order has still gone through, and it has. Does anyone know why this this order didn't decline, despite the insufficient funds? 

I share an Amazon Prime account with others, but my credit card is not the default card on the account. As the Visa gift card will not cover $180 of the $200 order, will the default credit card on our Amazon account get charged for that remaining $180? 

Any insight into this is much appreciated.",17Oct2020,1
294,"Most of the advice I've found is very 'live and let live' and remember there's nothing shameful about sex, which I agree with in general and when they play loud music and have loud sex 7am to midnight I've just put my own music on and accepted it as a side effect of close quarters living. But this morning I was woken up just before 4am by the sounds of her moaning and shrieking (and I've never heard conversation through the walls so this definitely was Loud sex) and forced to stay up for half an hour until they finally quieted down. After being kept up that long it was difficult to get back to sleep so I probably lost a full hour to this.

I don't want to shame them or make them think I'm a nosy controlling neighbour, but do I think being so loud at anti-social hours for any non-emergency issue shows a lack of consideration that they need to be reminded is unacceptable.

We aren't the sort of neighbours to have a friendly chat and I don't have their phone numbers to text, but I'm not sure how to convey this issue - to me putting a note through their door seems passive aggressive but knocking on their door to talk to them might be too confrontational.

I tried to apply to another job at their company before that but was also told that the position was filled. 

The company is small so I know they all know each other.

Also I am fairly athletic since I have been playing sports throughout my life, and I have been training in tennis for several years. I’m probably going to try out for the tennis varsity team, and I think I can do well since honestly I’m pretty decent at the sport. However, I could not do a sit up or push up to save a life.

I never thought much about it until my friend told me that they liked each other but didn’t tell me because they didn’t want me to be upset. I swore up and down that I was fine. I was lying.

298,"I live in a ""senior citizen"" park. My mom, myself and my nephew currently stay here. I freelance and work late nights on my computer. My nephew has been fixing his car which is parked in the driveway.

My family has been residents here for about 15 years now and we own the trailer we stay in. During that time the property has changed ownership 3 times and is currently owned by a property management company. 

Anyway, the issue is that the grounds maintenance along with the property company constantly seem to single us out and claim we are responsible for things like filling up the dumpsters or comings and goings during the night. All hours they say.

These people outright are assuming we are something we are not. Frankly, I until recently worked a job where I would be on call 24 hours a day. It feels like we are being portrayed as a family of drug dealers or trouble makers and the fact is we are just living normal lives trying to work and survive without transportation in some cases etc.

What can we do because we keep getting warnings and theres rumors being spread and I wouldnt want my family to lose this place because our family has used it when one of us goes thru hardships financially and stay there while getting on our feet back under us.

299,"My dog is going to be put down in a few days. 

  
She is old. *Really* old. Still semi-functioning at age 18, my small poodle is undefeatable. For as long as I can remember, she has been in my life. Running around and gnawing on my hand when she's happy. Knowing when I'm sad and cuddling up next to me, especially during my depression episodes. All of the years we spent together, building up routines and caring for one another. 18 years.   
But those routines didn't last forever. I left for college, graduated, loved and hurt. I grew older just as she did. Do you want to know why she's still living it up today? She's stubborn. She can't die, there is too much food to eat and too many naps to have! Even as her eyesight fades. Even as her hearing deafens. Even as her legs give out and her jaw gives in and her now leathery skin shrinks itself to her skeleton. She refuses to go in her sleep because if she goes then no one will be there to cuddle her or pet her or kiss her head. But she's hurting, right? Putting her down is a mercy, right?

I've never experienced the death of a loved one before. I've been very lucky, but at the same time I'm dreading what's to come. Will I be able to cope with losing something so precious to me? That dog has been as much a part of my life as any of my closest friends and family. I treated her as a sister, not a pet. I love her so much it hurts. I would go through agony just to make her healthy and happy again, if I could. But I can't.

I don't know how I'm going to cope. How am I supposed to cope?  My world is crashing down around me, and just having the foreknowledge of what's to come makes it harder not to cry every minute of every damned day leading up to us killing her. I wish none of this had to happen. I loved her as best as I could. Does she know that?

Did I do a good job?",17Oct2020,1
300,"For the past few years I had grown tired of social life. Nothing like depression or anything, I just started to see patterns in close peers where it would be an emotional roller coaster almost in seasons.

What made me grow tired of it was the concept of practicing absence, friends suddenly want to hang out with you and ask why you never keep in touch etc., I take the bait, try to get back in the simple process of ""Yo what you up to"", which is my ideal way of getting together to kick it. No expectations other than to just hang out and talk about something that isnt using text messaging or phone calls.

And of course, the prospect of that was only fleeting, as it has been time and time again. From the outside perspective this seems like depression, but trust me it's not. That feeling with me lies elsewhere and it's something I have to figure out on my own.

With that being said, my introversion/introspection over the years has led me to a lot of dorky random facts/quirks. I often say just the most random shit out of turn when no one really wanted to be on the receiving end of that at all. Like I'm cool with being dorky and awkward at times because I've always been comfortable in the fact that I always had good company later. No longer the case; friends change, energy levels change. I feel I've grounded myself too much to not respond to stress like other people normally do, and I've been Miley Cyrus-ing people's comfort zone with my makeshift stupidity.

TL;DR I have this phrase I repeat in my head when I get drunk to not do stupid shit: ""Don't be that guy, don't be that guy, don't be that guy""

Is there an equivalent to control myself from thinking everyone wants to hear what I have to say about any area of experience? Like I hear someone talking about health and nutrition, I immediately want to get in on the conversation because I've learned so much; but most people tend to not care and I make a pretty bad impression even on people I've known for a minute..",17Oct2020,1

My husband lost his dad to COVID this year, and couldn't even get home to go to the funeral or see his family because of border closures. His dad was so close with him, and so supportive of his decision to live half way around the world. He'd come to visit almost every year, and even talked about retiring here. But over the last 5 years or so my husband had only seen him once a year at best, and I know that lost time is hard on him. 

His dad was really young, not in the age bracket of people that are high risk. It just happened so fast and intensely, and noone expected him to actually die. 

 We live in a relatively safe country (I'm not disclosing this in case he sees this post). But it means there's not really any chance of getting back until there is some hypothetical future where it is safe to travel internationally without risk, and without having to quarantine on return. 

We've done okay given the circumstances, but I'm worried that Christmas will be a hard time for him because I am literally his only family here. Everyone says the firsts are the hardest, Christmas, birthdays and anniversaries of death. Honestly, I'm worried about them all.

is this serious? anyone know what it could be?",17Oct2020,1
324,"My roommate said she would call the cops if I invited my only friend over...?

So about six months ago I started dating a guy(let’s call him M) with borderline personality disorder. It was new and fun and I was still figuring him out as I’ve never known someone with bpd (I hadn’t yet seen him do anything bad/concerning/outrageous/nothing only good times). About two months into our relationship, my roommate’s boyfriend decided to throw a surprise birthday party for her with like 6 people invited. A couple hours into the party M had gotten pretty drunk and started getting louder and more aggressive when everyone else was calm...then he started picking on one of the guys for no reason egging him on saying he wanted to fight, he smashed a beer bottle on the ground, and then roommate’s boyfriend separated him and calmed everyone down. We went inside, I was in my room with M when he started yelling at me(but I was drunk and didn’t understand why) saying things like “this is your fault”...I got scared and my roommate asked me if I wanted him to leave the house, I said yes. So they asked him to leave, they knew he couldn’t drive drunk so they just told him to go sit in his car in the driveway. But he was blackout drunk and refused. He was banging on the front door and screaming and eventually they called the cops on him and he left before they got there.... drove drunk to a gas station and slept in his car there. After this incident he explained to me that he completely misjudged how much he drank, that he could not remember anything at all that he did, admitted that he shouldn’t drink because of his bpd and that he is taking medicine daily for his bpd(but not actively seeing a professional to manage it). I forgave him and continued to see him but I only went to his house because it was tense at my house concerning him. Things were good but about a month after, we broke up because I started to feel like maybe we were too different and I would get tired of him quickly. So we only dated for ~3 months. 

About three months after we broke up I messaged him and we started chatting. We both caught up with each other and made plans to hangout and it was really fun. I forgot that he is one of two people in the whole world that can make me genuinely laugh till I cry....my roommate found out that we were speaking again and got very upset. She went behind my back saying that if I invite him over to the house she will call the cops... I understand she was upset right after the incident but if anyone were to forgive him I feel like it would be me and I have. My roommate can be extremely toxic sometimes (lying about utilities, “borrowing” without asking, had her boyfriend along with his friends over for 4 days straight and they stayed in the living room and didn’t clean up after each other, adopted a cat then decided she “can’t afford him” anymore because he’s annoying...basically a lot of delusional selfish things) she is also extremely good at confrontation and seems to thrive off of it, meanwhile I am the type to cry immediately in a confrontation. So I’m just wondering if I’m in the wrong and I just can’t see it? I’m terrified to say something to her because I will just cry and she always has good points in any arguement and I’m the type to just appease others no matter how I feel to avoid confrontation. I feel like since I live there too I have equal say in who can come over...? I only have one other friend so this whole situation really sucks. Sorry this is such a long rant but just wondering what advice I could get on this. Thanks :’)",17Oct2020,1
326,"Hey all, I’ve got a grown-up version of a classic schoolyard dilemma: should I report bad behavior of a classmate? 
Let’s call him Jake. Jake and I are both students in an American medical school. It is an institution that constantly stresses how we, as future doctors, should always strive to be gracious, courteous, and civil, even in our daily lives, because we represent our profession. Bad behavior is not a problem unless it is reported, but given the high expectations I’ve described, they are taken very seriously, and breaches of conduct can get on a student’s record and seriously hurt their chances of advancing in the field.
Jake has a problem with being homophobic, sexist, and otherwise intolerant (the exact things that we are encouraged to report). In one lunch hour, several of my friends and I had to explain to him that queer people have standards when it comes to sexuality, a man can find another man attractive, queer people don’t refer to each other exclusively as “honey” or “queen”, and yes, queer people behave like normal people do, because queer people are normal people. Only a few days ago, he was getting into a heated argument with another student, which led to Jake hurling the word “faggot” around about anyone he didn’t like. That same day, he repeatedly asked another student details about her sex life, which made her extremely uncomfortable. Then, after a class-based discussion about the ethics of abortion, he made the comment in our (informal) group chat about there being a lot of “baby killers” in our class, in reference to the people who are pro-choice. 
I have a meeting with our dean in a couple days, unrelated to Jake. I have had such meetings with the dean every so often just to ask for career and academic advice, but we often chat about quality of life and other little things, and I feel very strongly that I should report Jake’s behavior, mainly because I am personally offended by a lot of what he has to say, and I don’t think he should get away with it. On the flip side, I am scared of retaliation from Jake, because I don’t think it’s impossible he might figure out that I reported him. And, I don’t want to let my personal distaste for a someone and their opinions lead me on a revenge crusade. But what if, say, he has a gay patient in the future? I know that’s butterfly-effect-ing things, but if he doesn’t learn that his behavior is unacceptable, he may end up hurting people down the line who are vulnerable and coming to a doctor because they need help. The thought of that scares me. 
What do you think I should do? 
I should stress that I am willing to either go through with it or not, and that, of course, any advice will not absolutely affect my choice.",17Oct2020,1

329,"I recently had to do a college project that revolve around me filming myself answering theoretical interview questions. It took about 20 tries but I was pretty happy with the finished project and it was the first time I have ever filmed myself do anything.

I grew up watching and admiring you-tubers like Smosh and Pewdipie and thought “I could never do something like that”, but after seeing myself on a screen and how charismatic I can be when I really try, I’m kinda motivated.

If I were to ever pursue an internet career like this it would be a huge shift and I would have to give it everything i’ve got, because It would definitely have to pay out as I have a wife and two children to provide for.

330,"My(26f) husband(26m) and I are having issues that I do not know how to solve. Therapy is out of the question because I have no insurance and we are broke (I used to be in therapy and it didn't help, but I'm sure it was the therapist but she was from a free clinic and it was all I could do). I know this will be hard to try and solve but it at least feels good to just ""vent"" to someone. I feel that my husband doesn't love me and he feels that I don't love him but we both claim to love each other. We are talking about divorce because I feel that that is what is best for our 2 kids. He wants to keep trying and for me to keep giving him chances (he always promises to try harder), he rarely spends time or pays attention to us because he's always tired (he is a construction worker so I understand) and the rare days he's free or not tired all he wants to do is drink, watch TV, or play video games. I feel very unloved and get extremely sad when the kids try to get his attention and he's too busy on his phone or games. He says he feels unloved by me because I stopped looking good, don't keep the house clean (I'm a SAHM and full time student), am always angry (lately I have been extra angry, I admit that) or crying, don't cook (I don't cook for him most days anymore, but it is very discouraging to do so when he doesn't like anything I make, so I don't understand why he keeps wanting me to make him things that I'm going to have to end up throwing away). He feels that he works very hard to provide for us  and I don't because he still has to come home and cook for himself, watch the kids, do the outside yard work, and to top it off an angry or crying wife. I feel like I love him which is why I keep accepting to keep trying but lately it has been getting harder and harder for me keep going and I just do not know what to do anymore. I lash out at everyone and I don't want to be this way but I also can't stop. I've suffered from depression, OCD, and severe anxiety ever since I can remember, I had a traumatic childhood that led me to be this way and I also have no friends to talk to, I'm very lonely and feel like my husband was my only friend. I really really want there to be a solution but deep inside I feel like there is none and I don't know what to do. I also wouldn't know what to do if we do have to separate since I don't work, and we are inundated in debt, mortgage, and car payment. I'm at a breaking point and feel like I am going crazy, have terrible focus also so sorry if this doesn't make sense. The only thing that helps me is smoking. I smoke once a week, would everyday if I could honestly, since it's the only time to myself I get and it really curbs my anxiety and stress levels. Please someone give me any type of advice, suggestions, or just motivation to keep going. 

This is my first post so sorry if it looks weird, I've read it looks different when done on mobile.. i'm going to find other places to post this too because I'm desperate for any advice.

Anyway, the mechanic told me my car only has a few months left at best. The steering wheel is getting worse. I looked into all of my options and the best I could afford is 200 a month, plus 100 insurance, and that's if I really cut expenses. I can get a decent used car for 7000 and financed at 200 a month, but the insurance in Michigan is nuts. They want 200 for the insurance full coverage even though I haven't had an accident in five years.

&amp;#x200B;

So I took the biggest personal loan I was offered, which was 3,200. The first  car I had checked out by the mechanic was a total lemon. It was priced at 2,500 (internet price). Now I'm starting to freak out. Now that I took out the loan, I'm going to be making 140 a month payments. What if I can't find a drivable car for that amount of money? Plus every mechanic inspection is $50.

335,"This is my first time so my apologies if I’m not as clear as I should be, anyhow it’s a long story that spans from my sophomore year in high school to present day, so buckle up. I’m pretty much giving you a look into my life and the details I remember specifically about this issue so that you have a better understanding. I don’t really know if there’s a limit to how much I can say but I can tell you with confidence you want to read it all.

Sophomore Year

Sophomore year of high school was pretty good, had its ups and downs, I had been hanging out with this one girl and I kinda liked her but I didn’t really know, as I got to know her better she introduced me to her friend group and that’s when I met the girl, I’ll refer to her as SJ. SJ was B E A U Tifal and I was stunned because she was just so vibrant and amazing and I just kinda had this click that was like “you gotta be friends with this girl”. We hit it off! We had a lot of things in common and some things not in common but we actually had fun disagreeing and comparing our views and whatnot. We slowly got to know each other better and we actually bonded over not wanting to be friends with the original girl because she was going crazy and had the cops called at the movies one time. So more so we hung out more because we wanted to and not because we had the same friends. So sophomore year goes on, we’re hanging out, I meet her friends, we all hangout a lot and do a bunch of fun stuff, and I can’t help but feel attracted to this beautiful girl who has a fun relationship with me, atleast I think right, anyhow over time I deduced that she had a boyfriend, yet I’ve never seen this dude and we’re practically spending all our time together. Little did I know she’s dating some guy she met in the Bahamas on vacation who actually lives in California (Were in Texas). Dude is about the same age as her and kinda had a rich family. I don’t really know him that well or how they got started but every so often when there was a big school break she would spend her own money to go fly out and see this dude, and do some classic date stuff and then have sex and she leaves. The worst part, she doesn’t spare any details... so I’m falling for this girl and here she is telling me about how she is flying halfway across the country to get D from some dude she hit it off with on vacation.  This made me very distraught and depressed as I couldn’t seem to get my head off SJ no matter what I did. I had been very depressed before I met SJ and was seeing a therapist and pretty much gave my Therapist updates in her whenever I went for a session. As I was falling back Into depression over feeling helpless and not understanding how  SJ could really be in a relationship with this guy, My therapist died in a car accident. So I went into a pretty bad place and still to this day I have this gut feeling that I never got closure because I have never found a therapist the same as my last. I had gotten some really good advice from her before she had passed and I used that to help myself. I continued to hangout with SJ now with the knowledge of her boyfriend and I tried to keep my boundaries out of respect. What I didn’t understand was that she didn’t seem to care and started to feel distant from me ever since she told me about her boyfriend. Regardless we kept the friendship going and it wasn’t as strong but still pretty good. School goes on and life goes on and one day I’m sitting at home playing some games late into the night when I get a random call from SJ, “hey what’s re you doing right now! Let’s go get something to eat and have fun!” Mind you it’s 1-2 am in the morning. Being the lovestruck idiot I am I go and sneak out of my house and she picks me up. There’s some other people in the car and the plan is to bring everyone to our local whataburger. So I already get disappointed from feeling special like something could be happening to I’m not really all that special. So with my hopes down I’m eating a hamburger at 2 am and all her friends except for one leave with other people to get home and we get in her car and get ready to leave, “Hey so let’s go back to my place and watch a movie!” I was kinda shocked because I’ve never gone to a girls house so late and plus I really had no clue how any of this would go. So we go back to her place and we somehow sneak in (still have no clue how I wasn’t caught) and get up to her bedroom and she pulls out a spare mattress from under her bed. So she’s with her girly friend on the real bed but all of a sudden pops down to the mattress I’m on and just kind of leans against me. This was the closest I had ever gotten in a relationship and I was kind of panicked and trying to keep myself calm but I reach over and just start snuggling and spooning whatever you call it. This goes on for about half an hour while we’re watching this Netflix show when she turns around and looks at me and asks “Have you ever had your first kiss?” I say I haven’t “well do you want to?” After that my brain just exploded, after almost a year of being with this girl I had finally broken that boundary and I’m in! But then I think about her boyfriend, I feel bad, I feel bad for someone I don’t know across several states who Is sleeping easy because he thinks his girlfriend is the best and he couldn’t be happier. And I couldn’t do that to him because I wouldn’t want it to happen to me so I use the lamest excuse in history and say “I would love to but my lips are chapped” To this day I wish I had just gave no fucks and sent it because I don’t think I’d be writing this had I not taken that chance. Would I break my son morals, yes, but at least I wouldn’t be so heart broken in love with this girl that it affects me everyday. She was very disappointed from what I could tell and we snuggled the night away with no kiss in sight, friend awkwardly falling asleep on the real bed having no real clue as to what is going on. I slip out and get back home. The next week or two was rough, I was fighting myself for being too much of a square to do anything with my life and then I was imagining a relationship with SJ on a daily basis that it tortured me to be awake and be able to think. Spring break happened and she invited me to go to her Florida vacation house with her family and I politely refused as my family really thought I was getting in over my head, which I was. What ensued the following break was her teasing me on Snapchat with some nice pictures if I do say so myself. Break ends and we hang out a little, but then I get I to an argument with her and stop talking to her over the weekend. She was very upset and didn’t want to lose our friendship and we made amends. I had started to reach my breaking point and about a week later I called her and told her I liked her and wanted to go out with her. 

I was friend zoned, I expected it but didn’t expect it to be so easy. She clearly still cared for her California boyfriend even though she was seemingly seeing me constantly on the side. She started to keep her distance after that and I had never felt more like a failure. By now I had spent hundreds of dollars on fun gifts and birthday things and just going out to eat, and by no means was she suing me for money because she would often do the same and take turns paying for stuff. But you feel like this social and financial investment that is your best relationship ever has gone to waste and ruin.
Ever since middle school I had a superstition that if I ever told someone who I liked to wouldn’t work out, and perhaps this is some excuse I created for myself to be more prepared for the worst or to help me cope but I’ve never asked a girl out successfully and to be so close to SJ and fail like this was the largest hit I had taken at that age. I’m always hopeful but I really kicked into my inner devil’s advocate after that. The rest of the school year was a drag with SJ on my mind, we hung out and did the same stuff as usual but we never got super close for awhile.

Junior Year

Junior year had come around I felt like I was new and refreshed and ready to start as a new and rejuvenate self. My relationship with SJ had bolstered over summer but nothing crazy happened. I started to go my own way when it came to dating and when homecoming came around I didn’t have a date but ended up dancing with a girl and hitting it off with her, little did I know that girl was attracted to me for a day and then no longer. So I fall back to SJ and find comfort in consolidating with her. The year goes on, I get her a really sweet Christmas gift of the things she is always talking about but never has the change to get (cool shirts, accessories, etc..) she is elated but I feel a hole in myself as I don’t know if she even notices that I’m listening and doing these things for her. Winter break passes and second semester starts. SJ’s relationship with her boyfriend was rapidly deteriorating and she was constantly on the phone with him arguing and she was tired of consoling him until 1 am every night because he really seemed to have some problems and I hoped that he would see a professional so I got in contact with him and had a good conversation to help him find someone to help him. Yet alas SJ and her Cali Boyfriend break up. It was for the best. Now she was unhappy for a very small time and I was there for her but I was surprised how fast she got over him. What I didn’t know is that she had found a guy at our school and was dating him for about two weeks before she broke up with her Cali boyfriend! I was Astonished and broken. I had no clue that this was happening and it shocked me to think I might get another chance when she feels better and gets over this guy. The worst part of it all though was that she had just recently met this guy in a new class she was taking and he wasn’t all that great overall, he’s pretty stuck up and can be an asshole sometimes, but I guess she sees something else in this guy. I had been secretly heart broken for around a year now and still trying to find hope that maybe someday I could make it work but now I felt like nothing. The following weeks felt like they melted together and I melted into a long depression. SJ started hanging out with me less and less, we shared a class but her boyfriend was also in the same class so we never really talked after that. I would hangout or go do stuff with the friend group but not much else. As everyday seemed more dull and life seemed to be taunting me and making me feel as if I had no purpose, it continued to hurt and get worse. Her new boyfriend was about as in Innocent as me, didn’t know much about girls and had little to no experience. SJ turns him into a man real fast and he would not stop bolstering about what he was doing at lunch or whenever he got a chance. So her I am eating my shitty lunch hearing about how another person is having the life I dreamed of and I finally quit it, I leave and just stop going to lunch with my friends and stop hanging out and stop doing everything. I was completely alone for a month, no hangouts no nothing. I hit  a new low for myself but it was better than hearing sex stories and crying myself to sleep everyday. I started to get spouts of anger which mostly consisted of getting my bed as hard as I could until I couldn’t anymore. I often thought about how SJ’s family loved me and were always asking where I was and how I was doing when SJ herself seemed to really throw me away.  I ended up getting into a big fight with her when I found some random things to get angry about and both her friend group and my friend group hated me and cast me out and some still hate me today. So here I am as alone as I’ve ever felt, and boom COVID. I worked my way back up during COVID because people were isolated because it was not safe so I felt better being at home with my lonesome because it was the new norm. I brang myself back up and when things cooled down SJ and I had mutually forgave each other whether our friends cared or not. We started hanging while being safe of course, however I never saw her boyfriend for a long time because his family was super lock-downed. He couldn’t see SJ  his family didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything so this dude is going through a rough time being stuck. I frequently remember phone calls where SJ has to explain that she will always love him and I’m just a friend (he always seems to call whenever I’m over or were hanging out). So this was a blow to the chest every single time. If I had not gotten the sign already that my chances were zero to none already then I don’t know what’s wrong but I just kept going and going. We hangout, we have this special burger place that only me and her go to and we promised we won’t take any other person there. So we go there often and we eat and have fun and maybe go to the park. Just living good lives as best as we can. However one day she’s driving and she says she is going to go see her boyfriend. So I can’t Really do nothing and I’m like yeah that’s cool ok. We drive to his apartment and he is only allowed outside to walk his dog, so he gets in the back of the car and lets his dog loose and Then I have this crazy ass pit bull who’s deaf and can’t hear stop or whatever gnawing on my arm while SJ and Her BF are having a make out Sesh right behind me. When they’re done he takes the dog and goes home. I have never been more humiliated, frustrated, and defeated in my life, I didn’t say a word all the way back home. This happens several more times and I finally stop letting her drive so that I don’t have to deal with that shit anymore because I was so fucking done with being this fucking cuckold to a relationship that only existed in my mind. So this goes on for awhile and god knows what happens between her and her boyfriend but things start to come back around for me.

Senior Year (Present)

SJ is still seeing her boyfriend every so often but we have been hanging out a whole hell of a lot like when we first started but things are going really good. I got into astronomy and she loves that kind of stuff so I’m just kind of really giving her a good time, hiking, stargazing, late night ice cream runs, you name it.  Our relationship has everything a real relationship has without the label. At least I think, but that’s what hurts the most, because I’m still not there yet. At this point I pretty much do everything with her and her boyfriend just has sex with her and calls her and that’s just about it. Obviously thinking about that is not the greatest for me but I just block it out now. 

A week ago

So as we get closer to today and the culmination of my question. you have to understand that me and SJ are both each other’s closest friends, we go to each other for everything, we even planned a trip to Alaska for next year but had to cancel once we realized we’re too young to rent a car. So a week ago one of our good friends turned 18 and we go to the birthday party, small group COVID safe blah blah blah, SJ wears this stunning dress (theme was prom since ours got canceled) and I am once again infatuated with her as I seemingly always am. Party is great and I have to go home with the rest of the guys as we can’t sleepover. I’m tired as hell at this point and I’m snap chatting SJ about how sexy and stunning she was and she’s taking it very well. I basically say I’d do anything for her and she’s saying that she doesn’t really want to stay for the girls sleepover and for me to meet yo with her at her house. It’s 2 am and I get to her house. Sneak in, and once again just like 2 years ago, I am spooning and snuggling SJ and from what I can tell it went really well this time. No kiss offer though. Then she sends me this pretty explicit photo of her half naked from me being funny responding to one of her Snapchat stories and I’m just even more locked in. After that I’m basically having dinner with her family cause I’m staying at her house super late every so often and they still adore me. But I’m giving SJ some nice personal attention, scalp massages for hours you name it.  I never felt closer to achieving this years long goal and I’m pretty happy.

What made me feel pretty fucked again.

So here it is, two days ago. SJ has been craving our burger joints food for the whole month and really wanted a burger that they were only offering for a limited time so what do I do? After class I text SJ and ask her if she’s available around 8:00 pm cause I have a surprise, she says yes. I drive half an hour across town to get to this burger joint, pay and grab the food, drive half an hour back to our neighborhood. Time was pushed around due to traffic so I ask if she’s available at 9:00 she’s not, she tells me she’s getting ramen with her brother. So I kinda freak out and say don’t eat too much but have fun, hoping to god she still has a stomach for this food I got her. Of course this is like the worst case scenario with surprises because you can’t always expect it to work or go well but I go ahead anyways. She called me when I was driving and I don’t respond cause I’m driving. I probably should have called her back but I didn’t. And I go home and wait for her to get back home at 10:00 when she said she would be home. Having nothing to do I look around for five seconds and realize my worst fear. Not only with a quick snap maps search do I see SJ at her boyfriends house right now, but she used getting ramen with her brother as an excuse to cover it up, SJ who always shares too many details for once lies to me about what she’s doing. So now I’m pissed and sad and feeling all the emotions and no longer have the goal of being mr nice guy. When SJ is finished with whatever she is doing she says I should start heading to her place now, she then tells me that she feels sick. So with some scientific method thinking it’s easy as 1 2 3 to figure out that SJ just had Sex with her boyfriend, lied to me to get more time with him, and then wouldn’t even be able to accept my surprise due to her sex sickness. So I’m furious I’m absolutely blasted. I get to her place and give her the food, I ask her why she lied to me, all she had to do was say I’m already seeing my boyfriend at so and so time but I’m available at 10:00. She tells me thats why she called me earlier to let me know.So thats fair she tried to correct herself. Regardless I’m still fuming and stuck on my point and feeling like a worthless piece of shit. 

I’ve spent the last two years catering my life for this girl whether that matters or not and I can’t help but feel that her willingness to get more than comfortable with me and to basically cheat on her boyfriend is getting a grip on my mental health and I just want to ask, what do I do? 

What’s the best way to tell her that she’s gone too far. We still care about each other deeply but I don’t know how much more I can take as day to day I am berated and beaten by my own thoughts and failures. 

Anyhow thank you for reading this long long mess, all criticism I’m open to, I’m not perfect and I’m just trying to find my way in life right now, as much as people tell me I don’t need a relationship and I shouldn’t worry like I am I still can’t believe it and I just hope things will work out in the end. Once again thank you.",17Oct2020,1
336,"I’ve been going through a weird period in my life. I’m one of those people who has always known what I want to do since I was a little girl, which is work in the animal medical field. I am 21 years old and I have attained the first step to this goal and I am now a vet tech. The overall goal is to start my own veterinary clinic. But the issue is my whole life I’ve had this vision of what it would be like to be an adult and finally be able to start this career and this “successful adult life” as I imagined it. Growing up all my life until just recently I’ve felt like nothing can come in my way and almost as though when I turned 18 a switch would flip and I would automatically just start this successful life. I’m getting a hard slap in the face by reality that adulthood is not how I’ve dreamt it would be my entire life. I feel like I’ve been in a haze of the “American dream” which I’m now seeing is not as glorified as everyone makes it out to be. When I worked at my first vet clinic 2 years ago it felt like the most amazing thing ever. I was so proud of myself and would come home feeling like I learned something new everyday and always leave work with a sense of accomplishment. It felt like my true journey to this successful life I’ve always dreamt of was finally beginning. Recently I’ve been feeling dreadful about working at the vet. I switched to a new clinic to see if that would help and that lasted 2 months before I walked out because I felt like I couldn’t bare to be there one more day. I thought maybe I was just done working under someone and repeating the same routine everyday of working a 9-5 that I’ve been doing since I was 15 years old. So I decided to begin starting my own business. Even that is not making me feel fulfilled and I have no motivation to do it. I’m fantasizing giving everything up and buying a cabin and just starting my own farm and living off my own land. I just can’t seem to grasp the idea lately of having to work everyday of my life until I’m old and can retire just to have all these materialistic things I won’t even be able to enjoy because I’m working my ass off everyday to have them. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I feel like I’m having a midlife crisis at 21 years old. Someone please help",17Oct2020,1
337,"My grandma passed away at the end of August, and my mom has taken up smoking pot as a coping mechanism. my sister (23f) and i (21f) smoke recreationally, and several family members of ours smoke. weed isn’t the problem here, my mom being an ex drug addict is the issue.

from the time she was 13 until i was 8, my mom did hard drugs. i remember the horrors of my parents’ drug use (my dad didn’t start using until he met my mom in their twenties, but he still used as much and as harshly as her), and i know sobriety has been one of her most prideful achievements for the last 13 years. they turned their lives around for the good so much so that people are baffled when they hear of their pasts.

so fast forward, my grandma got sick with lung, brain, and liver cancer only in May. it hit the family like a truck. they gave her six months and she gave us 3 long and hard months. my mom is an only child, and suffered great childhood trauma under my grandma, but their relationship turned around when my mom sobered up, making them the best of friends. my grandma’s loss was and probably forever will be the hardest thing my family has ever gone through. my mom has been consistent with therapy for about three years now, and my family is pro mental health self care (we all love our therapists and the wonders they have done for us all individually haha). my mom has been speaking to her therapist about not just my grandma’s death, but also my grandma’s diagnosis and how quickly the whole journey went south. here’s a red flag: my mom hasn’t told her therapist she’s smoking. she said she doesn’t need to because “she’s a grown ass woman and she does what she’s wants”. i know the signs of addiction, and that right there is one of them if i’m going to be honest.

she is high 24/7, overspends on her product, sits and rolls joints in bed crying, lays on the floor in the living room crying and smoking, is too high to perform daily tasks or keep up with life.... it’s a lot and it can be unhealthy to mix drugs into your grieving process. but here's the thing, i understand her grief. i know that she is hurting not only because i see it, but i feel it alongside her deep in my core. loss sucks, and so does cancer. a joint to the face or and edible when shit hits the fan really does help, i know that. my mom is hurting, but that doesn't change the fact she has a past that no current life event can pave over.

also second of the several red flags: she's asthmatic! like hardcore asthmatic! sometimes i don't think she will ever stop coughing, and it sounds painful. asthmatics shouldn't smoke, right?!

Would I be wrong to tell her to stop? if i should, when is it an appropriate time to tell her to stop? Is two months too soon to tell her to drop this coping mechanism? Could I be reacting in subconscious childhood trauma of my mom being on drugs (my therapist brought this up to me. I'm sure this is part of it, but i don't know if it's all of it)?",17Oct2020,1
338,"(Note:As her name's rather unique and I don't want to expose her identity, I'll just call her A for context.)

A and I met when I was 13 or so. We went to the same school, but as we were in different grades(she's one year younger than me), we didn't get to meet often. One day, I went to her classroom for my weekly debate class and found her struggling with her homework. Being the good person I was, I started helping her with her homework. After I finished my own lesson, I started talking to her to get to know her better. After sometime, she asked me if I knew somebody(the bully). I told her I'd been bullied by the same person before(the bully got held back a grade), and that she didn't need to be sad.  Some days later, the bully and her minions started claiming that A loved me, and it got kinda annoying that we decided to do something about it. Being stupid 13-year-old I was, I and her devised a plan to turn the bullies against each other. It kinda worked for a month or so, and we enjoyed seeing them arguing with each other. 

A few days later, my mom asked me if the bullies were still bullying my friends. Thinking what I did was smart, I told my mom the truth. She went 1000% berserk. She claimed that A was a twisted, evil scum because she and I tricked the bullies. She claimed that she was seeking revenge and was therefore a bad person. I explained that the sole purpose was to stop them, not revenge. My mom didn't believe me at at all. 

One year later, I decided to see what other religions are like(my parents are Catholic) so I talked to A, who was a Protestant. She agreed to bring me to her church, and I, knowing that my parents would not let me go if I told them the truth, lied that I had to go to someone's birthday party.The result was, I got caught again because I was an idiot. This time, they weren't that nice to A. They claimed that she lured me and that her parents were problematic because they knowingly let their daughter bring a minor to church without their consent. I was pretty damn mad. My religion, my choice. It doesn't matter if I am 3 or 18 or 90. I told them not to blame it on her but I was ordered to stay away with her.

Days later, she accidentally scratched me while we were play fighting/wrestling(we were trying to see who's stronger). She apologised immediately even though I wasn't really hurt. I wasn't even angry as it was my will that i fought with her. The only problem was, it left red marks on my arms. How the hell was I going to respond when my mom asked me about these?

Now, my mom mentions her every single day. She 'reminds' me not to tell her which new school/country I will be going to because she is crazy and will follow me every where. She even claims that the bullies are her victims, and that they wouldn't bully without reason. I'm tired of her, but I'll pretend to agree so that I can study abroad successfully.

Can anyone tell me what I  should do to let my parents know she's not a bad person? I really want to see her before going abroad.",17Oct2020,1

343,"Disclaimer: long story, has some sensitive topics. 

Some context as to who the person is and how I met him and then I'll get into what happened that makes me uncomfortable. Ill call him Q (randomly selected letter)

In the beginning of the school year I came up with the idea of making a pride club, because our school likes to avoid anything that could be considered controversial it had to be underground and kept to a certain amount of members to avoid it getting too big and raising suspicion.

 A friend of mine ended up inviting a freshman (Q) completely new to the school who seemed pretty chill and honestly was pretty fun to talk to. He became apart of the club but also apart of our much smaller friend group in less than a week. Typically our conversations weren't anything too interesting but yesterday during lunch he sat beside me and had some pretty disturbing things to say. 

Seemingly out of nowhere Q started talking about how he had depression and that he was a diagnosed sociopath. He also brought up disturbing storys of things hes done to animals. When he started talking about this I distracted myself by playing on my 2ds with another friend of mine who was also sitting beside me hoping he would get the hint I didn't want to hear what he had to say. 

Eventually he seemed to stop instead asking me questions to help him with a study page on his biology unit. I happily helped him out since I have done all that before and it was second nature to me. But awhile explaining something to do with a question he got, he abruptly stopped me mid sentence and pointed out that my thumbs were bleeding (not much at all but still bleeding). I took a look and they were, I didnt even notice I was picking at them until he told me. I tried brushing it off and just put my hands in my pockets when he suddenly  talked about how thats a sign of anxiety and started asking me extremely personal questions, stuff like ""are you nervous around people"" and ""are you in an abusive relationship?"" 

Needless to say I refused to answer the questions and went back to what I was saying previously to help him with the worksheet. Thats when a friend of mine came up behind me and poked my neck to get my attention (I poke the back of her neck to annoy her so she does it back when she needs something) I tensed up, which isn't abnormal because I have sensory issues with anywhere in that area, but didn't react that strongly. After my friend asked her question and left Q felt the need to point out how I tensed and that It could also be a sign. I was a bit tired at this point so I politely told him that I tensed because my neck was overly sensitive, and that though I have anxiety it's not as bad as hes making it seem like it is and that I'm actually pretty calm compared to most days. 

He either didnt hear me or didnt care because he went back to explaining how I also show signs of depression and that some of my art is concerning. He also pointed out how my characters that a design show similar characteristics as to me and that im possibly reflecting myself on them to vent out frustrations. Q was assuming all of this, when in reality I've had the same characters for 3 years when I looked like a polar opposite to what I was drawing, and only looked like one character that he pointed out because my hair had been cut in a similar fashion (I didn't even chose the hairstyle I was simply a labrat for a friend who wanted to practice on me for her cosmo class). 

After that the bell rung and he left pretty quickly. I honestly dont really want to see him again because he made me extremely uncomfortable and was trying to read me/diagnose(?) me with things I either didnt have or didnt have to the extreme level he was saying. Not to mention the personal and uncomfortable questions he asked me.  

What should I do?",17Oct2020,1
344,"Okay so I know the first thing everyone is gonna say is ""but do you smoke tho?"" No I don't. It's been years since I've touched the stuff because I had an injury which made me super hypersensitive and it just makes me feel ill now. 

The smell is so bad that I've got a splitting headache. I live alone with 2 indoor cats so I can definitely say no one in the house is smoking weed. 

I live in the UK in an end terraced house. I have gone around smelling my carpets/my walls/cupboards. I have gone outside to check around the house when the smell has been strong in case someone is smoking it nearby and it's wafting in the house and come up empty. 

The next logical theory is that my neighbour is growing it. 

Now seriously, usually I'm a live and let live person. I don't really care if someone is smoking weed or even growing it, what I do care about though is having a week long headache because of the overwhelming smell of weed in my house. My house is supposed to be my safe place and not somewhere that negatively affects me. 

So what can I do? I feel like its either call the police or talk to the neighbours. The neighbours havent caused me any issues before though and seem like decent people so maybe I could just talk to hem but what would I even say?

 ""Are you growing weed and if you are can you find a better air filtration system cos the smell is making me ill"".

347,"One of my closest friends happens to be my ex, although we only dated for about 2 months a year or so ago, and we've talked/texted almost every day since. That's the reason I was so appalled when I saw that she had blocked me on WhatsApp, Monday evening (it's now Saturday morning). It's important to note that some of her good friends hate me because I broke up with her and that they have blocked me on her phone without her consent before. 

Thinking they did it again, I went on to send her a dm on instagram only to find I was blocked there as well. So I tried to call her and saw she had blocked my number from her phone... And blocked me on discord which is basically the only other place we've contacted online. At the time I thought this was weird but didn't think much of it, and assumed she was pissed at me for some reason and she'd get over it. The next day when she still hadn't unblocked me I borrowed a phone from a friend and called her.

On the phone she'd acted like she had no idea she had blocked me and said maybe it was one of her friends that did it. I asked her if we were ok and she replied with an ""I dunno"". I asked her if she could unblock me and she quickly said she had to go.

Deciding to give her space I haven't talked to her since, but I did ask a friend of hers who I've meet before if she was ok, and she replied with (tl;dr) ""she's fine, if she blocked you.its because of something you did, not her.""

I don't like I could've hurt her in some way, I mean, our last conversation was about twitch streamers, not anything important. The only reason I could think for her blocking me is maybe her friends convinced her our friendship is toxic.or something and decided to just cut me out. I don't want to just show up at her house unannounced, and I don't have any other place irl that I'd see her anyway. Does anyone have any advice?

349,"Schizophrenic. Smart, but schizophrenic. I also have had this feeling that it not in control of my movements or thoughts anymore, that I’m just watching myself from my own eyes try to live without a real input from myself.

I gave up school because of my all or nothing mindset. One ap class and all of a sudden I’m not the smart one anymore. And went down my gpa, until I decided it would be a game of mind to deliberately turn it into a zero.  I started hanging out with people I perceived as “cool,” and got into the drug abuse lifestyle. Nothing heavy, just weed, nicotine more often than not, and the occasional bottle running to drink alcohol. I didn’t pay attention to family values, and started becoming suicidal for the culture. Destruction was my mindset. I ended up becoming schizophrenic during this time, and it became my worst enemy.

It felt like people were using telepathy to communicate, and I was broadcasting my life to them through my own eyes. It went from falling in love to someone I never knew in real life, to becoming a bully to my own family.

I tried community college. I didn’t have the proof nor the talent of discipline nor did I even have a path to pursue. All I knew was being “cool.” But I did go to college. For about maybe a month combined. College wasn’t even hard, just something I knew was out of my comfort zone. I never did homework or paid attention, dropping out twice because of it. Being cool wasn’t my pursuit to happiness anymore.

My parents moved me to the PH from San Diego in order for me to forge my own future, and in a sense, find my way back. They agreed I wasn’t suit for the US. Not after going on a spiral I couldn’t control.

I just need answers. I’m getting my laptop soon, so I can practice on pursuit to either be a SWE or front end web dev or back end web dev, but the pressure from my family here and the US is immensely making my soul feel depressed. They want me to be better, but I don’t know what that means.

I just need an outlet to make it myself. Maybe I have identity and trust issues. Maybe I have imposter syndrome holding me back, thinking I’m not as potential as I used to be. Maybe I’m just to ego-ridden and snobbish to take a chance at something less, but remember, for me it’s all or nothing.

I don’t even have reliable internet anymore. But any communication would be helpful. If a millionaire is reading this and wants to contact me and have me work for them personally, shoot your shot. If a company hirer is willing to give an opportunity to me, please bear with who I am and how I am. 

I guess I need a role model and inspiration in life. My dad was in and out of my life, giving his effort and care for me as a human. He did what he could do, but I’m grown now. I’m 20. I need a mentor, someone who’s role I could model my life into. 

I do know that I need to get reevaluated by any trusting psychiatrist and get the right medication. I do know that I need to find a career, because I won’t have the people I have around me forever. And I do know I need  to learn how to be myself even through all this mental(ity) changing I’ve been trying to force myself through.

I don’t know what to do and have never had any input on this, so a even strangers’ words would help. Even roasting would wake me up. Anything to put me on the right track I once was before I gave up. Anything so that I don’t end up in the wrong mindset with the wrong things around me again.",17Oct2020,1
350,"Its 2 in the morning and I'm on reddit reading and I hear yelling in the hallway. I turned off my music and waited because I wasn't sure exactly what I was hearing. A lot of the times noise in the hallway of my apartment is just people being loud. For 10 minutes I wasn't really sure what was going on. She's yelling pretty sporadically and so I wasn't entirely sure if it was nothing for a while, but I got up and put my ear to the door. I cracked the door, thinking they might be in the hallway but when I peaked my head around the corner it was empty and I could clearly hear someone a couple doors down yelling ""somebody help me!"" she sounded pretty upset. I don't know if she's my neighbor or not I've never really met my neighbors and I don't know whose where. So I don't know if this woman lives here or if if she's a visiting girlfriend and this is normal for them. Either way it's not normal for my apartment building, my neighbors don't usually fight. I wouldn't be any help in a fight. I thought I heard a male voice saying something to her while I was in the hallway but they weren't yelling.

I really didn't know what to do. I hesitated to call the police, I've never called them before. What if this was nothing, my neighbors would hate me and someone could be shot for nothing. But if this was domestic abuse and I didn't say anything then someone could be really hurt. So I called. I could still hear her yelling every minute or so. But she yelped and I haven't heard her voice since.

I gave the police my address and my phone number and 35 minutes later they came. There were at least 7 SUV's, they didn't have sirens on just lights and they didn't call me. I was waiting inside my apartment building for them to come in. I saw some of them get out their cars and go towards the office building. I figured they were going to get the keys to the building or apartment. When they came back they didn't come towards the apartment building, they went towards there cars. I went outside because I thought they were leaving but I also thought they wouldn't do that. Even if this wasn't as serious as it sounded and was just a misunderstanding they would knock on their door just to make sure everything was okay right? But no I watched as they SUV's backed out of the gates into the street and left.

Now I don't know what the fuck to do. The police didn't even come in the building, and I did give them the building as well as the number as well as my own address. I haven't heard my neighbor yell or say anything else. But I'm still worried. What if she's not okay? Do I knock on their door, its 3 in the morning, but that doesn't matter if she's not okay? I dont have any weapons in my house, im a female and I weigh 126 lbs and I have absolutely no self defense skills to speak of. I also don't know if they're there anymore, at a certain point I left my door cracked because I thought they could leave and I could be vulnerable. Doors were open and shut but I don't know that it was them who left, anyone could have left the apartment building.

352,"My (f,22) parents split up by the time I turned 13, and since then my mom (56) has a new boyfriend (67). I mostly stayed with my dad and just spend some occasional weekends being at their place.

At the age of 15 it started, that her boyfriend kept on commenting on all my new WhatsApp pictures on how sexy I am (over text).
At first I thought nothing of it, since he knew I'm struggling with my self-perception (had an eating disorder) and I thought he just wanted to make me feel good. 
One day, when my mom was at work he walked into me taking a shower, and even though I didn't understand how he couldn't hear that (we have a rule to never lock the door in case someone slips), I still thought nothing of it. 

When I was about 16, her BF texted me about a dream he had. It was a detailed description of him f***ing me and how he was masturbating while writing this message since it turns him on so much. 

After weeks of avoiding my mom, I decided that I had to tell her, even though I felt super bad for her, knowing she loved him and wanted to spend the rest of her life with him. She cried, but stayed with him. 
I was pretty shocked and cut her off for almost a year, until I decided that it's the best for me and my moms relationship to just forget about it and move on. I did. 

The past 3 years I haven't been around them a lot since I worked as a travelling bartender. This obviously ended in March and stayed at my moms place again. She was working, BF was staying at home. It was always slighty uncomfortable, but well.

It happened 2 times, that I was sitting on the couch in the living room, watching TV and I could hear him masturbating in their bedroom, which is only about 5 meters far away, but out of sight since it's around the corner. 
He KNEW I would hear it and that I wouldn't say anything, since he often has tantrums and I would be too afraid. I acted like I noticed nothing, I told my mom nothing. 

Up to now I can't stand it no more. I don't even dare to shower or change clothes since I'm scared, that he has cameras installed. I hide a second toothbrush since i don't want to stick the one that is reachable for him into my mouth. I can't eat or drink certain things because I'm scared he jizzed into them. Y'all might think I'm paranoid, but he is really sick. 

I can't get rid of the uncomfortable feeling I get when he looks my way.
I can't even sit crossed legged on the couch when me, my mom and him are watching TV, since I feel uncomfortable having my legs slightly spread when he's around.
My mom thinks I'm over it and doesn't seem to be bothered by that no more, she even defended him once like ""he just told you about a dream he had, you asked him about it"".. like what??

I kind of want my mom to know with what kind of a nasty pervert she plans to spend her life together, but I know she's happy and I WANT her to be happy..

Like, many people say it’s not worth explaining “how you feel” of someone’s actions or how they hurt you or anything, cause they won’t care.

So I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice maybe show me some photos of haircuts that you think would look good on me. And I can’t get any advice from anybody I know. My parents don’t want me to cut my hair short so when I do it I’ll just have to go and do it and show up home and suffer the consequences of it then. And everyone else I know always tells me not to cut my hair because I have “such pretty long red hair” it’s so annoying. Again I want something really short like a “boys haircut” or pixie cut or something like that. Thanks I’d appreciate any advice you guys could give me. I’ll put a picture of me so you can see what I actually look like LOL so you can see what would look good

359,"Hi there, I am concerned for my twin(13). I have started noticing odd behaviors and am wondering if they are normal. We grew up in a bad home with violence and i'm worried there might be something wrong with them mentally. Here are some of her behaviors and stuff she has done that are concerning.

\-They use to be very abusive when we were younger

\-They have outburst

\-They have been caught lying and stealing

\-They tend to throw attitude

\-They like to skin rabbit skulls ( my mom had already called them off) and pop out there eyes and brains, she then saved them in a jar in the fridge for a few days.

\-They just started getting better emotionally ( I hope) and stopped self-harming.

\-They were doing bad stuff online like for example, talking to strangers, lying about being 15 and abused ( they even claimed that they had a 3 year old son that her parents sent away) using a fake email,watching bad porn, getting secret social media accounts, and watching videos about bestiality.

\-When they was confronted my our oldest sister they flipped out and tried running away jumping out of windows, saying they was gonna kill herself, and begging for her not to tell.

\-When ever we play games she makes her person get raped, abused, and kidnapped.

This isn't all of it but just so you could get an idea:)

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried confronting her but she denies there might be something wrong. A few weeks ago someone trimmed our dogs whiskers, and today I noticed our cat had chopped whiskers. When I asked her about it she said the only time she ever trimmed a cats whiskers was when she was around 6 and that she was crazy back then. She said it herself she was gonna be a psycopath when she was older.I am trying to find out if it's her. No one else in my family would be able to this. My dad is very smart and loves animals, my mom also loves animals and was a vet, my sister (18) has the dog Dakota (the one who's whiskers got cut) and when she found out she freaked out and started crying, my other sister (14) is at the moment in a hospital bed because of back problems, she is a big animal lover and hates the thought of animals getting hurt. My sister when I asked her about it got defensive and started saying she would never do that, she never asked if they cat was okay like the rest of my sisters had. She had started saying anything could have caused it like our other cat. I know it's not possible, this was done with scissors. Our bio dad was abusive and our brother had used us sexually when we were only 5, could that be why she is acting this way. My brother is diagnosed with Bipolar and ODD (my mom has Bipolar). Could she have a mental problem? If so, what could it be? Is this behavior normal?

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried about them, I keep thinking they might be a going insane:(

361,"I'm cutting to the chase because my heart aches with despertation to find a way to help her. 

My sister's always struggled with being over weight since I could remember. She's always been surrounded by a loving family so we've always made sure that she grew up empowered and reminded that she should be proud of who she is - no matter what she looks like. I know school must've been filled with bullies &amp; she definitely got called names yet she remained calm &amp; moved on. I admire her more than anyone because she's lived a hard life yet she's surpassed it all. The toughest person I know. However, she suffers from extreme anxiety &amp; has depression. She's 18 and now veery overweight.

I try to set the example of being healthy &amp; I encourage her to seek personal development for her mental health.  I remind her daily that she is beautiful because she is. My family tells her to lose weight because of her health. My mom has paid for the best nutritionists but my sister doesn't follow through. We've gotten her memberships to the gym, access to good trainers but nothing. It hurts me knowing that my mom fears losing her someday to a heart attack. Thankfully at home we eat well (but my sister eats fast food &amp; chips whenever she can).

 Frankly I'm begging for insight because I NEED to help my sister. I KNOW she wants to lose weight because she has even told me it's going to help with her anxiety &amp; depression. [I believe that to be true as someone who went through depression and found inner peace through personal development - aligning mind body and soul]. I want to help her realize her highest potential. I want to help her help herself but it seems as if nothing works and everyday she becomes more hurt. I can see it in her eyes and it's killing me. She says she wants to get better but proves otherwise... she stays in her room, watches tv, and eats. That's it. Her attitude has gotten worse and worse and it's driving me crazy because it's as if she's the only one that's not seeing her downfall! But she's my sister... I won't ever give up on her. 

Anyone who can is or was overweight please tell me: how would you like (have liked) to be approached by your family in this situation? How can I help? I love her and I just want to understand what is the link that's missing.",17Oct2020,1

I've been working at my job for over a year now but the management absolutely sucks and the workplace itself is a very toxic environment. Many new hires have left right after training shifts or within the first month. I hate going into work now. I only stuck around cause of the pandemic but now I just wanna leave asap and focus on school since last midterms and finals are coming up. I'm handing in a three week notice since I have vacation coming up and I want my last shift with coworkers who I'm friends with haha.

363,"I have a neighbor from hell essentially. I live in an apartment and back in June he was constantly getting into screaming matches with his girlfriend that, and I can't confirm this, but turned into physical abuse.  During these arguments I had heard racial slurs and comments being thrown left and right, so as a black man, I have no desire to communicate with this man in the slightest.  I called the cops on him and told the company about him, and the they were supposed to evict him in July.  They still have yet to (for reason's I'll explain later).  This neighbor has also been labeled a public menace for sexually harassing a large amount of women in the community by getting their phone number while beeping (driving people from place to place without the authenticity of uber or lyft) and then sending very explicit text messages to to them.  My company knows about this and still hasn't evicted them.  And now they are playing incredible loud music and having loud gatherings every day of the week, and when myself or others around me that are fed up with them call the police, the neighbors simply don't answer the door.  It doesn't help that this apartment building is likely incredibly old, as I live above him and can hear literally everything they do down there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently the reason they can't be evicted is because during this time of COVID-19, (I live in america so it's awful here with the pandemic) no one can be evicted for any reason until the end of the year.  However this is a problem that has nothing to do with COVID-19.  It is so insanely frustrating that this person, who is essentially human scum, can continue to be act like this with no consequence.  Is there anyone who has went/is going through a similar issue as this who has any advice?  It seems like things are at a complete standstill right now and I don't know what else to do.

366,"My mom recently received an email supposedly from Amazon that said a purchase of an item worth a few thousand dollars had been made by her card. I checked both her and my accounts to verfiy that this hadn't actually happened and it said neither of us had purchased the item. 

The next step was to see if the email seemed legit, and it was definitely strange. The email actually said ""@amazon .com"" so there was less concern from me at first. I figured that we had been sent the email as someone used her card info to buy something and thus we got the billing info.  I figured we should call the number, and when I called I got an automated message which said ""Please wait, your call will be answered in the order which you called."" It then played the same waiting music most legit companies have. 

I then became unsure if the number was legit as my mother then showed me it had been marked as spam in her inbox. I went and blocked the number so that they'd be unable to call back. I then told her to go to her bank tomorrow and check if she had been charged for the item. 

My mother is a very paranoid person who jumps to many conclusions fast and has said that she thinks they now have access to all of her information because I called. I didn't leave any message, so I want to ask if they actually have any way to determine the call was from us? Can they tell our geographic location from the email and connect this to the phone number? And will they steal information by us just calling them?

368,"this has been by far the most bizarre thing that i’ve come across during a video game in my 18 years of living.

the story starts on the trending game Among Us. i was playing with other friends i’ve also met from previous servers and enjoying the game. that was when we started getting along with someone in the server (let’s call her Pink) for teaming with us. we’ve come across many people like Pink and eventually we exchange socials if we trust them enough. so Pink started to ask for our socials and we ask for her age because we don’t want to give our information to minors and elders. she says she’s 15 almost 16 and so we reply back saying we’re too old for her. that’s when she announces that her boyfriend is 29. an alarm went off in my head. at the same time, i was doubting her because you never know what you can fake on the Internet. we expressed our doubts and disagreements, yet she still was trying to convince us. because i’m the youngest of my friend group, i was the one to add her on snapchat. 

that’s when she started to send me pictures of her and her boyfriend. videos of her kissing him. videos of him kissing her. videos with a sticker over their bodies. they’ve clearly hooked up and i think it’s sick how he probably knows the age of consent is 16 in a majority of states yet he’s doing this. some say age doesn’t matter but this is clearly wrong.

the story sadly doesn’t end here. she continues to tell me how her 25 y/o math teacher is all over her too. she sends their conversations and i am even more disgusted by this. no teacher should be even considering an affair with a student. that’s just unprofessional. 

some key points from these screenshots:
• he does not want any staff member to know meaning he knows it’s wrong and will cost him his job.
• he is willing to pick her up late at night.
• they send each other nudes on snapchat.
• she had his name saved with a teacher and heart emoji but he asked her to change it to “play it safe.” he has her saved as her first initial because he “leaves his phone unattended at school.”
• he thinks of their relationship as “sneaky links” and thinks it could change over time. she responds she’s a big girl and she has “done this before.”
• he sent a revealing selfie but blocked his face.
• he teaches, she babysits. i believe they haven’t had sex yet but the last screenshot she sent, he’s asking for when she’s free. timestamp says Yesterday. they’re definitely meeting soon if she wants him.
• Pink says: “Ever since I watched pretty little liars when I was younger it was always on my bucket list to mess around with a teacher” ... i do not want to comment on this.
• we’re not positive she wants to have sex with her teacher despite the seductive texts because she could definitely be teasing him. i think that’s why she hasn’t made a set schedule for them.

now, these conversations gave us a lot of information. although she had his initials on the top, she scribbled out his name in the screenshot where he asks what he’s saved as. throughout other screenshots, we see her saying his first name and then another shows Mr. [his last name here]. this is how we got his identity. one google search of [his full name] math teacher ohio and we got it. we find the high school page along with a staff directory and there is his smiling face. his shoulders and skin tone match up with the dick pic perfectly. he is apparently 29 and not 25, the age she gave us. i am absolutely sick. this is something i’ve always seen on the news and it’s never something i’d find myself right in front of it. i do want to report it and i’m needing some advice. 

• do we contact the police or her school first?
• we don’t have much information to on her boyfriend but do we still include him? i think the police could investigate that concern anyways.
• my friends and i would like to remain anonymous to her at least. i sadly gave out my snapchat which has my full name but i’ll take my chances. i just don’t want her to think i just ratted her out, but i’ve learned in the past that if i see something, i should say something. i don’t want her boyfriend or her teacher to know that i was the one who just costed their lives or jobs. i’m concerned for my safety when i do report this. i’m focusing on my studies but this is something that popped up and i’ve been thinking about nonstop. providing information for the police is the most i can do.
• i want her to be safe. she is 15 and this is an age where the brain isn’t developed enough to understand that what’s happening to her is wrong. on her facebook, we can see that her mom is currently in jail for drug use, she’s having rocky relationships with her brothers, she really is in a relationship, and we haven’t found much information on her dad. this tells us that she could have possibly had a rough childhood. she probably needs an adult figure in her life and that’s why she’s turning to all of these older men. we also found some sad quotes about love posted on her page. so it might be better to have county police or child services reach out to her before they get to the men.
• i’m from a different state — do i have to call a specific number or is there at least an email i can provide all of the information and screenshots to? i’d prefer email because i don’t want my parents to know that i’m talking to police from a different state. if not, is there someone else i can trust in/near ohio to relay this information?
• what is the statute of limitations on something like this?
• why do you think she’s told us strangers on a video game? it’s almost as if she was bragging but i personally think it’s a cry for help. maybe she can’t tell people in person without there being judgement in her relationship with that person.

i really don’t want to ruin her life any more than it already seems but i want the men to be informed that what they’re doing is wrong. it’s none of my business, but they don’t truly love her. in the end, the teacher already knows it’s wrong! he’s conscious! these men are knowingly messing with her which could possibly lead to emotional abuse and manipulation. please give me some advice on how to approach this situation without harming myself or the girl.",17Oct2020,1
369,"I've had chronic depression for 3 years, and never could figure out why that no matter what happened, I just always this feeling of sadness inside myself every single day. 

My Mom told me today that she thinks it's because I have major self-esteem issues. And I can't believe I never thought that THAT was indeed the problem, but she's 100% correct.

I have not had a single friend for the last five years, (except a few Xbox friends) and always tell myself to never make an effort to make friends because of the fear that I'll be annoying them by doing so.

I've had a crush on a girl from my school for over a year now, and somehow bunched up the courage to write her a small note on Valentine's Day (for which she hugged me and thanked me for being the only person who gave her anything besides her best friend). This would have been the perfect time to start texting her and possibly ask her out, right? There was no reason for me to not be confident in doing so, since she obviously thinks highly of me.

Nope. I chicken out and have barely talked to her since then because I've been too afraid that I might be annoying her.

She's with another guy now, by the way. Great job by me to throw away an easy relationship!

I also have been calling myself stupid, dumb, and I am always very tough on myself about my grades for around five years now.

I graduated high school a long time ago. I'm 22 and probably never gonna get into university. I've suffered from abuse in every possible way and I'm financially and emotionally drained. I lost my job with the first covid wave and that was the only thing going well for me.

Part of me wants to be a scientist, but I know it's a long road there and I need to first be financially stable. I have no family and nobody to lean on and spend most days being depressed or applying for jobs knowing I'm gonna be their last choice.

I'm an immigrant and can only do freelance work. I also want to learn programming, but to do that I have to have at least a part time job that can help me pay my bills.

I'm not stupid or useless, I know I have some potential but it's all thrown in the toilet when I try to improve my life.

I can't go back to my country.

I also love cooking and would love to have a career there too, but where I live, every job you can get (whether you're a personal assistant or work in retail) you have to have a schooling of atleast 3 years, for which I don't have time or money.

I have so many passions once I set my mind. I got into specialty coffee and would make fantastic filter coffee and experiment with it, along with other things. But here you need a diploma to be a damn Barista, which I know I'm good at.

I also worked small internships in labs and got paid half of my colleagues salary because of my Nationality (that's legal here) and I was praised and did everything faster and more efficiently than others. I am not lazy when I'm given a task.

But I'm not wanted. Nobody will take my offers and I am completely useless to society. I don't know how long it will be till I end up on the streets.

I also was raised bilingual and taught my mothertongue to older people with success, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the reward. But it seems I can't find people who want to exchange for my skills.

No, I couldn't get a diploma. But that's not everything I can offer. I can edit videos, write and translate in multiple languages, I can teach and cook and prepare coffee and sell and do whatever tasks you want me to do if you just show me once.

A paper and years of debt seem more valuable to people. My dad has had several successful careers and didn't even finish highschool.

372,"Long story short, parents are moving the family to a new house around the corner and are planning on selling the house that the whole family grew up in for 20+ years. This is the only house I’ve ever lived in my whole life. They would rent it but they believe the up keep will be far too much the hassle and dealing with renters that will mess up the house is the factor pushing them to sell. However they purposed a deal where if I invest $25k of my own money and pay for damages caused by the renters, they’ll keep it and find renters to fund the monthly payment. 

I have no experience dealing with renters and honestly have no clue if they’re actually going to flat out destroy the house like my parents are predicting or if that’s an over exaggeration. 
I’m personally ok with funding the money and maintaining it just to keep the house, because it’s sentimental value means more to me than the money. 

Is this a smart money decision?
Are renters actually THAT bad?
Do you think paying for whatever damages they have over time will add up to be worth more than having them there?

A little background about me, I am a 22-year old male. I am currently a student in university and also an undocumented. Currently I have been in the US for 10 years, and have found a partner. I’ve been with her for the past 4 years, but the start of our relationship was extremely rough. She was experiencing some sort of sexual harassment ptsd and was too shy to hang out with me, so all of our conversations were strictly through text. Fast forward 5 months later, we are finally hanging out but I am also talking to other girls. Long story short, I end up emotionally cheating on her multiple times. She still resents me but we are still together because I guess I am the only person she feels comfortable with. I love her, and want to help her but I am terrible at communicating and so she always ends up pissed off at me.

With that being said, as stated I am a student, and I currently feeling completely crushed. My parents have no college experience, all of my friends have less education than me. And lastly, it feels hard to talk to anyone because my partner begins to feel that I am not giving them any time.

381,"We're often in the nature for hiking and of course then we sometimes have to perform bathroom breaks in the wilderness. (don't panic: we exclusively use natural stuff like leaves or grass to wipe).   
Unfortunately our little daughter never learned how to do the 'practical part' properly.   
Until about a year ago we always lifted and held her in a 'sitting' position to pee or do her #2. But she became too heavy so we started trying to train her do do it squatting down. But it never worked. She wet her pants every time she tried. It was so frustrating for her that she looked for another solution.

Now when she needs to go she sits down with her bottom completely on the ground, legs placed forward, and then she does her business. So far so good. It works very well for #1 (except for the wet bottom after). 

The problem starts when she needs to do #2. She's really in trouble then.   
Then she sits there and we can see her pushing intensively again and again, but she complains that her poo is stuck and doesn't get out. The first times when this happened we supposed that she's constipated but she told us that she can feel the poo tryin' to get out of her bottom but not making it. 

Of course I can imagine her struggle because this way she has to squeeze the poo between her bottom and the ground. Unfortunately she refuses any other way to do her #2 outside. We suggested her to sit on a log or lean against a tree, but she says that it's pricking her. She neither want's to get lifted up again.   
Once she made it to poop a very little bit while doing it her way so in princible she'd be able to do. It really was a hard work, she struggled for about 10 minutes with pushing and straining, clenching her fists and pinching her face. But at the end she had a really tiny bit out but it was enough for her to feel relieved enough.   
From this time on she totally refused any other suggestions to do but she never made it again. All the other tries failed and she's sad about it. 

So we're looking for a way to get her making it this way again. But I have no idea how to support her. Until now our only possible support is to cheer her to keep trying and to push hard while she's doing. So we're really looking for advises how to get her making it. But please don't tell me that she has to do it another way. Actually there's no way to convince her to try another way. It must be **this** way. As she made it once there must be a way to get her making it again. I hope for your hints. 

Thanks a lot",17Oct2020,1

384,"Hi advice community of reddit! I need some help!

So my sister (she is 33) keeps coming over during the weekends. Now she moved out to a shared house literally down the road so we see a lot of her. She lives with 4 other people, she goes out with with her friends and takes public transport every weekend.

She keeps on visiting for the weekend to eat and use the tv to watch Netflix ect. Normally this is whatever but recently I have gotten uncomfortable with this.
I told my mom and she said I was being ridiculous and over reacting.

I dont know if I am or not I think it's ok to be uncomfortable with her being reckless and coming over here just for food and tv, two things she should be able to provide for herself since she has a good job and is 33. 

But I honestly dont know any advice would be very welcome as I feel like I'm being an annoying bitch and slightly going crazy since my mom keeps saying I am being crazy and weird about this. 
My sister thinks i am bullying her and my dad is staying mum about the whole thing.

For context I am 22, we live in ireland in dublin and covid cases are rapidly increasing and by government guidelines there are no household visits allowed and the country will most likely be shut down for a few weeks to stop the spread.

389,"**I really need help, advices, and remarks because google doesn't help**. I do not like talking about this to people in my place. So I cannot explain this one sentence so It would be great if you would try to read all it. I always have these phases where my mind just makes me so angry and depressed and gloomy and I am suddenly thirsting to make other people feel shit, and not just random people in my life, people that I think is contributing to this gloomy feeling that makes me so angry and is needing for like revenge i think, even though I am not one hundred percent confident that that person is worthy for such revenge. I don't know, for real I don't know and it is so hard because this sad and somewhat angry phase just lasts for a while and then I feel fine. I felt that gloomy feeling a while a go and I calmed myself down by making a facebook post saying how the teachers are bullying me and the other students are influenced by them into bullying me too, that is not true in fact people are super nice to me at school. Is there something wrong with me? I feel like I need help but I am too ashamed to face my parents. This post is really hard to write btw, like I said, I cannot write this in one go and I am not able to write my true feelings and thoughts in one go, I have to take time for myself and figure it out haha. Okay, so, yeah.

I use to do this before but I relied on actual facts but I end up being a failure and making myself look like a douche, I only did it with my parents and they forgave me and I love them, a lot, but there are some moments that memories of the not so cool things they had done and I hate them for it, but then, I suddenly let go and I feel fine again. Am I bipolar? Shit, do I have a somewhat of a mental illness? If so, then that fucking sucks. I wanna be fucking normal, and now I am typing this and thinking I might have some sort of mental illness makes me angry, but it is not the same anger as the 'gloomy phases' I mentioned that I would have.(I only call it 'gloomy phases' cause idk it gives me dark thoughts instead of typical anger and sadness)

I feel like a bad person, and yet I feel like this is what I THINK is I am capable of only. Throughout my childhood I was never validated, I didn't have lots of friends in elementary and I only had one best friend. Our friendship was like the book turned into a movie Diary Of A Whimpy Kid, he was like Rowley and he always followed me around but like the movie I unfriended and insulted him because I foolishly thought he was not too cool enough to be my friend. We were both nerds, like to draw, into video games, and likes to make comics. But this is where things go wrong, I had my eye on the other popular kids at elementary but because of my best friend I could not. You see, I had made a lot of friends and I am a somewhat of a social butterfly myself, but my best friend was weird and quirky and he was hated for it, I had some classmates that gave me the ""You're not my friend if you unfriend him"" ultimatum. The teachers never liked me because I do not listen to class and I am just peacefully drawing in my desk. Led me to having a grudge against people and doing lots of shit because I thought to myself that I must be a rebel.

Years in my childhood gone by and I am a loner and I only focused on my own interests, but I never had a lot of friends locally to share it. I was so lonely that I became angry, fourth grade came and I was kicked out because I got into so much trouble by fighting other kids, I was hated and despised and mind you it was in a private school so such trouble was HIGHLY intolerable. I went to another school and repeated fourth grade, there I had some few friends and I had been really popular amongst my peers but because of a rival I was outcasted.

I was homeschooled then and I was so lonely I didn't have homies, friends, and pals but I didn't know it because I focused myself on my own interests with my family supporting me.

Whenever I look at my peers being popular and having pals, I feel jealous and I would get a glimpse of hatred in me that is why I separate myself. I tried talking to my peers but I was mocked, now I realized I was just inept in socializing.

Now moving on from my middle school years, my mom decided that I will not be homeschooled anymore and actually go to a High School because she found a particular school that has arts as a major in their senior grades and ofc one of my interests is art. When I learned that it is a public school, I was livid. Growing up and always attending private schools with a bunch of privileged turds you get told that public school is the last resort for private schools students who gets kicked out. They portray public school as a place where the environment is dirty and full of poor unethical poor people. But this school isn't like what the people have told me.

First year in high school I was the ""guy who came from private school."" and for some reason me being homeschooled makes me look rich from the students and teachers. I realized I was smarter than I thought, but public school is just easy and the teachers are not that strict(in my country) I actually became popular and well known, thing is, I am late at school for 2 years but no one really mocked me for it, in fact, some of the teachers suggested that I should take an acceleration test because they are confident that I am smart enough. But I am not really THAT popular. Before I went to that highschool my social media likes would range at about 2-7, only including my family, relatives, and a few internet friends. Now I have achieved more than 80 likes on facebook since I went to this high school. Great, I have TONS of friends, TONS of validation, and TONS of good people to know, why is it that I still feel sad? Because there is a line between my past and my present on having actual friends, but i didn't really realize it then until now.

My first years of high school I have a problem on taking jokes, there is this two guys that made fun of me on my first year, but looking back I realized that it's just their natural habitat and they are just used to kidding around people for fun. I realized that socializing means adjusting to all sorts of people around you. I am actually friends with them now, and I do not feel anxious nor offended by them anymore.

Now I have learned how to fix myself, learned how to make friends amongst more extroverted people, and make myself good looking. I realized I was even more attractive than I thought and when I started to look more attractive I was the talk of the campus.

But my problem doesn't stop. People started perceiving me as good looking when I shaved, had longer hair, and emphasized my pale skin, and got skinnier. Being skinny became my unwanted addiction, I thought it was cool to be skinny but the more I eat less the more it upsets my tummy. I only have facial features that is similar to the standards in my country but I still don't think I am that attractive internationally.

I have never seen people first hand that hated me but I will always assume someone always likes to torment me and make fun of me behind my back because of what reason idk, I get delusional and make up stuff from small things. I thirst for more validation by learning how to be a victim, it started when I had a fight with a girl but we made amends when I framed her ex boyfriend for bullying me and explained to her that it is the reason why I was so aggressive to her. Since then, I somehow felt the stuff that I can do. Before writing this, I felt that gloomy phase again after recalling about the uncool things my parents did to me and suddenly my mind was shifted to school, I feel so sad and I feel like nobody sees me as important so I created a post on facebook saying that some of the teachers are bullying me. I am getting lots of messages from classmates and teachers and friends asking what's wrong and I kinda like the attention but I feel like shit. Makes me feel like my life does not have any meaning anymore. I don't know if you guys believe me but I feel like shit and liking the attention at the same time.",17Oct2020,1

395,"I’ve only know her for about 4 months now, but the two weeks her boyfriend has come over has got me concerned for her well-being.

He corrects her for literally EVERYTHING. He tells her things like “that’s not how you do it. Do it better. Do you even know how to XYZ?” And when she asks him to do it or help her he says, “no you started, finish it. You are doing fine, but fix it” like... wtf dude? 

Literally today she was ordering pizza for her birthday and he got all upset at her for not knowing whether or not she wanted it delivered or takeout? He literally slammed the table, rolled his eyes, and raised his voice and told her “THAT IS NOT WHAT I ASKED” I genuinely got triggered as it reminded me of when my dad would threaten to smack us. 

They argue all the time too. Every, freaking day. He is from another state so he doesn’t live here, but when he’s not here he calls her all the time to ask her who she is with and if she has “been thinking about him cause he’s been soooo lonely”. 

There was this other instance where my roommate and I were playing video games and he called her, but she wanted to keep playing so she ignored the call (since they had talked a few hours earlier) and so he FaceTimed her the second time and gave her the silent treatment on a freaking FaceTime call?! They argued pretty badly about it and then she felt guilty about playing video games and apologized to me for ending the night early.

So, this one friend, now 14 years old, has been drinking, smoking and vaping for the last two years straight. You know, the usual stuff - hanging out with the ""cool"" kids, going to parties with adult friends, smoking, and what is bothering me the most - she's making her self look like a slut. Almost everyone I have met around my area has or has seen an erotic picture of her half naked. Don't get me wrong, she's really gorgeous, really caring and gentle around me and my friends, but she completely changes when she starts hanging out with the people who I think have a really bad influence on her. Since she has started drinking, her grades have been getting worse and worse. I see a lot of potential in her, but can't seem to have a good conversation about the situation. I have tried talking to her, but she said that she likes what she's doing and is never going to change. I could accept that as a final answer, but there's just something in me that tells me that I should really talk about it with her more.

409,"In July, my old manager and assistant manager were let go because of some allegations against them. We ended up getting a new manager but that fell short after she didn’t last a few weeks because of a medical condition she had. I was soon quickly promoted to Assistant manager and also acting manager. Now instead of working 15 hours a week I got jump up to 40 hours and my paycheck also increased as well. They said I will stay as assistant and just work as a manager until they can find a replacement. I pretty much handled everything, from morning meetings to handling paperwork which during that time I didn’t have any training for. 

After a while, I felt great acting like a store manager, I felt like getting that pay was worth coming into work and I didn’t have to worry about bills or anything. My DM (district manager) kept saying the store was improving after I took over and that I was doing a good job handling things even though I got dumped with everything in one day. 
My family was happy I got the job and I was happy that I had money in my bank account after struggling for so long. I felt great about everything! Until my DM called me yesterday and said she found a replacement manager and she was excited for me to meet her. 

I was devastated because that meant I would be back to being an assistant and my pay would be cut including hours. I told her how I felt and that I said that I loved being a store manager and that I had put in so much work into it. She said she was 100% on my side and that she’d help me get there but I still have to trained because there were still some things I needed help on. She said she’s gonna send me a manager checklist packet (for me to start going over things to help me on what I need to learn on becoming a manager). And said that the store is still my store and my employees are still my employees. 

 But here’s the problem, I don’t know how long it’ll take to start my training and I don’t know if before that they’ll cut my pay until they can start my training. I also don’t know if my employees will start to lose respect to me after they find out there’s a replacement manager now and I’m no longer their manager anymore (it was so difficult to gain one employees respect). Assistant managers don’t get paid enough in my company (I believe I’ll be okay with bills but I’m not too positive) and I don’t know if they are gonna cut my pay or not for training. 

My DM said that if I was wanted to be a manager then she would help me but she also said I can manage a different store. So now I don’t know if I’m going to be transferred or not or what’s gonna happen with pay or anything. So my question is, should I wait and hope for the best or should I start finding another job? There’s a ton of positions for management that probably pays a lot better and I could get a good job before the holidays.

I haven’t had the motivation to do anything and I’m falling so behind on school. I wanted to withdraw, but I work and pay for my own school and wouldn’t get a refund. 

People have been messaging me saying they’re sorry, how much her loss hurts them too. I tell them thank you for reaching out, but inside, I feel so angry. Like who are you to tell me how much you’re suffering? You weren’t the one who lost the person who was practically their sister. You talked to her twice in class five years ago. 

I know my feelings aren’t right, everyone is entitled to their own grief, but I can’t help but feel that way. 

And then I just can’t help but feel so so guilty. I haven’t been able to see her because of covid restrictions, can’t go out because my little brother is high risk. I’ve been busy with school and work, and I didn’t even find out she was in the hospital until after she was dead. I couldn’t be there for her and I feel so guilty for how things ended like that. 

I know my presence wouldn’t have changed the outcome of her surgery, but I can’t help but feel like maybe I could have done something. Anything. I haven’t been able to sleep for the past two days, and I know it’s not healthy, but even if I try to force myself to sleep, all that happens is that I have anxiety.

I want to see her family, but again I can’t because of covid restrictions. I don’t even know the details of her funeral or what’s going to happen- I think it’s too painful for her mom to message me knowing her daughter is dead and I wasn’t there for her.

At this point i was worried so i asked how old these guys were and she said 2 were in their 20s and one was over 40. she doenst see a problem with this as she says its just part of the 'bdsm community' but if what she said is true then would that be considered pedophilia and if is there anything to be done?,17Oct2020,1

My gf asked her mom if i could stay over for the first time? She looked at the time again and decided it was best since i could and would most likely be pulled over if i try going back home that late. That whole day was filled with lots of speed traps and cops hunting. The night was expected to be the same. Her mom said it was best, especially since my car has extremely tinted windows and is kinda sporty, im latino, and it’s past curfew for me (12pm).

I was excited, my first sleepover, we were going to sleep on different couches but it was still exciting. Now its just filled with pure anxiety and stress.

So I decide to go ask for permission. I usually go to my mother since she’s the “boss.” I called and she answered “What’s up?”, me: “Can i stay ove-“, her: “NO!! YOU WILL NOT BE STAYING OVER AT ANYONES HOUSE!!”

That’s a mini version of it. She just kept screaming in my ear that it is morally wrong and how im not going to. That she doesn’t give a shit if i get pulled over, if something happens. She said I can stay as late as i want but i will not be sleeping there. I tried calming her down and trying to speak to her like an adult. I told her what’s the problem with it? I would like to understand and if it’s big then i won’t and we will work through it...but she just kept yelling and saying “NO.”

I bursted into tears after she hung up. I have gotten the idea that she seriously doesn’t care about me or what happens to me, that she just cares to be in control. I had a panic attack. I talked to my gf and her mom again, they said I can stay if i wish to. I did. I woke up at 6:15 (its 7:50 now) because a cat sat on me. I got a text 15 minutes after waking up. I responded immediately. It was my mom.

She was bashing me. She kept telling me that im a disappointment and a disobeying bad kid. That i was fucked up to have done that, to have stayed over. That im such trash for not listening to her. That im not fit for the real world. etc. etc. I don’t wish to go into details but i decided to stand my ground and tell her that im growing up. That in a few months ill be 18. That I could and will move out of the house. She kept saying rude and mean stuff to me. 

I decided to call my dad who is working 2 hours away. I start crying on the phone but it isn’t as bad. I explain everything. He understands and tells me that it’s okay. That she’s wrong for saying and doing all that. That it’ll be okay. That he’ll be home later today and he will see what becomes of it. He said he’s thinking of kicking her out or doing something if these things keep persisting. (i keep getting mistreated for no reason from her. extremely different from my sister at the very least. even she has noticed.) I don’t know what to do, im scared to go home. Im scared to think of what she will do or say to me. I feel like waiting and coming home once my dad comes home. Advice..?",17Oct2020,1

Anyway I even starting to think I am wasting his time but oh well. Yesterday he sent me couple of messages saying that if I am not serious about our relationship and things and that he is upset about it and even said that he hates me. All messages were sent in different times. Recently he made fake acc to spy on me check if I cheat on him or no and seems anxious if we care about each other or no. What to do?

Some backstory:

Yesterday i(16M) was out with my best friend(also 16M) to the park we always hang out. We were talking about memes while sitting on a bench, when a young gipsy (around 10-11 years) came up and started aggressively-jokingly showing us his boxing gloves. Me and friend were appreciating his gloves out of politness when his older brother came up(13-14 year) asking if we have any girls for them to fuck. After we tryed laughing it off he then challanged us to a fight with the gloves but as me and my friend weren't delighted by that ideea we declined.

Then they sat themselves on the bench near us. Neither with a mask or desire to not catch Covid. I got my kind of expensive phone out so that they'll maybe see that we're not intereset in talking but that was a mistake. When the little one tried touching my phone i said ""No, i dont want Covid' jokingly. He kind of got mad and said something about breaking it. Me, wanting to stand up for myself i told him that if he'll break it he'll pay for it.

After that they both got more aggressive with both words and movements. I threatend to call my dad as i wasnt about to punch 2 kids if front of a whole park full of people. The little one expressed his doubt that my dad will do anything to him, and he'll beat him up. I was done so i got up to leave. They asked where i was going so i said I was going to buy something to munch. Then the liitle one asked for money. I unknowingly said ok, but i have to go home to grab some, just so that we leave quicker.

Me and my best friend went to a store to get antivirus wet wipes to wipe ny hands and phone. But guess what. After i got out of the store there was the little gipsy. He was asking where is his money, as i have promised him. I didnt want to give it to him so i started speaking english(as it is not our main language). He was on a bike, and started slowly getting closer and closer wanting to make it seem like he was running over me. After he got it that he wasnt getting the money, he sett off on his bike but did one thing that made me almost lose it. HE SPIT ON ME. And it was really colse to my face (on my shoulder). I dont know how i didnt sprint to him and ask nicley about his well being.

And know, i believe that if i slap the Mc'fuck out of him once he'll either never come back or bring his 69 older brothers to beat me up but i am willing to take the risk just to see him puzzled after getting slapped. What should i do?",17Oct2020,1

429," I  wasn't always like this.  My friend dumped me.  I came out as trans to  her and she supported me but I started to hate her.  She has a new  boyfriend that I had a crush on...and I hated her for being with him.   She would leave her tampons out knowing I could never have a period and  it would upset me.  I was going to end it with her because it seemed  like she was being rude to me but she ended it with me.  I was going  through pictures over the years and all these memories started flooding  back....memories that I didn't even remember.

I  became addicted to certain themes in porn that aren't ""vanilla"" one of  them being ""Sissy Hypno""  I thought it was a joke and laughed it off.  A  friend told me about it and how it brought out his more feminine side.   For some reason it did just that to me as well but after years of  masturbating to more porn I forgot where the idea even came from.  I  started to see the flashing images in my head throughout the day of  sissy hypno porn and the words...and having urges to try it with men.

Then  began wearing women's underwear, stockings and skirts.  I'd go to  spaces online where we all talk about porn.  I was ashamed and told them  what I was watching but they said it was normal and cheered me on.  I  later came out as a sissy and felt great with all the attention I was  getting.

When I was a child, I  didn't get much attention.  My mom worked all the time which makes me  wonder if that ties into all of this.  I started to also have feelings  of hostility towards women including my own long term female friend.  In  the past people would ask me if I was gay because I could stay friends  with her without sex...and anytime I would watch sissy porn I'd ask  myself if I was gay because other people have asked.  Back then I was  into women only.  It wasn't until watching the themes of this kind of  porn that I started to change.  It dawned on me, I wasn't into men..I  was into attention both good and bad.

Today  when my friend and I were talking on the phone she brings up her  boyfriend and I called her a ""C\*nt""  she told me that I used to be so  much nicer and that she can't talk to me anymore.  I don't know how to  stop being addicted to porn and have noticed I go through bouts of  depression and guilt plus feeling like less of a man the more I  masturbate.  Is masturbating too much damaging??

Ok so story time. Back in December I was dating this guy and his birthday was coming up so I asked him what he wanted. He told me he wanted a Naruto skateboard deck and I bought it for him. I actually ordered it so it was supposed to arrive in a few weeks. 
Fast forward two weeks- he broke up with me and I was absolutely devastated. I completely forgot about the deck until it arrived the next week. I hated looking at it. I hated seeing it and thinking about how excited I had been to give it to him on his birthday. I was crying to my friend about this and she offered to sell it for me and give me back the money that she sold it for. Sad and miserable, I agreed and gave her the board.

Now we haven’t been in the best terms recently so I understand why she’d be reluctant to talk to me but this is literally business. It’s actually consignment.

436,"Hey guys

Just as a bit of context, I’m a 20 year old guy from the UK who’s just started his first year of university.

I think I was a bit naive as to how covid would affect my university experience, but I don’t think it was unrealistic to think I’d make some friends. I’ve made none. I only know people from my course and flat, but I wouldn’t say we’re friends. It feels like a line has been drawn at this point to make friends because loads of people have already found their friends, courses have properly started, and no clubs and societies are running because of covid. I just don’t feel like I connect with anyone and there’s only so long you can spend with your own thoughts. I spend most days in my room on my own, and some days the only conversation I’ll have is with my parents over the phone. I can’t keep doing this because I hate how lonely I feel.

I’m an introvert, which really doesn’t help my situation, and I just generally struggle to strike up conversations with people because I’m shy. Once a conversation has started I’m absolutely fine, but it feels like people stop the chance of getting to know me because they just think I’m this awkward guy. I’ve always struggled to make friends and can’t say I’ve ever had a true/best friend. I’m just at a point where the feeling of being alone all the time is just draining after feeling like this for so long, and I want to do something about it.

I know for a lot of time me not having any friends in the past has just been down to circumstance, but I’ve just isolated myself more and more. I really don’t mean to, because that’s not going to help, but I often question why people would want to be friends with me anyway. 

I’m getting tired of people telling me that I’ll make friends later on and all that stuff, because I’ve not had any friends for years, it’s not just because of covid. Telling me to put myself out there doesn’t help either, as I’ve really tried to, and there are very limited options in how to meet people in the first place.

I’m honestly just really fed up at this point. I really thought this would be a fresh start, but it’s just a new place with me having the same issues. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to meet people. I promised myself I’d try and put myself out there to make sure I made some friends, but there genuinely has been little opportunity to do so, and now I’m just back to old habits.

In a weird way, I kind of hope someone else is in a similar position so I’m not the only one that feels so isolated. Please feel free to message me if you are, or anyone else if you need a friend/someone to talk to.

Thank for taking the time to read this and I apologise for the long post",17Oct2020,1

I live on a farm, so the party is being held at my place. And this is where the issue starts.

Today I got a message from someone I went to primary school with. They were my really good mate from the age of 8-12. Once we went to high-school, we went our separate ways. He went down a path of doing drugs, and I believe he is now a meth user.

Some context: I live in the uk , had 3 weeks worth of time at college before I had to self isolate for 2 weeks and now I’ve just been back for a week now, this is also my alt for anyone wondering about my low post count.

At first I praised loving college, the teachers were nice, it had a good location, far from my high schools and everyone there I knew so I had a fresh start.

But one thing I didn’t praise was my new class mates because I was still getting use to them.

And now I hate college, I’m already being picked on and laughed at, everyone there went to the same school so I was the only 'new guy' in the group I’m in and they laugh at me.

The boys my age are constantly picking on me to impress the older boys in my class and it’s annoying.

I have a shit ton of social anxiety and I can’t do well with new people and things are already going bad. And my speech impediment isn’t too bad but I’m still laughed at because of it.

And that increases my anxiety which causes me to mumble/slur my words making my speech even worse.

I can’t act the same as the rest of the boys in my class and even though I rehearse everything they could say to me , i any figure out a normal reply without being laughed at. 

I’m nice too, I jokingly sarcastic but being nice or mean or average just digs me deeper into a pit.

I’m behind schedule in school so i have catching up to do, i don’t know how to talk and feel like I betrayed myself.

I told myself after the horrible time high school was things were gonna get better but they’re just repeating. College was my last chance to be accepted and normal and things have already been set in place.

I have this friend (M), who has helped me a lot and has always been that person that I can vent to when I’m sad etc. and he would do the same. We met on IG and we bonded over giving each other relationship advice as he was into a girl at the time and i was into a guy (fall of 2019). 
As a couple months passed the girl he was into had rejected him; and I dropped the guy I was into (winter 2020). 
More time passed, we still talked though. 
We started to drift apart in spring of 2020. 
But we started to talk again in the summer. 
In august, I felt like I started to develop a crush on him even though us getting into a relationship is one of those things that are impossible to happen because it’s kinda long distance and he’s not really over the girl that rejected him. 
I decided in late august to officially deactivate my socials etc. due to personal reasons and he was one of them. 
I don’t want my feelings for him to escalate. 
I’m in touch with very few people at the moment except him. 
I have to reactivate my socials every month or else they would get deleted.

I thought I would appreciate her for being the way she is by not 'talking' with her anymore because I don't want her to get drowned out in an overwhelming waterfall of sad news and stuff from other people's (in this case my life and there's nothing happy in it right now with covid and stuff) , instead , indulge in small talk so that it can act as a distraction, however, she doesn't listen and I am glad that I know someone like that but still....I just want her to be happy. Maybe this is what makes her happy? Being able to be there for others I mean, but regardless

Any idea on how I can let someone like this know how much I appreciate them for being the way they are while at the same time just making their day? I just want to make her happy. 


Ps - it's a very random post and not frames perfectly but tldr - I just want a way to thank her and make her happy",17Oct2020,1
446,Just wondering if others have been through something like this and what things they have done to improve their mental health cause mine right now is lowest that I can remember.,17Oct2020,1
447,"Yesterday I overheard some co-workers talking about me. They were describing some of my behavior, saying they observed me (it seemed to have been something they talked about before). One of them concluded I was crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I ain't. I've been through a lot of loneliness before, and I got used to daydream a lot and make up conversations in my mind. I know a lot of my body language change when I'm doing it, I think I mumble too, but I'm having the hardest time breaking the habit. I don't remember what I'm supposed to do with my mind when I'm not focusing in reading something or talking to someone.

I also have a hard time with my senses, I tend to stumble and am bad at coordination. I think I look very spaced out, but I'm not sure what to do about it because I've always been this way.

&amp;#x200B;

How to deal with it? I feel like I'm the worst, craziest person I know; one my parents would have warned me about. I'm drenched in shame. I'm never normal. I don't remember ever being able to function like a normal person. I never melt in with people, I feel stuck inside myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Other people don't seem to face this type of issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do about it at work either. What do I do if people ask me about it? One of the guy of the conversation talked to me afterwards like there's nothing. Why does he keep talking to me if it's what he thinks of me? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also sorry to ask since my post is a pile of rambling, but am I a narcissist of some sort? Everyone else is talking about people and things happening, and I can't stop being concern by myself, my thoughts, or my feelings.

Thank you for any advice.",17Oct2020,1
448,"So I am currently talking to a girl online. I liked her voice and thought that the body/ face would match, I was flirting with her and she sent me a couple of photos of her that looked alright. (Was kinda hard to tell because their were some filters)until she video called me and she looked like she was on the heavyside of the spectrum. Now I dont have nothing again fat girls but thats not my preference. With that being said, I can definitely see potential if she were to loose the weight because she's not ugly she just has a full face from the fat. What should I do because I know she likes me and she's a cool person and I dont want to hurt her feelings because at the moment I'm not physically attracted to her but like I said, if she were to loose weight I know I would be attracted to her physically.",17Oct2020,1
449,"I know that I may be called a karma whore or something like that but I didn't know where to find advice, so I'm asking you, Reddit.
Yesterday was my bday, I just turned 15 and I was extremely happy, because I was at my house with my classmates and we stayed together until 11, I then went to sleep and the day after my mom woke me up at 5:20, and she said that we had to go to my grandmother's house, and that my grandma had suffered an internal hemorrhage and was in the hospital since yesterday afternoon and that neither my mom nor dad had told me because they didn't want to ruin my birthday.
So we get in the car after an hour (btw the drive there is 3 hours) and I start listening to music and remembering that about 2 years ago basically the same thing happened, but with my grandpa, and that he had died 2 weeks later.
When we get over there we find my aunt crying, and she tells us that grandma was hoeing their garden and suddenly she fell to the ground and couldn't move her left leg and arm, after a while the ambulance arrived and took her to the hospital. 
Some time later they took her back home and when I saw her in the bed I cried for the first time in 3 years.
I'll post some updates on her condition in the following days and weeks.",17Oct2020,1
450,"I’m (21f) gonna make this as short as possible (I lied) but my bestfriend (21f) is TOO much for me. I’m an introvert. I love being at home and doing things by myself. I’m an actual loner. I’ve always loved doing things by myself or staying at home and never thought there was anything wrong with that at all. That’s where the difference between me and her comes in. My bestfriend always wants to hangout or do something. God forbids if someone (me) tells her NO to hanging out because she’ll ignore you for HOURS or, say something mean to you to help her cope with you saying no, or say something like “my heart hurts”. This is an everyday thing where she would ask me to hangout. She’s too energy draining for me. After hanging out with her I need at least 3 days to get myself together. Every time I hang out with her I’m spending money I don’t have, doings things I don’t need to be doing, or talking about her and herself 24/7. It’s exhausting to me! 

What I really don’t understand is that she have friends that’s been her best friends FOR YEARS yet she constantly chooses to hangout with ME. One of her friends came to me asking me why she doesn’t invite her to hangout anymore so I decided to tell my bestfriend how she should include her more whenever she  wants to hangout and she had the audacity to say “she just needs more friends.” GIRL YOU NEED MORE FRIENDS BECAUSE IM TIRED OF HANGING OUT WITH YOU! I shouldn’t have to think to myself everyday, each week, “oh I better go hangout with her today so I can at least give her some attention for the week” or “if I hangout with her today then she can’t say that I’m being “anti” because at least I saw her this week”. Sometimes I’ll even count how many times I’ve seen her a week to see if I given her enough attention she wanted. 

It’s like she’s clingy to me and I don’t understand why? Yeah we’re similar in a lot of ways in the things we do and say but that shouldn’t have to exude the fact that I must be attached to her hip bone. If I go somewhere by myself or hang out with another person and I tell her about it, she feels attacked. The “why didn’t/don’t you invite me” questions start pouring. Like do I have to?

She also goes through these moods where she starts being anti for a couple of days and I’m always relieved during those times because I don’t have to worry about her texting me or asking me to hangout constantly. I give her her space and some advice if she’s feeling really down. But when I do something like that it’s like all hell break loose! “Why are you being so anti!?”, she’ll have her mother texts me, and she’ll sometimes call me. Like girl give me space like I gave you yours. 

I’ve also noticed that she very manipulative as well. If she really wants me to go somewhere with her she’ll use emotion in her texts. For example: “you know it would mean a lot to me if you —“ “you’re probably gonna say no—“  etc etc. I feel like I’m back in highschool. This friendship just feels so childish.

I’m tired of it. Truly tired. I don’t know how to end this. We also work together so she KNOWS my schedule. The best friendships I have right now are the ones where I keep in touch over text and possibly hangout with them twice a month. I can’t do things or get things done having her around in my life. Am I being way too over dramatic with this situation. I know there are people out there who would want an outgoing friend like this. Don’t get me wrong she’s not that bad of a person but the way me and her operate are completely different and she doesn’t understand that.",17Oct2020,1
451,"Content warning: abuse, stalking.

My parents abused and neglected me from the age of 9 and up, I was the only child who got this treatment. I once had their love, I lost it. In New Jersey I was bullied frequently, a select few taking it very far to the point I have been stoned, choked, and on one occasion, beaten unconscious and left on the side of the road. I was told by my parents I deserved all those things.

We all moved to Florida when I was 13. At age 14, I kinda opened up to a friend and she went to a counselor. My parents were called, who from that point on stopped abusing me, and pretended to love me, because they had to, not because I earned it...

This was 8th grade, I began high school later that year (2015).

Long story short, met somebody I got very close with, she promises to help me but I gotta do everything she says. I didn’t know any better. Next thing you know I’m trapped in a very abusive relationship with my “best friend”. She basically owned me, and I thought it was love. She humiliated me, physically harmed me, pushed me to harm myself, demanded me to starve myself, blackmailed me with my traumas, purposefully recreated my traumas, and so on.

I left her at age 16, in October 2017. It’s now been 3 years since I left my abuser.

For the last 3 years, she’s been stalking and harassing me for leaving. My parents have done nothing, and my mom has gone to great lengths to hide it all from my friends, siblings, and at times, my dad.

Despite that, I’ve managed to get better. Became more self aware and examined my flaws, either got rid of them, or improved them.

I learned to become a functional person, I’ve even had a lot of friends, been on dates, been in actual romantic relationships. Of course, my stalker has made it hard for me to stay with the majority of people, as being associated with me means you gotta be a target of her, and nobody wants that. 

In May 2019, I graduated high school alongside my stalker. In June 2019, my mom came clean. About EVERYTHING. Prior to this I was gaslit by both of my parents, they denied ever neglecting or abusing me, denied the violence. Told me I was sick and remembered a different life. Even going as far to tell mental health professionals this. Which is why I haven’t been to therapy since 2017, they stopped allowing me to go because I kept telling me the truth. They withheld every single thing I needed to recover sooner.

I forgave her.

In August or September 2019 my stalker left for the US Army. Basic training, I thought it was all over.

By December 2019 she makes her comeback. She’s still not in Florida but now has her phone. Turns out she had been collecting info on me before making it clear she’d be coming for me again.

In the time she was gone, my life became GREAT. I had allowed myself to hang out with more people knowing she wouldn’t try and sabotage things. I started college. My parents took steps at improving their relationship with me. I was enjoying life for the first time since elementary school. I remember thinking how grateful I was to have finally been free.

But she came back, digitally. And my mom allowed everything this year to happen.

I opened up to 3 of my closest friends, 2 didn’t believe me. One going as far to make memes about my trauma, and say that my parents would never harm me. He snitched to my little brother who obviously wouldn’t have known. My parents did not abuse me in front of my siblings. So next thing you know my mom finds out I told my friend, and I’m kicked out.

Then my mom goes out of her way to TEXT MY FRIENDS AND SAY I RAN AWAY.

So now I’m homeless, starving, full survival mode, while a bunch of people are calling and texting me, some I hadn’t even known (friends decided to tell their friends how “ridiculous” I was). Strangers were telling me to kill myself, friends were telling me that I’m immature for running away from a “great home” and that I “have no clue what a real struggle is like”. All while I’m fighting to SURVIVE.

Turns out my mom’s plan was to kick me out and have me home that same night. She contacted my friends about an hour after I was out, to humiliate me and have me home sooner. It was a tactic to scare me into never opening up again. Didn’t work. I survived homeless for several days, until I could strike a deal with my mom. That we would take legal action against the stalker, that we have mountains of evidence for. And that my mom would put me back in therapy and also get therapy for herself.

I went back home. None of these things came true.

Even worse, despite me now only weighing 135 pounds, I wasn’t taken to a doctor when I definitely should’ve been, and my annual physical was cancelled as well. They want to cover up their negligence, as they’ve done my entire life.

On July 31st, my stalker was so proud of herself she decided to humiliate me. You can actually read that here...

https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/iv817e/on_july_31st_2020_the_girl_i_left_3_years_ago/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

A few days later my mom called an attorney right in front of me. She wanted to look like a hero now this “false” information about my parents being negligent had been shown to a lot of people who know us.

I thought this was my chance. I worked on a document, 35 pages long. I showed her. After I showed her, she seems to have gone back on things AGAIN. She isn’t doing anything.

Something else happened just this month (October 2020) now I have to add more to the document. 

I still have the attorneys information saved, planning on scheduling a free consultation.

But honestly, there’s one thing holding me back. I know this would be an extremely easy case; most of the evidence I have against her ISN’T anonymous. She’s boasted these disturbing things from her social media accounts (direct messages) and I still have a conversation with her saved in iMessage from May 2018, several months after I left, telling her to please stop harassing me and that I’ve moved on, she was uncooperative. There is so much against her, and just about anybody who went to our high school would agree she is crazy. She is toxic, she was a jerk to everybody. I was just the kid with no proper experience with any type of love to understand that your best friend should not act like an abusive, manipulative, controlling parent to you.

But - my biggest fear, is that once she’s out of my hair for good, my parents will run out of excuses to not love me. I’ve proven them wrong in anyway; I’ve grown up to new a strong, logical, respectful, adult. I have creative skills, I’m a very talented video editor, I make YouTube videos. I do great in my classes (when I’m not being viciously cyber stalked) and I have healthy mutual connections with other people, and walk away from those who are toxic.

This stalker is the only thing keeping my parents from loving me now, but I know that may not true.

My parents did try to improve themselves while she was gone - but I now realize that, they were just being kind. They didn’t have to put any effort, which is why they were loving. They didn’t put me back in therapy, something they definitely have the wealth to do. However, they were definitely on an upward path, so maybe things really were on a track for them to get better.

I’m afraid to take action against my stalker. Not because I fear her - this will be extremely easy. But once she’s gone, my parents will be faced with two choices.

Improve and finally learn to truly love the child they neglected, or continue to disregard me for their convenience.

There won’t be any outside factors pushing them to either side. It will be their decision and theirs alone.

I don’t know which path they will take.",17Oct2020,1
452,"I am a a very young freshman in university and I despise the current course of study I have chosen. I chose International Business by default since I wasn’t allowed to take a gap year and that was the last course I was still able to apply to. 

I have no idea what I want to do. I don’t know what I like or what I dislike. I don’t know who I am. My parents allowed me to drop out of this course as long as I find something else I would like to do within 2 months so I can switch in the spring semester. So the pressure is slightly on. I haven’t done anything but study for the past 12 years to get my high school diploma. I was so focused on that and getting good grades that I unfortunately never had the “Highschool” experience. Now I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been struggling with depression ever since I can remember and all I know is that the situation I am currently in isn’t helping with making it better. 

How did you choose what to study? How did you find out what you like? How can I choose a course that I’ll enjoy that my parents will agree to?

453,"I started this job last year around Christmas, part time in a pub. At the time it was just a little side gig to get me through uni, but now it’s feeling more and more permanent the longer covid carries on. I’m retaking half of my second year, meaning my friends are moving on without me and I’m going to be working with people I’ve never met.

My actual job is going to have to become full time because I can’t afford not to, and that is going to absolutely destroy my mental health more than it already has. You can get more context from my post history if curious.

Whenever I think about paying rent I get sad and angry. Angry that I have to give up over half of my salary just to have a roof over my head, for a flat that has mould on the walls and a landlord who threatens to evict us whenever he sees something he doesn’t like whether we actually are at fault or not. Usually we’re not! 

I’m just scared I’m going to be doing the same job in 20 years time when it was supposed to be just something to get me through uni,
Because as we’ve all seen, the arts industry is dying a very quick death and my degree is costume making. I am royally fucked. I think thats why I’m struggling more at work, because I feel trapped there and like I’m going to be trapped there for a long long time. 
Don’t even get me started on the fact nobody my age will ever own a house, because of the rising costs and landlords stealing all of our money under the guise of “rent”. 
I can’t save money because it all goes towards bills, or other essential expenses. 
I have a friend who got an inheritance of over £50,000 and she has the fucking audacity to complain to me about her money??? Like sit the fuck down you have more money than I could dream of jfc.

They aren’t interesting or funny and they don’t give me the urge to message back as soon as I see their notification come up.

I know that’s normal in a crush especially after I’ve been looking for this for a while now. I just don’t know what to do.

456,"I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. During this time my son has not seen his father because 1. He was enlisted for 4 years and 2. When he got out of the service he was so screwed up mentally that he didnt trust himself around a child. He paid child support every single week, never missed a payment and called to check on our son every 2 years or so. Which I realize isnt much, but it is what it is. His child support helped my son do a lot of the activities that I simply couldnt afford and I dont have one bad thing to say about my ex. 

Last year my ex reached out and said he wanted to meet his son. I talked it over with my BF to establish plans and he was all for it. He even went to the meet ups with us because my ex didnt feel comfortable with overnights, as he still has nightmares and needs to drink and/or smoke before bed to actually sleep. During this whole time my BF was completely kosher and did not say one bad thing or anything that would give the impression that he didnt want this.

Anyways, due to Covid the visits stopped. My son is high risk and all 3 of us (me, my ex and current) decided it be best to stop visitation until this blows over. Ex still calls often to check on our boy. Now at some point or another my ex got ahold of me via text message and said ""I'm sorry if I ever pressured you when we were younger."" I didnt know what he meant so I asked him. He responded with ""Well, we were always drunk when we had sex so I feel like I pressured you and I want to apologize."" After I responded and told him he had nothing to be sorry for and that it was a mutual hook up despite us being drunk, I jumped in the shower and left my phone on the counter. 

My BF heard my phone go off and went to check it apparently and saw the texts. He has full access to my phone and I have always told him he could read texts that come through so he has my permission to do this. Anyways, he saw the texts and came flying into the bathroom extremely pissed off and asked me why the fuck I am still in contact with a guy who date raped me and knocked me up. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about and he pulls up my phone and the texts that my ex had sent me. 

He is livid and thinks that I'm just trying to defend my ex and said that he no longer wants my son to see him AND he wants me to block him off of everything and lose all contact with him. Which I out right refuse to do because it wasnt date rape, as I have said. He also lost his mind and said that I never once asked him if he were okay with this anyhow and that he would have said he was uncomfortable from the very beginning and if I valued his feelings at all than I would have asked him. As I said above, I did discuss this with my BF before I even responded and agreed to meet up with my ex and my BF never once said that he was opposed to the idea. Since this encounter he has been leaving the house whenever he can and when he is here he gives me an attitude. 

What can I even do about this?",17Oct2020,1
457,"Hello reddit. So last year in june my mom died from cancer. She'd gotten the news in April 2018 but managed to keep going for 14 months. 

Things with my dad were okay before, but the moment she passed my dad completely lost it. He told people I was in denial, I needed help, ... Then he proceeded to make the funeral all about him. Barely anything was said about me or my brother, and somehow he made it seem as if my mom couldn't live without him. He taught her to cook, clean, everything. In reality, my mom was a strong woman who did just fine on her own. 

A month after her passing, my dad went on a holiday with some random woman he'd met somewhere. Suddenly his facebook filled with couple-like pictures of the two of them. He told me nothing had happened and how he tells every woman he meets that he doesn't want a relationship. It stung, but I let it go. 

Another month passed and suddenly he's semi-dating some woman. This pattern would repeat itself a few more times until he finally confessed to being in a relationship with someone six months after my mom's passing. He'd had ""casual fun"" (shivers) with random women before. Apparently he'd met a group of people who were all elderly, single, and ready to mingle. This relationship would last a few months but eventually fall apart, so now he's back to dating and partying non-stop. 

My brother and I have repeatedly told him to get therapy, and he has. But he always quits after one or two sessions because ""he doesn't need it"". Meanwhile, he goes out almost every night, gets wasted, and drives home. 

I'm fine with him dating and meeting new women. I'm not fine with him posting happy party pictures on facebook, and then texting me how he's crying and how life is so tough and how he'll never be happy again. The two don't mix. Nor does it compute in my mind how he can wear his wedding ring and bring home random women who then sleep on my mom's spot in bed. I get moving on happens, but surely not a month after losing someone you've been with for thirty years?

There's so much he's done since my mom died that I can't even collect it all in one post. Everything from drunk texting, drunk driving, attacking and fighting random guys who were having a conversation with him just a minute before, all the way to texting me one minute before I get off work that he's waiting outside only to get annoyed that I'm not dropping all of my plans to hang out with him. 

I've already told him I don't want to hear about his party life anymore. I told him I respect his decision to go out every night, but it makes me uncomfortable so please refrain from telling me the details. He respected this decision for about a week. 

The worst part is that I just found out he resents my wife. Apparently he holds grudges for shit that happened when we'd just started dating. Obviously, my wife is done with it all and now refuses to spend Christmas with him. I myself and also pretty done with his entire lifestyle. 

So now I'm wondering how others would react to this?",17Oct2020,1

459,"This April I 28F suffered a mental health breakdown so I moved in with my sister and her partner. The plan was to sort myself out and then figure out what to do next. 

Whilst I lived with my sister I paid rent and did all the cooking / cleaning whilst working full time remotely. They expected it, if I didn’t cook they’d get upset with me. If I did the housework they’d be ok with the arrangement. My sister cooked on a Sunday but her partner never lifted a finger. I hate it, I ran away from my parents house years ago because they believe it’s a woman’s job to cook and clean. But a few months till I’m ok so I thought just put up with it.

May - work changed. New management. I was being bullied in a toxic environment so I started applying for new roles. 

Yesterday. I haven’t even had one interview, i can’t cope with all of the housework demands and shitty work and the new job hunt at the same time. Endless meditation and trying to deal with each day as it comes wasn’t working. And even if I had an interview I just couldn’t mentally do it. I was being forced to work with another toxic team at work so I broke down and gave in my 3 month notice period. Its the standard.

I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t have anywhere else to go but neither can I cope with the job stress (although this feels a little better  now that I’ve quit) and being the housewife. I have some savings but I just don’t know what to do?",17Oct2020,1
460," 

My mom received an email supposedly from Amazon that said a purchase of an item worth a few thousand dollars had been made by her card. I checked both her and my accounts to verify that this hadn't actually happened and it said neither of us had purchased the item.

The email actually said ""@amazon .com"" so there was less concern from me at first. I figured that we had been sent the email as someone used her card info to buy something and thus we got the billing info. I figured we should call the number, and when I called I got an automated message which said ""Please wait, your call will be answered in the order which you called."" It then played the same waiting music most legit companies have.

I then became unsure if the number was legit as my mother then showed me it had been marked as spam in her inbox. I went and blocked the number so that they'd be unable to call back. I then told her to go to her bank tomorrow and check if she had been charged for the item.

My mother is a very paranoid person who jumps to many conclusions fast and has said that she thinks they now have access to all of her information because I called. I didn't leave any message, so I want to ask if they actually have any way to determine the call was from us? Can they tell our geographic location from the email and connect this to the phone number? And will they steal information by us just calling them?

TLDR: My mom got an email saying she bought an expensive item which she didn't, I called the customer service number from the email but now we're unsure if it was legit. Can they steal information by just us calling?",17Oct2020,1

463,"I got my bachelors in 2017. I've tried to start a teaching program for 2 years but something always goes wrong. On top of that, I'm kidding myself because there aren't high school english jobs around here anyway. I live in an apartment attached to my family's house, rent is 300 a month and that's going to pay off the house itself. My bf is disabled and doesn't work and gets no help as of right now. Honestly, I love my small town and my home in the country. I'm not interested in moving.

I've been eying my community college. I don't want to be rich, I just want to get out of the hell that is retail. I've been doing this for 15 years and I'm exhausted. I feel like a failure at life and everyday it's getting harder to fight off my depression and keep going.

464,"okay compulsory background information:
this boy and i are both from the same church, and he's someone whom ive known for quite a while now but never had feelings for (at least not up till now). 
i never considered him prior to this because he's always seemed so out of reach. he's smart, extremely well known for his looks, and also an overall very nice guy. he's extremely faithful in serving at church as well. so you get it, a total package and far too ""out of my league"", which is why i never bothered entertaining the thought of him.

what changed? well, over the entire covid period, our friend group of 8, grew closer. i got to know him better there and realized he's so real and down to earth, and i guess, ceteris paribus, i started developing feelings for him.


heres the complicated part:

1) ive received advice before, people telling me to just go for it! ask him out for coffee or something. that's just not possible. the way our friendship dynamic works, i can't even directly message him without it coming across as suspicious. I don't want people to know either bc he is from my church group after all and i dont want to make things awkward to the point i dont want to come for church gatherings. due to covid, irl meetings are also not very possible, but when i do see him, its always in a big group. he texts like a complete wall. his replies are so bad (in general) so even trying to develop a close one on one friendship is hard.

2) this other girl in my friend group likes him too and she told me. she doesn't know that i like him, and i was 100% willing to step away to let her like him, but im failing at doing so.

advice i need:

- what should i do about this boy? should i completely give up (especially since my friend likes him too), wait or try to actively do something? (also in church ive been told to not actively pursue a guy but indicate that im willing to be pursued, so im honestly feeling so stuck).

sorry if this story is a lil messy or if advice is hard to give, this is all i can offer right now bc my heart is a mess and i am extremely confused as well HAHA.",17Oct2020,1
465,"I know this is above Reddit’s pay grade, but I really have no one else to ask and I don’t know what to do.

My boyfriend and I (21&amp;23) have been living with his family since the pandemic began in March. It’s us, his mom and younger sister (F14). 
I’ve always known his mom has been extremely verbally abusive. She frequently gets very drunk and yells at my bf’s sister, calling her a bitch and a psychopath and saying horrible shit for hours at a time. She’s extremely angry and emotionally abusive. She ignores my bf and I mostly as we stay to ourselves and avoid talking to her.

A few days ago, my bf’s mom found out that his sister has been stealing money for her room for the past few months and spending it on fast food, expensive clothes, makeup, whatever. She’s taken between 5-7k. It was really stupid of her to do but I think she justified it as retaliation against her mom. I don’t think she’s a bad kid, she’s cried and apologized a lot. I believe she feels bad and I don’t want her life to be ruined over this.

Since then, the yelling and verbal abuse had been worse. The neighbors have come up to make sure everything is ok. Last night, my bf’s sister came in and told my bf and I that her mom had hit her. That’s never happened before as far as I know, but I know my bf’s mom’s parents hit her and I don’t think my bf’s sister is lying. From what I’ve seen I strongly believe she hit her. 

I don’t know what I should do here. I know my bf’s sister wants to go live with her dad who lives nearby, but her mom won’t let her. 

I want to call CPS but I’m worried about repercussions for my bf’s sister because of the money she took. I really don’t know what to do. I’ll likely call CPS anyways but is there anything I can do to try to protect the sister? I know if CPS comes her mom will likely report the money that was stolen and get her into trouble.

469,"Hey All. For the better part of a year, I’ve been on and off about getting a Nintendo Switch, specifically the Switch Lite. Frankly, it’s getting to a point where I’m sick of obsessing over it, but am still not fully sure if I even want to get one. 

Admittedly, I’m really drawn by the Switch because I’d grown up with a lot of Nintendo’s consoles in my youth, from the N64 to the GBA, the Gamecube and the 3DS. Also, I’m a pretty big fan of their original IP’s and am also greatly interested in how strong the market for indie games is on the Switch, which I’m incredibly passionate about even though it’d mean investing in a whole other ecosystem of digital games. Games like Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Luigi’s Mansion 3, and Shin Megami Tensei 5 have been on the corner of my mind for quite some time. On top of all that, hearing the News that Nintendo intends to support the Switch for at least 10 years, much longer than the typical console cycle, gives me the sense that there’s going to be a very strong future in the catalog of games for the system. 

Having said that I’m concerned it’ll end up being another accessory that I don’t really need. I already have a Playstation 4, with nearly a hundred titles between physical and digital games. That, and I also have a MacBook and Surface Studio for any indies that I can’t find on the PS4; recently, though, my Steam account nearly got hacked, so it started to waiver my faith in PC gaming a bit. 

While I don’t really plan to get a Playstation 5 at the moment, I still feel like there’s a strong couple of years to come for the PS4 before Sony completely abandons the platform; though they haven’t officially announced it, I’m fairly confident that games like Elden Ring and Demon’s Souls will still come to the PS4 as well as the PS5. Also, in the event something unfortunate should happen to my PS4, I’m confident that many of the games in my digital and physical catalog would be playable on PS5. My only hope is that the indie scene will still be fairly strong for PS4 in the years to come as well. 

As it stands, the reasons for and against getting a Switch are both weighing quite heavily on my mind, and putting me in a state of inertia that’s just making me exhausted from even thinking of gaming. So if anyone could give me some advice on how to overcome this fixation that I have for the Switch, I would greatly appreciate it.",17Oct2020,1

473,"My boyfriend and I have been together for going on 4 years. I have one child, who is 5. My kid goes to their dads every other weekend. My boyfriend does not financially support me or my child, as I had a full time job. We split the bills evenly when he did work and whenever we would go out and do something with my kid, I paid. I recieve CS payments every month or so. 

My BF was jobless for 2 years due to spiking depression with lash outs that basically made him incapable of doing anything. I was supportive. Checked him in therapy on my dollar and got him the help he needed. 5 months ago he was discharged from his programs. 3 months ago he got a job. It was perfect timing, as not even 2 weeks later I lost my job due to lack of staff during Covid; which forced my company to shut its doors. We do not have a date of when we can start back up but I have been able to collect unemployment and we are staying afloat, as well as my already established child support. 

For the first month and a half (give or take) of him having a job everything was smooth sailing. The house was happy and calm. Things then started to change. When he came home he was in a bad mood and being negative. There was a dark energy about him. He never took it out on me and my child but he started isolating himself again. Locked in the bedroom playing video games or listening to music. I did what I could to find out the route problem but failed in the long run. This is when his need for control started happening.

All of the sudden it turned into ""I work all the time"" or ""I have a job now"" and started feeling entitled to nightly back rubs, sex at his disposal, me basically being his maid. I tell him no often and I have no problem doing so. But it's now turned into he wants to access all of the money I recieve for unemployment and he wants to do all this shit for himself. Like get gym memberships for $60 a month but never going or buying loads of things to keep him busy when he is home, just to have those items be untouched and still in boxes. 

He has grounded my child twice in the past month and a half for minuscule things, such as standing on the bed to give me loves before bed instead of getting off the bed to do so. Or sticking my child in the corner for spilling water on the floor and not cleaning it up immediately or accidentally tripping over a chord which resulted in a broken cell phone charger. None of this was present prior to this last month and a half. Even when he was severely depressed he was still insanely nice. 

Now he is overstepping me. Whenever I tell my child to do something, he will immediately say ""No, go do this instead."" When I question him about it he will say ""Well, why do they need to do that anyways?"" And when I say I feel overstepped he will say ""Yeah, well I do too."" His behavior is simply selfish, controlling and entitled now.

How can I even go about this? 

And because I know people will ask, I have sat down with my child and asked them directly what they want me to do because I didnt know how much it was affecting him. My son tells me that he is fine and that this doesnt bother him. I have told my son that I will leave and all he has to do is say the word and he says that he does not want me to and that basically the behavior isnt as bad as I think it is.",17Oct2020,1

475,"So last year I started middle school. (Out middle school starts in 7th grade).Since we started middle school, there were obviously kids from the other elementary schools too. I became friends with some of them and they got added to our friend group. My friend group already consisted of my now best friend I'd met jn 6th grade, one of my male friends I met in kindergarten, and my crush who I'd known since kindergarten and liked since 2nd or 3rd grade. Enough backstory here's the actual stuff.

It started out as me finally telling my best friend about my crush (I'd never told anyone until then). We were sort of laughing and talking about how nobody else really seemed to like our crush, which was a good thing and that they probably just unlikable. Welp. I was wrong because within a few days she came up to me and said ""I guess the people you like aren't so unlikable after all"". I was confused and asked her what she meant and she said ""you'll find out in a little"" but I was confused so I just asked her about it and she said ""M likes K"" (we'll just call them that instead of their real names. I was surprised ajd a little sad about how she started liking him and just acting around him all of a sudden after a few weeks of meeting him. I'm not a jealous person hut I got a little mad when she just say right between us when we were sitting next to each other once. A month or 2 later (maybe less) she comes up to me when we walk in social studies and says ""ME AND K ARE DATING"" my heart dropped at that moment. Any time they interacted and she tried to be all lovey dovey with him and he didn't seem to like it I was sort of mad but I didn't unfriend her just because of liking someone. 

I'd always felt some sort of way about them. Oje time in lunch she walked up to me and said ""I know you like K"" and j was stunned. She asked me why I didn't tell her and j said because I would seem like a bad friend but she said it was ok. She even asked if she could still date him. As much as I honestly wanted to say no, I couldn't. I don't own either one of themso I have no say in that. Heck, I'd liked him for all those years and never even said anything so. I still liked him and felt some sort of way. For multiple months I slowly thought j got over him and stopped liking him. Then we left school for quarantine in March. After a while of that I thought I'd really stopped liking him, but after looking through some of our old group messages I always feel some sort of way. I can't tell if its jealously, sadness, or what. I felt the same way when in the group chat on discord she was sort of venting about something and she asked him if he ever liked her and if she forced him into some relationship and he said no and she asked him if he lukes her and he said yes. Idk why but it just sort of hurt me even though j thought i was over him. Maybe it's that feeling that j never stood a chance anyway? I mean, I'm not old enough to date in my opinion, but that still hurts...

Yesterday i asked if he would like to hang out this weekend and even now he didn't reply, clearly avoiding meeting me in person as he posted a story (instagram) after i asked. I also suspect him of saying things about me behind my back and this could affect my frienship with people around us.

Honestly i don't think i can blame him. Long story short i said a few things i shouldn't a while back and i can't stop but think this is where it all went wrong. It was nothing offensive it was just me being awkward.

477,"Whenever something goes wrong, like dropping something, breaking a plate/glass, taking a while to find something in my bag etc. I always feel like I have to apologise because I’m going to get in trouble with whoever I’m with.  My whole life feels like everyone is on the edge of shouting at me for doing something wrong.  

At work, with friends, at home, anything really, I’m absolutely convinced that if I do something clumsy or even slightly inconvenience anyone (e.g. have to go back in the house after we’ve left because I forgot something, get home late from work because my train was delayed, spill a drink etc) I’m going to get shouted at and belittled by literally whoever is around me, stranger, friend, co-worker, whoever, so I always do it myself first (e.g. drops a plate ‘omg I’m so sorry, I’m so stupid I don’t know why I did that, I should be paying attention, I’m so stupid please I’m so sorry’).  

I’m 23 and my husband has told me that adults can’t even really get ‘in trouble’ but that’s the best way to describe it.  I really have that feeling of being about to get screamed at by a teacher or parent whenever the slightest thing goes wrong.

478,"
I had a friend I will call Dave for the purpose of this post and we were very close friends for 12 years and he ghosted me last year around May. I have really been struggling to come to terms with this and have had multiple episodes or depression due to him ghosting me. 

I’m honestly just dumbfounded, we were talking fine and I tried to meet up with him a few times but he kept making an excuse so I just left it. He was due to go on a holiday for 3 months so I wished him a safe flight and he said thanks and I wished him a happy birthday and he said thanks again. My birthday is 4 days after his but he didn’t say happy birthday to me but he said happy birthday to my boyfriend which is only a month before ours. (The same period of time where he wasn’t taking to me)This was when I started to notice something was off because no matter where he is he ALWAYS said happy birthday at midnight on the dot. He was doing some summer camp thing and Utah the year before and he made sure to wish me happy birthday at midnight. 

I waited a few days in case maybe there was no connection or something but he didn’t message so I expressed I was upset by this and he ignored me. I waited till he came back from his holiday to talk about things but I hadn’t heard anything from him since. I spoke to a mutual friend and she said she had been in contact with him regularly and it looked like he had blocked me when he got back to the UK. 

Our mutual friend asked him about it and he said “I never blocked her and I don’t have an issue with her but even if I did I wouldn’t tell you”. I was at work when this happened and honestly I was in tears. I had to go to the bathroom to calm down. I walked to the station with tears down my face because I was so upset, I honestly have no idea what I did wrong . I admit I am a bit sensitive so if I feel that I’m being treated unfairly I will call it out and he would always say I’m being too sensitive but I didn’t think this was enough to ghost me? I tried to send a message saying sorry if I upset him or anything and he ignored it again, I sent another message saying okay I won’t bother him again and expressing my feelings on the situation but ignored again. 

I have gone through the events leading up to this hundreds of times and I honestly can’t think of anything I have done that was bad enough to ghost me. Now to this year, the other week I sent him an email literally pouring my heart out about this whole situation as it honestly has triggered the worst depression of my life and I need some sort of closure and he ignored it. I don’t want to be upset by this but I am even a year later. 

In the email I said that whenever a mutual mentions his name I get severe anxiety, hot, sweaty and really flustered and it instantly puts me in a somber mood. The other day (after I sent the email) on Snapchat him and our mutual friend were chilling out and he was happy to be filmed and put on her story. I just want to note that he usually hates being put on stories and he hasn’t been on anyone’s stories for a year or so but after I send this email that’s when I see him pop up after all this time? 

I’m just really upset about this whole situation. I keep having dreams that we are friends and he has responded to my email but then I wake up and I’m just sad again. We were best friends and I trusted him with everything as did he with me. There’s no possibility he has a crush on me as I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years and they were also friendly. I’ve tried to find advice online but it’s always it’s their loss or I am better off without them but it doesn’t help me to get over it. 

Ultimately, I just need advice on how to move on and not get so upset whenever people talk about him or see him and mainly to just stop thinking about him. I can’t even make more friends as I am worried I will get ghosted again, I started being very hostile to my other friends as I have been in a really bad place. ( I have since apologized and explained). I really miss our friendship as he was my oldest friend but I am desperate for advice on coming to terms with this.

I want to preference this by saying I really need advice on how to handle this because it’s unlike anything I’ve ever dealt with. So I have a good friend who I will call Kyle who is 26. Kyle is a teacher and a coach at a middle school. He had a player on his team (John) who eventually told Kyle that he isn’t able to eat at home because there just isn’t enough food to go around. The more Kyle talked to John the more he realized johns home life was far from perfect and that even though the mom was on government assistance there still wasn’t enough for John to get the food he needs. 
After that Kyle starts feeding John every night and dropping food off ( McDonald’s and such) to his house. 

Kyle works another job during the summers and has a high up position. He offers to hire John out of his own pocket for a few weeks so John can make some extra money to buy himself stuff. Which in my opinion is weird. But here’s where it got weirder. Kyle started going to all of johns baseball games ( ones he wasn’t even coaching) and driving John everywhere. They go mini golfing, work together, go out to eat and even go shopping together. The final straw for me that made me realize just how weird all of this was is that Kyle will leave hanging out with friends early to go bring this kid food every single time we are hanging out. He will get a call from John at like 9:30-10 pm and he will leave wherever we are and go bring the kid food. 
It’s creeping me out. Something about this feels wrong to me. And I’ve confronted Kyle twice now saying I find their relationship inappropriate, and he tells me he understands but that he’s helping this kid who doesn’t get the help at home so he thinks he’s doing a good thing.  When I spoke to him this week about it he told me he understood the concern and that he would back off a little bit.  
I’ve been friends with Kyle for 9 years now, and I’ve never seen any other signs of him being a pedophile or him being creepy in any way. He truly is one of my closet friends, but something about this just feels odd to me. Can anyone give me any advice on what to do next?",17Oct2020,1

I can understand having some older pics of people you were in relationships with since they are on your camera roll and it’s just a memory, it also depends on how much you look back at them I guess, but should I be upset that I still see snap notifications almost every time I’m with her, especially due to the fact there was a thing between them?

My gf's (at the time) her car broke down (for like the 6th time in the past year). The next day my roommate and I were involved in a car accident that has done extensive damage to my neck and spine. I was already just wanting my gf at the time just to move in with us my mental state was just so horrible that I just wanted to be with the person who promised me she wouldn't leave me like all the rest. So in a sad desperate attempt she gets permission from her folks at home and they just blew up in anger knowing what I have been going through between the pandemic and making it even now harder for me to find a job I was just absolutely falling apart after a quick argument in which I got upset with her grandmother because all she did was yell and scream cursing me out on my phone and I told her the truth that she is a racist pos. I know what I said was wrong but it is the truth I have heard her so many times an old white woman calling me a lazy wetback beaner that had nothing. My ex and I get into a heart breaking phone call if she would have just told me that she was not quite ready I would have understood. But instead she turned against me out if fear of her folks and made up a story about how I showed my true colors... All because I got really upset because the night before this argument she was all for moving in with us but I guess had 2nd thoughts we were together for almost 4 years completely fine as a couple other wise always got along great. So now I am just heartbroken my spine is starting to degenerate and has made me even more worried. I have had so many injuries in my life that I feel as though I am one more accident from death or being completely paralyzed.
Everything has gone so wrong this past year and losing her was just the final nail in the coffin and I have been an emotional wreck ever since. I just need some advice as to what I should do now? I am broken... I have nothing my financial situation is getting even worse I'm sure that's the same for a lot of people. Our house is falling apart and we are going to end up losing this once beautiful house in January. I am surprised with someone like me who has been through so much mental issues that I am still even alive to make this post..",17Oct2020,1
492,"So my roommate and I moved into a new apartment in June and we’ve been having issues with our utility company since we moved in. Every single month the bill on their website says what our monthly cost is and it’s usually reasonable but then they email me bills saying our bill is hundreds more than it is. I’ve called them multiple times, sat on hold for hours and they either hang up on me or say they don’t know why it’s like that I just have to pay it. 

This month our pay days were a little weird and we got paid two days after our electric bill was due. We submitted our payment as soon as we got paid, we were prepared to pay the 10% fee for being late. But the bill went from being 180$ to being 436$!!!! Which is outrageous. So I made the payment using my debit card and it took its time processing per usual. 

I got an automated call Thursday night at 8:30 pm, it sounded like a total scam. It was telling me that my electric would be shut off the next day if I didn’t give them my card info. It was the first time they had contacted me and my payment wasn’t more than 10 days late. I decided to wait until the morning to call the electric company and talk to someone to confirm it was them calling. I called first thing, sat on hold for hours and finally they answered and I paid my bill over the phone. An hour later our electricity isn’t working!!!! 

We were pissed and tired of dealing with the electric company so we did some errands and returned home. The electric was back on! My roommate and I went to work got home around 11:30 pm and NOW OUR WATER ISNT WORKING!! And it’s the weekend so we can’t get ahold of anyone!! But the crazy thing is that our water, gas and trash are included in our rent. There’s no reason for our water to be off. 

Is this legal what our electric company is doing to us? Can they even turn off our water if we’re not responsible for that bill?? Has anyone else had any similar issues? 


- - - ALSO, we have paid all our other bills on time, and even though they won’t tell us why our bill is crazy high we’ve been paying it. We are younger and don’t really know what to do in situations like these, plus we work multiple jobs and are full time students. We haven’t had the time to deal with extra crap.",17Oct2020,1

Now, I work a job I hate. A lot. I work survey calling and my worth is determined by how many biased and hypocritical surveys I can get random people to fill out over the phone. It was fine the first couple weeks, but now, I find it really difficult to muster the energy to even log on to the network. 

I’d find another job, but this one took months of searching, and I don’t have a means of transportation, so my only options are work-from-home. So, how do I trudge through this one?",17Oct2020,1

497,"warning this is going to be long lol-
For background info:
I (19f) recently got broken up with. He was/is the loml (I really hope he doesn’t see this lol, but if he does- hi baby) but he told me he doesn’t see us working out in the future, and that he doesn’t see himself being happy with me. That shit hurt. More than hurt actually, but of course I want him to be happy over anything. I begged and cried and told him I would change to become exactly who he wants me to be (yikes on my part) but he wants nothing to do with me in a romantic way. He still wants to be best friends, and although I know one day we won’t be friends at all and we won’t be in each others lives because he’ll move on and his new girl won’t want us in contact, I agreed to being best friends because I can’t lose him completely just yet. Overall, I’m heart broken and every night and all day I sob at the thought of us not being together romantically anymore, because I truly thought I was going to marry him. Like it feels like my heart is physically breaking every time I imagine him with another girl or imagine our good times together, and then remember one day we won’t be having any more good times. As Stevie Nicks once said “I've built my life around you”. That’s exactly what I did, and now, I don’t know what to do. This isn’t my first break up, but I think I can say it’s my worst. And I just want to feel better. It doesn’t help that I already have severe anxiety and bipolar disorder (I don’t want sympathy I’m just giving as much detail as I can), so my mental state is already trash. 

Anyways, I need help. I’m raised a Hindu, but have been pretty disconnected from my religion growing up. For the longest time I declared myself atheist, but about a month ago I wanted to reconnect. I know practically nothing about my religion, except for little practices and rituals like not eating beef and such. I know they’re big on spirituality and meditation and healing yourself... so where do I start? I meditate sometimes but it’s so hard to focus (I also have adhd so maybe that’s why) for more than 5 minutes, I get so fidgety even though I’m trying my hardest to concentrate. I need to heal myself, I want to be a whole new person. Is that naive and ignorant to think is possible? I wanna be one of those calm and collected spiritual people who never loses their temper (I have a big problem with my temper that I need to control, another reason I got broken up with). I can’t keep living the way I do, with a negative mindset and sadness all around me. I want to feel free from my own negative thoughts. I want to be happier. I want to make the people around me happy. And if something as terrible as a break up happens to me again, I want to be able to pick myself up and remind myself it’s truly okay, and believe it. Because I can tell myself again and again it’s going to be okay but I never actually believe it, instead I cry and overthink and wonder where exactly I went wrong or blame myself for things. Please help a girl out to fix her broken heart ;-; 

If no one can help me with this... maybe there’s someone out there who can tell me how to manifest your ex back into your life romantically ;))) thats my last option hehe

498,"Backstory: I recently moved out and my friend and my cousin moved into my old place. My grandparents own the place. 

It has taken me some time to get all of my stuff moved. I am selling a piece of furniture in the shed, outside the house. Someone is coming to get it today. I sent a message to both my friend and cousin that someone is coming to get it. My friend replies with “We aren’t home right now and I don’t feel comfortable with people there when I am not there”. I am not going to cancel on the buyer. I feel like my friend is being unreasonable. Why does she need to be there? The furniture is outside!",17Oct2020,1
499,"Trigger warning for possible sexual assault. This is really confusing to me and idk if this is the place, if not, my apologies.

Long story short. After not being home after one year exchange I (M22) came back (month and a half ago) and met some friends. I got drunk and came back to my place. Around 2 AM, and old friend of mine (F20) texted me asking if she and her friends could stay at my place since they were far away from home. I kindly agreed, with no malicious intentions. This girl liked me, and I found her attractive, but nothing else. I asked her if she could bring alcohol and they brought it, but I was the only drinking it (they were sober). After that, this girl and I started to make out. But after that, I have a blackout. I have some flashbacks, where we did more things and I think we had sex (but I'm not really sure about it). It was kinda interesting because it was my first sexual interaction with someone, I'm a bit shy to be actively interacting with someone in that way, but it is all blurry honestly. In my eyes, everything seemed consensual. But around 5:30, I, still a bit drunk, wake up and see the girl sad, almost crying and their friends saying the were going to the police and then they left. I was so confused and anxious about it.

It was until the next day that a friend of mine told me the girl called her, in a really bad state, saying I sexually assaulted her, went to the police but didn't press charges. She wasn't specific how, but saying I did it. My friend tried to found out what happened the first weeks but couldn't, because the girl was kinda just not talking about it. I've tried to apologise with the help of my friend (cause the girl blocked me everywhere) but Idk if it's not yet the proper time or maybe it would be even worst (even though I really want to).

The police called me the next week saying if I knew about it and told them that it seemed consensual to me, but I couldn't remember everything bc of my blackout. They told me everything started consensual, but then it wasn't but I continued (which I find kinda odd bc I can't really remember, and I have never forced anyone to do something, specially sexually, we all need to respect and be respected in our boundaries, but they tell me it is what she said).

Til this day, I don't know what happened and I feel like shit. I've always been respectful and respect boundaries, trying to help everyone, but now I don't know who I am. I feel really anxious, depressed and the guilt is killing me knowing that someone is suffering bc of me.

I know a lot of people know already the details about it, but to this point Idk if I really want to know (I know, it's a bit coward from my side). I've lost almost all my friends because of that (which makes me really sad but I respect). I just really know what to do.

Of course, I cut alcohol from my life. And I've been going to a psychologist that has been helping me but still I feel like I'm in a hole (and which I deserve to be).

Should I just forget everything and move on, even though I don't want and get really anxious of finding out more about the story? Should I wait til everything cools down to do something?

Thanks for reading and sorry if it triggered someone or if it doesn't belong here.

Tldr: I was told I sexually assaulted someone while blackout drunk. No charges were pressed but I the guilt is killing me.",17Oct2020,1
500,"I (21F) have been single since January 2020. The breakup with my ex was very difficult because I was very in love and it was an abusive relationship. 
It took me time to accept that he’s no good for me and that I deserve to be treated with respect. It was a one-year-relationship. At first it was amazing, but then he started showing his true color by preventing me from seeing my friends, telling me how to dress, arguing about every detail of my life, etc. It got so bad that I was harming myself and almost killed myself. But I didn’t want to live because I believed my life was worthless without him.
I moved back to my home country, took the time to heal and to forgive myself. At the moment, I’m in a good place and I felt ready to date again.
I met a cool guy (28M). We hung out a couple of times and had sex. It was good but I kept feeling guilty, as if I was cheating on my ex... 
I guess I wasn’t as ready as I thought but it feels like even though this relationship is long over, it’s still haunting me. Do you have any advice for me to move on?",17Oct2020,1
501,"I’m going to delete this when I get the help I need so please if you have any advice for me, it will all be helpful. And also I’m not sure what the exact definition of gaslighting is so tell me if I’m wrong on the use of the word.

So I am 16 M and a bit more than a year ago when I was 15 I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I would actual say that I am super lucky. We have so many friends who are working in the medical field, diabetes specifically, and one once saved my ass from having to go to the hospital. 

I am also forever grateful for all the thin my parents have done for me. They’ve spent money that they didn’t have to spend on MY fuck ups and they’ve never complained dan once. Or at least my dad hasn’t. My mom however uses this against me. Every time there’s some kind of arguments between us (which is just normal stuff, like grades, work, etc.) she will bring up “all the money I spent so I could keep you alive” or her personal favorite, “I’ve gotten up every night at 2 A.M. just so I could make sure you’re still alive.” His immediately makes me uncomfortable and I back down.

But here’s the thing. The last few nights I’ve been staying up, admittedly, way later than I should and I she hasn’t come down to check on me once. I don’t even hear footsteps coming from up stairs. We’ve had arguments during these few nights where she’s said the same thing. That at 2 A.M. she always comes down to my room to make sure I’m still breathing, as she put it.

I’ve felt horrible about myself ever since I was diagnosed, not because I have it, n out because my diet would have to change, but because I knew that this would be a burden on my parents financially, and my parents know how I feel about that. My mom also avoids doing this in front I of my dad, who is much more calm and understanding about how I feel. I e told him that she’s said this stuff and he says “Well maybe she does. I’m a heavy sleeper so I wouldn’t know, etc.”

So any advice on if I’m right or how I should handle it would be great. I’d also like to say that I LOVE my parents more than anyone in the world. My mom is a great mom, but she absolutely has her flaws. So like I said, any help would be great.",17Oct2020,1

I'm 16+ I don't have a license yet(soon I will) so yeah I've got no way to get there on my own a taxi would cost me too much because my aunt and uncles where we have the family get-to-gethers at is an hour away. And my parents keep saying I'm an embarrassment because I'm not in a relationship like all of my cousins (their ages are 17 to early 20s. But a few of my cousins are older like 27-32 etc.. they usually aren't there(the oldest ones). They say ""oh all your cousins dates will be there its so strange and uncomfortable for you to go with because of that."" 

First off, I choose not to date after the physical/mental abuse that I have gone thru from ages 3 to 15. I am not typing it all here but I have made posts of it before on here for advice/ etc. This question isn't even about that. I have no desire to date(no I'm not lgbt its not like that, it's just uncomfortable seeing how my family is) especially when I'm still living at home it is just so uncomfortable and I am still trying to cope/ stop thinking about what my parents did to me for 12 yrs (was also homeschooled til age 15 also so yeah).

Just a little backstory. I don't give an f if its embarrassing that I'm young and single. Why
the hell is that even a PROBLEM? I'm not ready for a relationship even if its not a serious one. I still don't want it until I can get over what I had to go thru because It is sooo not f*cking easy.  

And no I'm not asking for your sympathy either I'm just explaining MY SIDE to this situation in question. 

They also say its embarrassing I don't talk to my cousins. Like what??? I try to. I say hi how are you. But after they answer they go right back to their phones or to their dates and ignore me
so yeah. At this get-to-gethers I usually just go chill outside/ walk around or call a friend. I don't see how any of this is embarrassing",17Oct2020,1
503,"This is a hypothetical situation but there’s a possibility that it can happen at some point in my life.

My mother and my father divorced when I was born, I’ve never seen him irl and we don’t maintain any sort of connection except biological of course. My father’s family is one of the reasons he left me because apparently they didn’t want me and my mom to inherit his property. Anyways, they didn’t treat my mom well and so she left. 

After a few years of struggling and being ostracised for being a divorcee in a fucked up society, my mom made it and became a professor at a top university in my country, we are financially stable but if something happens to her, I will not really have much money to get through high school even. My mom’s siblings only pretend to care and there’s no way they will help me.

My only two options are:
1. I go to my mom’s birth town where her aunt lives, she is poor and the area is quite rural so my future won’t really be as bright and there will not be any personal space or emotional support because the aunt is old and is going through enough already.

2. I reach out to my father for financial assistance. He moved to a Scandinavian country and he apparently made a fortune there. He probably has another family and might oblige to giving me money as long as I don’t interfere with his private life. I have no idea about his net worth, he could probably lie and tell me that he has less money than he truly does which I want to prevent from happening. Also, the value of the currency of that country is much higher than mine and even America’s so knowing his net worth is a big deal here.

The second option is my favourite but I want to know more about any legal procedures I’ve to go through. I want to find out his real net worth and I want to make sure that there’s no way he can ignore my message (keep in mind, I can’t travel to his country).

I don’t mean to sound like a heartless bitch about my mom’s life but we’ve been discussing about this stuff recently and it seems wise to sort all of this out “just in case”. 

I’d really appreciate any and all suggestions y’all have. Thanks!",17Oct2020,1

About a week ago my father was diagnosed with lung cancer and some other medical problems. The doctors told us we need to test my father's blood pressure once a day in case it gets too high, but with the machine we are using at home we need power to run it (it's not battery operated). 

Obviously my father isn't working and my mom is taking time off work to watch my father. The problem is my mom is a sale's person, and only makes money off commission, so she's not making any money either. 

I'm currently the only person working and I'll be getting a paycheck of a little over 1k in 2 weeks, which isn't enough to pay the power bill (it's 1.2k, moneys been tight because of covid and so we skipped the bill a couple times). Even if it was enough we can't go a week without power.

508,"I (16M) live in the US. Back in January my mother and I went to our native country of Bangladesh to visit my sick grandmother during my school’s winter break. We stayed for about two weeks at my aunt’s apartment. In Bangladesh there is a custom of wealthy families keeping maids around to cook and clean. These maids are almost always the daughters of impoverished families who are usually young and stay with the wealthy family until they are married (which usually is at a relatively young age maybe around 15-17 years) although some choose to stay even after they marry for the salary they earn. 

My aunt’s maid (20F) was absolutely gorgeous and I was really attracted to her. Throughout the two weeks I was there in Bangladesh I hit on her secretly and she secretly flirted back with me. On the last day before my mom and I left, my mom, aunt, and uncle had gone to the market to buy a new suitcase since one of our suitcases had gotten damaged on the flight there. Seeing as all of the adults had left and my grandmother was fast asleep, I decided to make my move. The maid was in the kitchen washing the dishes when I approached her from behind, grabbed her around the waist, and began kissing her neck. She responded positively and we began making out. Then we made our way to her bedroom where we had sex. However, in my crazy bout of horniness I forgot to pull out as I was about to ejaculate (I didn’t have any condoms with me) and came deep inside her. Only after I had came did I realize what a grave mistake I had done. But it was too late to do anything so I just crossed my fingers and hoped that she was not ovulating. 

Fast forward to today and about two or three weeks ago I hear that the maid has given birth to a baby. When I heard that it felt as if my throat dropped into my stomach. She gave birth almost exactly nine months after the day we had sex. Fortunately for me, neither my aunt nor my uncle questioned why she had a baby because she was married. You see, sometimes maids who are married are allowed to go home for a few days to spend some time with their husbands. I am guessing that coincidentally enough, she was allowed to see her husband right around the time we had sex, so everyone probably assumed that she must’ve had sex with her husband and it was his child. But nobody knows about what we did and the fact that that baby may very well be my child. What do I do now because that child is most likely mine but I guess it could have been her husband’s as well. There’s no way I can get a DNA sample for the baby to do a paternity test and I am definitely not telling anybody about what I did. Somebody please help. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you. 

tl;dr: I had sex with a maid in my native country and she gave birth to a baby and I think that baby might be my child.",17Oct2020,1

I'm a student and our school is very big on academic fraud. I finished an assignment before it was due, but my friend forgot about the assignment entirely. So I sent them a copy of my assignment and let him copy it (change all the wording).

I don't hold anything against my friend for this, as I'm the one who sent it to him and gave him permission to copy it, but I'm mad at myself and I probably destroyed my reputation with my teachers that I worked hard to get (I tried to be a student that took initiative and didn't cause trouble).

511,"Hello kind Reddit people. I'm in dire need of some helpful advice, I haven't slept well in two weeks and for the past one I've been getting panic attacks.

So here's the thing: my family and me left our country for several reasons. As a result, I lost all my friends, I don't know anybody (or anywhere) here and we don't have a lot of money.

My parents, being the beautiful people they are, decided to work to pay for my college degree. I started studying Computer Science because I like videogames. I passed the first year with OK grades but I felt really drained emotionally just going to class. It was boring, hard and the idea of having to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer is not appealing at all.

In the second year I went to study Psychology, since it's a subject that seemed fascinating to me. Again, did the first year and and this time passed with great grades. Again, this time I felt drained emotionally just going to class. It was boring, monotonous and the idea of having to spend the rest of my life listening to others, working at HR or marketing is depressing.

And there is part of the problem: the very idea of having to choose one thing to do for the rest of my life makes me queasy.

My parents are rightfully angry at me for not wanting to continue my studies and they're pressuring me to continue my studies on psychology, since I did well on the first year, but it genuinely makes me depressed to even think of continuing. It feels like an imposition and a waste of time.

On the other hand, I can't find a job because I have no qualifications and no job experience. I got a job as a salesman last year, but  they fired in a week for not selling enough. To make things worse, the pandemic put a lot of people out of job, so there's fierce competition for each job and no way they'll call me. (Yes, I've tried.)

I can't sleep and I've been having panic attacks just thinking about the future. It all seems hopeless, like there is no way for me to ever feel happy again. It's like all the decisions were already taken for me and all that's left is to carry on without fulfillment or any sort of happiness. I understand and acknowledge that most people don't even get to choose what to do, they just do what they have to do. I also know that my parents are putting a lot of effort into my education and it seems childish and entitled of me to simply claim that studying is boring. I also can't keep hopping between careers expecting to suddenly like one.

The garage has been boarded up but not sure it's really safe to be in at this point as that wall is being held up by the corners and a single vertical 2x4 the boarders put in, all the other boards ate basically charcoal.  I'm going to secure the garage door with a bolt in the track, so at least it cant be opened without being inside.

Now for the advice.  I've had some companies come out and liked a few and hated a few...but I cant really get rolling until the adjuster gets here.  Any tips on how to select a company?  Any easy ways to identify someone that is gonna pad their pockets while robbing me?  What mistakes do ppl usually make and how to avoid them?  Anything else u want to add?",17Oct2020,1
515,"I am a 24 year old male living in the Northwestern US. I currently live in a household of 3 people and am the only one without a job. Person A is gone 3-4 days of the week on a cross-state shipping job. Person B works at home 8-4pm for a call center job.
I dont know how to drive and am basically living off of their charity right now, recently I found out we may lose the house before 2020 is over. I'd walk to a job but am over 500 lbs and my health is shit (bad life choices and some medical bs) ...frankly I dont know how to get out of this spiral and need advice on what to do.
Note: I have been looking into evening/night desk jobs but I am not finding many desk jobs that are graveyard shift. I did work a hotel-graveyard shift for a couple months last year but due to said obesity, I eventually lost it.

I don't think I qualify for disability or unemployment in my state but I suppose it is worth another try?
Any advice helps, weight loss is a slow burn, and am out of time for it I think...",17Oct2020,1
516,"
I feel like i’m naturally really empathetic and nice, and I’ve never grown up in a “ratchet” environment where I’d be insulting everybody and/or learning that from others. Also, I just lack any feeling of jealousy towards others (I’m just usually motivated); but I see other people have it, which has caused jealousy problems with the girls I was friends with. I’m a female in her 20s. 

How should I “learn” to be less nice? I feel like people sometimes use me as a doormat. They don’t value me or my boundaries, tend to say mean things just to try to make me angry or get a reaction out of me, or have even said that I’m too kind. 

What should I do?",17Oct2020,1
517,"A lot of people think that living as a couple is always peachy, but this is the real reality.

Living with the person you love is not what everyone thinks it is. You don’t wake up early in the morning for breakfast together in bed every morning. It's not snuggling in bed together until you sleep peacefully every night. It's not always having the house clean and food freshly made every day.

Living with the person you love is arguing for simple things, like who forgot to take out the trash, it's sleeping because the day has been hard and you're exhausted, it's arguing over financial issues, it's someone who takes your bedsheets away when you sleep and you wake up in the cold. 

But despite everything, every day you expect to see that person eagerly or go home everyday to meet that same person you know loves you and cares about you. You laugh together the moment you do something funny, it's intimacy with each other, it's cooking dinner together as you talk and making it easier because you both had a complicated day.

It's living an emotional crisis and having someone who sits next to you, hugs you and tells you that everything will be fine and you believe it.

It's loving that same person even when it drives you freaking crazy and pulls you out of your box.

Living with the person you love is arguing for silly things constantly, but it's also having a love that many people spend their lives looking for. It’s the times that people try to break you up, but the love was stronger. It's not perfect and it's very difficult to keep it balanced every day, but it's wonderful and the best you can experience, because if it were easy it wouldn't be worth it.

That's why every day you think..",17Oct2020,1
518,"I've (F18) started doing some self-reflection after having many arguments with my father (M50) my entire life. In my family, my mother (F49) and brother (M14) gets along relatively well with my father and I have noticed that I am the only one that does not get along with him. 

I have never had a good relationship with my father because of his sexist (Women have 'expiry dates', and 'shouldn't dress a certain way', while Men shouldn't do things considered 'feminine' like waxing and/ or being emotional) and racist (generally negative stereotypes targeting people of other colour) views, and we would always end up arguing, before he pulls out the 'I'm your father, don't talk back to me or I will slap you' card.

He is also partly the reason why I struggle with body image issues because growing up he would always tell me that my 'thighs are too fat, like the legs of a billiard table', even though I was within a healthy BMI range. Now that I am taking fitness seriously and started losing weight, he would make unsolicited remarks about how my legs are so much slimmer and nicer, which always makes me uncomfortable. 

At family gatherings with my relatives, he would often make jokes at my expense, and when I get defensive, he would say that I am crazy and making the people around me uncomfortable. He has done the same to my mother in the past, but she has never spoken up for herself.

I was raised to believe that there was something wrong with me, my father always said that I had mental issues, and uses this to defend his arguments every time I disagreed with him. When I opened up to my parents that I was bullied in middle school for the first time (I was a quiet kid), my father (and mother) always said that it was my fault that people were targeting me. 

When I started receiving unwanted attention from male strangers, my father said that I should be grateful for that attention because that meant that I wasn't hideous. After all my failed attempts at reaching out to my parents, I kind of gave up(?) and started keeping my problems to myself. 

At this point, I feel like I am always walking on eggshells around my father and that I can never respect him. However, I do not know if my dislike towards him stems from a logical perspective or if it is just a result of me being too sensitive, considering that my brother and my father get along very well.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I have more respect for my mother, I find difficulty in confiding in her because of our differing viewpoints. And most of the time, I go out of my way to avoid my father so as to prevent conflict.

If we end up arguing again, how can I tell if I am being rational or just overly-sensitive?",17Oct2020,1

520,"My dad is a local business owner, pretty well known, pretty well set financially. Because of this, most people assume *I'm* wealthy, don't understand why I use an old laptop, don't have a car etc. 

My dad came from little money and it's important to him we are able to take care of ourselves, so ever since I was around ten I've paid for everything myself, whether it be clothes, books/a laptop for school or whatnot. He has paid for food at home, we've never had to pay rent, but that's all. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I started a business pretty early on, it did alright, and eventually, I sold it to fusion because it grew too big for me to manage next to school and I got a good offer. 

I haven't touched a cent of that money, and I've been working a regular job like my classmates, where I've also been saving so I'd be able to move out and so on. 

As you can guess, I'm pretty alright all in all, but I don't spend that money for a reason, and I don't want to. The second people find out about even some of all this, they get offended I haven't told them, wants me to pay for everything because 'I can afford it' and I've even been called lame, boring and a loser for saving. 

The thing is, my classmates found out about some of this, and they always want me to pay for stuff like beer if we go out together, even though we make around the same, they actually a little more than me. How do I handle this?

I don't want to seem or be cheap, but I've been working really hard to be able to have my savings and I don't want them slipping up because of something like drinking or going out. We're around 30 students in my class.",17Oct2020,1

523,So I’ve been struggling with my porn addiction and I ended up talking with a girl who I payed a small bit of cash for some nudes and then she offered to meet up for 300 dollars. I was going to agree to this until I really started thinking that what I was doing was a new low for me. So I just blocked he and figured that I’d be done but she had a second account and messaged me saying that she would sue me if I didn’t pay her the 300 for meeting up even though I never fully agreed to it.

528,"I've made many stupid, awful decisions in my short experience of living on this planet. Decisions that have led me to a life I hate living. I love life, but I hate my life. I want to keep living, but not in the situation I am currently in.

I'm a 28 year old man living in the UK. I have aspergers, but I like to think I've worked through most of it. I can socialise with people just fine if I have to. Currently, I have no friends except my parents, and even they have had enough of me now. Yes, I'm 28 years old and still living with my parents. I hate it.

I've never had a job, I've always been too scared to get one. I worry that no one would want to hire me because I have no experience. I've done hard work in my life, shifting horse shit daily, which was actually something that I loved, but it wasn't paid work. I'm confident I can work any job that I'd need to if I had the opportunity to learn.

A problem with me is that I'm not street-wise. I fear that if I left this house and started wandering the country on my own, I would be robbed and murdered. I have saved a nice chunk of money that can carry me through for a couple of months in hotels and B&amp;B's.

Why do I want to do this? Living here is choking the life out of me. I'm not one to self-harm, but the past couple of days I have been punching myself as hard as I can in my own face for no reason. I now have several bruises. I fear that if I stay here any longer, I will be harming myself more and more severely until I finally end my own life. I don't want to end my life, I love life. But I just can't live here anymore.

I just want to walk out the front door with enough clothes in my backpack, pick a direction, and keep walking. It's something I've been thinking about for a while now. The idea of going on such an adventure is enticing to me. I mean, it's gotta be better than where I am right now. I'm just terrified of going out there and being brutally murdered by someone that wants my money or something.

Other may even attempt to dissuade me from doing this.

529,"For some background, I am a student in high school.
I have been struggling with procrastination for quite some time (2-3 years) which has been progressively getting worse over time. In recent times, due to the quarantine period, it has gotten really bad to the point that I literally cannot bring myself to sit down and get my work done. Even the deadlines don't even provide motivation. And when I do happen to try, my mind always wanders away and I feel a strong urge to distract myself with youtube or games. I have tried to break this habit before, but just eventually end up back where I started.

Procrastination has also adversely affected my mental health. While procrastinating, I don't feel any guilt at all; it only comes flooding in later and I feel like a complete failure, which makes me have depressive thoughts. I also stay up late in hopes of getting to focus, as I could previously get into the zone very easily at night, but even that too is failing. Instead, I just end up sleeping very late without having dinner any work at all.

I have exams coming around soon, and I feel like I am setting myself up to fail. I really want to break this habit now, otherwise it will be too late. Literally any help or advice you guys can give is much appreciated. Thanks",17Oct2020,1

531,"My boyfriend and I started out ldr and after 3 months closed the gap with me moving from the u.s to Australia and moving in with him and his parents. In a few months my boyfriend and I will have been together 2 years. My current boyfriend is the first partner I've had beyond ldr and the first to last longer then a month.

Before I lived with my boyfriend(currently) i used to live with my abusive parents who would yell, punch walls/doors, and have an overall adult tantrum any time I was on calls/video chats with my boyfriend. My boyfriend heard and saw how nuts my parents can be through those calls and helped me move out of there and in with him. 


Since moving in with my boyfriend I've cut all contact with my family(and I'm pretty sure they've given up trying to guilt me into coming back by now) and anyone from where I used to live back in the u.s. 

My boyfriend is a good person and a better partner but I don't get butterflies or excitement around him anymore and most of the time when he's home I'd honestly rather just be alone doing my own thing then always being near him and having him involved in whatever I want to do.

We've also been talking about marriage and the future and picked out an engagement ring together(which he actually bought, brought home, and let me try on to check the sizing). Since seeing it in person I've been going a bit nutty in a way.. I can't imagine marrying or having a future with him anymore since he's my first and I want to know what else is out there. 

He's a good choice, a stable choice, and very compatible to me both romantically and sexually but nothing about our relationship excites me anymore. I like him and think hes a really decent person but i don't feel like I love him anymore. I feel trapped and that I want experience so many more things then I can with him but also so very guilty for thinking like that. 

I know if I broke up with my boyfriend he'd stop working towards his healthy goals that he's been doing while we've been together(going to therapy, working towards his driving license and owning a car, going back to school for a decent career) and he'd just go into being depressed and not want to do anything but cry and eat. When I think about that I just feel so guilty and selfish, how could I be so horrible to ruin something so good for him, he's only ever been good to me and it'd break my heart to hurt him so much and see him like that.


I'm in Australia on a visa that doesn't allow work so I have no money and won't be able to find anywhere else to live if I have to move out. I also don't know anyone else around, I only know my boyfriend and his parents.

536,"Okay, I did something really fucked up when I was in middle school. I dont have an excuse at to why I did it, maybe it was because of my major depression or that I was diagnosed with being a sociopath last year. Anyways, back to what I did. In 7th grade I became really depressed because I had no friends and I was constantly being pressured by my family to do good in a sport that I hated. I was bad at making friends because I was very antisocial. This eventually kept wearing me down and sometime at the end of 7th was when things went to hell. My dad had pissed me off, I dont really remember what for. (This is where the fucked up parts come in) I began telling people I was being abused by my dad. And that I was suicidal. And that my dad was a drunk that never did anything other than abuse me and my mother (none of that is true) I began telling people that my brother also abused me. (I was never really fond of my brother, but still he'd never do anything like that.) And by the middle of 8th grade... things were bad. I had absorbed this fake life style by pretending it was real. I completely changed my personality to fit the story. I became a whole new person. I told people that I had tried to commit suicide and was in the house (never tried, never was in the hospital.) I began telling people that my dad killed my mom by abusing her (just.. no) and that when he abused me he would almost kill me too. And that my brother helped my dad. Things slowly got worse and worse and by the end of middle school things were way way way out of hand I couldn't stop it. I changed schools when high school started, and I never told people at my new school all the lies and hoaxes I told at my old one. But, I did keep in touch with people from my old school and continued the story there. I told them that my dad had went to jail and I had been adopted into a new family and thats why I changed schools. That is pretty much where the story ended. Now, in my junior year, I contacted and old friend from my old school. We talked a lot. She has a boyfriend, but tells me everything.

538,"Yesterday I went out with my friends from school that i haven’t seen in a while. We went to a bar and honestly it was kinda boring like i don’t find it that fun to be with them anymore. then we left at 10 cause it closes early and we decided we would go and buy some more beers and just walk around the streets looking for something to do. My one friend got really drunk and already started being kind of annoying to deal with. we met this guy who was going to an after party and invited us (i know not very corona safe sorry). so we walked with him for like 20 minutes and he seemed normal and to me, he seemed like a funny nice guy. my two friends don’t speak the same language here so they couldn’t talk to him in his mother tongue but in english. and i think guys here just come across as a bit awkward and sarcastic in english. 
but then we were walking for 20 minutes and my one friend decides to pull us both away and just start like saying to him “Now we’ve walked too far!!! it’s just too farr! we’re leaving” and it was just really weird and awkward now we’ve walked with him for so long. 
and i was just really confused. then she started saying he was really weird and she got really defensive. and like that’s fine, i really didn’t mind but she started like getting really annoying towards me and made me feel like an idiot. 
it’s hard to describe it, when’s she’s drunk she gets a bit argumentative and she started projecting her whole defence on me. and it was just really uncomfortable. 
it was as if she was pissed off at me because i had put her in this situation but it was just miscommunication. anyway the thing that annoyed me is just the way she speaks to me. it’s really belittling and she singled me out completely and made me feel like i did everything wrong. 
it was impossible to have a normal conversation about it because she was so drunk. so i ended up just hugging her saying i don’t care, it doesn’t matter about this random guy. it’s just miscommunication. but anyway after that it was just a bit tense and it put me in a really shitty mood.
but we went back to my friends house and then i went to the bathroom and my cousin called me and i started talking to her about what happened. and i just told her how i felt upset and uncomfortable there. then when i got back from the toilet (i was in there for maybe 15/20 mins) 
i got back and they were both asleep. and my one friend was in a single bed, the other on the sofa. and i just didn’t know what to do. i guess the original plan was just to share a single bed with one of them but at that point i didn’t want to be there so bad that it was the last thing i wanted to do. 
so i texted my cousin who lives about a 30 minute walk away and asked if i could sleep at hers. She answered and i packed up my stuff and left. it was 1 am so maybe it was kind of stupid to walk 30 mins on my own but that was just the thing that seemed right to do at the time. i was annoyed and i probably should have texted them and i was going to text them to let them know id left but my cousin kinda influenced me not to just saying fuck them man let them think what they wanna think just leave without saying anything. 
then the next day they text me like where are u and i said i left and went there blah blah. and i had to come by the next day to pick up some makeup i forgot. 
i got there and was planning on just coming, picking up my stuff and leaving. i really really didn’t wanna talk about it. because i think i just needed to cool off instead of saying something i don’t mean. but i went there to pick up my stuff and the one friend who got really drunk really wanted to talk about what happened. and i kinda just said that i was disappointed in the night because we hadn’t see eachother in a long time and it was sad that it went like that. i also said i don’t like how she talks to me when she gets drunk. and she kind of just focused on the fact that i left without texting. which i understand, but at the time it was just the last thing on my mind. but i was like yea sorry i didn’t text, i’m fine, nothing happened, i was pissed off sorry. i just kept saying i don’t wanna talk about it rn i’m just done with it. and she’s like saying how disrespectful im being by not wanting to talk about it. 
what annoys me is, the day before she acts like a drunk argumentative baby and who doesnt care but now she thinks she’s so mature and a good person for wanting to talk about it. fair enough, but it’s the last thing i wanna talk about rn. let me be annoyed at you and take time to cool off. 
but i’ve been feeling very off with them both for a long time, and i don’t think they’re the kind of friends i want in my life. so maybe i was being a little unfair but in my head, i feel really uninterested in them. and maybe this was the breaking point i needed to let them go. because i don’t have fun with them. and she said it’s as if “you just don’t care” and i think maybe i just don’t. but it just annoys me that it got spun all on me, and i left them and now they’re talking about me being an arsehole and talking about how they’re so good and i’m being so childish or whatever. but maybe consider how childish and argumentative she was the night before? you can’t be a dickhead when ur drunk and expect to be normal everytime afterwards. it’s happened enough now where i really am tired of it. 
but i’m in a situation where i don’t really have other friends because i’ve moved to a new city and corona really makes it hard to meet new people. so i’m worried i’ve now gone and left the only friends i have who live close-ish. 
anyway, i would just like to see what it looks like from the outside. and know if i’m the arsehole here. i know i made the mistake by not texting them to tell them i left. also i just wanted to get it off my chest. 
hopefully someone read to the end haha. thanks :))",17Oct2020,1

I left my family behind with the promise that I’d be coming back with adequate money. I came to the new city, and the manager straight up tells me that the company isn’t paying for the hotel room anymore. I think it’s not big deal because I have funds and I can rent a room for a while. I’ll make up the money with what they pay me. Well, fast forward one week, and none of the employees have gotten paid due to insufficient funds on the company’s end. I still have money to wait it out, but this place has been a little sketchy from the start. Is this normal for a company to do? I’d rather go home and find a job and be with my family at this point.

 now there's one problem, sometimes I don't text them for a while (that could be from a few hours to 2-3 days, which i would think is pretty normal like I dont even text my family everyday you know), and when that happens they usually text me with something like ""TEXT ME NOW"" accompanied with some joke bullying (which im fine with), and then when I do text and strike a conversation, they just reply with single words or close ended replies that make it much harder to keep this conversation alive, so I would try to switch the subject to something more interesting but no matter why I bring up they just seem very uninterested, and I'm like this whole operation was your idea what am I doing wrong here,,,,

548,"So im sorry but this will probably be a long one because of context. I am 23f and I have just finished college and am about to move to France for a masters degree. I used to go to college with one of my good friends (23m) and always really liked him a lot. 

At the time I felt like it was a bad idea to ask him out during college due to the small class size. I also knew from talking with him that he had a lot of depression issues (which i understand) and seemed to have problems with his family who he lives with. We were kinda an odd pair of friends because he is a very quiet introvert and I am an extrovert with lots of friend groups but I always felt like he was one of the only people I could feel truly myself with. 

So during the college year, he repeats a year while I finish my final year. Because of work we fall out of contact but meet up again at the end of the year party. During this party, we talk and it's like we never left off in our friendship. He walks me to my car and he's pretty drunk while I'm sober but his sister is on her way to collect him. During this time while we wait we are talking and holding hands, it feels like he's going to kiss me but It feels wrong because I'm stone sober and he's pretty drunk (which he never gets like). I kiss him on the cheek instead and At the time it felt right because it to me would have felt like taking advantage of the situation but now im wondering if it might have been taken as a rejection, idk.

Anyway fast-forward coronavirus kicks in and it's hard to meet up with anyone. I get accepted into my master's course.  Recently, every Friday me, him and a few friends play games over zoom and afterwards, we always end up chatting together after everyone's gone. Last night he lets me know that he thinks he just might drop out completely from the last year in college for his mental health but he really doesn't know what he wants to do in life, to begin with. He knows it's not what he's studying but he has no idea other than that. Now usually I would tell someone to stick with it but his family is one of those well off but emotionally distant types, so they want him to finish just for the paper.

So with my move, I will be gone for two years but most likely will stay in France near Lyon. I am moving alone with no family but I don't really mind. However, when I told my friend, he seemed really surprised and basically said to me 'so you will probably stay out there?' which made me realise that I probably will lose contact with a lot of people. I dropped a few hints to him that I was looking for a friend or two to join me (which I was) but now im kind of faced with this choice.

Am I a bad person if I tell him how I feel and ask him to come with me? I know it is a lot but we have known each other for about 5 years now. I wasn't going to ask until I heard about him already thinking of dropping out and taking some time to figure out what he wants to do. I do think it would really be better for him to get away from family right now and focus on himself but maybe that's just me? I just know that it will probably be the end of any chance we have at a relationship when I leave in January.

For extra context the friends I have asked about it say either 'do it you're not going to lose anything' or ' he's nice but your too outgoing, pretty, funny ect for him, you can do better' which absolutely infuriates me. I think I just need an outside perspective.",17Oct2020,1

550,"I need some advice about life decisions. I'm 28 years old and I've been living with my mom for the past 7 years. I was in college and I became mentally ill with bipolar disorder and dropped out of college at 21 years old. I lived in Chicago for almost a year before I had a breakdown and lost my job. I moved to New Jersey to live with my mom and I've been here ever since. 

My soul was crushed and I was a recluse for many years. I couldn't hold a job longer than a few months before I have to quit due to crippling anxiety. Eventually, through trial and error I found a medication that works and I've been working steadily ever since. I even went from being a recluse to just a loner. 

I finally felt ready to move on and get a place with roommates back in Chicago. I saved $6000 and planned on saving an extra $4000, but then Covid happened and it changed all my plans. It would be hard finding employment, roommates, and I didn't know what would happen to the country. Not only this, but my car engine blew out and I had to get a new car. On top of that the house needed an unexpected repair.  Both cut my savings in half. I felt broke and realized I had few job prospects so I decided to go back to college since there's nothing else to do anyway. 

None of my credits crossover because I previously went to a trimester school so I'm starting from scratch at a community college. I work full-time and I'm technically a full time student. I don't feel like my life sucks because relatively speaking I'm in an good position, but I feel societal pressure for living with my mom. By the time I'll graduate I'll be 32-33. People think your a loser if you live with your parents after a certain age. Not only that, but it'll make dating difficult as far as expectations and intimacy. I'm trying to weigh my options. I'm in school, have a car note, and only have a couple thousand saved. I was thinking to move into an off-campus apartment when I transfer to University.

Events of the night unfold and I get tasked with getting her home as our other friends have lost patience as she becomes a handful when drunk. My goal was just to get her home safely and in bed.

558," 

This is not some low-level thing where I can't do chores until a few days. This has been affecting me for the last two years and it has effectively ruined my academics in this period. I've graduated school and have been trying for an entrance exam, and I've failed twice in a row now, largely because I leave it until the last minute. I was always a procrastinator but before it was reasonable, I used to start within a reasonable time and therefore always manage to do well. Also earlier, once I started work, I could focus completely with no panic or worry.

Recently it's become so that I've been putting off my studies until the time within which it is literally impossible to finish and of course when I do even start I legit have breakdowns and anxiety attacks. I've taken the second failure reasonably well but the first time, despite knowing what I'd done was my fault, the shock was so much, I kinda wanted to give up on life entirely. I've come out of that now. I intend to try one more time. I have a couple of months left, which is more than enough if done right, but I have to start. Already, I see myself falling into the old pattern of delaying my beginning. 

If you wonder what I do to procrastinate, it's mostly phone browsing or daydreaming. Things that require no work whatsoever. Also while I'm mostly asking for my academics, this behavior is in everything I do. I don't sketch or write anymore as I used to because even when I want to I don't start, keep saying I'll do it later. I often put off replying to messages for weeks. Regarding daydreaming, I've noticed that all the signs I have match those of Maladaptive Daydreaming (MDD). Now therapy might be something many of you might advise but I don't have that option. What I'm hoping for is if someone else has gone through something similar and overcome I would really appreciate your advice",17Oct2020,1
559,"I'll keep it short. It's not exactly an LDR but we have been talking every single day for the past 4 odd year and it's clear that we have feelings for each other but haven't taken it to the next level. We usually just phone call in the night and talk for a couple of hours. During the years, there have been some speed breakers but that's usually because of me always doubting and being clingy. I improved myself and quit these bad characteristics. I really like this girl but I think maybe I like her more then she likes me and that's a big problem.

So we didn't call for about 3 days straight, we didn't talk much in these 3 days because she was busy, she's a junior doctor in a hospital and I understand how it can get busy. But I was especially annoyed on this day, I was upset due to some personal life stuff going on and needed to talk so I rang and after like 30 seconds I ask why we didn't talk for the past 3 days and I know she hates having to explain and she was like you don't trust me and dropped the call. I responded saying oh you're too busy for me yadayada go find yourself a doctor instead. I was upset and tried ringing her back but she denied all my calls and just left me on r. My messages don't even go through now.

I was upset the entire day. I slept during the entire day, I never got out of bed. The next day was awful, she still had me on r and didn't message me or anything. I felt distraught. I never left my bed that day either as I felt sick and drained. I started thinking and what really upsets me is that she says a lot of stuff she doesn't mean. She'll say something, somewhat offensive and I'll forgive her. I don't hold grudges, I'm a straight forward person, when someone says something in anger I understand that they didn't mean it and if I ignore them it'll only make them feel worse. I forgive everyone. I understand that if I leave them on R or hold a grudge it'll make them feel really bad but she never once thought of the situation like that. She didn't think why is he being off or did something happen or he must be upset about something? She never once cared to ask what had happened.

I'm still on R and I'm just going to cut my losses. I lived without social media for years and I can do it again. I only have social media to talk to her, for me it's pointless. I already have a lot of stress, I don't need anymore. Sure, I'll miss her, will she miss me, doubt it. I'll get over it. Clearly I'm NOT THAT GUY she's after. I rather just focus on myself. I don't deserve this. Should I send her a goodbye text or should I just go?

560,"11th grade student here,  and I am so stressed. It is one class, AP  (Advanced Placement) Physics, and named to be the hardest class in the school. Now I understand why. It isn't because it is hard material, but due to the fact that the quizzes and the tests are timed. It is impossible to get an A on them. He gives us 12 questions in 12 minutes, or 9 questions in 12 minutes with atleast 3 having five parts to them. There were two writing portions where HE PUT A WORS LIMIT ON?? So now I have to think of SOMETHING that fits in his word limit, hence adding more time. I do not have a learning disability, but isn't this incredibly ableist? After our first two quizzes, I joined the zoom call and he says ""yeah, I didn't expect you guys to do good on the quizzes."" We went over them and after each problem he would say ""shouldn't have given you that problem, it was way too hard"" or ""should've given you more time on that one."" When I look back, the problems I took my time on I got right, so clearly the time is the problem here and not me not knowing how to do the problems. He is a narcissist, bragging about how he has his English degree and can probably teach better than all the English teachers in the school, but none of them could teach Ap Physics. After every quiz, he makes sure to tell us how he easily gets an A on them. I'm getting straight D's (68s), as an A average student and I'm not sure how to get things to change. Should i report to administration? Should i talk with him but knowing he isnt going to budge?

Given that online shopping can be kind of iffy sometimes, I typically open these presents to check for quality before handing them off. I was talking to my partner about this method and he balked, saying it was rude to open someone’s gift and put your hands all over it before rewrapping, and that it taints the gift.

571,"I know that's a silly title but here's the thing I'm a young teen trying to lose weight I've been over weight since around 2nd grade and honestly it's tiring. I used to think I was ugly or that I was just fat etc. The worst part is that I was honestly at most 20 pounds overweight. I was never obese and most people thought I was 20+ pounds lighter than I truly was. I'm finally able to change that and I've lost 15 pounds. I am basically at a healthy weight but on the higher side of the spectrum and I don't plan on stopping my weight loss anytime soon. For weeks I've been eating oatmeal, bread and eggs on repeat. I do have other food at home but they are just not as healthy as those foods. I try different variations but at this point I don't even look forward to eating breakfast. I usually eat 2 meals a day, workout, and have a healthy snack like fruits in between. Today my siblings are making pancakes. I made them pancakes. And I put some batter for myself too. I want pancakes. But I also want to lose weight. Honestly I don't want pancakes. I just don't want to feel like I can't eat anything but oatmeal, eggs, and almond milk. Worst part is that my parents who were so on board with my journey at first are now of no help and when I try to tell my mom that I want to try a new recipe that is completely declined. So should I just eat the dang pancakes? Not to mention we're making Alfredo today. I know it's all about portion but I also know my body. Even before my weight loss journey I ate a healthier than my peers and usually ate 2x a day. Yet I still gained and gained. I'm done being sad and thinking it's unfair it's just life lol. I have slow metabolism, it runs in my dad's side of the family. What can I say I've come into terms with that fact. But should I eat both of those today. Yesterday I was thinking if I should eat a chocolate. Just 75 calories. I thought about it for TEN MINUTES. And I still ended up not taking it. That's what usually happens. I only eat around 1,000 calories a day and trust me I've done my research I KNOW I should be eating more. But I'm scared. What if I lose all my progress, what if I gain? I mean eating like this had worked and I've lost 15 pounds so why stop?.....lol I just had a whole rant anyways the simple question should I eat the pancakes and still have Alfredo?

So last night (before her plans I presume) she sent me a snap and said “wanna zoom tonight?” and homegirl looked gooddd lmao but I knew she had plans so I just brushed it off and asked how they were going (assuming we’d catch up later for the movie) but she didn’t respond until mad late so I just figured she forgot about our plans and I didn’t open the snap. 

So anyways we’re supposed to have the study session today but I’m really not in the mood esp after whatever that was last night. I’m not mad, it’s hella small- just tell me if you gotta take a raincheck but don’t keep me waiting on the back burner you know? I’m probably overthinking and I hope I don’t sound petty. Like I said, not mad. Just annoyed",17Oct2020,1

578,"I have an acquittance looking for advise from you marketing professional here. They would like to funnel converting clients to their webpage. I am looking for advice on average prices you'd charge for this service (and your pricing model). 

Their specs: 
Small Game Dev Company (projects, assets and art ranges from $40-$500 for starters and obviously the standard $50k to $250k per big projects). 

Real 5-Star Reviews from clients so far. They are quite talented with a razor sharp Project Management skill (able to quickly prototype and cough out designs and betas)

Payments:
They are small and starting so not much of a budget. They are willing to pay upfront and commission based (small upfront just to go to things going). 

Condition:
They don't have much of a presence other than a page on a freelancing website and a few extremely happy customers. So they are simply looking to get a lot more. 

_________________________

1. What is your implementation plan for such a client? 

2. And how much would you price the project at for your services (remember they don't have much of a budget, your the revenue stream creator in this case)?

581,"I really don't know how to bring this up with her, but my (19F) flatmate (21F) has been basically helping herself to all my food. I really, genuinely don't mind sharing some stuff if I know where I stand: but it's gotten to the point where I buy stuff to cook with, and when I get to the fridge it's all gone. I think she just doesn't see it as an issue; she sees everything in the flat as communal.

It's things like cheese, hot chocolate, bread, milk... and it's also a bit more tricky because I'm vegetarian and she's not, so she can eat any of my food whereas (even if I wanted to) I can't eat much of hers. Also, she'll just leave stuff open and spoiling: I bought cheese a few days ago, went to open the packet today and it was 2/3rds eaten and lying open, drying out. 

I don't have much money (we're both students) and this is noticably costing me more at this point. I meal prep and only buy food I know I'll need, and so it's kinda annoying. But at the same time, I don't want to be that annoying flatmate who's counting eggs and weighing out oil to check who's had some.

582,"So, my mom never seems to want to do anything with me. I know that's not necessarily true, but it just feels like that. It always takes me ages to convince her to do something with me, even if it's as simple as baking cookies, but she always puts it off and it really hurts me. I know she has depression and she sleeps a lot because of it, but whenever she goes to her boyfriend's house, she gets up at a kinda reasonable time and gets all excited to be with him. Sometimes it feels like she'd rather be by him rather than spend time with me and I feel like I dont get to spend enough time with her because shes always sleeping. I talked to her about my feelings a month or two ago and she was doing better for awhile but now it's gone back to how it was. Whenever I remind her or ask her if we could bake cookies or whatever she snaps at me and tells me to stop ""nagging"" her. I don't know what to do, I feel so alone.",17Oct2020,1
583,"This is my first post I've ever written so excuse me if I did it incorrectly. Im 155 lbs and 5'2, I just hate my body. I absolutely hate my stomach, how I can't fit into jeans the right way anymore. Everything. This is a big change for me. I wake up every single morning crying, I never want to take pictures anymore, I can't try on new clothes, I try to eat and get upset at myself for eating and so much more. I mostly hate my face. All the fat went toward my chin and face, and stomach. I've tried dieting and it makes me want to die. 
Context: I used to be 90 lbs most of my life/throughout my teens. It was natural, I don't know how I weighed so little naturally but I did. I was known for being cute and tiny, and I had a very nice slender face. Now, I am almost 22 and 65 lbs heavier. Everyone is saying it's natural and a good weight gain, as 150 I think is normal. But I just can't shake how absolutely disgusting I feel at this time. 
It's hindering how I live. My poor boyfriend gets so upset because I can't help but cry when I put different types of clothes on, like jeans and dresses. Now halloween is coming up, I've tried on a nurse costume, and absolutely lost it. 
Instagram isn't really helping either. I keep seeing girls I went to school with losing all their weight, looking amazing and better than ever. And I feel like a slob. 
Is there any advice I can get on how to love myself? How I can lose weight? If my weight is really that bad or if I'm overreacting? Anything will help. Thank you loves.",17Oct2020,1
584,"My husband is a McDonald's cashier currently working evening shifts. Last night I picked him up and he was acting unusually horny, immediately talking about how bad he wanted my pussy. So we got home, stripped and went at it. 

Afterwards, I was wondering what had gotten into him so I asked him what's new. He was like ""Not much... There's a new girl at work today."" I asked him how old and he said ""College freshman, probably 17 or 18.""

Then he starts talking about her, how she was smart and funny, etc. Then he noted with a tone of disgust how she wore yoga pants which ""Went up her butt crack in an unsanitary looking way.""

I jokingly said to him ""You'd tap that, wouldn't you? Probably pretended I was her tonight.""

He then reassured me that no teenager could turn him on like me. Then he told me he was hard again and told me to suck it, which I did. He rarely cums twice in one night, but this time he did. 

Only then did he ask me about my own day, which he usually does straight away. I joked about there being an attractive new guy at work, but my husband was just like ""Oh, that's nice. Hopefully you become friends.""

Needless to say, I'm wondering if there's a Coolidge effect going on here. Should I be jealous that he may be attracted to this teen, or just be thankful for my sex life?",17Oct2020,1
587,"COVID cases in my area aren't crazy high, but it's higher than a lot of places and getting worse. I've been incredibly careful with the pandemic, and I haven't gone in public other than to get gas (with a mask, gloves, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer... I'm terrified of getting this). A few days ago I learned that my father has been taking his parents out to eat at restaurants at least once a week, and you can't eat with a mask on. My grandparents are incredibly high risk, and my dad is pretty high risk himself. My grandparents are in their 70s, diabetic and overweight, and have a plethora of health issues. My dad is obese, a previous smoker/vaper/alcoholic, current drinker, asthmatic, around 50, and has really bad health overall, and his wife is also obese and goes with them.

I've been going to his house once or twice a month to drop off things I bake, but I wear a mask and use hand sanitizer before and after and socially distance. A few days ago I decided it would be ok to take him on a drive to see the fall leaves. I was worried about this, but researched the risks and thought it would be ok. (In hindsight, it wasn't a good idea and I'm monitoring myself for symptoms. None yet.) We didn't leave the car. I wore a mask the entire time (I asked him to as well but he didn't), made sure we both used hand sanitizer, turned off the AC so air wouldn't circulate around my mask, and did everything I could. I cleaned and sanitized the inside of my car afterwards as well. He didn't show any symptoms. But then he told me what he'd been up to.

He's been going out to eat at LEAST once a week, possibly more, and usually taking my grandparents with him. Not wearing a mask, and their favorite restaurant is not known for it's health precautions. Knowing him, he has most likely been irresponsible in other areas as well. Not only is he endangering himself, he is endangering my grandparents. While this is their responsibility too, he is encouraging them. I have cousins who are much younger than myself (I'm 17) who are still kids and would be devastated if anything happened to their grandparents. With their risk factors, they would most likely die if they got this virus. 

Should I confront him about this? Should I warn him not to go out, and that he's endangering his elderly parents? I won't be seeing him anytime soon, needless to say. I've confronted him on things before, but he is selfish, inconsiderate, and just doesn't want to change, and I'm scared of sounding too much like my mom and he will resent or ignore me. (One of the reasons they divorced was because she wanted him to get better and he didn't want to). He is self-absorbed and just doesn't seem to realize that he has an affect on others. At this point I've just accepted it and stopped trying to help, but now he is involving my grandparents. Should I confront him? Would I be rude, or the asshole for doing so?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My dad, his wife, and his elderly parents are all incredibly high risk for COVID-19. A few days ago I learned that they've been going out to restaurants at least once a week, and you obviously can't wear a mask when you eat. I've decided to stop visiting, but would I be in the wrong to confront him about this? Even if confrontation has not gone well in the past?",17Oct2020,1
588,"I'm 28f. BF is 28. Been together 3 years. I am not the jealous type. I dont freak out often or randomly think something is up. He never gave me reason to be like that. Until recently. He started a new job. Started being really weird. Was on his phone 24/7 and would put it away when I walked in. Stopped looking at his phone when it went off if i was right there.

This morning we had plans. Plans didnt happen because he got pissed off this morning and took off to his buddies house. He left his messages up on my work tablet and I did not scroll through. I did read the message that was up though. Nothing out of the ordinary aside from this guy saying ""Let's go do things that will get us in trouble with our ladies"". I thought maybe it meant drinking because I hate him drinking that far away from home (this friend lives an hour and a half away). I logged out because I knew I was going to snoop and I dont have his password to log back in. I dont want to be that fucking person.

Well, I went against my own boundaries. I got onto google to search after looking on my desk and finding an address written on an envelope. The address is for someone's house. I dont know who. I did some more digging. I went onto my personal Instagram and searched him to see who he is following. I know he wont do anything on his FB because I would catch on but I'm hardly on instagram so whatever. He is fucking following some chick named AdrienneMarie and right in her bio it says that she lives in MT Auburn, Massachusetts.

592,"I have this weird on and off anxiety about cross posting on different apps, groups, or websites. For example I'm an artist, I may post my art on Instagram but then feel really anxious to post it on another platform in fear of someone from instagram seeing it and judging me. It gets so bad that I sometimes even consider deleting the post on Instagram just to post it on the other platform. I use this app called amino and basically you can have a different profile for each group(amino) you are in. This is a perfect feature for me because I can basically change my identity for each group, however it promotes my anxiety because I may be in a group for the same topic and i want to post something from my other group into this group but I overthink it and can't bring myself to do it. 

It's weird because sometimes I manage to bring myself to not care but once that high runs off I'm freaking out scrambling to delete the posts or at least debating on it.

I see people cross posting all the time and I personally don't think anything of it and I try to even use it to convince myself cross posting is alright but it doesn't really work. 

 I'm a very private person and I don't like people indulging in my life too much so this may be why, also I had a few messy situations with people online in the pass and I developed a habit on hiding so they couldn't find me.

595,"Okay I'm aware that this doesn't seem like a huge deal and that a ton of people go through worse than this, but I can't handle my parents fighting.  Every time it happens it causes me to have a knot in my chest and I feel like I'm going to throw up.  Sometimes I feel like the only reason that they aren't divorced is because they feel bad for me and my sister.  Just for some background, I'm 16F, my sister is 14F, and my parents are 51M and 49F.  I have anxiety and depression, and I take medication for it.

The biggest fight I remember them having was about a year ago.  My sister was at a school basketball game and the referee was making terrible calls.  I will admit that it was frustrating to watch.  My dad, however, went berserk on him and ended up getting kicked out.  Needless to say, this upset all of us.  The next day, my dad packed a bag and left because he was upset that none of us had his back and defended him.

Today I took the PSAT, and when I got home they were yelling at each other.  Apparently my mom offered to get him breakfast but then forgot to do it.  Now he's yelling at her about how nobody in this family takes care of him and that nobody puts him first.  I think this is a bit of an overreaction, but that's not really the point.

Now I'm listening to them yell at each other and I feel like I'm going to vomit.  I can't help but think that they hate each other and that they are just together because they think it'll be better for me and my sister.  Like, if they're gonna divorce I'd rather them just do it.

I don't really know where I'm going with this.  I'm just really anxious and on the verge of a panic attack and I'd appreciate some help coping.

597,"I moved back to my family home after 3 years of uni in August and it is an absolute mess. Rubbish piling up everywhere, unvaccuumed carpets broken appliances and junk.

603,"I've been with my SO for 6 years now. It was great for the first year and a half, and then I gained a bunch of weight, lost all my confidence, and fell into a deep depression that lasted for the next 5 and a half years. I drank way too much, smoked way too much pot, and basically became an emotional wreck.

My boyfriend is a trooper and has stood by me through it all, but because I have been so emotionally unstable, I haven't treated him in the way that he deserves.  My insecurities and extremely low self esteem plagued my thoughts and try to convince me that there's no way my boyfriend could actually love me, so basically I spent all my time actively trying to push him away because I didn't think I deserved his love.

I lied to him, I screamed at him, blamed him for all of my problems. I complained about him to my friends and threatened to leave him. All of it was an effort to get him to do something terrible to me because I felt like I deserved it. I wanted him to treat me badly. 

At the same time I was doing all of this, I felt extremely terrible for the way I was acting and it just made things worse. I beat myself up every day for it and then eventually because my boyfriend refused to give me the negative attention I was trying to get from him, I started physically beating myself up. I'd cry and scream and throw temper tantrums because I was in such agonizing emotional pain and then I'd start punching myself in the face and gave myself bruises. Thats what I felt like I deserved, so that's why I did it.

All of this hurt my boyfriend so much and for some reason he continued to stay with me. I can only guess that he just loves me and cares about me so much that he knew the girl he fell in love with was actually in there, and I think he knew I was acting this way because I was so depressed and knew I really did love him. He had (has, I should say) faith in me and knew I could be a better person and he wanted to see me become that person.

Now, things have gotten better and I started going to therapy and have even lost a lot of the weight I gained. He's forgiven me and still loves me just as much as he always has, and I stopped hitting myself! 

The problem now, though, is every time I slip and make a mistake, no matter how small or big it is or what its about, I am literally devastated and it takes me days to get over it. It really doesn't matter what it is -- I always overreact and get super panicky and then I get upset for being upset. It drives my boyfriend crazy because he just wants me to be happy, but every time I make a mistake and get emotional it feels like I'm letting him down and I can't possibly be the person he wants me to be. 

For example, last night I wanted to make him his favorite dinner but we took the wrong meat out to thaw, and because I was too hungry I couldn't think straight and I started panicking about trying to figure out something else to eat. And then I got upset because this is the exact thing I've done over and over (freaking out over small things) and it makes everyone involved feel like shit. I cried all night long because I felt like I was weak and pathetic. He was super sweet about it and held me and told me he loved me and again, didn't want me to be sad and wanted me to be happy. I still don't believe I deserve this kind of love.

How do I get over the guilt from hurting him so much? The bad memories keep playing in my head over and over and its so hard to ignore them. I'm trying really hard to stop beating myself up and be nicer to myself and just forgive myself, but I really don't think I deserve it. 

I'm so grateful that my boyfriend still loves me and is willing to stick with me even during my darkest of times, but honestly I don't understand why. How can you love someone who has been so terrible to you? He even said he wanted to support me in this and help me through it, but its so hard to understand why and accept that when I feel so terrible about myself. 

What can I do, reddit? How have you handled situations like this? Did things get better for you? Any insight is helpful!",17Oct2020,1

605,"I'm on mobile so I apologize for formatting in advance! 
So I was raised in a very religious household and then fell away when I was about 18yo. I've recently (at 26yo) been finding my way back to my faith and my relationship with my mom has been strengthened over the last several months when I've confided in her about my faith and its brought us very close or so I thought. I went to her house and spend the night a couple of weeks ago. Well when I left, I left my scriptures as well as my personal ""diary"" behind BY COMPLETE ACCIDENT. I assumed she wouldnt read it because she had no reason to, I'm completely independent and dont rely on anything from them other than emotional support. Well in my diary (which I started when I started to find my way back to my faith, however clunky it has been) I was completely honest with myself and the happenings in my day to day life and the emotions that I felt. This included me discussing premarital sex with another guy in my faith. And also talking about desires that I've had and things I've enjoyed. Well shes been so short with me when we have talked on the phone since I left. She sent me the journal......but it hasn't been the same with her. If I hear an uplifting quote or have an insight I want to share I usually text her and she will give me some input which I love and cherish! But....when I called my father (parents have been divorced since I was a baby) and told him I left the journal he basically told me that ""you know she read it right?""

I know this is a dumb / weird question but I still wanted to ask just in case.  
So I'm an aspiring music producer.  
All my social media accounts have my current "" artist "" name as the username, which is Deatheption.

The thing is I don't really like it anymore. I just don't feel it's the right name for me.  
And this happened with every name I had before. Whenever I pick a new name I really like it at first then slowly I just don't like it anymore and change for another one  


So since apparently I cannot choose and keep an artist name, what should I do ? Is there any way I can find  a name that I like and that I'll keep liking for more than 2 months ?   
I appreciate every advice and suggestions on what to do. Thanks in advance for your help",17Oct2020,1
614,"Throw away account


So for a long period of my life iv been dissociated and have only recently (past few months) started to feel more in control and self aware, but i now struggle to believe anything i think or feel. Nothing i feel or think feels real, any emotion i experience turns off quickly or i dont validate it because i cant accept that i feel that way. If i speak up about a problem i have, feeling insecure or even my ankle being in pain, the emotion or pain goes away immediately or not long after i verbally bring it up. I struggle a lot to remember anything, even the day before, it really affects my day to day life because i forget dates and/or work that needs done, this bothers me a lot because it feels like each day i wake up, im like a new person, the thoughts and opinions i had the previous day are gone and i have new ones today, and theyll be different again tomorrow (i brought this one up to my boyfriend but he said he thinks this is overreacting) this makes me feel like nothing i think is real or my own. 


Im constantly paranoid around my family that they never mean what they say and that they dont understand me, that they speak indirectly to me to get me to do things and they think im someone im not and this makes me disconnect from them more, making things worse. I also cant think for myself cery easily, my boyfriend who i love with everything i have, whos been by my side for all of this and never fails to try his best to make me happy, was feeling insecure and said something along the lines of ""yea, but you love ME of all people"" and that made me spiral, i rely on him a lot to always tell me the truth as trusting someone is hard for me, and him saying that made me think im doing a bad thing dating him, that im wrong for loving him, that im only using him because hes shocked i love him so thay must mean im making a mistake.


I need to know if anyone out there thinks this is just depression or if anything else is at play, i know its dumb but hearing outside opinions always help me accept what is and isnt real.

Also I have this weird white knight complex with women that is completely freaky. For example, at age 16, i bought a vintage ring to give one day to the love of my life. It is white gold and topaz and it is completely beautiful. But why am I like this? Why can't I just be normal? I've always got to be different all of the time and I'm sick of it. I just want to be a normal person. I feed birds out of my hand because I love them so much and people probably think I'm crazy. I'm known as the seagull girl on campus because I'm always sitting outside feeding the seagulls. They're just incomprehensibly beautiful to me and I want all of the seagulls to be happy. I once chased a fox into the woods because it was trying to eat a baby seagull. Then, i passed out from chasing it uphill for so long. I just really really wanted to save the poor baby but I couldn't in the end because the fox hid somewhere after a while and I really couldn't find him (it was midnight, so it was pitch black in the forest). Then i posted on my Twitter about the poor baby seagull and loads of people unfollowed me, obviously thinking i was weird.

I also never trust my own opinions on anything and it's a terrible problem of mine. Why am I the worst person in the world? I'm honestly trying to be a good person but I'm just so damn weird and I don't understand it.

621,"Hey, Reddit.

Writing to ask advice for how to reach out. It's a lot to drop on someone, and I don't want to shock him.

So, rewind to 1989; my mom met some dude and they hooked up. They hung out for about a week before this dude says some messed up shit--bigotry. So she ended that *real quick*. Some weeks later, she realized she was preggo-her-eggo. She apparently had been walking around for a few years kinda feeling ready to have a kid. She was 31, and wasn't in a relationship.

So, she decided to keep me. That was, perhaps, the obvious choice. The harder choice was deciding whether or not to *tell him*. Ultimately, she decided that the financial help she would get wasn't worth raising her child to be a product of bigotry. Obviously, she deprived me of a father as a result, and she knew that before she made the decision. It was a hard decision to make, and I'm not looking for any criticism regarding my mother or her choices.

I never really felt deprived of anything as a young kid. I never had a father, so *not* having one wasn't anything to be upset about. I really never thought about trying to find him. But, then I had my first heart palpitation. I thought I was having a heart attack... I got a good dose of mortality after seeing several doctors and getting about 5 EKGs done. It made me consider the possibility that I had risk factors I wasn't aware of. I wanted to know my father's medical history.

So I did some searching. The problem was, even though I knew his name, he had the same name as a famous American writer. Like *fuck me*, y'know? But I knew the state he was from and his approximate age. I used a few of those people-finder sites, but I didn't pay for any extra info. I found some entries on there that might've been him, but I couldn't be sure. No photos or anything.

So, I did what everyone does when they really want to find someone--I searched his name on Facebook. I found a few people with his name in the right state, but they either didn't have pictures, or weren't the right age. I found this guy a handful of years older than I with the name, and we actually had the same profession. I thought, maybe this is his son? There was a photo on his Facebook profile with his dad, and I showed that to my mom. She was like--""Maybe? It's been a long time."" Anyway, that was pretty much a dead end. I never felt compelled to reach out to someone with a pretty *meh* confidence level.

But then, last night, I was talking to my gf. We were joking around and I said something cocky about how good-looking I was or something. She said you better thank your mom for that. I responded with yeah, I guess that's what happens when you mate for physical attractiveness or something like that. She said, ""What's his Facebook? I'm gonna look him up."" *Whoa*--slow your roll, there, kid. But she hadn't done anything wrong, so I wasn't angry or anything. I just said I'd tried to look him up on Facebook before, to no avail. So *this bitch* (sorry, honey!) types his name into the search without a single location/age/etc filter and she sees someone from the right state, and *BAM*! He's the right age, even from a town I know my mom spent time in/around, and he's a real piece of work--one of those boomers posting all their problematic political beliefs all over Facebook. And even his political beliefs were consistent with what I knew of him.

The kicker--he had a picture of himself from when he was a teenager. And **fuck**, man. I look *just like* this motherfucker.

I'm kinda reeling at the moment. I'm not ready to reach out, but I will be at some point. He's single, and he works for himself--but pretty blue-collar. He has no family in his ""about me"" section on his profile. How can I brooch the subject of his probable fatherhood of yours truly?

I've tried to keep this pretty vague, but feel free to ask questions. I won't necessarily give you all the info you seek, but I might be able to give you cursory details.",17Oct2020,1

625,"My coworker has always been alittle... obvious. But I assumed it was a puppy crush and he would get over it. I’ve done my best to discourage it but still remain his friend. I am always reinforcing healthy boundaries and steering away from certain topics. I also put a fairly obnoxious emphasis on my age pretty much constantly. We don’t hang out outside of work, but he is fun to talk to and during our shifts together I usually enjoy our conversations. I really would consider him a friend.

But apparently he has started to tell my other coworker about it. Our conversations are pretty mild, I try not to even curse around him. I’m worried he might try to take it to an inappropriate level. I was in a similar position at his age with a 25 year old from work, and I really had no idea how wildly inappropriate it was until after I had grown up myself. 

I don’t want him to feel bad about himself for having had a crush on me. I also don’t want to ruin his confidence. So I’m struggling to strike a balance between letting him down easy with a emphasis on the age difference without giving him hope about a possibility of a future together when he’s older or something. Or implying that if it weren’t for his age, I would because that’s also gross. I don’t even have any interest in 19 year olds at this point. Teenagers are repulsive on a fundamental level. 

Please note: not sure he’s had a proper crush before, and I think he might have some mild insecurity issues. We will definitely still have shifts together after this and everyone at work is pretty close.

630,"I should have noticed before but better late than never I guess. 

CONTEXT: My college is using Microsoft Teams for remote lectures. I have this really knowledgeable professor who teaches a phylosophycal subject (please don't mind the spelling, English is not my first language). His classes involve a lot of reflecting and think, and he tries to make us get to the information instead of handing it to us on a plate - I can see why most of the class gets lost and has a hard time understanding what is going on, and attendence plummetted in the first weeks - his didatic is not everyone's cup of tea and sometimes I get annoyed at the fact he won't take an ""I don't know"" for an answer.

Well, at the beginning I was really participative but here is where the problems starts: 

PROBLEM 1 - The squeezing 
whenever you say something, he tries to go deeper into the subject until you're stuttering and praying to any entity that might answer that someone else will make a comment so the focus will no longer be on you. He seems to have placed a lot of expectative on me so I guess this adds up. 
He also pressures into turning on our webcams when we speak, which brings us to 

PROBLEM 2 - The webcam 
I guess where my biggest issue comes from - one of the perks of remote lectures is getting to watch the classes in the comfort of the home, in still warm pjs. 
Add it to the fact that I am a night owl and some of his classes are either on Saturday mornings - when they are during the week, they are right after I arrive from work, I just have enough time to the anti-rona procedure of removing everything and taking a shower to log in. A relevant information is that it is super hot where I live. 
So no, I do not want to blow dry my hair or turn on the webcam with soaked hair, with my messy room in the background, for all my colleages to see - even if they do not see, it makes me selfconcious and I distract with the worry that someone will notice the humid towel just tossed in my bed. 

And no, I do not want to brush my hair and change from my very breezy nightgown with straps tiner than those of my bra at 6am Saturday when I consider waking up class to already be a victory. 

Allas, my three attempts of refusing resulted in really embarrassing situations as I tried to justify not wanting to turn on the webcam, so I sort of gave up.

And now I noticed that I pavlovian and  subconciously started to dread his class. I don't feel comfortable asking for advice from my mother because she doesn't seem to understand - she says that if we were having normal classes I would have to be waking up even earlier and yadda yadda. But thankfully we are not having normal classes, so I can rest a bit more and be more mentally present - or at least less zombified - in Saturday classes.

I don't know what to do because I like the professor, I like his class, but I dread his insistance that we turn on webcams on. During the week I started to not wash my hair before his class so it will not be an issue, but Satueday mornings already made me develop a flight reaction and I don't know what to do anymore.",17Oct2020,1

635,"My friend has a 1-year-old and she comes over my house 24/7. We have been friends since elementary school and are like sisters. My fiancé and I have an apartment. We are the same age as her, btw... She comes over frequently and sometimes unannounced end it’s fine that she comes over unannounced but when she comes over, she doesn’t watch her baby! 

For example, she will walk in and her baby will go right to the kitchen and dump out my dog’s food and water bowls and just dump them or play with the food and water or eat the dog food. I also have a cat and she will try to pick up a poop or litter from the litter box and my friend does nothing. She waits to see if me or my fiancé will say something first... Instead of her reacting and telling her son, “no,” and redirecting him, she just watches him pick stuff up and only sometimes she’ll redirect after something being spilled or damaged.

We have a very open apartment and since we’re only 21 and have no kids, our things are placed as if we don’t have kids. For example, my bf collects Funko Pops, statues and cards and he has them displayed on a shelf. Her son will walk over to the shelf and start pulling out the figurines or the cards and instead of watching him, she just sort of passively says, “no, don’t touch,” and waits for my fiancé or I to... grab the baby... and if we don’t she just sort of passively watches and says no and will say, “can you get him.”

I invited her to play cards against humanity since we had a game night a few days ago and all the cards were on the table and she brought the baby which is fine but she also didn’t watch him. The baby climbed on their chair, then into the table and pushed all the cards off the table and they weren’t my cards they were my other friend’s cards and she got super anxious about it and my friend who is a mom was just like, “baby, stop it.. go watch cartoons.”

I love them so so so so so much but I have never experienced a mother who lets her baby boy just do whatever and it is a little hard to deal with. She will also come over before guests are supposed to which is fine but while my fiancé and I are cleaning she will sit on her phone and let the baby walk around and touch stuff like the mop bucket, the dirt in the dirt pile, etc...

It’s just a lot and I know this is her everyday because she’s a mom but we’re so close and this is a bit taxing whenever she comes over with the baby.

And don’t get me wrong, I love the baby so much and I love her so much but I practically had to raise my twin little brothers so I know I don’t exactly want kids and I feel like I have one whenever my friend is over with the baby...

Please don’t just think I’m being a jerk, I have a lot of anxiety and PTSD in general so I get extra nervous or anxious with the child running around. Especially because she has like... spilled the dog water and slipped on it and smashed her head on the floor a couple times.

I’ll put the food and cat litter away when she comes over now but it’s hard to do that sometimes when my friend JUST walks in and lets the kid run wild immediately. But there are other things that I can’t change for example like... the baby will rip books off the bookshelves, touch the figurines, pull my dog’s tail, eat my controllers, open the fridge and take stuff out of the fridge, etc. 

Basically if my fiancé and I don’t watch the baby, the baby isn’t being watched.

What can I do or say about this?

Also... my friend is VERY sensitive.",17Oct2020,1

My anger towards him kept building up during the years, my social worker used to help me with it but because of the virus and money problems I can't speak with her for now. 
I feel so awful just from the most silliest of things he does, for example, today he was caught eating my mum's food and acted like it was nothing (he did that to me a few times even after promising not to and due to that I started hiding my food), we used to have a lot of bunnies and he couldn't keep them out of my room and they weren't trained and he sometimes forget (or just doesntl't care) to lock them so they always ended up doing their business in my room and I can't close my door properly and I can't really get it fixed so I ended up putting a lock on it and I always lock it even if I'm inside.. He always yells and even when he speaks it sounds like he yells  (he's a loud person). 


 The anger just keeps building up inside me and it's not like I can avoid him because he lives here.. Whenever we cross paths, snores that I sometimes hear at night  (sadly you can hear them through the walls), when he tries to make jokes, when you can hear him breath, when he talks with my mum.. Little things that kept adding up just brought me to this that I really can't stand him and the examples I gave might seem silly, but stuff like that kept happening all the time and he used to be very abusive so it's just hard to accept it and idk what to do..

Initially my mom was still very bad and could hardly do much with her body and she would hardly sleep. I would switch shifts with my father and we would sleep and stay with her half of the day each. One day my father had to work and couldn’t be there for the first half of the day so my mom was left alone. When I arrived she was balling in tears and screaming. This was not unusual since she would have episodes like this here and there. So I tried to calm her down and ask what she was feeling. She tells me that my dad was sleeping around with one of the nurses there and she was so heart broken. I told her that my dad was working and I even FaceTime him so she could talk to him. But she was in another place at this time. She couldn’t even look at him because she felt betrayed. My father even asked to leave work to come and be with her but she would not even look at him. It’s been two years now and my mother has been doing great for what happened to her. She is definitely different physically and she is still, for the most part, there mentally. But the issue with her thinking my dad cheated is still with her and even if all of our family tells her that she is wrong she won’t listen. 

My parents had been happily married for 38 years and loved each other so much. I’m very grateful to still have my mom but I get so down when she disrespects my dad and calls him the worse things. My dad has stayed strong and understands the situation but breaks down to me from time to time. He’s been the strongest person I’ve ever know and it gets me down that the person he loves the most is probably never going to love him again. 

Ive gotten into arguments sometimes with my mother when she try’s to talk about my father in a disrespectful way. It gets me so angry that I talk back to my mom in a rude way. I just wish I could bring things back to how my parents where before her accident but I know it’s probably not possible. 

I guess I would like to just hear thoughts on how I should better handle situations in which I get so angry that I don’t want to be around my mom after we argue. Or if anybody is going through something similar how are you guys dealing with it? Thank you all",17Oct2020,1
639,"This is a very weird thing to write, I have never talked about this with anyone in my life, but I would love some insight.

I am a girl, and I can't ever tell my parents that I like girls. And no, its not even about homophobia, or everyone being not very accepting. It's about me. It's about the feeling of discomfort I get even thinking about 'liking/loving' someone, or cringing when I see my friends with their SO. Why am I so ashamed to even acknowledge that I can like somebody? I have a very non emotional response to such things, to the point where I hate myself to be associated with anything related to relationships, hookups.

I liked this girl a lot in my college. It started from a crush and it kind of built up to this point where I still cannot get over her, even though absolutely NOTHING ever happened. I am talking constant 3 years of obsession, and she barely even knew me. My reasons for not asking her out were not that she was straight or that she had homophobic friends. My reason was , how fucking stupid I am to feel this way. Coming from me, asking her out or even talking about such feelings would just embarrass me, her and literally everyone, because it is ME. 

I dont understand why I feel this way, and I dont know why I still get that rush when I look at her picture on my insta feed. I feel like I want to hang out with her, in her circle but then I also can't help but feel embarrassed and awkward af, thinking about these things.",17Oct2020,1
640,"Recently I (17M) recently got kicked out of a friend group and my emotions are mixed about it. While it was my fault, I still feel betrayed and angry about it and I don’t really have a healthy way of sorting out my emotions.

What should I do?",17Oct2020,1
641,"I posted this on another sub, but I figured I’d also post it here since, why not?

It’s hard typing these words without crying, but I guess I’ll give it a go. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should pursue my passion, or the money, or the glory.

Following my passion means becoming an actress or a youtuber, and while I have an attractive face, my body is kind of overweight (though I’m still working out and eating healthy and loving it! Guess I’m naturally curvy)
And it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I’ve been a theater kid my whole life. It honestly brings me so much joy.
But that wouldn’t bring any money on the table. I grew up in a low income family, and I know just how important money is. 

Following the money means becoming a programmer, just like my sister. The way you talk about her, how she makes you so proud, how you love her so much. I want that for me. I want you to be proud of me, and also love me, mom. Please love me. 
It hurts me so much that I’m not like my siblings; ones a programmer, the others a nurse. STEM is just so easy for them. They (my sibling who’s a nurse) studied their ass off to be where they’re at, but loved it. 
Mom, my ADHD makes it so hard for me to study, let alone make an effort to study after school. Why cant I just be like my siblings and like things that also make money? 

Following the glory is also a little related to following the money, it means becoming a physicist; when I studied physics in HS, I got slightly better than average grades. I understood almost everything about physics since I had a great teacher.
After I graduated high school, I took a gap year and a half (1.5 years) trying to study for the admissions test for the college of my dreams. I didn’t get in the three times that I tried. So this semester I started going to community college, which is going...
Well, for starters I didn’t understand anything the professors were saying. I just couldn’t concentrate. They just read their PowerPoint slides and thought they were teaching us.

Following the glory means becoming an astronaut. That’s the main reason I want to become a physicist. Since to become an astronaut, I have to have a STEM degree. 
If I could, I’d become both an astronaut and an actress, but the requirements of becoming an astronaut basically means I’d have to stop treating my mental illnesses completely. I could never go back to my meds, or go to therapy, otherwise I’d be deemed as “mentally unstable” (I read the official report from some space agencies). 
Also, if I became an actress before an astronaut, to the job recruiters I’d be seen as “immature” due to being an actress. 

And, I love space so so much. I love looking at the stars, recognizing constellations, planets, etc. But, I don’t think it’s worth it. Being unhappy. Even if, hypothetically, became an astronaut, I’d still be sad and bitter and mentally not okay.

I mean, I’ve been bullied my whole life (literally, the minute I left high school the bullying stopped) and I just want to be happy. I want to travel while I’m young. I want to explore everything. But to do that I need money. But I cant force myself to like things I simply just don’t; which makes me go back to following my passion. But this doesn’t provide, so it makes me go back to the money.
You see this loop? I took this semester off to try and figure it out. I have to make a decision in two weeks, and I don’t know what to do. I’m so so scared. I’ve been crying myself to sleep trying to figure out these answers. 

Even if I chose the money, what jobs could I get to make money so I could travel relatively young?
I just don’t want to travel when I’m older and can’t walk around all day in a foreign city.

I’m extremely good at languages, I can read almost every Romance language, and English is my second language. That’s mainly why I want to travel.

I just don’t want to wake up at 30, bitter about my job, wondering why I didn’t get to travel while rotting inside. I just want to be happy, but that’s so scary. Thanks for listening.",17Oct2020,1

645,"Well I will try to make this short, but I hate father’s parents. My grandma in particular is actually evil. When my brothers and I were younger, she would give us IOU’s (I OWE YOU) for every holiday. One Christmas when I was 5 or 6 we got that while she made us watch our cousin open a car load full of presents she bought him. We of course cried our eyes out and left. Thats just an example of all the completely fucked up things she has done over the years to us. Last summer, my family lost our home. It was foreclosed and we had no where to go with no money. We had no choice but to move into the duplex next door to them that they owned. 1. They are overcharging us on rent. 2. Despite being the landlord, she pays for NO repairs on the house, anything that breaks or needs fixed comes out of our own pockets. Which is also pretty often because the house was build in 1930. 3. She raised rent after my mom was late by 2 days because she was waiting on her paycheck from work. Also charged my mom late fees which im pretty sure is illegal but she doesn’t care. 4. She treats my mother like absolute shit. Tells her she hates her and that shes a piece of shit, over a day of late rent. Then i get screamed at for sticking up for my own mother and telling her to knock it off. 5. She uses the overcharged rent money and calls it her”blow money” meaning she spends it on bingo and lotterly tickets plus expensive dinners everynight. While she collects well over $2,000 a month in social security. 6. My dog recently died from lymes disease at a very young age, and he was going into kidney failure. She said she was GLAD the dog was gone because he always barked at her. She watched me cry my eyes out the day I had to put him down. I COULD ACTUALLY GO ON ALL DAY about what a piece of shit she is but it would be pages long. I don’t know what to do. I help my parents as much as I can, but working full time at my job I can only give so much at 22. My parents can’t afford to move out at the moment and I really want them to leave.

651,"I (23F) have been having a really bad few months at work. Basically with everything going on, being retrenched but finishing up remaining big projects with little guidance, on top of family and personal issues, it became too hard. I started messing up, forgetting things and making mistakes, and it came to a climax last week when I screwed up 2 major projects over the busiest week. 

Whilst it was a shared mistake with a colleague, I played a big part in the the mistakes happening. I've reviewed the mistakes and noted where I could do better, apologised and stuff but I still felt absolutely shit. I broke down before a meeting with the boss for one of the problems, and whilst it was a tense and painful discussion we moved on from it, and I'm taking few days off to recover.. However during my rest, my boss found out that the other mistake was more serious than we had originally thought (it impacted the image of our business) and is now demanding someone to take responsibility for it.

I don't really know what to do, and I don't think there's anything I can do to solve the problem. I'm planning on wrapping up my projects with the company and don't plan on working with them anymore as they've caused my mental health to deteriorate over the course of my contract but the earliest I can leave for good is probably December as I'm stuck in a long term project.

Any advice on managing major anxiety from screwing up? I used to be okayish at dealing with mistakes. I know it's a learning process, but I've been having more anxiety attacks, dizzy spells, sleepless nights and have started tearing up randomly in public throughout the stressful months.

653,"We have just come into the English Sixth From, similar to high school. In our school, only at that point the classes become mixed (before the school is strictly boys only). Through a set of a few events, on the very first day I met a girl I will call “Emilia” for the sake of confidentiality. We quickly became friends, not too close though. I didn’t really know if I was that into her at the time, as I never really was in an actual relationship at this point.

I didn’t really talk to anyone outside of school, I still was in a kind of shell at that time of my life and was only slowly breaking out of it. I did talk to her occasionally, but it wasn’t frequent or lengthy. One of my best friends on the other hand, “Adrian”, was quite fond of her, from the very beginning he has told me that he had a close interest into her and that although he doesn’t know whether he likes her that much, he would want to try something out.

At that point, I have mostly held back from talking to Emilia to some extent, to even this moment I don’t really know why. I always tried to push Adrian into Emilia and try to get them to talk to each other more. Soon I learned that they frequently chatted outside of school. The breaking point for me was a school competition, where I saw just how well they worked together, had the same reactions to everything and the sort.

From that moment I knew that even if they didn’t know that they basically wanted to be closer. I didn’t even want to try and come between them, as I knew both of them were happy together. I do have to mention that Emilia and I did have a few more meetings by this point and I definitely noticed that we had some fun together as well, we had similar interests, similar goals and even a similar sense of humour, but I didn’t try to go any further.

It got to the point where I tried to take my attention off of my own feelings by focusing on trying to get the two of them together. I tried to ask both of them how they feel about each other and once I had enough “evidence”, I made a presentation to Adrian, telling him that he should already confess to her.

Not too long from that event, he actually did and the two of them, although still not exactly officially, became a couple. It has been a week or so from that time, and we have hanged out a few times with other people as well. It’s slowly getting harder and harder for me to keep all of that hidden. What’s even worse is that I also keep getting closer to Emilia, finding it fun to talk to her while Adrian is someplace elsewhere. 

I value both of them really highly and don’t really want to hurt either of them, I want to spend time with both, however at the same time I know that it hurts me to do that. I don’t really know how to deal with this anymore, which is why I’m seeking advice from you guys…",17Oct2020,1

I’m still struggling with my mental health now and so is he, it just feels to me like I can’t get past just thinking about him and worrying about him constantly. The only thing I think about in the morning and evening is him and it’s talking up my life. Everyday I overthink about the smallest little things, for example someone I used to be friends with added him on snap chat and I overthink it all the time. I overthink about messages I’ve sent to others about him that may get screenshoted and sent to him and he won’t like me ever again.

I know it all sounds like nothing but I just seriously don’t want him to hate me or lose me. Every little thing that can happen between me and him that goes wrong can literally make me feel suicidal because I get past my day because of him.

First of all, I'm really grateful for all the opportunities I do get and am very thankful to have a stable life and yes, I know many people dont have what I have. No, I do not discriminate against others based on,, anything actually. This is just a post to get some advice.

I can't really disclose my location but I live in a place where.. let's just say I'm an outsider. We emigrated here from my home country (India) but we'll have to go back someday because we don't meet citizenship requirements. There are many people here like us but honestly I'm not dissing the place where I live or anything. In fact it has helped me have a comfortable and safe life and has helped me get to where I am now

Thing is, I was taught in the Indian curriculum of CBSE. In Indian standards it's somewhat average and trust me it's probably the worst one out there. The content is really mediocre, we are taught barely five things that are actually of value and the exam system is the worst. The school I go to is a traditional Indian school with it's strict rules, dress code, boys and girls should be seperated and the horrible assignments. I mean the only difference is that here we have child abuse laws. But anyway I'm not here to rant about my school problems

Thing is I attend other classes regularly. Thanks to that fucking idiot who started the shit we are smothered in right now, I can't participate in the high-end stuff that actually are of value to my college admissions. I'm only ever good in mental and art-related things which mean they're of no use to my application (I'm going into a commerce-related field) and I have to work extra hard by taking classes that matter. Again I'm thankful to get this chance, trust me I am

Now thing is college here sucks. As someone so eloquently put it, imagine a pile of turds. Now imagine one rolled in glitter. Honestly the degrees here are not as renowned internationally except a select few universities and even then the prices are really damn high. The worst part is I don't even know if I'll get a good job here. Even before Covid, the economy was really bad. Like people were getting laid off right and left. And in other countries you guys get to stay back right? Here we dont. You gotta leave as soon as you could. This made it worse because with consumers leaving, not many bought products. Cue price rise. We started to save literal pennies because we have no idea what will happen in the future. The worst part? I'll start uni next year or so. Hence my problem 

(DISCLAIMER: If anyone wants to comment on the above para, please do so in a very subtle, non-aggressive way. I think my account is bugged)

I have a bunch of classmates in my Communication class. I attend it because a) I need to fix the way I talk and b) It helps me get into other things as well. Im a fish out of water there because they are kids in IB (International Board) and have enough money to attend college in UK and the US. It's just so bad. The other day they were talking about courses and stuff and a guy (who's leaving next year to King's College) is taking *philosophy* and law. I'm not dissing on any philosophy students but here philosophy is seen as a waste subject, like History (again I'm not dissing). And the fact that he can actually take it up or change courses later, no bother was so outlandish I thought I heard it wrong. 

We here have to work so hard to figure out what we want to do, get top grades even if it meant killing yourself just to get a scholarship to cover college costs and they were talking about changing effing majors. It's just not fair that I have to study here and they get to go and get an actually good degree in an actually good college. My classmates seem much smarter than me and I'm just... a person struggling to get marks and afraid to speak out on anything really. Fuck this shit man!

An example question would be some thing like ""Are you going to take your dog out today?"" Or ""Werent you going to run that errand?"" Like the question itself isn't bad but it's typically none of the standard individual's business what I do with my dog or if I'm going to run an errand.",17Oct2020,1

669,"Excuse my language but this absolute piece of shit human being (let's call him john) that was Once my FRIEND, broke my $2000 laptop in class at school, 3 years ago (accidentally but it was incredibly reckless). He spilled water while he was sat next to me, and it went all over my laptop. 

The same year I kept begging john to pay me but my parents didn't want anything to do with it so I took matters to my own hands. I was afraid to confront him for some reason, even thought a lot of people sided with me. Some people however did things on their own volition and gave him remarks and insulted him (I didn't tell them to) so his fuckhead father used the excuse of ""bullying"" to the school, so he wouldn't have to pay me back. 

Of course the school heard bullying and instantly sided with John and told them that they didn't have to offer any compensation, despite me being without a laptop and fucking devastated. 

Those following years my grades dropped , I got pretty depressed , and the people who once sided with me became friends with John again. Oh , not to mention John went on 2 school trips in total worth $8k, he even bought himself a $2k laptop!

I'm now in my senior year of highschool and my current laptop I had to spend another fucking $1000 on keeps breaking. I did manage to get john's father to pay me $750 by messaging every month to pay asap. Now he's ignoring my msgs to pay the rest of the $1250 . 


I know it's been three years, and I took a long time to act or do anything. My family couldn't be bothered sueing, and the police probably wouldn't do anything.
I have no fucking idea what to do, I was thinking of blackmailing this cunt john by telling his father he's done drugs. I'm literally so angry depressed and everything.",17Oct2020,1
672,"I’ll put out the context first. We’re living in a first world country. Everybody in the small city we’re living in is well off, but we’re currently broke and in debt. I’m currently studying as a senior in a private school, which  I am able to attend thanks to my father’s job’s benefits. The school was supposed to provide us with reimburse-able graphing calculators, but due to the pandemic, I couldn’t get one. They told us that we would have to buy our own calculators, and that was last week.

I’ve been anxious to ask my parents to buy me one, so I’ve been trying to learn how online graphing calculators work instead. I have a maths exam coming up pretty soon where it’s required. I would use an online calculator if I could, but the school requires us students to show our faces and work area during an exam.

Should I ask my parents to buy me a graphing calculator or should I use an online one?

She removed me because her boyfriend was jealous and they're the kinda people who really don't talk to the opposite sex which she said she knows isn't that healthy or whatever, we became good friends again, closer than ever, she stopped texting me again and removed me, and apologized again after a week or two and I said i know why she did it again and i get that her boyfriend is like that, somehow managed to let that slide too, i really didn't think I've had feelings, idk if i did or still do but she broke up with her because the guy's parents weren't very accepting when they found out but both of them moved to Hong Kong for college.

First of all, I want to say that I don’t live in the US. 

I have a cousin who has newly become an insurance agent. I want to tell her to stop the regular follow-up messages to ask me to update my insurance plan (normally, she rarely message me directly). I don’t know how to turn it down polite enough that wouldn’t come out offensive. 

I know that my insurance plan isn’t at all up-to-date (it is passed down by my parents, they bought it for me more than 20 years ago.). I tried to meet up with my cousin once in wish to get to know in detail of the policy I currently have (my parents didn’t really explain everything to me and paperwork is not updated). But after meeting up with her, I’m just not convinced by her knowledge. She couldn’t tell me definitely of what do I have, not to mention all the details.

The past few years have been pretty good, until Covid hit and my brother started drinking, doing lots of drugs and having an affair. They are now fighting pretty consistently because she doesn't want to lose him, but he's over it and she doesn't have the resources to easily leave. Because he set their life up to where she is dependent on him. She's not going to leave him, the drama is most likely going to continue. We get calls and texts from them while completely intoxicated trying to pull us into the drama and its hard on us. We want what is best for their kids as they have been exposed to yelling, drinking, aggressive behavior, his mistress (the 7 year old walked in on them having sex in the kitchen and they played it off like they were tickling each other). We are also pretty positive that the kids have been in the vehicle while one or both of the parents are intoxicated.

683,"BEFORE WE GET STARTED HERE IS SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION

MY SYMPTOMS 
-severe depression (the lows in bipolar II)
-hearing voices  
-delusions
-delusional thinking
-feeling disconnected with reality
-mania 
-and a bunch of smaller ones loss of interest in things, anxiety, no appetite, self esteem is low blah blah blah 

MY MAIN CONCERN AND THE QUESTIONS THAT IM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT!!!!!

Were my childhood friends of 18yrs really my friends?

    With all the voices going on in my head, the impaired judgment skills resulting from my last delusions I was totally convinced was real, and all the other shit that hinders my strength/mind it’s difficult for me to make sound judgments. But i feel this one in particular i cant say whatever too because these are my best friends!
   I started developing strange behavior because of my bipolar, delusional thinking. Delusional thinking controls you and it takes almost all your strength to fight it because it never ends and is always creating more delusions in your mind. A big one for me was people talking behind my back all the time. An EXTREME amount of time spending talking behind my back. Of course I had a bunch of other delusional thinking lies in mind but all of this created new behaviors in me that looked odd. The reason it looked odd because that was the result of me constantly fighting off this hell. And since I was no longer that funny or whitty i felt like my friends lost interest. 
 
HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES 

  We were all getting ready to go on a trip with our friends for a organized tripped through our church. We were all having conversations and I tried to tell my 1friend something and he just turned his back leaving me in this awkward dark moment. 

 1friend and 2friend both always called me dumb. Im not going to lie I was pretty dumb and some of things I was doing could get on someones nerves but for the most part I tried to keep my wild behavior in control and not annoying. This was all BEFORE I was diagnose when I was healthy. But they only called me stupid/dumb/idiot when I was behaving like one or when the moment called for it. Like I said, I can understand them calling me a idiot/dumb/stupid but what im trying to figure out is would my real friends people who care about me call me this? Even when the moment called for it? It’s not like I was ever doing something seriously wrong, I was just saying really dumb things sometimes lol. But now that I’ve been through hell I had to smarten up to get through this and now I realize that I was being dumb lol.

Both 1friend and 2friend HAVE NEVER ASKED how I am doing with my diagnoses. Have never asked about my diagnosis or come close to mentioning anything about it. Ive been sick for 10 years! And YES they know and YES this pisses me off! It makes it seem like they were only interested in me when I was interesting and fun but now im weird and different. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE FAMOUS FACEBOOK SAYING LOL “if you can’t accept me at my lows why should you be in my life at my highs”. For both friends never to ask about the bipolar makes me question their true intentions with me. 

These were my best friends though and all of our parents were best friends too! We shared a lot of laughs! It wasnt all bad not at all! We through parties and went to parties! But now that im older and more mature idk if these were true friends because of my reasons. Or am I blowing these small reasons up because of the voices i hear, delusions i feel, and impaired judgement i deal with😣😣😣 IDK! AND I NEED ADVICE! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!

P.s. i have been in and out of their lives because of my fight that i have had to deal with so we all havent really been close for like 5-6years. But we all kept contact through facebook. Im just wondering if i should just burn the bridges",17Oct2020,1
684,"So, I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years now. He's always liked a few drinks but he is also very good at not appearing drunk (probably due to the tolerance he's built up.)
He's drinking what I think is a dangerous amount of alcohol which is about 1 x 70cl bottle of spirits every 2/3 days. He hasn't had a single day without at least 3 beers in about a year now and it's usually 3 beers and about 200ml of spirit every night. He free-pours and sometimes I can smell how strong his drink is (about 80% alcohol with a tiny bit of coke or mixer.)
Whenever I bring it up he gets very angry about it because he has never been violent etc when drunk and doesn't think it's a problem. 
I am so worried for his health and also not wanting to be with him anymore because I feel like he doesn't care about our future because he's drinking himself into an early grave. 
He thinks I'm overreacting and this has lead to him hiding his bottles and being secretive about how much he's had to drink. ""One drink"" to him could be a triple unit and coke, so by the time he's ""only had two drinks"" hes actually had at least 6 units.
I've suggested sober days where we only drink tea etc (I drink about 3 glasses of wine a month maximum) and he agrees but won't commit to a particular days/ hasn't had a tea day since I brought it up 6 months ago.

691,"  I am a 15 year old female and I live with my parents as most teens do, I am feeling very conflicted and I'm asking the community of reddit for advice. (Be Warned, This is Long, But I really need Advice..)

I might as well start from the beginning, my mother is from Ukraine, she was the product of a relationship that didn't work and grew up without a father, at the age of 5, her mother married her step father and gave birth to a baby boy. Before the 2 new additions to their family, my mother was given all the attention she could wish for, and was loved by her whole family. This sudden change was a cause of trauma for her and has stuck with her. She was suddenly 2nd place in her family and her stepfather used his profits to buy things for her brother and not her. Her brother was an attention seeker and threw tantrums to get what he wanted as a lot of kids do. Two years later, her sister was born, to this day my aunt is one of the nicest people I know along side my Grandmother, their mother. Their family faced a lot of struggles and this shaped my mother. They moved to the United States after my mother graduated.

My father was raised in a very strict household. His mother was very traditional and very fair. She was also quite harsh. My father learned directly from her and knew if he ever had children, he would treat them the same way she treated him. My father also lacks sympathy from this, he doesn't show much emotion and does not care about anything unrelated to him.

My parents met when they worked at the same company, my mother was in her early twenties and my father was in his mid thirties. Having grown up without a father figure she trusted, she seeks approval from older men so, yah. They started dating after my mom left her job there to not make things weird in the work place. A year into their relationship my mother found out she was pregnant. She was worried at first that my father would leave me like her father left her, which was very understandable. As time went on, the focus of her worries were shifted from him leaving to him staying only to raise me and not because he loved her. My father is a very responsible man and it became clear that since I was his kid, he was going to stay because it was his responsibility.

I was born when my parents were on bad terms, they lived separately and had no idea how to raise a kid. My grandmother on my mother's side basically raised me and tried to keep me away from my parents fights. I got used to sleeping in a car while being transported from one apartment to the other. Or while being taken away from my father temporarily as punishment from my mother. When I was 2 1/2 years old, my parents moved in together and my grandmother was not needed as much anymore. This is when the it got a bit worse. My father was not used to living full time with a small child, and a lot of little things I did, like knock something over or refuse to eat something, got him extremely angry. He would grab me by the wrist and squeeze it until I listened. I can tell you after all these years, I still remember how bad that hurt, I would cry and scream but he wouldn't let go until I calmed down. Another thing he did was spank me extremely hard for not wanting to take off a band aid or go to bed. He had been spanked as a child with a wooden spoon, but since we didn't have one, he used the next best thing, his bare hand. My dad has large hands and is a volleyball player as well as 6ft 2in. tall, so you can imagine how hard he spanked me like he was spiking a volleyball over the net. My mother didn't approve of his physical punishments most of the time so instead he would threaten me with words like ""If you don't take a bath right now, I will spank you so hard, there will be a red handprint on your butt for a week."" As a young kid, that was very scary to me. this continued until I was about 7 and then changed permanently to time out, which was standing in front of a wall and staring at it for 10mins+ not being allowed to cry or the timer would be reset and at the end having to tell them what exactly I did wrong and promise to never do it again, and lets face it, that was way better for me than the previous punishments. They also did a lot of other things, like ground me take away movies and desert but that wasn't bad. And its not like they let me out of the house anyway. The other thing they did from the start was yell at me for anything. And I mean SCREAM. They would get so mad and punish me and yell for hours for not putting my plate away after dinner, or missing a school assignment. My mother, who has seems pretty good so far unfortunately was not the better parent. She screams at everything, everyone, and whenever something is not done her way she makes the person feel horrible with out it and screams, plays the victim, guilt trips them, and so much more. She is an attention whore and will get mad at anything because she feels like it. I have been the person she takes out her stress on since I was old enough to understand. She will insult me for nothing. I once wanted to play with my neighbors instead of raking the leaves and she called me selfish, a disappointment, and a spoiled b\*tch. My father also would go over to my neighbors and grab my arm and shoulder and drag me back to our property and scream at me in front of everyone. When I was 10 years old, My sister was born. Their perfect version of a child, social, smart, and confident. While I was quiet and reserved due to them always telling me how bad of a child I was. From the beginning of school I always had trouble completing homework. With Depression, anxiety, trauma, ADHD, and several phobias, I found it near impossible to focus at my own home from a year young age. Keep in mind I have all these mental illnesses, by the time I was in first grade. 

At first school was a way for me to get away from my family, but I was bullied severely for being quiet and coming to school with the same clothes and hairstyle every day. In first grade, I was bullied by a boy two years older then me physically and verbally. My parents refused to do anything about it, no adult intervened and over time he invited all of his friends to join in. From this I became scarred of guys. After the school year ended, it stopped, but the next year, a boy in my grade who was exactly like the one before, started teasing me. he had all his friends join in as well and it was me against the school. I had no friends, just mild acquaintances. As time went on, I was bullied more, manipulated by girls I became friends with because at that point I was desperate. Eventually, I found a great group of friends after several tries and they help me through my home situation.

It was clear from the beginning that my sister was the favorite from the moment she was born. My parents now had experience and she was better then me with social skills, and was way more confident. I love my sister and I'm very supportive of her. But my parents definitely treat her differently. They get her everything she wants, when she does something wrong, they will take away movies for a day or something small. She doesn't stand in time out often at all, when she throws punches at my parents, they will take it, laugh and move on. I never threw punches or hit them yet I was punished so severely for not wanting to take a band aid off (Pushed onto the bed, held against my will while the other ripped it off and then spanked me). I am very glad they treat her well and I know that they will be a great family, but I am not a part of it, never was. All of the material objects I care about, they never got me. They were from friends or relatives. Even my iPhone 6s was from my grandmother, it was her old phone, but I'm happy with it anyway. I know I'm lucky to have food, clothes and a roof over my head, but my parents have only ever given me the essentials, most of my clothes, I've payed for or they've been given to me by relatives. They only give me what I need and even my toothpaste, shower products, and bathroom products in general have been my own purchase or from my grandmother. I can not be more thankful for my grandmother. She has been a better parent to me then mine have ever been. Every day I am screamed at by my mother and insulted, called stupid, dumb, selfish and many other things. I honestly don't consider myself that way. I've always tried to help people because few people helped me when I was young and I want to make sure no one feels as bad as I do at any point. I still have no self conscious or confidence, but helping people makes me happy. I love animals as well and want to be a Veterinarian when I'm older, but my parents hate animals, despise my interest in them and disapprove of any passion or dream I tell them about. When I stopped playing Volleyball I was shunned for it. I am constantly going through cycles of depression, anxiety and ADHD. I'm not doing well in school due to the fact that I can't do schoolwork in my own house. With the remote schooling caused by COVID, I fell very behind and my parents solution to this was stand over my shoulder and threaten me until it was done. They will get mad at me for baking cookies instead of raking leaves (I do a lot of yard work often, mowing the lawn, raking, picking up walnuts willingly, the few times I don't I'm punished and screamed at) and for turning off an alarm on my mother's second phone that was for her video game, SimCity. There are fights everyday and it is over the littlest things, like being home 5 mins after my 4pm curfew, not putting my dishes away, staying in my room all day, being around them to long, not hearing them over my music that I listen too with earbuds or else I get yelled at, not doing my laundry before Sunday on weekends, staying inside all day, being outside for to long, seeing friends, calling friends and telling them what is going on, playing video games, reading books, not reading books, not being in bed by 9pm, having my phone in my room, taking a nap, being tired, not laughing at their jokes, etc. I'm 100% serious about every one of these reasons and there are thousands more. Every time I do one of these things, I am screamed at, threatened and punished. I cry myself to sleep most nights, sit in bed crying and scarred after fights, and I dream of the day I can leave my parents and move half way across the country. I have 3 close friends that I call when these things happen and of course I get yelled at for sharing information with other people, recently or ever since quarantine started, I have been spiraling downhill and the fights are horrible, instead of being at work, my parents are home all the time, there is no break, no alone time for me, no safe place in my own home, my parents have even threaten to take my bedroom door (which has no lock) of its hinges because the crappy lamp they gave me after the dimmer setting broke that heats up my room to much while on. My 3 friends have been begging me to call the police, call child protective services, and get out of my house for good, get therapy, and medication for my mental illnesses and trauma and save myself but I've been hesitant. For so long I thought this was normal, but now I realize it's not.

693,"Hi! I have 0 idea of what I’m talking about to please bare with me. 

So I moved into a top floor 2 bed (one bedroom, one box room/office) officially on Tuesday (was able to move in before but chose not to do so). I have an economy 7 box thing that tells me how much my bill is going to be. I am aware that I am on a day and night tariff which means I get charged more for using energy in the day, and I get charged less during the night. 

I have been checking my little box every day since Tuesday and can see it rapidly going up. I have managed to somehow spend £22 in 4 days and I really don’t know how. I work from home but I only use my laptop during the day or the electric stove and not much else. I have electric heaters which take energy during the night and release the heat during the day (although I came in at 3am last night and boy was it toasty). 

I haven’t paid an electric bill for well over a year but I know it shouldn’t be £160ish a month for just me. 

My plan now is to change all of the bulbs (if lightbulbs can even affect it that much?) and I am in the process of moving to a new supplier who is literally a few pence cheaper but aside from this, I’m not sure what to do. I am aware that some companies will change the day/night tariff to a standard single rate but I don’t know if this will even benefit me very much. 

Does anyone have any advice at all please? I’m so unsure of what to do and I’m estranged from my family so I don’t have any adultier adults to ask about adult things. 

Thanks!",17Oct2020,1
694,"This is going to be a lot to unpack, but I've kinda got no one else to talk to. Let me take you through my background I guess, I'm (13 y/o) and I live in a third-world country that puts a lot of emphasis on knowing your home language, but we are colonised by the british so that in turn makes English one of our main spoken languages, cool. 

Now,I remember I used to go to a ""PRIVAte ENGLisH mEDIuM pRIMArY SChooL"" when I was in Reception (If you don't know, it's the grade below grade 1) At this stage, I used to speak a mix of broken english and part of my home langauge also gibberish, naturally my teacher didn't understand a fucking word I said. My teacher had to cast my parents aside and encourged them to ignore my first language in favour of English, so they could teach me how to read  english ""easier"". My parents caved in and I was put speech therapy, (I also have a gap in my teeth which provents me from rolling my r's or pronoucing it like you normally would.) so instead of learning my home langauge I learnt english which at this point English could be considered my home language. I understand my home langauge if you speak to me, but I can't really respond back I'll just nod my head because I suck ass at my own language. (plusss... I have very little vocab.) 

Fast forward to post-Covid, I'm transitioned into high-school and it's in a neighbouring country which also uses my home langauge as a subject. Now in primary school I only had conversional classes for my home language or just took French, but never my home language straight. So naturally hearing that there wasn't going to be any French, I freaked the fuck out. I had to choose my home language, I never understood a godddamn thing because it was out of my vocab circle of knowledge. 

Since someone ate a bat we've had to go back to our respected countries and go into lockdown and shit. Then our school did the online school thing to be ""tReNdy"" and ""prOductivE"" instead of respecting your mental health. I have 4 terms (or semesters), so we closed in the first term when it was the whole lockdown thing.  I am struggling with my online class like ALOT. I have poor time management, I procrastinate everyday, my parents are pretty cross with me. So then my mom decided to put me in my home langauge's tutoring class, and I hate it. I am a self teaching type person which is why I never enjoyed the idea school and church because information is just shoved down my throat and yeah, ""thaT's noT my KinD OF thING"" 

The reason I have been stuggling is because of my maladaptive daydreaming, I only learnt about this in like, May or August and told my mom but since she is a ""gOd feARiNg"" person and she has a habit of not listening to your problems and putting a barrier and essentially saying ""YOu KnOw gOd was HeLpEd mE blaH, BlaH hE CAN fIX ALL youR PROBlEMs!"", and It's like good for you but we're talking about me here miss ma'm. I wasn't told my dad because he is pretty distant but really over-protective and has given shit to my older sister for piercings especially her nose one. He went on how ""HoW Is tHe ChUrch gOINg TO see aS YOU kNOw THe yoUNG AdULT YouTh MEn THERE dOn't LIKe WOmeN wITH pIERcings iT mAkes tHem LoOK UGLy! YOu are GoIng tO InfLUencE yOur sIsTer To do The saME ANd i CaN aFForD thAT on my NAME PEroId."" You see why I'm not going to really talk to that bozo. My parents act like their open to you talking to them but my sister and I know they will NOT listen and spew some shit on how God does this and that, this that and the third.

But speaking of rebeling against religion, I am a homosexual more specifically a lesbo. I have a best friend at my school and we are pretty close and I developed a crush on her, but one cavaut tho she pretty straight-leaning but she was joked/hinted on being Bi but I not that sure, and I spilled the beans and she was shocked I guess. She said she needed time to think about it, but when we had to go back home (because Covid-19, that little rascal) but she said she can't do long-distance relationships so then, when my school decided to open on the thrid term she went even on my current term (which is the fourth one) I just worried she won't be interested in me because there's this guy that into her and he been making some moves and since I'm not at school rn, I am scared he might swoop her off her feet I guess.

This is a bonus paragraph, I aspire to become an artist or animator and make countless passion projects, but school has stucked all the attention and motivation out of me making me sit there with barbeque sause on my tittes. I started out drawing in 2016 and I was one of those ""how to draw manga \_\_\_\_\_\_."" beginner artist then I moved on to doing a lot of headshots instead of learning full body anatomy. I hardly draw now because I don't have the basic run down of the fundermentals because I searched ""how to draw manga heads."" and so on. I am so frustrated with not knowing plus having little to none motivation doesn't add up sis. Sure I can draw a decent looking drawing, but I feel like I draw the same things like, a lot of guys with spikey hair and who are white and so on because  that's what I trained myself to do for last 4 years! And I wanna broad my horizon by doing those art studies that a lot of art youtubers do, but I'm stuck in a rut and scared to try cuz I'm a perfectionist and I don't like seeing shitty drawings and I don't to lose interest in drawing because that's what I love, but it's probably because I don't have any goals for improving but I also don't time cuz school. I have tons of saves in Pinterest that I hardly use (for drawing) I don't know man. I aspire to have a unique style that is akin to Akira Toriyama or Kishi Torajirou and write stories like Satoshi Kon, and keep on beating myself up. I see no art youtube talk about this and need some advice ESAP.  

Anyway, I need some advice from some sane adults cause clearly my parents are mental, but shoutout to my sister for being on the same page as me. Well If took sometime to read all of that I want to say Thank You from the bottom of my heart, it means a lot that you read this far (I assume also sorry if my grammar sucks.)",17Oct2020,1
695,"I am smart. I know the way it sounds, I've heard it a million times. I also know that grades don't represent how smart you are but I use it here to explain myself and I know how people react when someone says they're smart, but I know I am and lucky to be.  
However,  I've always felt like I can't build relationships with people who aren't as good as me because of how they see me and how I see them. Don't get me wrong, I have friends but I simply cannot talk about school or anything otherwise, it gets quite bad. I feel like an \*\*\*hole saying this but it's true. I've always been the best in every subject related to science. It's true that I work in school but not as much as I should for my grades, especially in math. Since I was a child I could understand anything as long as it's logical, which is why math is my best subject in school and language is my worst (if you saw my grades you'd understand it). I've always been lazy and never did more than the minimum but I still get the maximum out of it. The worst part is that I'm a b\*tch about it. I am proud of my grades and I love seeing my teacher's face when I get a perfect score in a class where I've never paid any attention. I feel like I waste my potential by doing the minimum because I know I could do A LOT more however, the result simply can't be higher than they are rn. Most of my friends and even members of my family hate me when I talk about my grades out of jealousy and I can understand why. Most of them do ten times the amount of work I do and get results that don't represent what they do. I can only truly be myself when I can talk to people who also are kind of like me and it feels really good not to be judged for once, however, those people aren't truly like me. They either work really hard to get what they have, which is something I respect, or they feel too good to do the work they don't wanna do and up failing (those people usually are gifted) which is something really close to how I feel, except that I am too proud to see myself fail, and this the only time when I actually work hard in school (not as much as others) and still get my grades. I just feel like I am not in the right place. I know I have potential but I don't know how to use it and it's really hard for me to get out of my comfort zone to achieve something in my life. I feel like I'm wasting my time and my potential to do just what everyone does but really easily. 

There's a lot more to it but I don't have the words nor the skills to explain it, but I hope that at least one of you will either relate or understand how I feel.  
I know how all of this sounds and I get why you would insult me in the comments, but I just don't know what to do.

(And btw I am not a 14yo who thinks he is better than everyone else. I've met people like that and yes I've considered that I might be like that when I was younger but I am not. I am 19 and simply don't know what to do with my life)

I’m a high school senior doing my first semester away from my friends in another continent due to corona and I’ve never felt so lonely and hopeless in my life.

I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this, but I need your help.  I'm taking online classes and I was accused from my professor of cheating. First off, I've NEVER cheated a day in my life. I take my education very seriously, and this could hurt me from going into medical school.  The professor hasn't given me any evidence or proof after asking why she think I was cheating.  The only thing comes to mind is that when I was taking the test I was typing in the answer for the wrong question and I copied and paste it to the right question. I did this because our test are timed and I didn't have the time to type it out again - that's it! But it's my own work and words.

My question I have for you guys, does anyone know about VHL Central? Or the artifacts I can research and prove to my Professor and Dean I was NOT cheating? Please, I NEED YOUR HELP!

I am not a user of pornography, I believe the adverse effects are not worth it and I’ve removed it from my life. However, my older brother, before he moved out of the house, was a raging porn addict. My parents are very against pornography, and after what happened with my brother, the don’t trust me to have access to the internet where they can’t see my screen at all times, hence my computer being in the middle of my house.
I don’t use porn, and it’s gross to me and they know this, but still don’t trust me. (No offense to porn users, it just isn’t for me) I have no idea how I can possibly convince them that they can trust me with my private computer.

 I will admit that I am a very possessive person, with my partner, friends, family, job,etc. And yes, I know it's not a good thing to say and something that I should change and I'm working on it, so I'm asking for advice on how to be less possessive about this. 

Now, my aunt is in her 40s and even though she's been in some relationships she's never talked about wanting kids or actually marrying someone . She'd avoid the topic altogether in family meetings, and one of her aunts was single for her whole life so I thought she was fine with that concept.

Now, I have siblings and cousins but my aunt and I were always very close and my family would talk about how I was her 'adopted daughter'. Now, I started college this year so I moved to another city and because of covid I have not been able to go back and haven't been in my city since August. 

A couple of days ago  I was talking with my dad on the phone and he let the detail that my aunt is pregnant slip by mistake. After he realized it, he started freaking out about how happy he is about the fact that my aunt isn't gonna be alone anymore even though the dad is not in the picture. 

I wanted to be happy but I just hung up  the phone and started crying. It wasn't happy crying, to be honest Im still not sure what kind of crying it was. But I felt a bit betrayed that my aunt didn't tell me this herself, that I did not even know that she was dating a guy and let alone that she wanted to get pregnant. 

I know this is something good, and something that she wanted, I'm just mad that she didn't share those thoughts with me. I had been introduced to some of her partners, but not this one, that apparently she has date on and off the years. I wanna be happy because she is happy about having a baby but I can't tell her that while I'm so mad and all I wanna do is cry. To be fair I guess I'm also having issues with that baby completely replacing my relationship with my aunt.

719,"21 year old male in my last year of college. I want to move out of home but my parents aren't sponsoring it. I am at home because of COVID remote learning. Which I suspect will last through next Spring, otherwise I would get support to move to campus. 

My mother is OK, and she does things for me like cook (though I can do these things myself) but she kind of pushes herself upon me and switches between treating me like I'm young, and then ignoring me. My father is verbally aggressive but seems to want to take care of my physical needs. I don't want to bother them anymore and want to leave them alone. I've done therapy, the counselor said to see why my parents parented me the way they did. 

I have a decent amount in savings that can allow me to move. I wanted to get a job, then move, but now I'm realizing it is hard for me to get a regular job (I major in engineering) so now I'm thinking getting a temp job (like tutoring/data entry) and move. Or the other plan is to move right now, then keep looking for a job. What I'm worried about is my savings were made throughout high school and college where I tutored/worked and I don't want to spend a big chunk of it only to return home. I tried moving in September but it was rash and I couldn't secure a place so ended up coming home. 

I'm also worried that if I get a temp job quick right now, then I will regret it since I will have to work it for maybe a year while all my peers become successful in their careers. So it might be wiser for me to work on my interviewing and job search, but I have already for quite a while and am not making progress. I also don't have a driver's license but I can take a road test in Dec and likely get one.

Options.

1. Move now/soon, keep looking for a job, may have to go with a temp job. This is the path that feels to make sense but can be more stressful from the start. I also might not be ready to start a career now. 
2. Find a temp job, and then move after that. Use the time to continue looking for a more permanent career. This option is more prepared, but if my mindset changes in the Spring and I can get a career (I major in engineering) then it might feel like a waste working a temp job for a year. 
3. Work on my job search even more and settle down into a career, and then move. Might take until Spring 2021. This is what I want to do but I might not be ready to commit to a career, which makes it hard to do well on the interviews.
4. Don't do anything special and will probably be told to move near next May/June 2021. Don't know if I will have a job by then. This is what may happen if I keep on showing up in life but not making any firm choices.",17Oct2020,1

Thing is. I’m not nice to everyone. For example I was saying that people who take a certain subject are less intelligent than another. It’s true but some people don’t say it. 

Essentially I can speak my mind and I don’t care if some people get offended. What I say isn’t objectively offensive it has to be interpreted. She takes offence to it when she isn’t even referenced. 

It go me thinking. Do I have to be nice to everyone. Should I not speak my mind when someone may take offence. I’m not racist or sexist etc but some may think it mean at times. But only slightly and not really rude.

I don't want physical contact with this waste of organs. I want whatever statement I make to do two things. Let him know that I'm dead fucking serious, although I think this will be mostly in my facial expression and tone of voice, and not make anyone else around us suspicious or uncomfortable.

731,"So this guy I met in May 2020 online dating told me he wanted to start off as friends, he first told me he wanted to get to know me physically and get romantically involved but no rush, he always denied calling that “ friends with benefits”. I first told him I was looking for a serious relationship and he said he was too but his way of doing things was becoming friends with the person first and getting intimate with them. I noticed that he kept following women on social  media too, I asked and  he said he was looking out to see what’s outthere because he was single and had every right to look at or see whatever he liked but always denied calling it “ having his options open”. I decided to walk away from him after he told me that. He told me that I had turned him off after I was constantly accusing him of talking to other women when supposedly he wasn’t, after me thinking we were exclusively dating, I noticed he never made any plans with me or considered me in any future plans. But he would always call me every single day and text every single day not once did he ever ghost me. Which I find Strange because he made an effort to speak to me everyday and call atleast 3x a day but never make plans to see me? His excuse for not seeing me was that I had pushed him away but he never stopped talking to me completely, he said I pushed back to being friends all over again instead of exclusively dating. He did have half custody of his two young kids and worked a lot of OT so he was a busy guy. I am just confused because he recently reached out again saying to start over as friends but without the drama but yet he’s still looking out for other women? Am I overreacting ? I am the jealous type and I got really hurt when he told me he was following cute women just to have there just in case he felt he needed to reach out. He said that’s what dating is and I was being wrong about my views on dating. I understand that people have a right to see others but I told him I wanted to exclusively date someone’s and get to know just one person not many people. That’s why I chose to walk away because I couldn’t handle that but he insists that idk how to date and I am doing things and my views are so wrong! We had eavhother on social media but then after I was asking him about who these new women were he decided to remove me and block me so I wouldn’t ask.

735,"The flare is wrong, Idk how to change it, sorry.

I [21F] go on lots of day trips, road trips and general trips with other people with my fiancé [21M]. My sister and our friends join us on these excursions!

When we go to a drive thru for coffee, we just put it on my fiancé’s card because they do not take more than 2 orders anyway and if there are 5 of us, we obviously aren’t going to make it more complicated by requesting 2 orders. So everyone will have their meal paid for my my fiancé and I’ll say, “babe, how much do I owe you?” And he’ll tell me (but we share money, I only say this so other people get the hint) and sometimes, they just don’t send him money... and we have to remind them multiple times.

Another example is when we park at parking garages, we always put the fee on my card or my fiancé’s card and if it is $35 and there are 5 of us, we would of course expect each person to send us $7 and they don’t! I’ll tell our friends who to send money to, so I’ll say, “I used my card, send me $7 each!” And later, I’ll see that only my sister sent me money. And when I ask my friends if they sent me money, they’ll say, “oh, I thought we were sending it to your fiancé.” But... his CashApp and Venmo will be empty... so they just didn’t send it... 

If we go to a restaurant end the waitress says it’s too late to split the check or that she can only separate the check 2 ways or something, we will put it on one of our cards and our friends won’t send us money OR they won’t send enough money to cover what they actually spent and they never include the tip.

I have gotten more assertive saying, “you need to send me, x.” But I shouldn’t have to do that. I would never in a million years do that to anyone!

My fiancé and I have our own place and we travel and do fun things so I think our friends think we’re ballin’ or something... When really all we do is save a lot of our money... Our combined income is no more than $80K... We’re like... lower middle class. We pay rent, for groceries, for our vehicles, I also pay for my own education because I have never met my dad and my mom is dead. But also, they don’t know how much we make, anyway so I don’t get it.

What should I say? Keep in mind, we have about 20 good friends but only 6 do this. It isn’t all our friends but it’s the same few.",17Oct2020,1

Yes, it's a miracle that I've had yet to yield to the amalgamating insanity of my life, the spawn of negative emotions, the chaotic echoing of thoughts that reverberates as whispers and voices in my head.

Frankly, my physical self is 'here' but mentally, thanks to whatever it is that's going on in my head, I've become desensitized to a lot of things in life.

I feel like I'm treading on a thin line, waiting for a spark, for something that'll push me off the edge be it in the right direction or the wrong direction.

\- was wondering if anyone else who suffers from depression/bpd have problems sleeping and also suffer from a wave of negativity hitting you in the form of thoughts similar to mine   


I usually try to suppress them on a day to day basis, I feel as thou I'm expected to ""hold my own"" as a male adult, but I break down and cry in the comfort of my own room without anyone knowing.

I've tried talking to my mom, but most of the time it feels like she doesn't listen or even if she does, she can't understand which kinda makes things worse for me sometimes as she ends up saying really inconsiderate things even thou I know she means the best for me.

I've tried reaching out to people, but my lack of ability to express what it is that ails me causes misunderstandings which lead to people generally giving up on me.

I often ask myself what's wrong with me and can never seem to find an answer, I've wondered time and again why can't I just be 'normal'.

742,"This has been ongoing for months now, has had a serious affect on my mental health to the point of making me suicidal and I have no idea what to do.

A while back I was in a Discord server that was a really horrible place to be. The owner and his friends all treated people really horribly, always talking to people condescendingly, massive ego problems etc. I just ignored it and tried to have a good time with people. I was in this server using my real name because I forgot to change it before joining, and as it was already out there decided not to bother.

I was going through a tough time mentally as it is anyway earlier this year. Was venting about things excessively. Looking back on that I can see clearly that it was excessive - that isn't what the problem is, the problem is the way they treated me because of it. I only ever did it when things were quiet, I viewed it as a way of creating conversation, people outside the owner and his toxic friend group were always engaging with it. A lot of it was about my family, things I didn't mean and completely take back now and I just can't tell them about it. I just can't bring myself to do it.

So, asshole mod is disrespectful to me. Saying stuff like ""shut up, no-one cares, you're just a whiny idiot with anger problems."" All he had to do is be nice and there wouldn't be a problem. But, because he was so rude and horrible, I left (a friend later joined to keep an eye on the situation for me). Not long after this, a really weird Reddit account springs up on the Internet, talking about how the asshole mod should resign. Everyone thought it was me, and I can see why - except it wasn't me at all. Over time, this account got more and more creepy - I'm talking posting about wanting to have sex with people from the server. Almost as if someone was trying to make me look like a creep. And wouldn't you know, one creepy guy from the server was constantly spamming about how ""IT'S OBVIOUSLY HIM PEOPLE"" even though nobody asked. His name was Meatball132.

So, I messaged this account using a throwaway. Said ""if you're genuinely a real person, delete this account, because these people on the server are constantly talking about you. If you're Meatball132, please fuck off."" The account was deleted in seconds, then Meatball132 shared the message along with ""he's messaging himself lmao"". Meatball132, along with the asshole mod, were also responsible for sharing a lot of misinformation about me with the intent of starting hate - including made-up stories about me threatening to DDoS people. They created this fantasy that I was still in the server on an alt stalking them, even though it isn't true and they know it.

In comes another user, Error. Randomly starts talking over and over about how he knows what I look like and where I live. Claims to have ""folders of stuff about me"". Meanwhile, every time I posted something on my old Reddit account, Meatball132 was sharing it within seconds - so deleted the old Reddit account. My friend did some searching around, found messages from Meatball openly admitting to installing cameras in people's houses and stalking them. He has the nickname ""stalkball"", apparently. Needless to say, it's getting really creepy now, so my friend reports everything to Discord. They start an investigation on the server, saying they are unable to share what happens because it's confidential.

We all forget about it. I start doing volunteer work for WikiTubia (basically a YouTube Wiki). The owner is a YouTuber, and one day I notice a stub (incomplete) article on the site for his channel. Bad memories come flooding back - however, I think it's over now, someone needs to finish this article and I might as well do it myself. I do so truthfully, for the most part bringing up nothing about the server - until my dumbass decides mentioning the investigation is a good idea. Turns out Discord never did anything to the server or any of its members (maybe because there were two conflicting stories, and the other side were so manipulative they were able to make their story seem just as believable). Not long after the article is done, I get an email. My edits were undone by none other than Meatball132, who had the indecency to describe me as a ""vandalist"".

I mention it to my friend, he has a bad feeling and he logs back in to check the server. They're acting as if they're talking directly to me. Posting stuff like ""that's right {my full name}, we still remember exactly who you are"". Constantly denying the investigation ever happened (I guess maybe Discord just didn't make them aware) and calling me a liar because of it. Turns out in the months I had moved on, they were still occasionally bringing up random stuff from months ago, and acting as if I hadn't moved on.

Without telling me, my friend reports them to Discord again, but I can't shake the feeling Discord aren't going to do anything again. I'm worried I'm not safe, I'm constantly triple-checking my social media settings to make sure they can't find my friends and family. I want to report them to the Police, but I still live with my parents and brother and as far as I know it's impossible for me to report these people without having some correspondence from the post or over the phone. For a few reasons, it'd be effectively impossible for me to hide it from my parents if I did take it to the Police.

I like to think I'm a strong person. I've been through some horrible unrelated sh*t this year.

The problem is, I really don't work well with others. I mean I really, really, really don't work well with others. It's something I am going to try to work on, but it basically boils down to the fact that I have extremely low self-esteem and people interpret that as the opposite: me thinking I'm too good for them, when really I'm terrified of talking to or forming relationships with them for the fear of them learning personal information about me and taking advantage of it. I also have no personality and am very disingenuous (just being honest - again, something I need to work on). So I can't convince people to buy something from me because I sound like a complete phony.

I have background working in basic customer service jobs (food service) and working at credit unions. I enjoy, in theory, working in the banking industry, but I hate handling the money and dealing with the customers. I also don't want to have to make a sales goal. So something back-office in a bank or credit union would be ideal, but jobs like these never seem to come up, and if they do I don't qualify for them.

I have a Bachelor's degree but it's not in any field that means anything in the career world.

I wouldn't mind being a cashier somewhere. The customer service angle is not ideal, but at least once the transaction is over, I don't have to deal with that person on a regular basis (unless they come in all the time).

753,"Hey all. I left my job mid march due to Covid-19. In the past 7 months, i’ve developed severe anxiety to the point where i couldn’t come back to work till now. The only reason i feel comfortable even leaving my house is due to my friend who is able to help me not have any anxiety attacks by just being around me. I want to tell my manager to hire her, as she applied to my job which I am going back to in a couple weeks. Ive drafted the text I want to send this to my manager (whom i am very close to and discuss these things with). Please give me any advice on this situation. Here is the text:

Hey (manager), you know that i really enjoy working at (job) and especially with you as my supervisor, and i’m really excited to come back. I’m gonna tell you something but i really hope you can keep it between us as I don’t tell many people this. Lately I have been unable to work because I have been having anxiety attacks and it was affecting my mental health, and my friend who I told you about is able to prevent me from having these attacks by just being around me as I feel very comfortable just being around her, which is why she wants to work with me at (job), which is something I want dearly as well. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the only reason she wants to work at (job), ive told her a lot about the place and she’s been inside with me a couple times and decided the atmosphere is perfect for her to work in. I don’t want to pester you with this and I know you’re busy but Ive been quite stressed about whether she will be hired or not. If you could give me some reassurance based on her application or something like that I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much, I’m looking forward to seeing you seen hopefully.

Thank you.",17Oct2020,1

Hey, so life is taking quite a toll on me. 

Bit of a description for reference: I'm usually quite a miserable person but still have some nice moments. I find school pretty life draining and useless however I try my best anyway. 
I do usually hate getting out of bed, I'm usually quite stressed, I avoid interacting with most people a lot and I am barely able to smile most the time. 
I don't feel like I'm depressed however I feel like something is affecting me quite severely.

Is being in a limbo between happiness and being depressed usual? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

757,"I’m an American soldier who is in their early 20s, and have been isolated from the chaos seeming to erupt around the world thanks to my orders. I have no real ties to anyone or anything back home, and the time I’ve been away has thrown everything for a loop.

A little over two years ago, I made some of the worst decisions in my life by involving myself with multiple partners and it backfired on me horribly. I cut ties with nearly everyone I had known after everything was pulled into public view, from friends from my childhood all the way to my college life. My major is not something I’m passionate for but I only have about a year and a half until I‘d graduate after getting home.

All the reasons I had to go back to where I was are just gone. I made up with one of my best friends, but he is gone now. The only other person who has stayed in touch me with is one of my exes, and they go between hating me and wanting to talk to me. 

I really feel like I have a target on my back, and have been stalked by another past partner and their family. I’m by all means a loner, but the friends I do have here with me have said they think I shouldn’t go back to where I used to be.

I don’t have any idea or direction as to what I want to do, the last two years have just left me clueless but the more I look back the clearer it becomes that I never once thought about what I really wanted for my future. This last year I’ve saved most of my money after paying off whatever debt I had. 

By the time I’m home, I’ll be out of the service and will have about $25K saved. I’m so tired of feeling like I have no control in life, and want to escape it all. Maybe I’m a coward, but I don’t know how to go on like this. I fundamentally need to and want to change, and I don’t even know where to start? I don’t want to hit the next stage of my life and feel that all the advantages I had were wasted.

769,"A few months ago my roommate lost his job and we lost our apartment. I couldn’t afford anything in this city anymore. My grandma invited me to move in with her and her husband in his house. They’ve only been married a couple years and I’ve only met him once. 

So I sold a lot of my stuff and came out here 800 miles away. It’s an extremely small town, I didn’t do my homework honestly and didn’t know how desolate it really was. I thought I’d be able to get a job pretty quick or get in some kind of school but there’s just nothing here! The nearest business is a gas station about 10 minutes away and they aren’t hiring, neither is the dollar general across from it. 

Anyways I’ve been here for almost 3 weeks now and he’s become pretty passive aggressive towards me and is making me feel very unwelcome. He’s retired and my grandma still works a few days a week. It’s mostly a lot of petty stuff. He’s clearly very annoyed I’m not working. Every time he sees me he sighs real loud and does the little “pfft” thing. I’ve been on indeed every day putting in applications, I’m not just not trying. I haven’t spoken on it at all and don’t acknowledge it, for my grandmas sake. I don’t know what he’s saying to my grandma but I’ve heard him talking shit on the phone about me. Not to bring politics into it but he’s glued to the news channel and makes these side comments on things he doesn’t like, like pinning me to it, comparing me to it in a way. Idek like in this passive way that only him and I would know he’s coming at me about it. 

It’s so tense and I’ve decided it’s just not worth it. I’ve been roughing it for a long time now and I’m ready to pack my car and just go somewhere, figure something out. I don’t have any other family I can live with or friends I’d be able to crash with. 

I’ve got my car and about $1500. Honestly I’m ready to go to any city with a decent cost of living. I can find a temp service or a restaurant or something pretty quick, I’m not sure. But I know I can do a lot better where rent for somewhere decently safe isn’t $1000+. 

Anyways where would you recommend I go? I’ve tried googling and getting an idea but there’s so many places. I’m overwhelmed as it is and my mental isn’t in a good spot right now.

Shes coming out the other side now. Last weekend was my birthday, things got heavy, she led me on then she went off to fuck one guy and sleep at another guys place while I was sitting around wondering what happened to our plans.

Thought I could move past it and tried to see her again, she sat there swiping away on tinder in front of me all day. 

So now I'm at a point of I need to not be around her because my sense of self worth is plummeting and im miserable. So I called her yesterday to tell her how I feel and that I dont think I should see her anymore.

Thing is, feelings aside shes one of my oldest friends. We actually do have a rare bond, ride or die type shit. She practically ended up in tears when I mentioned cutting off and got upset because this isn't the first time shes had this happen and never thought of our relationship as something that could be lost so easily because of how much we've been through.

She has said she will cut out all boy talk and have more consideration for my feelings but frankly it's just not enough. I dont want to hang on to these feelings endlessly while shes off playing. The only way I see them going is if I cut contact. But after sleeping on it I can't help but wonder if I'm just being a petty asshole because I want something I can't have.

I’m a super sensitive person, so it’s really hard for me to tell someone to bug off because I try to be as nice as possible, but it’s gotten me into a pickle with my “parents” (Sister and her husband)

Lately since I’ve been getting older I’ve noticed that they’ve just generally been less tolerant towards me. I know that comes along with getting older but I feel like they’ve been taking advantage of the “I’m older and this is my house” aspect of being respected. 

Recently I bought a scooter, this is because I live on a small island and I don’t have a license so it’s my only mode of transport right now. I love it and I love riding around on and I bought this with my own money that I earned. but my BIL has been using it without my permission and won’t even ask me before he takes people on rides and it really irritates me because he’s usually super nice so I feel like I can’t say anything about it. Despite that he has a bad habit of being passive aggressive about it and saying things along the lines of “good thing you don’t pay bills” My sister has also been getting upset with me because she has just generally disregarded my feelings and calls me a little girl but I try my best to be mature, I’ve even been going on several interviews to get a job so then they will stop treating me like doo doo, but I don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere with this situation and it just makes me feel bad

Yesterday I went out with my friends from school that i haven’t seen in a while. We went to a bar and honestly it was kinda boring like i don’t find it that fun to be with them anymore. then we left at 10 cause it closes early and we decided we would go and buy some more beers and just walk around the streets looking for something to do. My one friend got really drunk and already started being kind of annoying to deal with. we met this guy who was going to an after party and invited us (i know not very corona safe sorry). so we walked with him for like 20 minutes and he seemed normal and to me, he seemed like a funny nice guy. my two friends don’t speak the same language here so they couldn’t talk to him in his mother tongue but in english. and i think guys here just come across as a bit awkward and sarcastic in english. 
but then we were walking for 20 minutes and my one friend decides to pull us both away and just start like saying to him “Now we’ve walked too far!!! it’s just too farr! we’re leaving” and it was just really weird and awkward now we’ve walked with him for so long. 
and i was just really confused. then she started saying he was really weird and she got really defensive. and like that’s fine, i really didn’t mind but she started like getting really annoying towards me and made me feel like an idiot. 
it’s hard to describe it, when’s she’s drunk she gets a bit argumentative and she started projecting her whole defence on me. and it was just really uncomfortable. 
it was as if she was pissed off at me because i had put her in this situation but it was just miscommunication. anyway the thing that annoyed me is just the way she speaks to me. it’s really belittling and she singled me out completely and made me feel like i did everything wrong. 
it was impossible to have a normal conversation about it because she was so drunk. so i ended up just hugging her saying i don’t care, it doesn’t matter about this random guy. it’s just miscommunication. but anyway after that it was just a bit tense and it put me in a really shitty mood.
but we went back to my friends house and then i went to the bathroom and my cousin called me and i started talking to her about what happened. and i just told her how i felt upset and uncomfortable there. then when i got back from the toilet (i was in there for maybe 15/20 mins) 
i got back and they were both asleep. and my one friend was in a single bed, the other on the sofa. and i just didn’t know what to do. i guess the original plan was just to share a single bed with one of them but at that point i didn’t want to be there so bad that it was the last thing i wanted to do. 
so i texted my cousin who lives about a 30 minute walk away and asked if i could sleep at hers. She answered and i packed up my stuff and left. it was 1 am so maybe it was kind of stupid to walk 30 mins on my own but that was just the thing that seemed right to do at the time. i was annoyed and i probably should have texted them and i was going to text them to let them know id left but my cousin kinda influenced me not to just saying fuck them man let them think what they wanna think just leave without saying anything. 
then the next day they text me like where are u and i said i left and went there blah blah. and i had to come by the next day to pick up some makeup i forgot. 
i got there and was planning on just coming, picking up my stuff and leaving. i really really didn’t wanna talk about it. because i think i just needed to cool off instead of saying something i don’t mean. but i went there to pick up my stuff and the one friend who got really drunk really wanted to talk about what happened. and i kinda just said that i was disappointed in the night because we hadn’t see eachother in a long time and it was sad that it went like that. i also said i don’t like how she talks to me when she gets drunk. and she kind of just focused on the fact that i left without texting. which i understand, but at the time it was just the last thing on my mind. but i was like yea sorry i didn’t text, i’m fine, nothing happened, i was pissed off sorry. i just kept saying i don’t wanna talk about it rn i’m just done with it. and she’s like saying how disrespectful im being by not wanting to talk about it. 
what annoys me is, the day before she acts like a drunk argumentative baby and who doesnt care but now she thinks she’s so mature and a good person for wanting to talk about it. fair enough, but it’s the last thing i wanna talk about rn. let me be annoyed at you and take time to cool off. 
but i’ve been feeling very off with them both for a long time, and i don’t think they’re the kind of friends i want in my life. so maybe i was being a little unfair but in my head, i feel really uninterested in them. and maybe this was the breaking point i needed to let them go. because i don’t have fun with them. and she said it’s as if “you just don’t care” and i think maybe i just don’t. but it just annoys me that it got spun all on me, and i left them and now they’re talking about me being an arsehole and talking about how they’re so good and i’m being so childish or whatever. but maybe consider how childish and argumentative she was the night before? you can’t be a dickhead when ur drunk and expect to be normal everytime afterwards. it’s happened enough now where i really am tired of it. 
but i’m in a situation where i don’t really have other friends because i’ve moved to a new city and corona really makes it hard to meet new people. so i’m worried i’ve now gone and left the only friends i have who live close-ish. 
anyway, i would just like to see what it looks like from the outside. and know if i’m the arsehole here. i know i made the mistake by not texting them to tell them i left. also i just wanted to get it off my chest. 
hopefully someone read to the end haha. thanks :))",17Oct2020,1

I'm doing a class remotely, and the professor doesn't send me the assignments + grade my assignment submissions by himself until I email him and ask about it.



Is there anything I can do about this ? I know he's busy probably, but I am a student in his class, so shouldn't grading my assignments and stuff be his responsibility? ( All the other students have received their graded assignments. And I'm the only student attending remotely).



This is weird to me since he was always very polite and encouraging at the beginning . I don't know if I ever said something which annoyed him, and my English sometimes does come out to be rude unintentionally since I'm not a native speaker ( but wouldn't he have pointed it out to me instead of doing this weird business?)

He dropped it so many times it glitches like crazy and it's so old. The battery hardly lasts an hour of use at full charge. And the software updates aren't supported by apple any more so more than two thirds of apps are not compatible with my phone. My parents say I don't need a new phone because my brother was fine with this one. My parents hardly get me any clothes because they say I'm 14 and I'm growing and it'll be a waste of money to get a lot since I'll grow out of them quick. My mom literally gets clothing two sizes bigger so that it'll last much over a year. And they never buy me anything. I have to pay for everything myself. I don't get an allowance I just have some money saved up from when I used to deliver newspapers. (I don't really have time for it anymore because I'm in grade 9 and in the AP program.) My parents literally never bought me a single video game. But they always bought video games for my brother. They don't love him more or anything, they just think that I'm ""more intelligent that my brother"" and I shouldn't be wasting time playing video games. But I already have a time limit for games. I play 1.5 hours on saturday and 1.5 hours on sunday. Anyways I mostly spend my time mostly on learning about science/math.

It's only going to be enough to cover 1 year and I'm planning on going for 9/10 years to get a phd in astronomy. And they never signed me up for any programs. I want to play on a sports team or go to a club but they won't sign me up for any. Even sometimes when I ask for books they don't buy them. They say ""wait for your birthday. I'm just so annoyed and I need to see someone else's point of view on this. Is this normal? Or maybe there's a way of convincing my parents to buy me more stuff. Anything helps, I really just want to hear what people have to say about this.",17Oct2020,1
784,"I have a longtime friend who lives several hours away and continually tries to force me to video chat with her 7 or 8 year old daughter (I can't remember how old she is). When covid started I thought my friend was calling to chat with me. But no. She calls so her kid can talk to me. I'm married and happily childless by choice. She knows this. In my situation, it means that I have lots of friends with kids of all ages and have no problem stopping by their house (pre-covid)/ video chatting knowing the kids are there. They are part of the package, I get it, and typically don't have a problem with it. But I want to be clear that this isn't the typical hanging out with my friend and her kid is there the whole time while she and I chat. 

On every call thus far, my friend puts her kid on the phone, walks away and I don't see her again. She's called when I am at work, she does it on the weekends and the evenings, on a weekly basis (it used to be every few days). Most of the time, I ignore her video calls. Shortly after, I get a text or call from my friend demanding that her daughter wants to speak with me to which I explain that I'm busy. And that works for maybe a week or so. Then she's back to video chatting me. Recently, my friend got annoyed with me b/c she called when I was about to have dinner and couldn't chat. Again, I have lots of friends with kids and this is way, way, way outside the realm of my normal interactions.

Since the ""not answering"" method is not working, the only things I can think of saying to her involve me raising my voice and telling her to stop her kid from calling me all the time. But I need some better wording that will somehow preserve the friendship with her while getting this silliness to stop, hence why I'm here.",17Oct2020,1
785,"Please, if you could help me with this, I'd be very grateful.

Please bear with my backstory.

I (17M) am struggling a great deal with my family.  A little over a year ago I came to terms with the fact that my Father has emotionally and psychologically abused me for years.  Since then, there have been times that I've doubted myself, wondered whether I've made it all up or am simply over-exaggerating.  However, after making a list of everything a couple of months ago, I know for a fact that I'm right - what he's done over the years is abusive.  I don't exactly want to get into all that, because this post will be three times as long if I do, and it'll dredge up a lot I'd rather not think about.

My Mother I have a complex relationship with.  I do love her, and if it was just her and me, I think we'd be ok.  But, the few times I've tried to talk to her about the abuse, she's cried, and told me that my Father ""would do anything"" for me, as if that negates everything I've been through.  She's stood by him through everything, everything he's done, all the times I've felt unsafe in my own home, the times I thought he was going to snap and beat me, the time he chased me up the stairs trying to hit me but stopped himself at the last moment.  I know this might sound silly, as if he hasn't actually hit me, how can I say he's abused me?  In short, all the shouting, degrading, insulting and glorifying of my brother.  In my mind, if my Mother's stood by him, despite what I've told her, if she's refused time and again to put her child's welfare over her husband's actions, doesn't that make her as bad?

Please, please don't think I'm being petty.  I've analysed this from every angle, I've read through Childline's guidance and therapists' articles and his actions from my childhood to now fit all the signs of emotional abuse.  I hate him.  I believe I've been depressed for the last 2 years or so (suicidal for the last year) and I honestly think he's the cause of everything.

My brother (22M) has always been somewhat damaged.  Even my Mother says his brain lacks the capacity for emotion, and when I was little he used to strangle me.  My parents never believed me when I told them, and he laughs when I mention it now.  Though our relationship has improved over the lockdown, I feel the same affection for him that I might the postman - no aggression, but no positive feeling.

Over the last few months, I've made a very detailed plan of how I intend to flee.  When I get to 18, I'm going to change my name (I can't bear to see my surname as his), my passport, my bank accounts - everything, and move to another part of the country.  I never want to see him again.  If all goes to plan, I should have enough money to do so, and to keep making a living.  Please note that I am far from being wealthy, it's just that my job can be completed from a laptop, anywhere in the world.  In a few years I should be able to emigrate overseas - I know exactly where I want to go, and the requirements to get there.

The thing is, recently, I've started feeling guilty.  I'm going to be taking my dog with me (legally my dog) and I worry that he will miss them.  But then I can't leave him with them, can I?  And what about my Mother, who like I say, would be fine if he wasn't alive?  Lastly, there's my Grandmother. She recently lost my Grandfather, and she loves me and I love her.  The problem is, if she knew I was gay she wouldn't love me anymore.  I know some people come around, but she wouldn't.  She was talking about this gay man on the tv the other day and how she wanted to kick his head in.  So, Reddit-folk, please help me.  Can I justify disowning my abusive Father and Brother and the expense of my less abusive Mother and homophobic Grandmother?",17Oct2020,1

788,"There might be a lot of context I need to give you to fully understand my current situation, but I'm mainly wondering what I should do about my plummeting mental health that mainly has to do with money and our living situation. 

I've never had a lot of support in my life. I was a foster kid for some time, but I was able to go back home to my parents eventually. My family is pretty messed up even though I was allowed back home. But I won't get into that. The point is that I can't turn to my mother and my father died a year and a half ago. 

My (25f) husband (28m) is very supportive. I had two kids before we met. We had two more together and married. He supported me through three years of college so I could finish my degree. He is the most supportive person I have ever met. But with college came debt. We didn't necessarily realize how much debt I got us into because we just weren't smart about it. I come from a poor family where debt is used to get by and he comes from a more affluent family who has said to our faces that you'll always have debt and seem to be of the mindset that debt doesn't matter. 

Anyway, I graduated and I am now a 6th grade teacher and my husband also made a career change and works for a cyber security company. I have student loans, he has student loans, we have a truck payment, and two credit cards. 

We decided to do the Dave Ramsey plan and get out of debt. Doing this would allow us to better care for our kids. But we first remodeled and sold our house (only made a few thousand in profit which went toward wedding expenses). We then moved in with his parents because they have a rather large house. His brother also lived with us and he had to move back home too. The plan was to do a debt snowball and pay everything off so that we could move out and buy a house we could afford. This plan would take between 3 and 5 years. 

The problem is that I like his mom, we get along. But she is trying to parent my children. My children have to be perfect for her. My oldest does the dishes and she gets upset when he forgets ONE THING on the counter. She'll tell my oldest that he needs to put things away instead of putting them on the table. 

That's not my only issue. His parents said we could just pay for food and no rent. We just had to help them clean their house. They're not necessarily hoarding disgusting trash. They have just spent tons of money on STUFF. For example, in the piles we have found three antique sewing machines. My mother in law tells my oldest to ""put things away"" but she has PILES OF THINGS WAITING TO BE PUT AWAY. 

The fact that we will be spending another three to five YEARS in this messy house where my son is constantly reminded of his shortcomings is just making me want to roll up in a ball and disappear. It's making me less responsive to my children's needs and as a result, I feel even CRAPPIER. 

My husband understands and he also wants to move out but financially we just can't. My teaching job ends at the end of the year and then I'll be looking again. 

My mental health is the main thing concerning me. I want to be happy so my kids can be happy. Maybe even a new perspective can help. I'm not sure. Any advice is welcome. I want to stay only to get out of debt so that we can buy an amazing house for our kids and not be drowning in debt. But I want to leave because I'm afraid of the impact this could have on my oldest's self esteem. Also any progress we have made in the mess just gets covered again and it's super depressing to watch.

Just. Help.",17Oct2020,1
789,"Need advice on how to report this. The problem is that he’ll know it’s us because my mom went out and asked him what happened when she heard gunshots. We live in a normal suburban neighborhood, no farm animals so it was done with no real reason. We assume he’s the reason why neighborhood cats have been disappearing. We once tried to save a cat that came from his yard who was clearly poisoned and later died that day.

790," 

Okay first and foremost I want to say that I am being 100% genuine, I'm gonna try to lay out all the stuff that has happened to make me question this in the most unbiased manner I possibly can. Because I am seriously confused about my own situation and what I should do. Alright here it goes.

A couple times each year my mom would have episodes we she'd yell, a lot, about the condition of the house and how me and my siblings would never try to pick up after ourselves. There was a lot of cussing and she'd say things about how we didn't really care about her, and how we only wanted material things. My dad would kinda join in on the you should be cleaning up more, but didn't cuss as much.

The next day we'd just kinda not talk about it, quietly do our chores, and after about a week it's like it never happened. And so life went on, it just became a part of existence and it felt normal, I did what I was told when I was told to do it.

Before I go forward I wanna add that as the years went on me and my siblings started to stay in our rooms more. And while we still talked with our parents I feel this is when we started to get distant.

And I think that's the reason why I felt really weird when my mom told me about her past, and how badly her father abused her. I didn't feel like should've been close enough to know that.

But it gradually got worse, in middle school she got a lot more irritable a lot more fast, especially in the morning, and she once during an episode told me that nobody cared about her and then played a song on the Alexa called a thistle and a peck and started singing along to it adding in the words ""and break my fucking neck"". That day when I was driven to school by my dad, all he told me was that my mom ""Wasn't grounded in reality"" and asked if I had friends I could talk to, I did. But that's all the ever told me about my mom's mental condition up to this point.

Then the peak episode happened on Christmas eve when my mom got really drunk and had to go to the ER. The next day was Christmas and everybody acted like nothing had happened, what else was there to do?

She only had one more episode after that, where she told me that me and my brothers were the reason she wanted to kill herself. And that nobody ever listened.

It's been about a year since then and no episodes yet, she's getting therapy. But I still can't help but feel unnerved whenever she shows the slightest bit of irritability. I know she a really bad past, and she has mental issues but deep down I just want to run. I want to go to college and never come back, but I feel bad for wanting to. Especially now because she just wants to be with her children and have a happy relationship. She's apologized very briefly a few times, I can't shake the fear. I feel like the only reason I act nice to her is because I don't want to get yelled at.

But I don't know I could be being overemotional, and maybe it was my fault for not doing my chores all the time. I don't talk to her that much and she's always saying things like ""You do love me, right"" and I should, she's my mom. She needs help and she trusts me, but I don't know anymore. I'm really confused on what I should do and if it even matters. Because all of it was really spaced out, and she was nice in the in-betweens. And she says she loves us and cares about us, but still I want to run.",17Oct2020,1
791,"A friend of mine just said she likes me. We both are 16F, we met in September 2019 and came out to each other as bisexual in June 2020.

We have talked about topics I haven't talked much with other friends, we sometimes make some teasy or kinky jokes with each other. I'm just realising that as much as the holding hands when we go out and the ""girlfriend for a day"" things were just jokes... They weren't.

Tonight she texted me that she's liked me since March. Our convo went smoothly but I didn't give her an exact answer whether I like her back... Because I don't know myself. I have a hard time realising my feelings, I've suspected that she could like me but I always tell myself I'm just making it up. Nobody has ever confessed to me before.

 I feel like I might like her back but I'm worried that if it turns out I don't after I tell her I do that I'll make her feel played.

792,"Me and my other two friends live in neighboring dorms and often we cook study and do other household chores together. So one of my friend got bedbugs in his room so he asked me if he could stay at my place. It wasn't a problem. But now it has been 17 days and he JUST DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE my place! 

I am a person who needs my own personal space and I respect his as well. Thatswhy I try to go out for work or to meet my other friends or even stayed at my girlfriends place for around 7 days but he on the other hand ( I figured it out in these days) stays home the whole fucking time. He doesn't work (he's quite rich) not even has any other friends so he is literally home 24*7. And he is extremely lazy so he can stay in one small room for few days. He just doesn't understand that I am trying to give him his personal space but he can't understand that I also need some personal space and time at least to talk to my family and my girlfriend ( I live in a single room apartment in a dorm so there is literally no private space). 
Quick anecdotes: I feel like he gets kinda dependent on me since one day he needed to buy disinfectant and he was waiting for me to come so we can go to grocery together as he can't speak the local language (google translate dude).

And now I realized that in last 17 days he did buy groceries like egg bread oil but didn't buy a single kilo of meat or vegetable for main meals. Ofcourse I have enough food at my place but I guess this is like a basic gesture you show while living at someone else's place. 

Things to be noted that he at times has helped me a hell lot regarding my studies and he still does. And he is one of the person whom I can count on when I am in trouble. He even helped me with my class assignments or write 1500 words essays when I was chilling with my girlfriend. 

Now I dunno how to tell him NICELY to leave my place coz I need to study and need my personal space. 
Some advice would be really appreciated!

Short Summary: One of my best friend asked to stay at my place but now it has been 17 days and he has no intention to leave.

We weren’t planning on ever speaking again. But, after some time, I want to reach out and offer my friendship to him again.

She fell for him that moment and broke up with me because of it, but said that she'll break up with him once our distance is over and so I agreed with her deal because I really love her and want to be with her someday(kind of a simp move I know). 

I was a the best I could ever be with her, and she was happy. But I guess the long distance aspect didn't work out for her. This happened so suddenly and this broke me, so I went offline for a few days. Her birthday was coming up and I had already prepared for it as her boyfriend so I felt that I should send pics to her anyways, and asked her if she's comfortable with that, and she said yes she is.. and said goodbye. Which scared me.. she said that only when she's suicidal. Things happened, she attempted and went offline, I panicked and messaged one of her friends I knew that she's in danger, and we saved her. Well her friend saved her I guess.. I was just a medium for saving her. No one would've even known she attempted if I hadn't texted her so I was lucky..

Now in the panic of her almost dying on me, I told her friend, which is a nice dude(let's call him A), that she broke up with me for the guy(let's call the guy she left me for L) and A was surprised as my ex didn't tell anyone of her friends. I.. felt bad for telling A because my ex probably didn't wanted to tell anyone about this.. then A tells me that he'll beat the shit out of L for doing this.. I asked him not to, I just want my ex's happiness and all.. and A tells me that they made a blood pact that they both liked her but won't go any further than friends, and L broke that pact. This L guy doesn't sound great on paper tbh, broke his friend's pact and knew this girl was in a relationship and still went for it..

Well.. I still said that not to do anything, and A said he won't, but idk anymore.. I asked my ex how things were going with the L and she said that things got complicated and didn't wanna talk about it.. she sent me a screenshot that he's been distant from her lately and left it at that.

I feel like A did something or talked to L about the blood pact or something.. I'm going to ask A about this anyways, he hasn't responded yet.

811,"My mother is anti vax and I’m scared I won’t be allowed to go to college

I’m 16f and soon I will have to start drafting up those college essays and start applying. My mother does not trust vaccines at all. When I was really little, I believe I have had some or at least ONE vaccination, but I had a very severe reaction to it where my throat closed up, I couldn’t breathe, and I had to be taken to the hospital. I haven’t had vaccines since. Now that I’ve been thinking more about this, I’m worried I won’t be able to go to college or stay in a dorm which I’ve dreamed of since I was little. She doesn’t want us to get the corona virus vaccine (which I’m not trusting right now since it was rushed, but possibly when I’m an adult I would receive it). I am definitely not up to date on vaccines at all, but my parents have an exemption for me to attend high school.

812,Imma 19 yr old virgin never had sex before or a girlfriend. anyways i luckily found a girl off tryst who is 19 as well! she's literally the same age as me lmfaoo. Anyways im curious on what u guys think i should do. The problem is that im supposed to meet her up at this really bad 1 star hotel. The hotel has horrible reviews written that describe how the place is smelly and has roaches and shit. I honestly dont think i wanna be losing my virginity in an environment like that. Since im a virgin sex isnt the only thing that just matters but the situation/environment we're doing it in does matter cause i feel like if i do it in a shitty environment the experience itself will also be shitty too.

813,"I know there a people with bigger problems, but I don’t know what to do, please take me a seriously..

So, I started stuttering around the time I got into 6th grade, but it has gotten a lot worse. Now (I’m 9th grade) it has gotten so bad I sometimes can’t even speak at all cause all that comes out is a syllable that I stutter out repeatedly. It only really happens when I’m upset, nervous etc. tho. (Like when I answer a question in class or am having a fight) 

Last week was the worst I’ve ever gotten to. A teacher asked me something and I got kinda nervous. I tried to say one word, started stuttering, got embarrassed, especially when people started laughing at me (like they often do). My hand started cramping, I got a blurry vision and started crying. I couldn’t stop my stuttering nor my hand cramping etc. so it was really stressing me out. 

I’m always really embarrassed about the stuttering and I really want it to stop. I had a friend who got Tourette- like symptoms after being very stressed and depressed, so maybe something like that is happening to me too? (I was diagnosed with depression in 6th grade but it has gotten better) 

I don’t want that to happened anymore. Also, I’d rather ask here for advice than ask dr.Google and possibly get diagnosed with a tumor.

I was abused when I was a child and as a result ended up in and out of hospitalizations and the school system which fucked me over. I spent a number of my younger years avoiding school locking myself in my room drowning my sorry ass with video games and lots of food. I always refused therapy/treatment since I was a child cause of my trust issues and embarrassment about the way I acted and the repercussions that came along with my actions (I had explosive outbursts and still do sometimes). Eventually, I turned my life somewhat around but it feels like I am in a constant battle with myself. Just when life seems like it's getting better, it becomes worse. Doing things I thought would make me happy never ended up giving me the satisfaction I desired. I used to be obese I thought losing weight would make me happy only to lose all the weight and feel the same. I would exercise every day, I mean yeah, I wasn't severely depressed anymore but I was still not happy. I expected this year (my first year of college) to be a chance for a fresh start but only to go there and drink a lot and fall behind in my work and struggle with my identity in the world. I've always had this fucked up view of the United States, It feels like money is all people care about. Not to mention this president who clearly does not give a fuck about anything besides his own personal gain is making me, an already depressed person with a fucked up view of this country, have even less hope. At this point, I left school and have been home although I am still enrolled in school and am not doing good grade wise and stopped giving a fuck about my attendance. I've put back on like 30lbs in like a month and my sleep schedule is fucked and my entire world is now turned upside down. I don't have the motivation to even get out of the house at this point cause I am not motivated. I am NOT going to hurt myself, but I certainly would not mind dying. I just do not know what will make me happy in this world, but then again I've never been happy so I don't know what it feels like.

829,"I've been through roughly 3 previous periods of somewhat regular meth usage since I first used this drug about 4 and 1/2 years ago. Each time I used I would use meth on and off a few times during the week and would then quit the drug within the first month or two of starting in order to quit while I was ahead...

My longest period of using this drug was December 2018 - March of 2019 and again, even after 3 and a half months of somewhat regular meth usage, I was able to give this drug up before I really got attached to it and thus ""quit while I was ahead"" again.

As of the day of my relapse I was well over 4 months clean and until the day I used again, I had no belief in me that I would ever return to using ice again...

As the title says, I've used a total of about 5 different times in the past 2 or 3 weeks since I came back to crystal. My last usage was a small ""bender"" in the sense of I started using yesterday after getting 4 points from my dealer around  8 in the evening and have been up since and was periodically doing lines every 2-4+ hours until I used the last of my ice up about 3 hours ago...

I don't want to stay a meth user - the last thing I want is to ruin my face, my teeth, lose my muscle, ruin my brain and fuck up my ability to produce and feel dopamine... The last thing I really want is to end up as a hopeless slave to the devil's dandruff of crystal methamphetamine.... I am a college student in my second year, I have goals and hobbies and a future ahead of me so I cannot allow myself to go on using but yet I fear that a future moment of weakness will once again draw me in and I may end up losing my lucky ability to ""quit while I'm ahead"" and fall into a dangerous addiction that would not only ruin my life but would break my parents hearts as well...

I would greatly appreciate any advice at all that you may or may not have for me. Please get back to me with suggestions if you think they may help, I am open minded and would really appreciate the help of the community here to provide me whatever advice - harsh truths included - that you people may have that may allow me to better understand how to once and for all quit my idiotic meth habit for good...

832,"(29, M) I’ve known a friend for around 7 years, on and off consistency and frequency of conversation but always generally amicable. Over the last few months, it’s become increasingly difficult to get a read. We’ve had some good conversations on the phone in this time but more than once she’s abruptly stopped responded to calls and texts. We’ll go months without a response then she’ll say she’s been stretched thin across her other friends. I can pretty much understand what this means, but am not the best at taking hints like that since it’s not definitive what she means. We can talk pretty openly, and so I’ve asked her if she even wants to talk and be friends and that it would be ok if not and she has insisted she does. She really doesn’t seem like the type of person who would not just say so. 

The last time we talked about this was on the phone ~2 months ago. I said I think it’d be best to get on the same page on roughly what the expectation for frequency of call or text for us should be. I felt incredibly awkward but I thought it would be necessary to help us out. She thought around 1 week, I thought around 2 weeks. I haven’t had a response from her since. Around 2 weeks ago she asked me for some social advice while drunk and I did what I could to help. Other than that, nothing. 

She’s regularly concluded my social difficulties are due to some level of Aspergers/neuro-divergence. It’s a reasonable explanation but I’ve never had any kind of diagnosis. I don’t think she’s twisted this into some kind of insult, but it feels like her behavior has shown a total lack of sympathy for this condition if she really believes I have it. 

It feels increasingly pathetic to try, and I’m rather certain it’s passed the point where it’s healthy to try. But she’s really one of my favorite people in the world to talk to. I know asking her what’s going on and asking something in the vein of if she “even wants to be friends” would be helpful only in pushing her away further, but I frankly don’t want to give up on the friendship because it means quite a lot to me. 

Does the friendship mean a lot to me just because of how hard she’s made it? How do I evaluate what the friendship is worth to me? It’s been a net negative with all the missed signals causing me quite a lot of anguish...

Is this something people are prone to do, insist they want to be friends and talk but then thoroughly ghost for months at a time? Is there any explanation for this where she’s been honest about wanting to be friends and really hasn’t had the time or energy to make any kind of contact or response in this long?

There’s a part of me that thinks this is so obviously me being exhaustively needy, or her being a terribly unsupportive friend, but I really can’t make heads or tails of what the situation is. All I know is I don’t take the idea of ending the friendship (or, I should say, ending any effort in it whatsoever on my end) lightly and I’d rather not unless it’s perfectly clear that I can’t expect respect or communication without radical change from her. I’ve tried to be as direct as possible but it didn’t exactly bring clarity to the situation.

I've been told a mix of things, I was even told to yell at her, to put her on her back and hold her down by her stomach and to look her in the eyes, to use a deeper voice, to use a water spray when she does something I dont like, to flick her nose (not too hard).

Since I was thirtexn I sold drugs, stashed drugs and delivered drugs. Back in the day anything went, from going out deliver heroin and cocaine for older people, to finding and picking shrooms to sell to people at school, from there I slowly grew my business and ended up involved in guns, money laundering, robbery’s, fraud as well as drugs. I’ve been kidnapped, stabbed multiple times, robbed, etc. It wasn’t the life I chose but it’s hard to back out once you’ve started. I never really had much guidance either as the closest person I had to a real mum died of cancer when I was 8, my brother was also killed before he was even out of secondary school. I could never deal with their deaths so just went all in. I feel robbed of a loving family.

To say I was a bad person would be an understatement, I just really didn’t care who got hurt, who died and who’s lives I ruined. I’m really sorry to all the people I’ve hurt, it was never my intention. People I’d known my whole life and grew up with were just getting killed, an it really messed with me. I would not rest until I had hurt enough people to call it even. Many of the people I had conflict with were illegal Somalian immigrants, meaning authority’s wouldn’t notice when they went missing. I’m not going to say anything else but some really fucked up things went down which I’ll have to learn to live with.

I started using lean heavily, as well as Oxy which I started using after I was stabbed for the second time. I became dependant dependant and I couldn’t fall as sleep unless I was high. Around this time I was arrested for some serious stuff and was looking at a long time in prison, even though it would’ve been my first conviction, this lead to me becoming low key depressed and I considered running to Jamaica but I beat the case and after that I realised I need to get out of this life.

Several months later and I’m now sixtexn and I’ve managed to somewhat leave my old life style behind, someone has replaced me and I’ve disposed of a lot of incriminating stuff. I’m financially sorted for a long time and I’m also doing ok at college. I thought I would never be able to have a normal life but I sort of have that now. I have a pen which has a concealed blade you can flick out but apart from the that I walk around unarmed. I don’t even own body armour anymore, as I’m no longer in constant fear of being stabbed. Probably the first time ever that I’m living a stable and relatively normal life. So to celebrate I want to try a psychedelic again, now that I’m in a better place I feel I won’t be as paranoid and susceptible to a difficult trip.

Read from here

So, I have a fair bit of experience with LSD but not for a while, back in the day I tried a heroic dose, which was I can be sure was between 650ug and 850ug. I’ve done LSD at a theme park, I’ve combined it with 140mg of edibles and I’ve also combined it with DMT. I had a lot of challenging experiences, especially when I combined it with DMT, the heroic dose was also pretty overwhelming.

Now when I think about LSD I’m extremely cautious and am worried I’ll have a bad trip. I feel it could be a good way to try and deal with some unresolved issues but it’s been a while since I’ve experimented with psychedelics in general and don’t want to overwhelm myself. I’ve got 130mg of DPT but am putting that on hold while I try something not as intense.

I’m thinking I’ll do around 200ug and possibly smoke cannabis to ease the come up and also consume a bit of of 4C-D. Maybe that’s too much though, I’m not sure, it’s been a while since I’ve done anything like this.

I intend to do it alone in my bedroom, so it’s a environment I’m comfortable in. I also have Diazepam incase the trip does not go as planned.

Any insight would be appreciated, have a blessed day",17Oct2020,1

849,"I just found out that when you google my name, a blog account I had when I was thirteen comes up (if you google my name and country it's on the first page). I'd completely forgotten I had it and I hate it so much that I just want it to be deleted forever (it's not \*that\* bad I was just fucking stupid and thought offensive jokes were funny, but I don't hold any of those views anymore and would never say anything like that). I don't have the password or even the email associated with it anymore so I can't do anything about it. I'm almost in tears writing this; it does say that I was thirteen but I still think it reflects really badly on me and I wish I'd just used a fucking fake name or something.

850,"My dad wrote tons and tons and tons. I recently read a paragraph in one of his notebooks that read the following 

“Christianity’s logic bends in on it’s self and contradicts its self too many times to count. I myself being raised a Catholic for my whole 25 years of life was brought up in a system of indoctrination. I was told I would burn in hell if I dare question my beliefs. There rest no doubt in my mind that there isn’t something after this life. There must be something else , it is without a doubt impossible for nature and life as we know it to not live on. But the god described in the holy bible is a tyrant. I sit here and write this as a future message to myself to not change who I am to fit into society and rather be myself. “

*dated* February 20th 1997 

After my dad died I questioned my beliefs heavily and recently left the Catholic Church, my only question is why the hell did he raise me Catholic if he didn’t believe. This message is about 23 years old. Is it possible his beliefs changed or ? How do I deal with this information that I suddenly found out about? Would it be a bad idea to keep reading into these notebooks? Is it possible he left these behind on purpose knowing he was going to die so I can discover who he really was?",17Oct2020,1

852,"So. Initially in my relationship my mother loved my husband. My sister on the other hand has always been condescending towards him. Of late my mother doesn't treat him well either. It's the little things like she doesn't greet him when he comes over. They (my mom and sister) don't even talk to him all that much. 

We have always been a closed knit family. I decided to address the issue and suddenly there are comments like 
"" You have a family of your own""
""He needs permission to come and stay over"" (when I stay over with my family)
""He is disrespectful because he seems very cozy when he sits next to you""

My husband has always treated them with respect with or without me around. So I don't know what the issue is. And Everytime I try to defend him it's like I'm always taking his side. I love my family but lately they have singled me out. So I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here. 

My mental health has been deteriorating for past couple of months. So maybe it's the anxiety that's overthinking.",17Oct2020,1
853,"My sister has always been a really kind soul, but I must admit she's not incredibly bright. Think of your basic pretty girl but a little overboard on the narcissism and a little lacking in intelligence, but she's really a great person. She's vegan, so that's probably all you need as backstory. 

My stepmom is obsessed with anything conspiracy related. Holocaust didn't happen, Jews are evil and run the world, reptilian overlords, illuminati, Bill Gates satanic microchipping people with vaccines, Clintons eat babies and worship Satan, and lately, Earth is flat. It appears she'll believe anything, and I always just shrugged it off and told her you can't possibly know for sure and it's best to not be certain of things you learn on the internet, but now she's convinced my sister and it's just really frustrating. I've tried general skepticism, I've tried asking for verifiable sources, pointing out logical fallacies, I've taken the elementary psychology stuff, but nothing seems to work. 

It's always ""You can't know it's not true, look at this youtuber"" or whatever. Normally I'm fine with people just becoming crazy but now she's at Trump rallies and all that qAnon stuff and I just really want some advice on how to get her out of this rut. I know it's not that she's ""just stupid"" or that she'll believe anything, though. It's just like, a trend or a fad or something. Anyone else have experience with this type of stuff? I really don't want my sister to become more and more radical about this stuff, it's driving away people in her life and it's honestly incredibly embarrassing and awkward to be around her when she starts ""well actually the clintons eat babies"" around people, it was better when she just kept bringing up veganism because then at least she was right about the horrible shit going on in the world.",17Oct2020,1
854,"So. I (F28) have these two friends (M32 and F27). We know each other from what is kinda the same as college (Danish version). I'd say they're my best friends, but we don't talk much about feelings. The guy (M) is probably the one I've confessed most to when it comes to problems etc, but not much. 

My problem is I never really hear from them, if I don't take initiative. Last year I played now and again with M and sometimes he took contact. I hear from the girl (C) VERY rarely. She is also hard to get ahold of. Last time we hung out, she promised me she'd talk to M about visiting they're new place, but then I heard NOTHING and I had to know if I should cancel this dog boarding I had arranged for something else which was cancelled. I texted her several times and not even a ""I don't have the energy"" or something from her.

I know they both struggle with depression, but I know M is much better than he used to be and all this time he often plays LOL with some guy friends. I just feel I'm very considerate to their well-being and I don't want to pressure them, but I've just about had enough. They don't seem to consider my feelings and well-being at all. I need social contact and since I don't have a job right now (don't have the mental energy for a full-time job or a job with people (on the spectrum), so it's not easy to find anything suitable) and I rarely see people through my hobbies (horse and creative stuff mostly), I'm just falling further down the hole. (It also needs to be people I like to ""work"")

I've thought about saying something to them for a couple of weeks now. Since I don't have any other friends I can ask about these things, I'm asking you people. I've talked about this with M before and he told me he'd try to take more initiative, cause he actually wanted to but never came around to do it. When we actually hang out it's very nice and loving. Loads of hugs, boardgames and stuff. This is the reason I'm not just cutting them out of my life with no effort. This and the fact we've known each other for 10 years and I like them as people (which is rare).

The thing is, I can't seem to find a good way to do it. Should I do it one on one (messenger, since we're far away from each other) or should a make a group chat? How should I phrase it? I've just been postponing it untill now but I can't keep doing that.",17Oct2020,1
855,"I'll start by saying that we're all in our late 20s, it's not some school drama post.

Alright so, there is a group of people which I consider to be good friends that used to hangout a lot together for the past 2 years or so, but lately I've been only talking to one of them, and we've been talking every day. So then I kinda started to talk less and less with the other members, few texts a day turned into few texts every few days and now it's been semi dead circle for months.

I talked about this to another close friend of mine, and she told me that I was probably the person that held the group together, so when I started to talk less with the entire group and only talking to only this one person from the group, they kind of stopped initiating. One of the reasons why I started talking less and less with them is because, well, the conversations just weren't interesting anymore, it just didn't feel like they cared enough and I felt really bad for thinking about this because we were good friends and we had a lot of fun together. The other person from this group however, we have never stopped talking, we pretty much text every day about our day, even just random stuff, we always find something to talk about.

A few days ago some of us did hangout together for first time in months, but that was it, no follow up. The friend I mentioned above that I'm more closer with tried to initiate a few times, asking some opinions on some things in the group chat and I was the only one to reply. They later sent a few messages that were completely unrelated to that friend's questions, just saying other things and ignoring the questions, I felt kinda pissed.

Now I'm starting to feel responsible for possibly causing the breaking of the group because I wasn't initiating as much. I mean, even they don't talk among each other in the same group chat as often anymore, barely even, it went from a barrage of daily texts to barely at all.

I'm not the ""organizer"" type of person, I'm a pretty introverted person, while I enjoyed our time together, I prefer one on one much more, so when I heard that I might be the person that held the group together, I suddenly started to feel a lot of pressure for not doing my role in the group and only talking to this one person. I just realized the entire post is a mess but I'm just writing as I'm talking nonsense to myself, kinda shows how much the whole thing confuses me, it just feels like it shouldn't be this taxing on my mind.

Some advice, opinions or similar experiences would be nice. Thanks if you stuck with me to this point!",17Oct2020,1
856,"There is this guy that lives in my dorm building and he teases me a lot and as far as I could tell only me. We had some fun once and agreed it was a one time thing. He leaves me on read sometimes and he went home for a week and I didn't hear from him. I started to think that he wasn't interested but then he sent me pick up lines at 2 am. I honestly can't tell if he's interested in me, wants to be fwb or is just trying to mess with me. How do I ask him about it without it being awkward?",17Oct2020,1

858," So im sorry but this will probably be a long one because of context. I am 23f and I have just finished college and am about to move to France for a masters degree. I used to go to college with one of my good friends (23m) and always really liked him a lot.

At the time I felt like it was a bad idea to ask him out during college due to the small class size. I also knew from talking with him that he had a lot of depression issues (which i understand) and seemed to have problems with his family who he lives with. We were kinda an odd pair of friends because he is a very quiet introvert and I am an extrovert with lots of friend groups but I always felt like he was one of the only people I could feel truly myself with.

So during the college year, he repeats a year while I finish my final year. Because of work we fall out of contact but meet up again at the end of the year party. During this party, we talk and it's like we never left off in our friendship. He walks me to my car and he's pretty drunk while I'm sober but his sister is on her way to collect him. During this time while we wait we are talking and holding hands, it feels like he's going to kiss me but It feels wrong because I'm stone sober and he's pretty drunk (which he never gets like). I kiss him on the cheek instead and At the time it felt right because it to me would have felt like taking advantage of the situation but now im wondering if it might have been taken as a rejection, idk.

Anyway fast-forward coronavirus kicks in and it's hard to meet up with anyone. I get accepted into my master's course. Recently, every Friday me, him and a few friends play games over zoom and afterwards, we always end up chatting together after everyone's gone. Last night he lets me know that he thinks he just might drop out completely from the last year in college for his mental health but he really doesn't know what he wants to do in life, to begin with. He knows it's not what he's studying but he has no idea other than that. Now usually I would tell someone to stick with it but his family is one of those well off but emotionally distant types, so they want him to finish just for the paper.

So with my move, I will be gone for two years but most likely will stay in France near Lyon. I am moving alone with no family but I don't really mind. However, when I told my friend, he seemed really surprised and basically said to me 'so you will probably stay out there?' which made me realise that I probably will lose contact with a lot of people. I dropped a few hints to him that I was looking for a friend or two to join me (which I was) but now im kind of faced with this choice.

Am I a bad person if I tell him how I feel and ask him to come with me? I know it is a lot but we have known each other for about 5 years now. I wasn't going to ask until I heard about him already thinking of dropping out and taking some time to figure out what he wants to do. I do think it would really be better for him to get away from family right now and focus on himself but maybe that's just me? I just know that it will probably be the end of any chance we have at a relationship when I leave in January.

For extra context the friends I have asked about it say either 'do it you're not going to lose anything' or ' he's nice but your too outgoing, pretty, funny ect for him, you can do better' which absolutely infuriates me. I think I just need an outside perspective.

Edit for confusion: A lot of comments seem to think I was asking about long distance. I am asking whether or not I should tell him how I feel and ask him to come with me for the two years. Again thanks for the advice.",17Oct2020,1

860,"I personally feel that I am overreacting. I’m 15f and currently living with my parents. The media looks at my parents as abusers and such but I feel that they are only talking about the bad parts. Examples are that when my stepfather wants help doing something instead of asking he says “I guess that I’ll go outside and once dinner is ready I’ll be dead” I’m not joking about this one. He said that this morning. Not hey you can you help me with this? Nope. Another thing is that my mother always takes his side. Things they also do is earlier this month I told them that I was having trouble with depression, and that it was extremely difficult to wake up in the morning. So now they were complaining right to my face about not being able to have the extra 15 mins of sleep because they have to make sure I get up or I will miss the bus and not go to school. When I was younger me and my sister were smacked around for not having our rooms clean, but we thought that was socially acceptable/ just raising your child. I was kicked out recently due to me making dinner with “attitude” and I was literally picked up and physically thrown out of the house. I tried to take my bike and ride over to one of my friends house but my dad met me over there and said that I wasn’t allowed to take their property. So I walked for 4 hours to a friends house to stay the night. When I eventually returned my mother was taking his side. although I was angry at him for telling me to make dinner for my brother because he was having a temper tantrum, I didn’t think I was taking it that far. When I was in 8th grade I was putting away the condiments and accidentally dropped the ketchup. I was 4’8” and 80lbs and he threw me across the kitchen. I am still overlooking the bad with the good but should I get emancipated at 16 and move out? I’m having second thoughts, but my sister who moved out, she got a therapist and told me that my parents were emotionally abusive but I just thought she was overreacting because we were never beaten black and blue and we always had food and heat and stuff, just we had to ask a lot for new clothes and they don’t give us our Christmas money from our relatives but it’s during Christmas and we usually struggle with money around then so we let it slide.

His partner is constantly telling him his stupid, thick, narcissistic and yells abuse at him daily.

He genuinely loves her to pieces but she reciprocates that with hurtful words and constant argumentative attitude.

She spends 10 plus hours a day playing video games whilst he sits alone with no way of communicating it getting through to her, when she's not playing games she's putting him down.

I never planned to make a move but she recently asked for my number... found me on snapchat.. and  well yeah.

We've already hung out multiple times. We haven't made out, although she has wanted to. I just told her I barely met her and that we should take things slow.

At this point, I was just saying yes to her invites and praying she just wanted to be friends. I'm a bit of a people pleaser. Fast forward a couple weeks and she's calling me every night to just chat... asking for my schedule to plan hang outs... calling me so I'm not late to work. Basically just being very sweet.

She has the habit of checking up on me multiple times per day. Today I was with my bud at work and she sent me a ""Hey 😘"" message. My bud literally saw her name, the message, and his whole demeanor changed. Like he had just been sucker punched in the gut. He basically let out a deep sigh and just nodded like he final answered the debate if he had a shot.

I only say this because I've been in the same situation. It feels horrible. He did keep cracking jokes and stuff, but he felt a little tender emotion wise.

Anyways, I just have the sense he's a little hurt about it and just don't want to continue this relationship if my boy has issues.

We plan to hangout soon and I plan on bringing it up. He does have a long distance GF but it's definitely straining. Especially for a young ass dude, we're both 21.

But we still hung out every weekend just to catch up and watch tv together. 3 months go by and the topic comes up about how we used to date and I say ""I'm suprised this developed into a friendship honestly"" and for the first time ever he asks me if that was the only thing I was open to and I said not necessarily but also I'm not looking to date any time soon because of how bad my mental health is at the moment and how I need to get better in that area before I date anyone. He then told me how he was pretty much interested in me the whole time and even has been hanging out with me more than his friends but he never made a move bc he was too scared of rejection. But then he hits me with the fact that he doesn't want ""more friends"" and I feel a little hurt by it. Like come on dude you wait 3 months to say that shit?

870,"So I have been with the person I'm dating for a while and I've been thinking about taking things to the next level with him but it's going to be my first time. I have a bit of a complicated history when it comes to sexual experiences, and I'm not willing to fully get into it because it's not super relevant to this but my past made me hesitant for a long time to ever actually have sex, and now I'm a late bloomer so to speak and although I think I'm ready to share this special thing with someone I love, I'm scared because I don't know shit about sex.

So my first question is how do you initiate it? My partner knows about why I wanted to wait to have sex and he's been very respectful of that, but that also means that he won't try anything until I do. My first kiss was with this person so I have LITERALLY no experience or knowledge at all. I tried watching porn to figure it out but they just kinda become naked and I feel like that's not realistic.

Second I want to know about condoms. Where/how to buy them? How do I get over the anxiety i feel thinking about how awkward it would be to buy them? I'm of legal age to give consent and have sex obviously, but I have a fucking baby face so I feel like if I go into a store and just buy some condoms they'll be thinking something along the lines of ""are we allowed to sell condoms to 3 year olds"" (obviously that's exaggerated but still). What kind of places sell condoms? Are they expensive? I know they're stretchy so does it matter what size I get? What kind should I get? Are some brands better than others? All that stuff.

I also kinda want to know what to expect. Along the lines of how long will it last and stuff like that. What were other peoples first times like? 

And any other general advice anyone has about the whole situation would be great. I've had talks (kinda) with my partner about this and he's just as clueless as I am because we're both virgins so I just want some advice on all things sex.",17Oct2020,1

In the morning watch a film and snuggle up, then she says she’s tired and I suggest a nap so we nap together to eat and start things up from during the night again, so nothing new, however after 10mins of PG foreplay lol, she taps my arm and says we shouldn’t, let’s not complicate things

I respect what she’s said but i just feel like I’ve lost a potential girl because we live together and I know the risks involved with that

How do I move on while still remaining good friends to her?",17Oct2020,1

874,I (F22) slept with married boss (M30) last year. Since then we continued our relationship short term untill I found out his wife was pregnant with their third child. We then stopped working together and have not seen eachother for months. We have began working together again recently and I have noticed he has began to criticise me and make out that I am being awkward and weird around him. I am almost certain that I am acting like my normal self and had believed that we were getting on really well since being back. I have also noticed whilst around others he is joking and laughing with me then I could make exactly the same joke when we are alone and he will take it seriously and often take offence. It's really frustrating me and putting me down and causing me to doubt myself and the way I'm acting. Help?!,17Oct2020,1

877,"Im an 18yo girl who ****** up and doesnt know how to forgive herself. A few months ago during quarantine my guy best friend and i had been getting closer and closer. He had been like my best friend for 2 years now. However, he used to date my ex best friend who was still my good friend. They had been broken up for about a year but i knew she stil deeply cared about him and they still were in some contact even though he wanted no part. Somehow between late night texts things got sexual and we ended up having sexual texts and pics sent for about a month and a half. I had lots of time to think about what i was doing, and failed to make the right choices. Eventually we met up and had sex a few times during a span of a few weeks in the summer. I knew i was making a mistake and did not stop it. Towards the end i knew i had to stop but did not know how without upsetting him, knowing he could tell people and ruin my life. luckily i moved to college and eventually texted with him less but still remaining friends out of fear that he will telI. I come from a small town and small school. I see these people all the time and hangout and text with them often, and have no real outside friends ive made in college. I have few friends who i value dearly and now have a boyfriend who i love so much. I live with extreme guilt everyday for what i did and cry about it often. I cannot find ways to forgive myself and realize that I am no longer that person. I hate myself for it. I live in constant anxiety that he will tell and i will lose everyone i love because they wont understand how regretful &amp; remorseful i am. Pleasehelp",17Oct2020,1

882,"I’m a gay 23 year old guy. I plan on coming out to my buddy the next time I talk to him. My best friend and I grew up playing hockey together but unfortunately hockey is a very homophobic sport. He’s pretty far right leaning politically. Our entire lives he’s never had an issue making fun of gays, using slurs, just the usual guy talk but sometimes going too far. Whenever lgbt rights get brought up he says “idc if gays want to get married it doesn’t effect me” but has also said multiple times “idc if you’re gay, just don’t go near me and we won’t have a problem”. In your experience, is this just “talk” or does it seem like he’s the type of person to drop a close friend because they’re gay? Playing hockey I’m no stranger to this type of talk, but I’ve never gotten to see if it’s just talk or true opinions. A second question I have is what would be a good way to come out to him? Should I just say “yo I’m gay”? Or should it be a more serious conversation? Or wait for him to talk about finding a girl for me and say “I’m into dudes”? I know it’s supposed to be what makes me comfortable, but I just want the best possible result and for him to accept me. I personally want to have a serious conversation, but I’m afraid he’ll think I’m a whimp for making a big deal out of it, if he even accepts me. To make matters worse, we own a boat together so regardless of the outcome we’ll definitely have to see each other again. It probably sounds stupid but I would love a straight guys perspective on this, especially if you also kind of fit the profile of my buddy. But any advice is more than appreciated. Thanks friends!!",17Oct2020,1

My girlfriend (17f) and I (18m) have been dating for over two years now. However, we have to sneak around her parents because they are very overbearing and strict. Her parents do not know about me and she would get into serious trouble if her parents found out she was dating. Recent events have made us have some close calls and she doesn't want to risk it anymore. 

She suggested we just wait until she turns 18 in December and then we can resume seeing eachother again. We go to separate schools and agreed on keeping a line of communication open through facetimes and lots of texting. Although I'm afraid within the span of 8 weeks she's going to loose interest or the semi long distance won't work for us. I am also heartbroken that I won't be able to see her because we practically saw eachother everyday. I am afraid this will ruin our relationship.",17Oct2020,1
884,"I always loved the mmo rpgs (such as pokemon, hollow knight, really any game where you explore, fight and collect) and i finally saved up enough money to get a pc.

885,"Sorry in advance for how long this is going to be.

I'm 32 years old and have been dealing with social anxiety, depression, and adhd my entire life. In school I was always known as the shyest kid in class and I rarely spoke to anyone. As I got into high school things got even worse. I became so anxious that I couldn't pay attention to the teachers in class because I was so self conscious and worried about what others were thinking of me. My grades started to fall and I was too afraid to ask for help. Home work was always tough for me as well because of procrastination issues and just not being able to get focused on what I needed to do. Despite this, I graduated, and passed all my classes albeit not with the greatest marks.  

I never went to university or college afterwards as I was just so petrified of my experience in grade school. So I took a labor job through my step dad. It paid okay for a kid just out of high school, but it wasn't what I wanted to be doing. I never pushed myself at the job and day dreamed constantly of the job that I actually wanted, something from my computer that I could do away from people. However, out of fear of not being able to find other work or still not being able to handle post secondary education, I stuck with it.. for 9 years. 

During this time, I still had a close group of a few friends that I knew from growing up and I came out of my shell a bit with the help of alcohol. I had a few relationships that all lasted no more than 3 years. They all ended in pretty similar ways with the other person getting tired of how shy and / or unmotivated I was. I've always taken these breakups pretty hard as I feel that because of my mental health issues I can't be the person that I see myself as, and this is the cause for a lot of the failures in the relationships.

At age 26 I finally had hit rock bottom. I had racked up 10K in credit card debt, could barely pay my rent for the month (I was living with the close friends mentioned earlier) and I needed to do something. The job that I had really always wanted to do was internet marketing. I had attempted it a few times previously with only minor success, but I gave it one final attempt. This time, along with some dumb luck, I had started making money from it. And it kept growing. I was ecstatic.  I paid off all my credit card debt, built a savings account, and turned everything around in a matter of a year.

Around when this was happening, I had just met another girl. Our relationship grew, and we moved in together. We had so much in common, and made plans to travel the world together. She was still in university for the first 3 years of our relationship and so while we did travel a few times, a majority of the time was spent with me working at my job from home and her going to school. 

By about that 2 year mark I was making good money, even while not actively working on growing my business. Even still, I started to become complacent with the relationship and was withdrawing from social interactions quite a bit more. I kind of felt that I was waiting for my gf to finish school and then we could go travel or do what we really wanted. I hadn't realized that I had even become so lazy until she finally brought it up around the time she finished university. It was a bit of a shock to me, and a wake up call. I told her I hadn't even realized what I had become and that I wanted to make things better. I started going to therapy once a week to get help with my mental health issues that had started to creep back into my life.

Things started to improve again in our relationship and I was hopeful that we were headed in the right direction. My gf was having difficulty finding any work with the degree that she had just went to school for. I encouraged her to stick with it and that even if we needed to move to another city we could try that. 

Through suggestions of her friends, she applied for a job that was across the world in another country that would allow her to travel and work at the same time. I was supportive although internally worried what it would do for our relationship. She applied, not expecting much, and heard back. She ended up getting the job and decided to move across the world. It was only supposed to be a job that lasted a year and a half and it seemed like we could make it work. Things were going okay in our relationship at that point (looking back now, that was pretty naive of me)  and we decided to try long distance. We would both move out and I would travel the world doing my job remotely while she tried this job for the year and a half.

In this first year apart we would video chat nearly every day. We were both enjoying ourselves and growing stronger together despite the distance. I ended up flying to her to visit and her job ended up taking her to places I was traveling and we met up a few times. It was great. 

During this time, I had also started investing (speculating in stocks might be more accurate) hoping I could make an even better life for us. I had initial success and foolishly took too many chances and ended up losing a fair amount of money overall. I had also been having trouble with some companies that I was working with the previous year (one in particular) who weren't paying for work that I had already completed for them. Work had also started drying up for me and things we declining quickly. I never ended up getting the money and the triple whammy blow to my savings and revenue was devastating to me. 

I ended up flying home after about 8 months of travel. I moved in with my grandma to save some money and learn programming online to make a career change that might help get me back on my feet. My girlfriend was aware of everything that was going on and was supportive of the idea. I gave her a rough plan that I would learn for 6 months and start applying for a job (I wasn't a complete beginner). I grinded away every day learning as much as I could until it came around that time to start applying for jobs. And I did, I had applied to a ton of jobs but didn't really have much experience to really show off to land something. Deep down, I also knew that I was too shy to go for an interview or get a job like this even if I was able to. This was around October. 

My girlfriend came home to visit and we spent two weeks together. Again it was perfect and hard to see her go. We made plans to meet up again in November and I flew to meet her for a few days. Again, we had a great time together. In our chats afterwards and towards Christmas, I was starting to lose hope with the job hunt and she was showing signs of disappointment that I was still living with my Grandma. 

I was disappointed with myself but also paralyzed with worry of what to do next. I was still seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist biweekly but I was showing no progress. To add, I've also gone on and off a list of just about every antidepressant and antianxiety medication out there with no help since I graduated high school. 

We kept in touch often but not every day like we had in the past. Then Covid happened. She was not working because of that but not fully laid off and was going through periods of wanting to come home and being unsure of what to do. I was still having no luck and felt so trapped in my situation and my mental health just kept declining. 

She finally decided that she was going to resign and come home and she began making plans for the future with me. I was beginning to build some hope and was excited that she would be back home for good. 

That was until just after my 32 birthday. She was to be coming home in a few weeks time and out of the blue texted me saying she was unsure about how she feels with everything. I didn't know what she had meant and she hadn't really expressed any concern with our relationship since I hit that wall in the job hunt which was 6 or 7 months prior. I called her a few days later and she said she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore and she wasn't going to change her mind, it seemed weird to me and I asked if there was someone else. She denied it and said there was no point in meeting someone as she was coming home in a couple weeks anyways. 

Either way I was completely devastated. I told her we needed to see each other in person before she made a final decision and she said she would meet but wasn't going to change her mind. I decided to just give her some space but was confident she would talk to me when she got back. But I never heard from her.

I was so depressed and crushed completely. I didn't sleep at all. I messaged her a few weeks later and said I wanted to see her. Once again she said she would but didn't want to give me false hope. After questioning her a bit, she finally spilled that she had started seeing someone around my birthday. Turns out this guy is a pilot from a country we had planned to visit together. She has since flew over there to meet him and that is all I know. I'm now all alone. 

It feels like I've wasted 6 years of my life and come out of it all losing absolutely everything. She has just moved on like we never even knew each other and I'm stuck here still living with family. I feel so disappointed with myself that I couldn't even change my situation for the one person that meant the most to me. 

I'm being discharged from therapy because I haven't made enough improvements in my life (I've been trying). My business is worse than it has ever been because of Covid. I can't see myself getting a programming job and keep getting discouraged. I don't sleep, and I worry 24/7 about what I'm going to do about my situation.

I've become angry and irritable and am treating my family like crap. They want to help but don't know how to. I want help, but I don't know what I need, or who to go to anymore, or what I should be focusing on. My parents are getting older and I feel like this is wearing on them like crazy and I don't want to waste the later years in their lives seeing me unhappy, and I'm also so scared of them passing away. I'm scared of absolutely everything and paralyzed by fear. My friends are all in serious relationships and getting married and having kids. I feel completely abandoned. When I apply to jobs, I'm scared to reply to any responses, I'm scared to answer phone calls, I'm scared to do anything on my own.

I feel like I've tried everything. It's kind of weird because I've been exercising for the last year in anticipation of her coming back and am in the best shape of my life, I have a healthy diet, I've tried setting goals and building up small habits, I've tried medications, therapy, breathing, being with friends, meeting new people, nothing seems to help. 

Things are continuing to go downhill and I feel so lost on what to do. I don't even know what to specifically ask for advice on because there are so many things going wrong that I can't get under control. It's been months now and I still think about my ex and what happened every day.",17Oct2020,1

887," I have a dilemma so, I have a female friend I knew for a lot of my life and recently I've started to like her but due to a cliché she likes my best friend so, this is where the problem lies she asked for me to link them up. I knew she liked him for a while so before she asked to link them up I would always ask my best friend subtly what he thought about her, well his response was something like this ""dawg nah she rhell fucking ugly"" translation he didn't and doesn't like her.
 A couple of days later we are smoking a joint at his house and he asks if I have any girls I can link on him. You can see where this is going I link them up but the problem he is going try and most likely fuck her and leave her, my jealousy took over and linked them up knowing he would break her heart and it would give her proper taste in guys, let me explain he is the classic stereotypical asshole teen best friend. He got the grades and athletic ability and popularity but those things gave him a huge ego, he makes fun of most things I like, like anime and shit, makes fun of the way I dress even tho he knows I'm both poor and don't like wearing designer (just not my thing). She is the typical teen girl who likes popular guys who don't give anyone else a chance but it's her choice, I don't like her anymore if she isn't smart enough to see what he is going to do even tho I hinted at his intentions towards her. So I ask you Reddit should I help her or let her learn this harsh lesson. IMO they are perfect for each other he is an asshole and she is naíve with bad guy taste. The sad part is both of them are great people, they need to be hit with reality.",17Oct2020,1

At the moment Ive been consuming a lot of simple carbs and a fair amount of proteins and other nutrients, ive been tracking my calories and I've been eating 1,600-1,700ish each day for the past two weeks. How much calories should I eat on my rest days?",17Oct2020,1
889,"Quick facts:

1. I work in substance abuse treatment. Currently, I manage a men's halfway house for guys going through drug and alcohol issues.
2. The agency I work for has three halfway houses: My house (10 beds) a 2nd men's (13 beds) and a woman's house (11 beds).
3. I've been in my role for a little over two years. The manager of the women's house (AD for the rest of this post) has under a year in her role, and the manager(BS) of the other men's house has less than a year as well (formally, he had been the assistant manager there, so he does have additional experience)
4. Each house has an assistant manager. The man (MC) in that role at my house has been with the company longer than any of us. The other men's house has had their assistant(PL) for a little over a year. The women's house assistant manager(SS) has not been in her role very long.
5. All of us are in some degree of recovery from either drugs or alcohol. The lengths of our sobriety vary considerably.
6. There has been a lot of staffing changes here since I arrived. My current supervisor is the 6th person to serve in that role since I arrived here. We were slated to merge with another agency at the beginning of 2020. Unfortunately, our CEO who is now essentially retired, caused the merger to derail. An official cause was never communicated, but my suspicion is it had something to do with his notoriously difficult personality. 

The situation:

1. BS wants to return to school. He has asked to step down from his position and take a position of lesser responsibility with the agency. They are planning to send him to my house to work 3rd shifts here (all of the houses have 24hr-staffing).
2. They have asked me to take over his position.
3. Additionally, they are planning on sending AD to take over my current role, while SS will take over as lead in the women's house. 
4. PL and MC are not involved in this shake up.

Why this is a terrible idea:

1. MC is pissed. He is a little under 50 yrs old, has a bachelor's degree and close to 30 years of sobriety. He is NOT capable of managing the house in the lead role. He can be kind of scatterbrained, and I personally think there is an undiagnosed learning disability there. Regardless, he does his job, he works hard and him and I have a good working relationship. He was never consulted or even asked about his thoughts on this. Part of his frustrations stem from being expected to work under someone with less time at the company and less education. 
2. AD is unlikely to succeed in her new role. She is a lovely person, capable and hard working, and a helpful asset in her current role. Her gender in no way precludes her from being successful. I actually took over for a woman when I took this job. However, this is a client base that can be manipulative and I fear that she is not going to be ready to manage these clients. Also, this is rehab and we have to get weekly urine samples. They have to be supervised urine samples. This starts to get a little grey, as it's my understanding that a male staff is never allowed to supervise a female client providing a sample, but it's not as clear cut when it comes to a female supervising a male client. That is going to cause additional issues. 
3. MC plans to leave because he feels slighted by them not even considering him for any higher level role. 
4. If MC follows through and does leave it will look like this:
   1. 13 bed house men's house - I'll be the manager, PL will be my assistant.
   2. Women's house will be SS in the manager role with no one initially serving as her assistant manager.
   3. AD managing the 10-bed men's house with no one serving in the assistant at first.

Also, I don't think I'm long for this role. I would like to build from here, further my credentials (I have a master's but its only slightly related. I had not planned on working in substance abuse treatment until I found myself abusing substances) and move into a private practice role. 

One more detail: Because there are far fewer female only houses in this state, female clients are granted a six-month stay while male clients are only given 90-days. That first month for the men is huge because they often come here without ID, money, job, a place to live, a car, etc. They often times also have probation from the courts or they are facing new charges (The charges are often what I just call ""doing drugs crimes"". So possession, theft, burglary, disorderly conduct, things of that nature. Not felonious but still something they have to deal with. While at the women's house the first month they aren't allowed to work, they are expected to just focus on recovery. 

There are too many gaps, too many staffing issues and too many realities that in my opinion are going to prevent success. Should I make an attempt to explain my concerns to my manager, or do I just go with the flow and start planning my departure?",17Oct2020,1
