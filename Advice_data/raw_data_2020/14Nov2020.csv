0,So I accepted this job and gave my resignation with my current job. It was the same job in another city for less money. I was confidant it was the right decision. Found out that my schedule wasn’t what I thought It was and than the people i were moving there for were leaving. I went back to my old job an hour later and took back my resignation and I just feel stupid. Maybe I should have moved? Anyone else make decisions in the heat of the moment ? Might make me feel better.,14Nov2020,1
1,"I've never had a great relationship with my mom, to the point where her attempts at physical affection repulse me and make me incredibly uncomfortable. It's really hard to just sit there and take it and afterwards I feel very upset and angry, and compulsively wipe away where she kissed me. She does this fucking shit where she'll come up behind me, grab me around wach shoulder or my ribcage and koss me on the neck or the head or some shit. She was neglectful of myself and my sisters and had basically no maternal instinct and now she just grabs hold of me and does it.  I apologize for the swearing, but even talking about it makes me livid. 

Can someone please tell me how I can tell her it rebothers me and want her to stop doing it?",14Nov2020,1
2,"I’m a guy, 17 from the UK, and I’m in a relationship with another guy from my school. We message every day and it’s normally quite PG but occasionally he likes to get a bit... frisky. 

As you can probably tell, I have absolutely no idea how to respond to any of his sexts and normally whenever I do it just ruins the mood. I really want to sext with him but I’m just so bad that he has to stop me talking (probably because I’m embarrassing myself).

Does anyone have any tips or advice on what to say?",14Nov2020,1
3,"First post on this subreddit.

I have three kitties. They are all rescues. Two I raised from kittens the last walked up to me on the porch demanding food and took the next 1.5 years to let me cuddle him for maybe 1 minute. They are all indoor outdoor because they bum rush the door and trip me when I try to go out. I'm disabled.

I noticed my neighbor (porches are next to each other) had a lasagna disposable pan full of kitty kibble and a plate with canned food remnants on it. I asked him about it since two of nine are currently on diets (feeding times no free flow food). He denied I was seeing cat food. He denied owning animals ""I don't have animals so I don't need to feed them"" when he owns chihuahuas he then picked these two things up and took them in the house.

My worry is that two of my boys have been vomiting recently. They do not have hairballs. I worry that this avid gardener (his plants are everywhere and beautiful) is mad about one of my boys using his plants as a toilet and instead of talking to me he's taking things into his own hands.

I leave food on the porch since my newest rescue isn't comfortable eating indoors. I keep trying (feeding everybody at the same time so he a sees this and might get the hint) to no avail. He has also resisted the idea of kitty box training.

What can I do?",14Nov2020,1

9,"So I work with this girl who’s only worked with me for like 4 shifts and after each shift we’ve hung out and grabbed drinks and we’ve had a couple really deep talks where she’s told me some serious stuff and I’ve told her stuff I don’t normally tell people (especially only knowing them as long as I’ve known her). I love hanging out with her and we’ve hung outside of work a time or two so far. 


I don’t really get the vibe that she likes me more than a friend but at the same time when I mention a girl being cute or anything like that she kind of brushes it off and isn’t that responsive to it. Like last time we went to one bar and I told her I had my eyes on this girl and she didn’t really say much then asked if we could go somewhere else. On the other hand she’ll tell me about the guys she’s talking to and how she’s traveling a different state to see a guy (which I play cool on but I’m crushing on her a little so it’s definitely a little tough to hear lol) is she just jealous of me talking about other girls or is she really interested?",14Nov2020,1
10,"TL;DR - not sure whether to return home or not - got an important exam coming up but afraid of catching COVID where I am.

So, currently renting in a friend's flat in London, and I've been making use of the communal study space there to revise for an important software engineering exam I have coming up. However, of course, due to COVID restrictions/2nd lockdown, these spaces have been closed. Quite by chance I've managed to get free communal office space courtesy of the GLA, due to competing in hackathons (virtual/real) in London this year and last year. This space has been useful to revise/work in, and remains open (socially distanced, cleaned etc) despite the lockdowns for other office spaces. However, I'm not sure how long I can continue using this space safely as not all people are following restrictions - some people are taking off masks, sitting next to each other and I have heard a few coughs, though none from anyone particularly close to me.  


I'm thinking I should probably leave to avoid catching COVID - currently using a communal lift to get up to the flat, plus the communal office space. I'm thinking of going back to my parent's house, where it's at least safer, but I'm also worried about potentially losing my focus/concentration once I get back (my parents can be loud/distracting), and this is a really important exam for me. Really unsure what to do, and I have to make the decision asap or I'll be roped into paying for another month's rent. Any advice appreciated.",14Nov2020,1

I can’t walk half a kilometer without being completely drained of energy, and I have almost passed out in the shower before too, almost, because I had to lay over the side of the shower tub for several minutes to rest and luckily didn’t loose consciousness.

12,"Anyone, lawyers whoever, I need your help. Last Tuesday (Nov, 4th) I dropped my phone into a bucket of water and had to get a new one. I bought a new one from a store that had pretty good reviews in New York (I'm in Pennsylvania). I paid more for 2-day shipping. I only received the phone yesterday (Nov, 13th) very late. I take it today to be activated and my provider said it was blacklisted (it was reported missing or stolen). I inform the store this, they tell me to check the IMEI numbers on the providers website and it did say the phone was good it be activated. I ask them if they could refund the money back, that I don't want the phone, they said no that they can only exchange it, I don't want another phone from these guys. I call my provider and ask them about the activating it and that the website said that it was good, and we tried to get it on, but it is blacklisted and there's nothing they can do, understandable. I call back the store i bought it from, I tell them what the provider said and they said that they can get it turned on they done it millions of times. That doesn't sit right because the phone has to be in fact stolen, so they really shouldn't do that, and I don't want to be in any drama being caught with a stolen phone. So I said that i'd send the phone back to them, and ask again if they could please just give me my f\*\*\*\*\*\* money back.

14,"I do not even know where to start ...
My fiancé (M) parents had one foster child a few years ago and shared the responsibility for 3 years, before she was sent away by my mother-in-law because she did not handle the responsibility.

 Meanwhile, my in-laws decided to divorce. Which seemed to fo well.
My father-in-law decided to take the foster child back into custody without discussing it with my mother-in-law. Something we thought was not a smart move, and of course she felt stabbed in the back by it.

In any case, the foster child was brought back to the family.  Me and my fiancé were completely neutral and did not know anything about the situation at the time, other than that we had been asked to function as a relief home, which we answered yes to.

Then out of nowhere hell begins to happen.  
My brother-in-law and his girlfriend invited the whole family to a meeting (except for me, I was not allowed to join). And demanded that the foster child had to be sent away back to intention, and that we all had to block the child from social media. Because the child had a bad influence (which is not true, he has met the child twice and the second time he asked her to packing her bags, because no one wants her and no one likes her). In addition, he starts talking about me and the relationship with the foster child.  for I am obviously her ""makeup friend"", and that I am therefore not to be trusted, and that my fiancé also had to think about who he had become engaged to (we have been together 5 years).
 
This went on for a while, they had 2-3 more meetings to discuss me and the foster child, but the family did not understand the problem.
Then, my mother-in-law chose to block the foster child so she could keep in touch with her son.  The ultimatum given to the rest of the family from my brother inlaw, was that if we did not block the foster child from social media, and threw her out of the family.  we would be banished by him, and would  not have any contact with his future child to come.  (no one knows to this day, why this was a problem)

The months passed and family members became more and more included in the family, despite that the foster child still was a part of the family. Besides of me and my fiance.  now they obviously have a problem with me.  And has come up with the ultimatum that I have to disappear from the family our else my fiancé will not be allowed to be with his own brother or nephew (whom we still have not met).  My brother-in-law even came to the door of our house to tell me that I could go to hell, and that I have to leave my fiancé.  He has also gone to mutual friends of ours, and tried to talk badly about me but has not succeeded.  
Then if any one defended me he would  block them. Whitch he eventually did to all his friends who have defended me in the situation.

I still do not know to this day what I have done wrong. The only thing i know is that he does not understand how we could agree to be a relieve home without having discussed it with him and his girlfriend first.  I have also been told that I have talked bad about them, something I do not have.  the only thing i have done is that i expressed ""concern"" about what it would be like to suddenly become a family man ... something that was never meant to be an insult. But more like friendly smaltalk.

This has been going on for a year now, and I have no idea what to do with it.  I have received threats from both my brother-in-law and his girlfriend. I am starting to get paranoid about what they will do next.  at the same time I feel unsure if I have done something wrong at all. I can not understand what it could be.

I need some tips, the only thing I have managed to do, is to get them to join in therapy, but I am not allowed by them to participate in the meetings ...

Ask me any questions, this was basically the short version of the story... and I'm sorry for my bad English.",14Nov2020,1
15," Hello, reddit.

I'm here because I'm curious of the VPN that my work uses. First of all, I work as a support for a company which I won't mention. I work from home and I think there aren't any chips planted to track the PC's.

Although, I'm not really familiar with VPN we need it to gain access to an app that counts our working time, breaks etc... (it's already on the computer). I've managed to figure out I guess that when you connect to the VPN you are transfered to the office? I'm not sure though.

I'm just wondering if I could work somewhere more far away from the office or would it not be possible? As I have to go back to my home which is around 100 km's from the office. Would this manage? Would they able to track me? How does VPN exactly work?",14Nov2020,1

17,"Hi everyone! I’m 19(f) and my girlfriend’s (19f) family is absolutely awful to her. We’re been dating for a little over a year and a half and we recently moved in together a few months ago.

As much as in the beginning I liked her family for the most part (mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom, siblings) I’ve recently become increasingly frustrated with how they treat her. I moved into her mom and stepdads house when quarantine started because I was going to university in the city that she’s from and my family lives about 5 hours away. During the few months we lived there I saw her mom verbally abuse her multiple times, refuse to believe that her daughter (my gf) has mental health issues and basically just be a terrible person. On top of that her stepdad is just an absolute meat head of a person with terrible anger issues. Honestly it was a little traumatizing to live there to say the least. After a few months my parents came and rescued us and now we’re living in our own place. 

On a different note, I never really met her dad, stepmom and siblings very much because my gf grew up with them being in and out of her life. Her dad favourites her siblings that he had with his new wife and basically never paid much attention to my gf when she was young. She has a lot of resentment towards them. She’s been trying really really hard recently to build a relationship with them now that she’s older and not living in a toxic environment with her mom but they honestly make it so hard for her. She posted a happy birthday picture on Instagram for her sister today and had a joking/sarcastic caption with it and apparently her sister was a little brat and told her dad it upset her and now my gf’s dad is texting her yelling at her that she’s a terrible sister and that her sister is sobbing and that she’s a horrible person. 

I would never tell my gf not to have a relationship with them but honestly they’re the most toxic people I’ve met in my life and I can’t stand that they keep setting her back in her mental health recovery. What do I do?",14Nov2020,1

19,"Hi... i recently got my left forearm tattooed ... and ... in the design i reference 4 people that even if things go i would never abandon in my life. 
Those people being my aunt ( person who raised me from very little), my uncle (since he was also there... he is different but he is there), my mom and dad (even though i haven’t grown up with them i still love them).
And in this design has i said i reference all of them.
So... i got my tattoo 3 days ago... and i haven’t told anyone about it besides my cousin (witch is like a brother to me).
So yeah ... i got the tattoo and i am now in this state of mind where i am just feeling depressed because for some reason i have this feeling of guilt that i should have told my aunt about the tattoo... and also i have this feeling of pride that i finally done something i’ve wanted for more than 10 years now.

*Cut*
-Btw after the tattoo was finished i showed it with pride to friends, gf, mom, etc... but now my aunt ... witch i dont know why i didnt even talked to her about this ... i mean she has always been there for me...
(sry for the lose ends of this story but im not feeling that good atm)
When i was a kid i didnt had much friends, i didnt live with my parents because of drug addiction.
I lived with my aunt and uncle for all my life.
While i was growing up i tended to not express my feelings at all even to my aunt.
I play games a lot because i feel i can escape reality and all my negative thoughts.
When i was little the 2 families ... my Father family witch includes my aunt and uncle and my Mothers family always fought because of me since i was the first born grandson of a generation ....
Sow ... yeah ... im messed up ...
*Cut*

Sow ... today i showed her the tattoo and ... has i expected she felt a little “betrayed” because i didnt tell her prior... uhhhh!
She said the tattoo was pretty and said she understood the design but it was to big and was somewhat disappointed with me (although not saying it i felt it) that i didnt tell her...
So yeah ... again sry for not making much sense...

ps: next up is my uncle witch i think it will be easier since throughout my child hood my dad was more present than my mother since she lives about 30/40 mnt ride from me.

Can anyone take anything from this and ... idk... uh... yeah ... learn from my mistakes... have a nice day stranger :)",14Nov2020,1

Even though he is neglected it’s not right to beat his dog. I hate standing there just seeing the dog getting choked or punched.

My older brother (23) and I had a discussion as to why our parents weren’t doing anything about it months ago. He had come to my dad telling him to have a talk with her about why it’s not okay. My parents would refer it to the “tickle tree” and my sister and her cousins the same age would joke about it at family events. It disgusted my brother and I.

31,"So all throughout high school (i'm in sophomore year) I've been really close with this one teacher. I didn't have any role models before, but I really looked up to him and would always go to him for advice or anything- he was a little rough around the edges emotionally, but still a really good person, and the best teacher i've ever had.
Recently he went through a divorce and I was talking to him alone for a long time , and he started getting really into very personal details and venting about why he got divorced, and I was the one who went to talk to him in the first place, and he recognized after that he shouldn't have told me that much but regardless it's really not appropriate for a fully grown man who's a teacher to tell a high school kid that kind of thing, leading me to believe that he was a lot more unstable right nowthan I thought initially. I never told anyone. 
Up to this point I always saw him around and with this other teacher, but they were both married to other people and I told myself it was nothing, even when they became really close. I found out a while ago that she got divorced earlier this year, and I started seeing them go for lunch together, suspected his divorce, etc, but I still told myself that it was in my head and that it was nothing. Then he told me about his divorce, but mentioned nothing of any affair and led me to believe that it was his decision.
Then, just the other day, I was talking to a friend who graduated about school/teachers, when she goes ""Oh yeah, I heard about how mr (lastname) was in a cheating scandal and got divorced"". I guess It's something that has been going around the (small) town on the down low, and it basically just pieced everything together.
It broke me to hear that because my own parents marriage ended in cheating and it's always been something to me that, especially when you have kids, is one of the worst things you can do and hurts everyone. I feel lied to by him saying the divorce was for other reasons and that he just did it to get validation and sympathy from me. On top of that, I lost the person i looked up to the most for years.
I really want to talk to someone about this but it's still something I should keep confidential. Without going into much detail at all or saying who this was about, I told a friend and she recommended I go to a school counselor, but in my state conselors fall under the teacher's law that states that if any type of harm towards a student is even suspected from a teacher, even emotional, the counselors are obligated to report it. basically, if i talk to a counselor i'd have to tell them a ton of things he's said and done- i could get him in a lot of trouble, or risk losing his job.

Struggled alot in getting a job. In 2013, I realised that I was transgender. Started transitioning full time in 2015. In 2018, I got surgery. Still waiting on revision and also going in for a 3rd round of surgeries for other related things. Just saying this because, maybe, it might offer a certain perspective on things.

Around the same time, I had to take on the mortgage with my brother. Didn't handle that so well. That and the whole transitioning messed up my relationship with my family. Trying to fix, but damage is done. Things are ok with mum, but me and my brother aren't really on speaking terms.

Had a suicide attempt back in Xmas 2018.

In Jan 2019, landed my 1st office job. Still at that job. It's admin, so alot of processing invoices and orders, but also loads of Excel spreadsheets, containing lots of product details that I have to maintain, via Vlookups, new data coming in from 3rd parties and constantly cleaning. SAP comes up alot for reporting and looking at trends in sales data. Helps alot with seeing what we'll need for next seasons. Going to be switching over to NetSuite

So, after getting this experience, I still find that I'm struggling landing a data analysis job.

Are there any courses I can take that people can recommend?

I've made a few Job applications, but I don't know if it's myself or that the market is really dry right now. I'm working under the assumption that my cover letters/CV can always be improved, but I don't quite know what to do.

As a way of balancing my life/self out, I've started learning Japanese. I speak Cantonese, so there is a little bit of an advantage. There's also 2 more reasons for this: I've always wanted to and I want to join the JET programme in a couple of years, when this lockdown, hopefully, would've ended. I'd like to believe that it's a good opportunity for an adventure as well.

I also did programming back in uni for a couple of yrs. Picked back up in 2013 and 2014, then again in 2017. It's something I've always enjoyed and can see myself doing for a career, mostly due to the fact that it's the only sorts of jobs I've been interviewed for and did well. I have an idea for a web-based character creation for a D&amp;D style game. It's really difficult to keep track of experience points, skills, spells etc on paper.

I guess what I'm looking for, other than the job application advice, is what to do with myself? My mental health sucks. Everything with surgeries and transitioning are on hold. My original plan was that my current admin position would give me the experience I'd need to move on, but that's not happened. I get it. I'm not the sharpest, most well put together person, but I know that I can do more. I want to do more. I just feel stuck right now. Sorry for the long ramble. I just wanted you to get the fullest picture as possible.",14Nov2020,1
36,"A bit of background first. White family. Absolutely NOT racist at all in any way. Son is 7, I'm late 30's.

&amp;#x200B;

So onto some details. Wife is gone for the weekend and my son threw this at me out of left field. My wife is very... conservative. No guns, play or otherwise, no swears (or even discussion on it, somewhat understandably, but boys will be boys and every other generic bias in those regards).

So i finished making supper and he asks ""What does the N-word mean, why is it so bad"". And i'm like ""uhh... why did someone you know say it?"" and he denied they did, or what it even means. He knows its a bad word and in his own words ""Like the B-word and S-word"". 

He adamantly denies ever hearing the ACTUAL word or saying anything (i was very calm with him as I dont want to scare him into staying quiet. I want him to talk to me about this stuff). But the long and short of it is that I described to him the reason its bad and who its directed at. (African americans or black and brown people, etc). I had to dumb it down for him quite a bit to really explain it to him but it seems like he understands.

He couldnt explain where he heard the term from ""N-word"" specifically, just that he knows its bad. I suspect someone at school said it. After explaining as simply as I can why its so bad and why its especially bad for someone with our skin colour to say it, he said he was nervous. (I explained to him that using that word could get him seriously hurt and will really hurt the people its directed towards).  


He didnt explain why he was so nervous, just that he was.  


I told him theres no reason to be nervous if you never said it and never plan on saying it.  


Then he says to me, well I dont really like black people. To put it simply i was shocked. I have no idea where it comes from at all. I asked him if someone with different skin color hurt him or was mean to him and he said no. He explained he doesnt like how they look. To be frank, I have no idea how to change that perspective, or why it exists in the first place. I DID explain to him that you cant judge people by how they look but by their actions. It doesnt matter what color their skin is but if they are bullies or are just mean, its okay not to like them.  


He explained its just that they dont match (I have no idea what that means and he couldnt explain it). He went on to say their teeth and tongue is white (again i have no idea what he means by that either exactly).  


So i guess my advice i'm looking for here is, how do I correct his view or explain to him better why what he's saying isnt nice. I cant imagine my kid being racist. I dont think he is. I just dont think he is explaining himself right but I dont know what to do about it or how to talk to him any more than i have. I just know i have to. I cant tell it isnt settled.   


Any advice on how to approach the subject or even educate him better would be greatly appreciated.",14Nov2020,1

I have a decent amount of friends and most people think I’m funny so Im pretty sure I’m perceived as a chill and normal guy. Anyway, one thing that has been on my mind is the fact that I’ve never dated a girl and that I’ve never had sex nor kissed. I know there are thousands of other guys my age in the same boat and that I shouldn’t stress over it and just be patient, but lately outta nowhere it’s been driving me insane. I think it’s because most of my friends have already had relationships and sex, while I’ve never even been close to experiencing any of those things. Most of my guy friends get flirted with and checked out by girls, while I only get that experience like once a year. I’m starting to feel really insecure and even getting to the point of disliking myself and thinking there’s something wrong with me. I’m starting to think maybe it has to do with my height since I’m a pretty short dude (5’6) or maybe I’m ugly and no one has wanted to tell me? I just feel really lost and feel like I’ll never have a romantic connection or any of the stuff every other person in my life has already experienced.

She claimed to have had super natural experiences and my father confirms them, i believe them and my father is not a lier so i believe him too. she is so die hard muslim she said she would rather have me die then come out as gay when i asked her one day as a joke. im afraid that if i come out as muslim she would lock me up in a masjid  ( a place of worship for Muslims ) listen im not joking around when i say that if i come out as ex muslim i would probably ruin my whole life until 18 years old. but i still want to come out as ex muslim, i want to be able to eat pork and enjoy the wonders of youth. many people told me to play by their rules until i get old enough to move out but even then i want a relationship with them, i feel like im stuck.",14Nov2020,1

42,"So I used to have a really unhealthy relationship with my hair. When I was younger (13/14) I didn’t take care of it, always wore it in a bun or ponytail, and when I went through a rough period in my life I didn’t take care of it for so long that it literally became such a tangled mess that I had to cut it short (from butt length to above the shoulders length).

Now, my relationship with my hair is a lot better. I take vitamins that are supposed to make your hair strong, I untangle it before bed every night and I wash it every other day. The problem is that my hair still doesn’t seem healthy, but I’m too scared to go to the doctors and have him look at it (long story) so I came here.

I wear my hair down when I sleep, and when I wake up there’s always lots of separate hairs all over my mattress, between my toes, around my neck and very often there’s little balls of hair that got balled up probably because I move a lot in my sleep. Also, when I run my fingers through my hair afterwards I can literally ‘pull’ like 30/40 hairs out that are already loose. 

And whenever I untangle it, with my fingers (brushes to more damage) I always end up with lots of hairs between my fingers and on my bed as well. It’s not enough to worry about, but because it happens every night and because you only have ‘so many’ hairs, I want to know what I can do to reduce it. 

Is it just me not taking proper care of it, and if so, how can I change that? Or could there be an underlying issue, and if so, how can I spot it?",14Nov2020,1

I can’t speak to my husband without it escalating into a fight. I’m not exaggerating. Every topic leads into an all out war of words and leads to not speaking for the night or even days. 

I have been trying to tweak the way I communicate because I am constantly told it’s my fault we’re fighting (in more or less words) so I have been trying to work on not sounding accusatory or even refraining from daily, monotonous venting about kids or work. I am scared to say anything to him for fear of starting a fight. I need insight on how to approach this and a better communication method than I have now. (Clearly.) I’m just tired of not speaking to each other all day and then when we talk, it only lasting for 5 minutes before we’re at each others throats. I know I haven’t given a specific example but there’s too many. Think of calling your s/o and asking how their day was and 2 sentences later you’re accused of asking because you need to know where they are at all times. From there I’m sure we’ve all had a relationship that’s had one of those fights so tell me - how on earth do I talk to someone if this is how it ends up?

44,"   So I (17f), am in the process of applying to colleges since it is my senior year. Previously, I have had only colleges close enough to me so that I wouldn’t have to leave home (living in a dorm seems expensive af). However, I have gotten to the point with my parents where I am ready to never speak to either them again.

   It’s not just teenage angst, they make me feel so bad about myself and seriously are damaging my mental health. This summer, I told my mom about the bad anxiety I’ve had for years (panic attacks and such) and while she did take me to the doctors for it, she made some snide remarks about not “telling her sooner”. They are both yellers, and we have been getting into so many fights lately. They call me a b*tch, selfish, stupid, self-centered, and more. My mom also has the temperament of a toddler, she snaps at everybody when she’s in a bad mood and she has NEVER apologized to me. EVER. She always pretends like she didn’t just make me cry in the bathroom at Adventure Landing when I was 15 because she said, “This is why nobody wants to be around you, you’re so f*cking miserable”. 

   I was always sure I wanted to move across the world after I finished schooling so I could have less student loans while also “taking my misery elsewhere” as my mom puts it. However, I am so hesitant to actually leave home for college.

   Besides the fact that it would be an extra $15,000 a year for the dorm, on top of the education costs, I just don’t know if I can leave my dog. It might sound dumb, but SHES been my rock for over 7 years. She sleeps with me every night, and spends almost half the day with me. When I am not here, she sleeps in my parents dirty clothes basket because they don’t let her on their bed and it smells like them. If it wasn’t for her, I would probably never smile. She is the only thing keeping me happy. 

   So I just cannot weigh which side is better. I cannot stand these people anymore. Imagining more years like this with them makes me so scared and sad. But I also want to cry when I think about my baby girl being left virtually alone without me. I can’t take her with me, because she’s technically my parents dog, but I can’t imagine not seeing her every day, or even week. I don’t know, I just need advice on how I could potentially remedy this or am outside opinion on which is more important. The thought of staying makes me just as sad as the thought of leaving her behind. I am so confused and worried, and many deadlines are coming soon so I need to figure out a game plan on where to apply.",14Nov2020,1

47,"Hello there, beloved comunity. My real life nickname is Rospano, I'm 24 year old and I would like to receive not just an answer but as well an opinion. (If the post doesn't fit to this comunity I please the moderators to move it in the one that belongs, as I dont really know in witch it fits..). 
So, I'll make it short, I started writing lyrics when I was 14, my first concerts where at 16, I used to do music until 18, then I stoped, I moved out of the country, I started doing instrumentals for 7 months and I stopped again. I left evreybody and everything behind because of a fake love. An girl that never supported me in my dreams and made me quit everything I loved. I used to have a lot of contacts and relationships from my home country's music industry. Starting from hip hop (my main thing) to rock, EDM, rock, pop [..]. But.. yeah, I left everything behind because of that one.. . Anyway, I just said that to have an idea. At the moment I own .. shit. But the thing is that I can make the money I need in a month or two.. unethically.. . What I need it for? To make a ""boom"" in my home country, in the music industry. The entire project costs about 14,000£ that includes professional video directors, editors (big names that are the real thing in my country, people that directed big movies &amp; big artists music videos) professional producers &amp; even in that price also includes the help from big musicians, artists and writers with the lyrics and voice. That money includes even more important things, officially play on radio, big chance to appear on a TV music chanel + promotion from Instagram and youtube biggest creators + trademark, copyright, official artist website also I started to get in touch with the artists that I left behind, when my ex made me so it and.. not all, but few of them were glad to help me with promotion. 
And no, I'm not from no where, I have the lyrics, I can fit myself not just on hiphop, but also on rock (death metal, metal, punk, grunge), pop, flamenco, r&amp;b, trap, lo-fi .. and the list can continue.. on and on.. . Since my first inception into the music and writing, I've keep practicing on and on since I was 14. So I can so this all, risking a lot doing the money in an unethical way, a lot.. , also risking to do all of these and having no chaince.. doing everything in vain.. , but the this is that I really really trust myself, for the first time I feel that I can make it true and I will succeed. The other part, is that my familly is keep asking me to come back home, in the country that I left, to come and live with them, but.. I would love to do that.. I haven't seen them for 3 years.. I miss them a lot, and in the country that I live now.. I'm struggling a lot...for real, a lot, I'm working hard, and I'm in big debts.. . Why I'm not doing the money in that unethically way if I can make that much I told ? Because that's about risking a lot.. . Does that deserve? Doing a specific thing, to get the money risking a lot, starting my project.. with the chance of blowing up or doing all in vain? Going back to my familly, with no money, living debts behind and people with problems.. (few of the ones I own money are friends of mine, and running without giving the cash back would put them in problems) living with my familly on a small wage and struggling.. or stay the way I am at the moment, broke, working hard to pay my debts, and struggling, a lot? 
Also.. if I make that money, the amount that I make, I could pay my debts, start my project, and even if I dont succeed after that I can go back to my familly... . Does it deserve? Does it really deserve? I rep6myself again, I know the people, all of them are friends, I can do the money. I know the people that I need in the project, I know what involves, I know the directors, I know the artist, I already spoke with few of the and few of Instagram big name, I have the delivery, I have guaranteed professional musicians to help me out with the delivery of my music. I have everything I need... does it deserve to risk that much? What would you do?
if you didn't understand something, tell me and I will explain, I'm at a party and I've been continuously disturbed.. I can't feel good, I'm not in the mood to party because of the pressure.. I can't delay this decision, I'm already thanking about it for months.. but I need few opinions, it will help, a lot. I'll burnout soon if I dont decide.. the pressure from the debts, the money, and my hunger for my dream is to big.. thank you guys.. please dont make any fun, dont be trolls, I'm as serious as possible thanks you.

anyway, tomorrow i have a chance to see him again. fyi, i live with my parents, sister and brother. my parents visit my niece every week. so my sister got really upset if i would get corona and spread it to my dad and my dad would spread it to my niece. 3/4 weeks have passed and it did not happen. my bf is most of the time home and goes to work 2 days a week (he works at domino's). he lives with his parents. oh and i live in the netherlands.

65,"My parents are strict immigrant parents, and my dad wont even let me get my drivers license, wont let me get a job, a bank account or anything. I am going to college next year and they wouldnt let me apply to anywhere out of state, because they want me to go from home. They wont even let me egt a license so that I can drive my self, my dad said that he will drop me off at college in the morning and pick me up after. I was never allowed to go out with my friends EVER, and they never let me live my life. I'm a more carefree fun loving guy, and it feels like they drain my soul everyday. I need to get out of here but I have no money and I dont know step ny step what to do or where to go. I dont mind being homeless for a bit, again, Im a pretty out going guy and Im just looking for adventure since I have never really lived life (because of my dad).

66,"I live in a pretty toxic household. I’ve also had a nasty past with my dad, which my dad doesn’t take too kindly to. I’ll be 18 in about a month and am planning to just move out after high school, and I’m completely aware how hard it’ll be. I need to pay bills of all sorts, insurance for cars and health, phone bills, gas, TV, and even finding a place to live. I’m aware that I’ll be living minimally and I’m okay with that.
My 16 year old brother found himself with a pregnant GF and it’s been really stressful. He doesn’t stay up on his pills, him and his GF finally convinced me to downsize about 6 bags worth of clothes,miscellaneous things, and sentimental stuff. I’ve spent well over 400 dollars on stuff we all use plus baby stuff and food for them. My Dad is a chronically ill alcoholic with a God complex, and my Mom just refuses to admit that after 17 years of turmoil and instability, I’m ready to move out. Not out of the country, just out of the home, in town for Christ’s sake.

 They take the easy way out. We're training her to stay outside, in the yard but every time she comes inside, they use a treat to make her leave. Basically, she's being rewarded for things that she isn't supposed to do.

Lately she reminds me those spoiled brats you want to punch in the face sometimes. She's 3 months old and I'm wondering if if we can do some damage control? Can she still be trained to behave properly or is it too late?",14Nov2020,1
71,"So his name is Juan. He’s my friend, we aren’t acquaintances or anything like that. He associates me as a friend of his so I know for sure we are friends and I was thinking of nicknames to call him. it’s been a thing we done ever since we met. I call him headass sometimes and he did the same but he stopped. While I just kept the nick names. He didn’t seem to mind. And I was calling him jauny for a little bit, I changed his name tag to jauny with a blue heart since it means friendship. If it was red...that’s a whole different story then.

But I called him jauny and he didn’t seem to mind from what I thought cuz he didn’t say anything. I asked him if he didn’t mind the name. He reads the text but didn’t reply. So I shrugged it off not thinking it was a big deal of him not replying, maybe he got busy. 

I tell him time to time if he has any concerns or if something is bothering him he can tell me.  Then he randomly removed the name. And I asked what’s wrong, I didn’t know what happened so I asked. He said he didn’t like the name. I felt guilty and explained to him that he should’ve told me how he felt cuz I had no idea and he kept it in, making him feel uncomfortable. I just wish he spoke up, why didn’t he tell me? Could it be cuz he was shy? Afraid? I guess he can’t speak up for himself, we been friends for over a year and I was surprised he didn’t say anything to me. 
This is my fault...but I wish he told me sooner. I asked him what’s wrong since he didn’t tell me but he didn’t tell me. I told him we are only friends and nothin more.  So I asked does he consider me as a friends of his and he said yes he does..:so idk he got so uncomfortable then. I guess he doemst get this kind of affection form his friends.",14Nov2020,1
73,"From the ages of 5-7 I was in a sexual ""relationship""with a close relative of mine. The person was 4-5 years older than I was at the time, and they started the ""relationship."" It never led to anything like penetration, and mainly consisted of them making me give them BJ's and in return they would make me ""feel good."" At the time, I never really enjoyed what they were doing and always felt disgusted by it, but they were someone I looked up to so I thought it was normal. When I was 7, around the beginning of the year, I was put into foster care for a few months and didn't see them at all. When I came back, and they tried to start the ""relationship"" up again I started crying and told them no and that I was going to tell on them. They didn't try anything after that.  
  I'm not too sure how big of an effect this has had on me. I'm 15 now and It's a memory I've always had, but for the last three years it has constantly been on my mind. Whenever I'm getting ready to go out, this feeling that I can only describe as intense disgust builds up in my gut and it erases all desire I have to do anything. I'm not sure if this is connected(I grew up in an unaffectionate household so I think it could also have caused this), but I hate to be touched. Any time I have to hug someone, that feeling in my gut starts up again and I just want to run away. I feel like everyone knows what I did even though I haven't told anyone. I don't have any intention of telling anyone in my real life because I'm ashamed of myself and I still see the person who started the ""relationship"" very often. Also, I feel like I shouldn't harbor any hatred toward them since they weren't much older than I was, but I still do. Any time I see them I'm disgusted. I don't know if they remember or not. Im not sure what to do. How do I get rid of the feeling of disgust?",14Nov2020,1
74,"About seven weeks ago my grandpa who is 86 years old got sick and went to the hospital. Before hand he live by himself next to my mom I would go see him about once a month and so would my cousin and mom. When he got sick he was immobileFor the two weeks he was at the hospital. He asked me when I was available to come and spend time with him I told him Fridays after school, Saturdays and Sundays. I am a full-time student teacher at a middle school that is basically running the entire class by myself. Along with being a fiancé I also have a shit ton of dogs. For five weeks straight I was going over there every Friday Saturday and Sunday. Then I had my solo Teachingand I was busy writing lessons from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep. I’m still teaching full-time as a student teacher meaning not getting paid and I still have all my other responsibilities. This week I went back and for two hours I got yelled at because I made him feel bad because I wasn’t there.

I dont want to hurt them because if they found me hitting their dogs i would surely not be in good standing with them any longer, and on top of that my fiancé’s dad is one of those weird dog people... so if i tell him i dont like dogs and want nothing to do with them, he will start to dislike me, tease me about it, or generally be petty.

76,"My boyfriend loves me. A lot. I felt the same way. I still do love him but I don't think I'm *in love* anymore and I feel so terrible about it. It's our 2 year anniversary and he put up 3 pictures of me saying he loves me and it has been the best 2 years ever and I feel like a monster. We had a really bad rough patch summer 2019. This happened again from June-early September this year. He has a serious mental illness that makes him a shadow of himself. He can unload on me for weeks at a time. We fought almost daily because I was so fed up and wanted him to get therapy for our future. About 2 or 3 months ago I was so resentful of all the crap this untreated thing put me through, I started worrying I needed to end it. Suddenly I wanted to spend less time with him and felt less attracted as my head was filled with guilt or anger of stuff the illness made me feel. 

I'll admit, he has been a lot better the last 2 months and I still have hope it' won't come back or if it does he'll get help. I just want to fall in love again. I yearn for how I felt. How do I get it back?",14Nov2020,1
77,"I'm 17 and next year I'm going to have to start applying to colleges. The thing is, is that I have no idea what career I want do. I'm interested in numerous subjects (Psychology, Finance, History, Law, Crime, Medicine, Chemistry, Japanese) but have no idea what I should focus on. 

I think I've always been expected to go into some type of ""respected"" profession (mainly being some type of doctor or lawyer) I guess - and I have no problem with that.  I've always been fascinated with doctors and have read many books/ biographies on doctors and hospitals - and the work that they do. Additionally I've also been interested in law, and how it is used to maintain justice in our society. But, I'm just worried I would be not good enough for those professions - what I mean is, is that many of peers want to be doctors or lawyers, and most of those kids have already taken many classes in high school, and have done internships (and have parents in the field), so I'm worried that if I decide that I want to be a doctor or lawyer, that I'm already behind and won't be able to keep up with everyone else. 

My biggest worry is finally deciding on one to put all my energy into, and then later on realizing that I'm terrible at it and hate it. I think part of the reason I'm having so much trouble deciding on what I should do, is because of  where I live. I live in a pretty affluent area just outside DC, so most of my peers and their parents are pretty high-achieving - and I worry that if I aim for a job in Medicine or Law (or anything that's like I don't know, um, up-there if that makes sense) that my life will just end up being miserable. Because even though my school mates are polite I guess, the school I go to is pretty competitive grade-wise and I feel like if I go into one of those fields it'll be the same as school - I'll end up just constantly worrying if I'm good enough and always being surrounded by the same kind of people.

I also acknowledge that this whole post probably sounds super immature and rambling, but I've sort of been freaking out about this for the past week. I know that I don't have to choose a career quite yet, but (1) I will have to put a major down on my college applications, and (2) I think I'd be much happier with having a goal to aim towards and am secure with. 

Thanks so much for reading this, and again I'm assuming that most of this post probably seems ridiculous to actual adults, so, please go easy on calling me an idiot for something or another in the comments. 

THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY TO READ THIS!!",14Nov2020,1
78,"So long story short my mom's house is a bit of a mess. There's just me, my mom, and my step-dad. My mom has some mental health problems and, as such, she drinks a lot and doesn't eat much. My step dad has always been a bigger problem to me, as he is always very angry and he has these big blow-ups where he will insult me, call me names (like b*tch, monster, cancer, etc), and yell for hours on end. My mom will usually go with what he says, acting like his echo and mainly just repeating him.

7th grade was when I remember all of this getting the worst (I'm in 10th grade now). My brother had to move out of the house because it got so bad, and I was left to deal with the repercussions.

I've struggled a lot with mental-health problems. Even after 3 years these blow-ups are still happening and it always seems like they know the best time when I'm actually happy again to knock me back down.

Now, lets talk about what happened today. I woke up this morning in a total daze. I had forgotten to plug my phone in the night before, I hadnt packed any lunch, etc and eventually i ended up leaving the house late and missing the bus. Granted, this was the third time ive missed the bus this school year. 

I walk back from the bus stop and immediately my mom tells me I had to walk to school. I protest, and it starts and argument that ends up with her driving me to school. During the argument I did call her a b*tch. 

I had to have a meeting after school today and when I got out she refused to pick me up. My school is two miles away from my house (so not bad but its still 80 degrees and I didnt have any water left) and she is still working from home so she couldve easily picked me up.

I get home and my mom tells me that she is taking my pet snake, Athena, to my dad's house. When I try to tell her not to, she just takes the snake and drives away, leaving it with my dad. I stuffed whatever I could think of into a pillowcase and she drove me to my dad's.

What should I do now? I don't want to leave my mom with my step dad, and I really dont want her to hurt herself, either. Should i just stay with my dad?",14Nov2020,1
79,"Hey everyone! So about 3 months ago, my(18, F) cousin(22, F) came to live with my mom and I because of family issues. Ever since she came to live with us, I noticed a big change in the atmosphere, and not in a good way. My brother, who lives with my dad, even said he noticed a difference, especially with our mom. Whenever they get together and talk to each other, its always to badmouth other people. It gets so draining when all they do is bring others down, and I can't help but think that if she does this to others, who's to say she doesn't do this to us? Anyways, my cousin is a very judgemental person and it seems like she's always got a problem with something. For example, I'll be talking with my best friend on the phone in the room we share while she's in the living room and, while I admit I can get excited and loud at times, she begins complaining that I'm weird for getting excited to talk to a friend ive known since we were basically toddlers. She also makes a lot of comments on my weight and it gets really upsetting at times. I'm really thin for my age (89 lbs) and it seems like no matter how hard i try to gain weight, I can't seem to do so. I also have a problem with eating in front of others no matter how long ive known them, and she knows this but always brings up the fact that ""I'm too skinny, I'm practically bones"" and its really discouraging. I try to shrug it off but it feels like I can't even be myself in my own home. Another big issue is that whenever we're out with friends, she always criticizes me on something and it tends to get embarrassing at times. There's so much more but I really don't want to make this post longer than it seems to have gotten! Also, I cant really confront her since I'm really bad with confrontation and just overall arguing and stuff. Anything would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you :)",14Nov2020,1

85,"So I  had my first job as a lifeguard last summer. One day I was going to my first shift at a new pool. There were a few families hanging out until one man came with two children. He left them and started walking around the pool I think. But once he came, the other families started to pack up. One lady who was part of the group came up to me and said that I was going to have a “creepy night” and asked me if my shift ended soon. I asked why and apparently the man was being sus and I was about to be left alone there at night near him. She told me to call my boss so I did, but I didn’t know what to say or what the man was doing so I asked her to explain to my boss. I heard her say the man was a “known pedo” and she “wasn’t going to leave a 15 year old girl alone with him so unless someone from the pool company came down she’d call the freaking police”. I don’t remember much, I was freaking out and dissociating. But I remember her telling me when I asked that he was just the “creepy uncle” of the neighborhood. He was there with his niece and nephew, and she seemed to know him. This was easily the scariest night of my life. In retrospect, I’m still scared. I get bad thoughts about it a lot. I feel guilty, because with the whole controversy surrounding the police and all in this day in age, should I have just sucked the fear up and not let her have my phone? But then I think of what could have happened if she hadn’t been there. The lady walked me to my moms car when she finally arrived and apparently my mom said she looked intoxicated/smelled like alcohol so idk if she was overreacting or what but like I said she obviously knew him. I’m scared still like I said, I get thoughts about it a lot, I’m afraid of working in a place where I could be at risk, and I’m guilty because idk how I should’ve reacted in that situation and how I should react if it happens.",14Nov2020,1

89,"So when I was little my older sister went to public school. This turned out to be a very bad idea, and she got bullied a lot. So naturally I've been ""homeschooled,"" in other words no education at all other than basic reading and writing. This was because my parents were far too busy. So now, since I'm 14 I've been enrolled into an online secondary school which doesn't use classes, but rather it's meant to encourage ""independent learning"".  I'm enrolled into a English course and a ""success strategies for secondary school"" course.   


My experience hasn't been good at all. I don't know the first thing about writing notes, writing essays, basically all the stuff I should know from school. I'm a terrible reader, and my motivation because of many things is shit. It takes 3 hours for me to do barely anything. I have no idea how I'm gonna write stuff like essays. I'm nervous to contact a teacher, but it probably doesn't matter since they're known to be useless anyway.

90,"Hey, this might sound silly but I'm 19 and get extremely anxious around most men, because I feel judged and looked down on. Since I've been a child I only had bad experiences with men, I have been physically abused by my dad, sexually abused by my grandfather and other men and have been extremely bullied by (mostly) boys, to an extent that I was suicidal as a child/ young teenager. All of that left me with depression and lots of self hatred, which I've been trying to work on but am progressing just slowly. While I am not in toxic situations/environments, like the ones i described, anymore, all of those things are still deeply ingrained in my brain.

92,"So I've had a few relationships, I've had serious feelings for people, but my last relationship was very toxic and she was emotionally abusive. It's been a year since I was brave enough to end it, and to this day I feel like it still effects me. The idea of being in a relationship with another person is a bit terrifying because I associate that with feeling trapped and that I'm not allowed to be with my family and friends.

I've recently felt the need to love someone, which I'm not entirely comfortable with just yet. But I feel like I've fallen in love with a famous actress after watching a show she's in. Honestly it seems absolutely ridiculous, I'm not delusional by any means. But my celebrity crushes before were less personal and just was they are hot and I like their personality.

I can't stop thinking about this famous actress, I keep imagining how we will get together and imagine how I will introduce her to my friends and family. If I'm watching a film, I'll imagine her with me. And I'm too scared to Google if she is in a relationship with someone because I will genuinely feel really upset.

93,"About 6 years ago,I became really close friends with this girl; let’s call her Amy. We were party friends at first but eventually became good pals. We were never each other’s best friend, but we would’ve each considered the other one on our best friends. 

I slowly realized Amy was really toxic. She is very insecure and would often try to say or do things to mess with my relationship with my boyfriend. Every time I hung out with her, I just felt crumby. I just don’t like her anymore and don’t know how much I did to begin with. She only talks about drinking and sex. 

My final straw with Amy was visiting her in May. She talked shit the whole time about her childhood best friend and then invited her over. I specifically told her I had strict boundaries with COVID which she completely ignored and gaslit me about. She was being crude beyond the point of it being funny. I wanted to go home after the first few hours. 

I’ve basically been dodging her for the past several months and thought she caught my drift. She recently reached out about visiting for my birthday, and I told her I was busy with school and work (which isn’t a lie). I’m just not sure what to do at this point. I don’t even know how to be honest about it with her without hurting her feelings? Say “I just don’t like you anymore” because there really isn’t something specific she could work on. Our personalities just don’t mesh, and we are very different people. 

I’ve been SO much happier not seeing her or being around her. We live in different cities and the pandemic has been helpful in keeping us even more apart. I just worry she will expect to be one of my bridesmaids or that she doesn’t even know I’m over the friendship. 

Should I just keep distancing myself and hope she gets the message?? It’s hard to write it all down so if you have any questions lmk. I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle things with Amy!!",14Nov2020,1

If I have to guess I think it started when I was young around 1st or second grade I was a loud energetic kid like most 6 and 7 year olds, my parents wanted me to be successful and that was just basically behaving in class, I was young and didn’t really understand so I got in trouble a lot. There was this system where each time you got in trouble the consequences got worse, I would usually get in trouble for interrupting and the school would call my parents, I would get him and get disciplined physically it. Yes it taught me to be more polite but it had consequences. My parents would always give me a lecture of being minorities and I wouldn’t understand. The teachers would always say “why can’t you be like this student” or like “that student.” Remembering what my parents told me I would obey I let myself be cutout and I behaved like “that student” I stopped talking in class I “listened” more. My grades got better as I progressed through school and teachers praised me for being a good student and being smart but it came with a cost and I just became quiet all the time I wouldn’t talk at lunch at recess or anything. When I became 13 years old I realized something wasn’t right when It was just hard to socialize.

98,"So I (17M) just had sleep paralysis I think, like, 2 minutes ago. I’m on reddit to calm myself down. 

I didn’t dream of anything conventionally scary like monsters, I just dreamt that someone was behind me in my bed and touching me, holding my hands and wouldn’t let go, and I could really actually feel it, their arms and their hands were really there. They were holding me down so I couldn’t get up.

100,"I had a terrible experience with a doctor.  Many, many things were done unprofessionally over a few visits.  I am now left with a bill for over $300 (original bill was over $1000 but insurance covered the rest).  I would have no problem paying for this normally, but this specific bill is for a test that I now believe the doctor had no business performing and was honestly a really traumatic experience (I won't go into detail but I have had this test performed before and it was nothing like this.  I cried a lot after).  I had a biopsy performed at the same time.  A few days later the biopsy results were sent to me via the office's ""portal"" with no comments from the doctor or recommendations.  Literally just the pathologist's report in medical jargon.  I called the doctor multiple times and reached out over the portal but only got responses from a nurse who told me that my biopsy was ""normal"" (I have this in writing from her).  After many (just so, so many) additional things went wrong with this doctor/practice I found a new one and showed the new doctor my biopsy.  It is not normal.  I need a surgical procedure.  I'm upset for so many reasons, but then when I got the bill I was enraged.  Paying $300 for a test the doctor should never have done and a biopsy I never got results for (or at least not appropriate results for) is just not ok.  I contacted the billing office who told me they couldn't help and had me talk to the practice manager.  After 2 weeks of trying to get a hold of her again after our initial conversation she finally told me her hands were tied and there was nothing she could do about ""services already provided"".  Does anyone have any advice on how to fight this?  Should I take this up with my insurance company?  I would appreciate any and all advice.",14Nov2020,1
101,I have this one bestfriend and we were extremely close and we been through so much together. And i dont mean like cheesy drama or sad days i str8 mean like REAL stuff like when a ton of  girls were outside her house trynna jump her or when she had a warrant. Like we used to smoke and everything but she started turning weird. Like she gets older boyfriends that are “hard core” bangers and shooters. Shell runaway for days and live with them and shell post pictures throwing up their gang signs and talking all big nd bad on her sc story. She dates the same guys in the same gang nd i dont even think she likes them she just dates them for their gang status/royalty and one time one of them went to juvenile and he snitched on everyone else in the gang and he was kicked out of the gang and all of a sudden she broke up with him and she just got with another guy that was still in the gang. Its pretty obvious girls in gangs arent taken seriously and are just used for sex but she really believes shes in the gang. She starts stuff with opps from other gangs and fights them bc she thinks her “gang” has her back but she doesnt realize that they dont really care about her and shes just being used. Im scared shes gonna pick a fight with the wrong gurl nd somethings gonna happen to her and her “gang” wont have her back. Should i straight up tell her to snap out of it or should i just let her do her own thing and hope nothing baf happens to her? Srry if this is confusing i dont use this app really,14Nov2020,1
102,"We had been broken for a couple months, but I guess we still hung out and had sex and the sorta stuff, we basically dated but just knew we weren’t. We wanted to work things out and get back together but it just wasn’t happening. We had been broken up for a like 6 months. 

We dated for like 3 years. She was my first love, my first time, it seems like the first girl I’ve wanted to do everything with, my first companion and someone that was always there for me. Heck we almost had a kid together and I love her. Probably will for sometime.

The fact is for awhile we didn’t work together, it was hard and it very toxic. I think our love and our problems kept us together. Honestly I was probably the more toxic one and I let my anxiety get in the way of everything. Did she hurt me yes she did a lot of stuff. She always had guys hitting her up and was always talking to them no matter how many times I said it bothered me. She lied to me a lot and posted things behind my back.  It felt like we hung out and had sex and that was it for awhile and I really regret that. 

But again I wasn’t perfect, I went through her phone and always thought she cheated and although it was morally are fault why I felt that, I took it too far. But no matter what happens we always came back and promised to make things work and that’s great but it never did work and we always broke up and again probably mutually our fault.  

I always felt like she had another guy and stuff like that but I just loved her too much to do anything about it, but things were different lately. After a guy accused her of sending nudes it fucked things up. 

I’m just afraid I won’t love someone else or love someone else the same, when I first started talking to this girl I was head over heels, like this was my perfect girl yknow. When I used to come over I could see her running down the stairs to greet me and she’d always be wearing these short shorts and it was the cutest thing ever. 

But now, I’d go over and we’d be fine and say lovey stuff and try to work things out but when I left, I’d do something wrong and she wouldn’t talk to me for like weeks and it absolutely broke me. 

Like I said, I’m afraid I won’t find anyone or be in love with someone like that again. Her family was nice and she has two great younger brothers. It just sucks because she didn’t feel the same way about us not working when it really felt like she did, she was talking to other guys and would not talk to me for weeks. I get maybe she needed space but like fuck. 

We argued today and she said she deserved better and to leave her alone and that she hated me and I did stuff to make her cry and want to die, which I get but don’t need to get into because I’ve talked to people about it and they mostly agree maybe i was in the right.  But she still refusing to tell me we’re done for good so that’s gives me hope we’ll work things even though I know better.   When we were fighting I said she cheated and she said I did and that was the last things she’ll ever say to me, when I messaged her on Instagram being like wtf 3 years of lies she said she said that because she was done me not listening but it seems sus regardless. 

Anyways I wanna move to Winnipeg anyways and out of this province soon. So maybe it’s for the best things are done. Regardless of how bad and lonely
I feel. If anyone could give me some advice I’d appreciate it. Sorry if this is super long just got a lot too deal with",14Nov2020,1

Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to cope because I went to boot camp. I'm now in the military, and for the first time in a year I saw my best friend.

113,"I (18F) am a senior in high school, and I am in marching band. My fellow senior bandmates came up with the idea to have a senior bonfire, where each senior may bring a guest or two. However, they have no regard for responsible mask wearing or social distancing. It just so happens that the bonfire is happening at my boyfriend J's (20M) house, because his sister, A, (18F) is also in my class and offered to host it here. The bonfire is in progress as I type this, and I was already hanging out here since it is Friday and wanted to celebrate Friday the 13th by watching Jason movies. The kids are also mostly hanging out in the house, playing card games at the dining table, so I suppose it is more of a gathering than a bonfire.

I'm not sure exactly how many people are here, as I'm hiding in J's room, but of the people I have seen, none are wearing masks. J's mom, M, is also in charge of the teens/helping organise the fire, etc, and she had even specifically asked A to tell everyone to wear a mask. Not even M is wearing a mask. Nobody is social distancing and they are all having fun without any regard to safety. J doesn't seem to care about wearing a mask either, and keeps telling me to take mine off as he doesn't think I'll get sick, even if I am staying in his room. One problem with this is that J's room does not have a door, and the bathroom is technically in his room, right near the doorway. So people are coming and going freely a small room-length's away from us.

Another issue to mention is that one of the seniors didn't come tonight because he is being quarantined and I'm assuming this is because he or someone he has been around has the virus or may have it. So, at least one of us is already sick, so who knows how many more may be infected? There are at least ten people here and none of the people I've seen are wearing a mask nor are they distancing. Additionally, the mask mandate has just been put back into place where I live: you have to wear a mask when you're away from home no matter what. Am I overreacting and being a snob, or am I justified for being angry over this? I was already not super thrilled about the idea of a bonfire anyway, because of the pandemic. Any advice would be appreciated. I'll update with more info if need be. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",14Nov2020,1
114,"Backstory- I live in my current location because I moved here with my exgf, Karen,of 7 years because we were going to start over again. That was in 2016. We ended up moving in with her parents and about 6 months later, she decided that she didn't want to have another go at our relationship. Fast forward to 2018. Still lived at her parents house because housing is crazy expensive and they like me. Things between my ex and me were rocky. We have a history of mental illness and addiction with her. I  made friends at the warehouse retail store I worked at, one being Todd. I liked him from the beginning not romantically though, but was always one of those people who you could talk to about anything. We would chat about gaming, life, food and music. He was one of my closest friends, if only at work because I'm socially awkward and don't know how to make friends otherwise. 
Around new years, Todd and me started hanging out but with other friends around. By March 2019, we were dating and I had to make a choice about moving out of Karen's parents or dating Todd. I put deposits down on three different apartments but one was a scam, one I had to call in weekly to see if they had any available apartments which they never did and the last but of hope I had was snatched up by someone else though I had made arrangements with the property manager. So I moved in with Todd. I really regret that. I found out alot of things about him that were at first weird or cute but now annoying. He's stuck at that part of life were hes resentful of having to be adult. Do chores, pay rent (his mom and technically he owns the house so he gets away with not paying it), pay bills ect. I've worked with him to get him to be more responsible and adult but hes still resentful of it. Besides that, he likes to try to have sex with me while I'm asleep and even after I tell him I'm not in the mood, he still tries until I get forcible about it or just get out of bed. He says he doesn't know he does it and is sorry. He also likes to grope me in public. The last time, he was dropping me off at work and cupped my ass as I got out. I've told him not to do this but he apparently ""forgets"". 
I'm not happy. I don't feel attracted to him anymore but I feel stuck. I can't afford to move out on my own. I no longer work with him but we carpool to work. Karen and her parents have offered to let me move back in but if I do, it'll be a single room I'll be sharing with Karen. Right now, I pay his mom rent everytime it's due while he still doesn't consistently. I don't know what to do, I just know I'm not in love with him anymore and I'm not happy.

115,"Sorry for shitty grammar, I can't think straight.

I don't even know how to start this. 

The best word to describe my life right now is ""WHAT"".

I don't know what I want in life, I don't know how to enjoy life, I'm very lost and miserable.

I'm a 2nd year student at a somewhat reputable College. I started as a premed student last year but ever since I graduated high school I don't feel happy anymore, anything I do, I just want to get through and get it done. Back in high school I always had a place to grow and wanted to grow. I loved studying, I loved the gym, I loved waking up, I loved every day as a new opportunity.

But ever since I got into College, I feel like I want to get this over with I'm sure its partially because of COVID but I've noticed whenever I'm in school, I'm not happy, in the break between semesters, I'm happier because I work more, I volunteer, I go to the gym, I feel my social confidence go up and I don't have to worry about grades and school.

 At school, I know I have lots of time, I know I have the potential I know I can be my best, and excel in everything but I don't have the energy or motivation. This fucks up my mood, my work, my gym, sleep, time with family, and mental health (I've been getting mood swings in school) and just want every semester to end. But all I've known my whole life has been me wanting to go to Medicine because I really want to help people. I have and currently am volunteering with people in need and I love it, but when I think of school, I want to throw up. 

Its like everyone saying you glow/your potential explodes after high school. And I've seen my friends who go to school really happy and get really good grades and manage social life, sports etc... and the ones who don't go to school also very successful in their jobs etc...They grew up and improved over time. I know I can do that too, but I don't like life right now.

I don't know what to do at this stage, I've become more childish than I was in high school, less responsible, don't want to get better, don't want to be happy, don't want to chase my dreams, I only imagine them. I don't even know what my dreams are anymore, I don't know what I want in life.

What do I do at this point? should I leave school? Stay in school? Honestly I don't know what makes me happy anymore. If I leave, then I'm a failure, my parents (who are immigrants) suffered so much, gave up so much, to get me and my brother here. I've seen/heard of people who built themselves from rock bottom, in countries with no opportunities, limited rights, etc... and If they can, but I don't I'm a fucking failure. I really need advice on what to do with my life. Thank you.",14Nov2020,1
117,"some context,, im a 16 year old girl,  i work at homesense, and because of covid I go outside for my break so i can take my mask off to drink some water or eat.

so im sitting outside on my break (its like 6pm but its COMPLETELY DARK because i live in canada lol), and this random guy walks past me and asks how im doing, I say, im good thanks, and ask him how hes doing. i didnt really think much of this because i deal with customers all day and I saw him earlier in the store, so I just thought he was being polite. he strikes up a conversation with me asking what im doing, if homesense is having any sales, and things like that. i tell him im on my break and that we dont have any sales right now. i thought this was the end. also note that he was smiling a  bit too much and looked overly happy.

but he keeps going. he asks me for my name, and at this point im contemplating if I should give him my real name, because it kind of felt like a weird situation. i then remember I forgot to take off my name tag, so I couldn't lie. i tell him my name, and he says ""wow, ive never heard of a name like that before, but that's a beautiful name"". im kind of freaking out at this point because who comes up to you and asks for your name????? theres a weird awkward pause, and im like, yeah thank you, its an arabic name, just to kind of end off the conversation. he keeps trying to talk to me more, but i cut him off and was like ""you have yourself a good night"", and ran inside. I felt really bad after because he had a backpack with him and went off to walk on the road, and keep in mind, its completely dark outside., so i assumed maybe he didnt have anywhere to go for the night

i know im probably just overreacting, and im sure he had good intentions, but theres a  small part of my brain that keeps thinking that hes gonna track me down and kidnap me because he knows what I look like, my name, and where I work.

I was going to post this on r/medical but I haven’t really gotten too many answers/comments on my posts there in the past. 

I did get my period about a week ago, but ever since my period ended I have been nauseous in the mornings and at night, emotional, horny, extremely forgetful, hungry, and the one that is making me really worried is that I keep smelling weird shit. Like, I keep smelling our trash that is all the way in the kitchen while I’m in our living room and it makes me want to throw up, or I smell his dirty shoes from work when he’s across the room and it makes me want to throw up. I know most of yous are just going to tell me to take a pregnancy test, but I don’t feel like wasting my money if I don’t need to. Am I freaking out? Or should I be genuinely worried? I’m worried that all of the baby-fever (my brother’s gf is pregnant, my cousin is pregnant, and my stepsister just had a baby girl) is getting to me and I’m going nuts, but as much as I love babies, I don’t want one for awhile. My boyfriend and I just got our first apartment in august, so we have bills to pay, I’m in my first semester of nursing school; i.e., this is not the time for a child. We are broke and on top of that are enjoying our time being alone together in our first place. 

Also some info on the forgetfulness: I have a brain tumor that used to make my memory awful (no I’m not going to die, tumor is benign), but the meds I take to shrink it have improved my memory greatly. My memory hasn’t been this awful in well over a year, maybe even 2 years. I first noticed this last week. I forgot an online class, which I never do (it’s an important class as I’m failing it and need to do all I can to pass, it’s constantly on my mind, so I’m a little concerned I forgot about it. I didn’t remember until there was 20 mins left till the class ended) I had to reschedule a meeting 3x because I kept forgetting. No, my endocrinologist (my tumor doc) isn’t helping, I actually had a follow-up with him the other day and mentioned how my memory has gotten worse again, and he didn’t do anything or offer any help/strategies. 

Idk, a lot of my family members have bled through either one or all of their pregnancies. I do sometimes forget my pill (memory issues, like I said earlier), but i always double-up the next day, like the instructions on my BC say.

119,"I work in an organization that is heavily reliant on volunteer work. I have a volunteer who I’ve been working with for about three years, who is one of the loveliest people I’ve ever met. And recently, he decided to take an active interest in my life and what I’m doing with it. For the past few weeks, every time I’ve spoken to him, he’s been encouraging me to continue my education. He just keeps telling me that I’m smart and capable, and that there’s no reason I shouldn’t expand my horizons for the future.

120," I have a relationship with someone diagnosed with mental health issues, schizoaffective in the case. We have been dating for more than 2 years and even tho things have been very harsh in the past, right now my partner has been doing quite well and stable and is completely receptive to treatment and therapy. He has a good job, hobbies, some friends, a girlfriend, basically all the milestones that someone could think on the early 20s, so, it was a really huge progress taking in account he was suicidal 2 years ago.

Obviously sometimes some depressive episodes still occur, specially with all the covid situation that is stressing all our local village right now. When that happens, he basically shuts down from most things, including me, and makes communication really really hard, specially not living together, if he doesn't reply to me or answer calls or anything, it's very difficult to manage. I try to manage it the best that I can and offer my support in all things that could help the situation but usually it all ends up in just waiting that it fades off, and it does fade off.

But the last time it happened I was very honest with him, that I needed some kind of communication, that I was also managing a lot of stuff on my own right now and I wasn't even able to have an honest communication from his side. I didn't ask for his support, he was surely in no place to give it to me, I asked for just something to remind me that he's there... He said that it is what it is and that it has always been like that and I should be used to it by now because he was already feeling bad enough and didn't need my complains to add to it. This kind of phrase was not new to me because it was something he had said in the past many times on similar situations, but, right now, it just hit differently. You know that feeling when you achieve something on your life or are working to it and you are going to share it with your partner? It hit me when I thought about doing it, but didn't because it was pointless, he wouldn't care. Or even smaller things, this week I gave 3 classes as substitute on a different school from the one I usually teach because the teacher was off because of covid, I broke my car, I planned 2 projects for my master degree, I read one the best books of my life, and I didn't tell most of it to my partner because it was pointless. Maybe any of us is at fault but I don't know if this is sustainable long term... if someone has any advice I'd surely appreciate. I love my partner to bits, but I don't want to be like this, I don't want to feel like all achievements on my life are nothing, I was like that years ago, with a different partner, and I'm not going to be that person again.",14Nov2020,1

Bit of background, due to a work related wrist injury I’ve got both arms in casts and have been like this for nearly four months with almost no improvement. I can’t lift anything heavy or write and can basically do nothing. I’m am able to use my phone as it’s light, and have been watching tv when I can. 

However, my parents keep saying I’m spending too much time on my device and this is becoming more often. This is understandable but because of my arms I literally cannot think of anything else I could do instead.

127,"Alright Reddit, I need some advice. 

Back story: I have lived in Florida my whole life. Only been out of state maybe 3-4 times. My entire family is here, we have some gorgeous property in the forest where I grew up. I love it here. I have a horse, work a boring warehouse job, and have no direction or passion I want to pursue as far as career.
 
My significant other has moved around the country a lot, and doesn’t really like Florida. He is set on moving to Oregon. He tells me all about how beautiful the state is, there’s so many things that sound amazing. Me, having never really traveled, am intrigued and really would like to visit and possibly even move. 

I guess my question is, how do people just pick up everything they own, and walk away from where they’re at? I am super interested in the thought of moving to a different, but of course the thought of leaving my family and completely uprooting myself is slightly nerve wracking. But the part of me that’s excited about the idea is outweighing the hesitant side. 

And then the struggles of finding a place to live, a job, and arrangements for my horse are daunting. Does that come before or after getting there? Obviously living arrangement first, the job (I really have no idea what I want to do career wise) then horse after. The cost of it all is also a huge factor. 

I am not in any way thinking about this to just stay with my significant other, I’m not trying to “follow” him and disregard my own needs and aspirations. I am genuinely interested and really liking the idea of moving away and starting fresh. Of course I’m sad to leave my home, my family, and all the friends and connections I’ve made. I guess the follow up question, how do you deal with that? What’s it like leaving everything behind and moving?

TLDR: How do people deal with picking up and moving away after living somewhere all their life, and handle the sad part of leaving family and friends behind?",14Nov2020,1
128,"i got out of work at closing for the first time today, and when i got to my car, i didn’t see any other cars in the lot, however my manager was leaving as well. i was already starting to exit the lot before i thought to ask her for a ride. I then saw the city bus pull up in my rear view and i assumed she got on that to go home, however i’m not entirely sure. i would love to help her out and offer her a ride home, but here are some things i’m thinking.

if she doesn’t need a ride, and she does have a car i didn’t see, she might get very offended that i assumed she didn’t.

if she does rely on the bus each night, i could ask her, however maybe she would be embarrassed to admit that she needs a ride, which is understandable. 

also, what if she lives very far from my house. i don’t want to get locked in to going way out my way each night to take her home, although i’d love to help in some way.

129,"Okay... so basically this is the deal.

I currently work as a teacher, I really like my job and get alot out of it. I teach 16-19 year olds who have behavioural/social issues and haven't had a great education so aim to get them on the right track, help them explore ways to gain employment or move into higher education (college, uni etc.)

For the past few months however I've because a little tired of it. Not because of the kids but because of his stats focused it is and if another F.E teachers from UK are reading this, its VERY marketised and it's generally a bit of a disheartening mess.

SO... to perk myself up and to give myself something to do... I took to teaching myself video editing and animation with this new computer I got... what came from it was me making these stupid little animations and then I thought I'd put them up on youtube... and would you believe it but they have started getting good views and I have gained alot of subscribers...

Anyway... a very prominent TV company got in touch with me after seeing these and asked me to write a script for them similar to these animations I was making... I said ""yeah okay"" and wrote them something.... they only paid me a small fee for this but I thought it was a great chance. Months went by and nothing back and I just thought ""whatever... I made some money"" and continued on with my work and doing the animations on the side.

Last week this tv company got back in touch and said they liked the script so much they want me to take it to the next step and animate it for them for a fee. This fee is literally a months pay but it's going to be ALOT of work and I cant juggle a full time job with it. If this is successful theres a high chance this could lead to a career as an animator or in this industry and it's sort of like a lifelong dream kind of thing... 

I want to make the leap but at the same time I am very scared. My girlfriend said she will support me and is ofc very proud of me but she too seems weary as it's sort of going into the unknown. Am I dumb to do this? My thinking is jobs come and go but chances like this are so scarce that it could be worth the risk? Or am I being wreckless?

Excuse my English it is not my first language please correct me where I have gone wrong 
So my fiance asked her friend whose partner is related to me if she fancies staying over tonight because my partner had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago  and she felt like she needed a friend because she's having a hard time.

 Well her partner told her she's not allowed to go  because their 5-year old might want her to get up with him and she might be able to go next weekend and it turned into an argument and I told them I do not want my hopeful future child to be around such  toxicity because I don't agree with a man dictating when a woman can and can't be with her friend.

Especially when my fiance needs her friends at the moment. I have been there for her as much as I can but sometimes she needs a female to talk to.

The problem I have the most is my fiance has always been there for them babysitting whenever they need it and paying so much for their child she treats him like her own but when she needs her the most they are willing to turn they're back on her.

My fiance has missed out on so much to help them when they need it for example her friend got pregnant purposely when they had booked a holiday abroad and my fiance lost £200 and she didn't care  she still did  and paid for a baby shower she also missed out on going on holiday with her family on a cruise because she paid for the holiday with her friend.

I, having been the victim of anger and threats due to rebuffing males in the past sent an email reply of ""thanks for letting me know, but this is inappropriate and we shouldn't talk about this anymore"" and decided to basically go no contact except for when professionally unavoidable. He replied back something to the effect of ""oh I get it... wink wink"". Then the pandemic hit and I couldn't work due to lack of childcare for months. During this time he emailed me and I ignored said emails. when returning back to work I was relieved that we would be working in different floors and not have contact. Due to how uncomfortable he made me at work I decided to look for other employment and found a job making double the money in a field I'm excited to explore.

I did notify one manager that I was leaving due to his harassment and she said she was sorry but we didn't talk about any further actions.

this man is now emailing me at my home email telling me that we could have had a friendship the last several months, there was a lot of mention of 'us' and how I must be hurt? then he goes on to say he hopes I can live with myself after the way I've treated him.

I'm scared. My husband knows bout the whole thing and says to either ignore the email or send a reply of no hard feelings sorry for the misunderstanding and hope he leaves us alone.

136,"Hey guys. I've never posted on here before but have read many stories which lead me to finally type this long story out and ask for some serious advice. I'll try to be as clear as possible even though I'm a awful story teller. I'm sorry for any mistakes. Thank you so much. 

6 years ago I (21f) met my current partner we'll call him Brad(21m). We met in high school, we were 15. We dated for about a year when my family and I realized the abuse he was suffering at home with his mom and step dad violently breaking up and kicking Brad out, and his bio dad who he has NC with is a violent alcoholic and abuses drugs. My dad decided to move Brad into our house. It was actually kind of thrown at me, obviously at the time I was excited but 21 year old me now sees the million problems with living with your bf at 15. my dad didn't really talk to me about it just told me to come down stairs so he could talk to Brad and I. He let us know what was going to happen. Now it's been about 6 years Brad has lived with us now. There have been many ups and downs with this whole situation. Since day 1 Brad hasn't worked, and to be honest for the first few years was a spoiled brat to myself and my parents, he didn't want to lift a finger or help anyone out, all he wanted to do was play video games. Our relationship hasn't always been the best. He is kind of the polar opposite of me as I've always loved hard work and am pretty outgoing person. I've always done everything or both him and my parents. Both of my parents have had issue with him but haven't gone to him to talk or asked him to leave (which I was surprised they hadn't). They kind of just tell me and tell me how much they dislike his behavior. which really put me in a weird place mentally. Brad and I discussed many times why his attitude and stuff needed to change because I couldn't really take this anymore. That was right around the start of the pandemic. He kicked it into high gear and really did a 180. He was there in a seconds notice if any of us needed help. (ex; built our chicken coop, helped me tend our 6000ft gardens, helped my dad build his business from the ground up. Built 3 greenhouses.) Even financially with savings given to him through a passing of a loved one he gave us all he had. He really went above and beyond for us. Brad and I started to notice on days where he was just having an off day my dad would go around and tell anybody that would listen how lazy brad is. This is where my dads behavior got even stranger.

My 21st birthday was in April this year and my parents wanted to do something big because they seen how hard I was working and thought that they would really surprise me. They called me down and told me for my birthday they were letting me get a puppy. (my mom has a slight allergy and huge fear of dogs) so this wasn't something I ever imagined I'd get to experience until I moved out. I exploded with joy, cried, the works ya know. Then my dad started to explain that his whole life he's been begging my mom for a dog and that this was my dog yes, but also for him. I breezed by this because I was just excited, stupid mistake. I found the perfect little bean and I adopted her from a lovely woman who's dog just had pups. I named her Salem :) So here is where the story gets weirder I guess you could say? Every time Brad or I would be around my dad with Salem, he'd make a comment like ""I picked the perfect dog"" ""my dog is the best"" or something like that. which at first I chuckled because I took it as fun banter. Then it became every single time we would be around he would make these comments. It was starting to really bother us because Brad started really feeling hostility coming from my dad when he said these things, especially if I wasn't around. I also noticed my dad would go against any training I tried to do with Salem and he told my mom it was ""so the dog would like him more""  So we just tried to not hang around as much and just kind of let it go. My dad then started asking me things like "" why are you keeping my dog away from me"" ""she's my grandchild"" ""why do you let brad abuse your dog"" These things really tore into me. At that point Brad was having a really tough time mentally and started attending therapy. He tried to keep to himself, be respectful and overall not bother my parents at all. My dad started to get angry about any little thing brad did, or didn't do. Even though during this time he did everything he could to stay out of their way. Even after my dad talking about him constantly behind his back, he didn't want to fight with him. It came to a turning point about a month ago.  We were harvesting our garden and all of a sudden my dad got up and said, ""things are going to change here. were going to talk."" So we went out in the blistering wind (dramatic scene ik) and very angrily said ""I hate brad, so does your mother, he's a piece of shit like his father, and you're going to be abused for the rest of your life. I want him gone, tonight."" Now, my entire world crashed down on me in those few seconds. My mind was racing, I had no idea where he would go, how to tell him out of nowhere my dad had said all these awful things, what we were going to do. I went inside bawling were my mom met e at the door with ""What the fuck are you okay??"" ""what's wrong???"" what's going on???? I couldn't bring myself to say anything and just ran upstairs. My dad came back inside and said ""I told her the truth, what she needed to hear. I want him gone"" and my mom started getting scary angry with him. She came upstairs to console me but was crying as well, she explained she didn't hate Brad my dad was just saying things in the heat of the moment all while Brad was in the next room prepping vegetables unbeknownst to this actual shit storm. she went back and fourth talking to my dad and then coming back and talking to me. she came up one final time and said "" he said to just forget about it, just drop it, pretend it never happened."" when i tell you i was floored. I don't really remember what happened directly after this expect trying to hide the fact i was crying because I didn't want to tell brad what just happened because he already felt like another family didn't want him so this would break his heart. I went in and we started talking about just casually getting an apartment, even though he could tell something was wrong I just used an excuse., we started looking. it was about a week into our search that my dad had sat us down to talk. He apologized for getting me a dog that wasn't actually for me at all he had just wanted a pet and used my birthday to convince my mom, all the passive aggressiveness, disrespect and pettiness he's been putting us through and that he had an offer for us. He wanted to give us the upstairs area of our house as an apartment for us. Originally the idea was wonderful, we paid very cheap rent, and he basically doesn't intrude and I get to keep a great relationship with both my parents and bf. Great. Its been a little over a month in and nothing has changed on his end, he still shames me for not letting him see my dog, getting my family involved and then they shame me, straight up not speaking to me and ignoring me 90% of the time. I'm at a loss now, I know the obvious thing to do is move. I'm working on that, I just don't want to lose my relationship with my dad, it's really creating a lot of unneeded sadness over everyone. I also don't think Brad and my dad will ever have a relationship again which really breaks my heart. Brad is really sad all the time now, not only bc of the way my dad treats him but mostly the way he seen my dad treat me and I think he holds some resentment towards it for sure. I appreciate any advice I can get, I need an unbiased opinion. I'm in a really dark place right now. I just want my family to go back to normal. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",14Nov2020,1

So, I've been home since March, graduated from university in May. Since then I've been looking for work.

139,"So I(16f) am currently dating my first boyfriend(18m). I've known him for just over 3.5 months and we have been dating for 2.5 months. We are really close and I hang out at his family's house every weekend.  
We were being normal teenagers and we thought nobody was home. He got on top of me and we were kissing(all clothes on, hands were in 100% jesus approved areas lol) 
I thought I heard something so I went to move but couldnt because I was pinned and didnt have time to tell him. Then his dad just suddenly walked into the living room. We made eye contact while I was still under his son. It was so embarassing I feel like crawling in a hole and dying.He literally said nothing and just walked around a wall in their house a second later, out of sight. We both immedeately separated ourselves and are super embarrased. 
My bf called me later to tell me his dad pulled him aside so they could talk and felt really disrespected in his own home (btw their family is quite religious and I was raised an athiest in case this is somehow important idk) I had no idea this would be seen as disrespectful, I'm not from the area I currently live so what is acceptable is a bit different and legit am just a private person which is why I was embarrased but now I know his dad feels really disrespected by our actions and I dont know what to do, 
I see this guy every single Friday and Saturday. How am i ever supposed to look his dad in the eyes again? How can i make his opinion on me not awful because of this interaction?  I dont know exactly what I'm looking for here, I just feel absolutely horrified and embarassed because I'm such a shy person with affection(no PDA ever, like handholding is basically it) and this situation has me feeling just awful.

140,"Let me preface by saying the clinic I work for has about 15 staff members, a privately owned Animal Hospital. Every health measure we could take as a team, we’ve taken. Some staff members are very paranoid, and others have downplayed the risk, throwing things like “we’ve all been exposed by now, I wouldn’t worry about it.” or bragging about their spouses who work for the Army and how many times they’ve been exposed and still haven’t gotten it... just blatant disregard for the fact that their spouse was exposed, thus them being exposed and coming to work. My spouse works in a correctional facility, on the perimeter of the prison, and they’ve recently had an outbreak. Based on the example set forth for me, I still went to work even though my husbands exposure was much bigger, thus mine being bigger. 

Some back story- this business has shamed anyone who calls in sick from work. I am on my 5th year with them and have maybe called off once a year for sickness. Getting vacation time that I’ve earned does not come easy. I’m always requesting my time off based on others and what schedules they work so nobody ends up short handed. I am always concerned with my teammates and their needs, often putting them before myself. When I am scheduled off, my boss and her minion waste no time to pick up the phone and call me at home to ask petty things that can wait. No other employee gets called at home when they call in sick or are on vacation, but their names get dragged through the mud for calling off or being gone. 

Low and behold, I tested positive for COVID last week. Any interaction I’ve had with the person below my boss (based on tenure, but is considered the same position as me) since then has been horrible. I have been shamed for getting COVID endlessly. Being reminded that our veterinarians could have gotten it, they could get seriously sick, or could’ve died. Guilt tripping me because I am still getting paid even though I got sick, which is- ya know, the law! They attempted to blame my husband and his job, but he hadn’t been at work for 12 days prior to my testing positive, and he got symptoms after me- so I got it first. I have followed social distancing and cleanliness, and went into work with a scratchy throat the day before, as if I slept with the fan on all night. (Mind you, I told them a few months ago I had strep throat, and was never once asked to go home for feeling ill &amp; having a fever) I always try to keep that ball in their court due to the blatant bad mouthing that goes on when you call off. They would rather you work sick than be short staffed, and that has been proven over the years. They always remind everyone that they come to work sick alllll the time. The moment I couldn’t taste my coffee, I asked to leave to get tested. My experience with COVID so far has been mild, I am thankful for that and also thankful nobody else at work got sick. Per CDC recommendations, the rest of the administrators that work close to me were asked to quarantine as well, who, thanks to an employee who called to see how I was, are also bad mouthing me that I tested positive. One younger team member complained that she has grandparents to protect, forgetting that I have a 6 year old son with underlying issues. As if I intentionally got sick or asked for it. 

Where I got it from, I have no idea. But does that matter?Is COVID shaming a thing? Is what they’re doing ethical? Legal? Any advice on how to handle this when I go
back? I have decided now is a good time for me to seek employment elsewhere, but I am having trouble with the pushback I have gotten in the meantime.

The tbi was extremely stressful on my whole family, as one can expect, but he made a full recovery, that was 4 months ago. Now the issue begins because he started drinking again after being released despite us telling him again and again he couldn’t, because he had been sober for the month he was in the hospital so it was the easiest time for him to quit. He refused to listen to us, and kept drinking insane amounts, refusing to go to rehab, and being an asshole and mean to us all the time. I forgave him for this as I understand he was addicted and it was very hard to quit, and I was as supportive as I could be. 

That is until one day he decided to get an Uber (my mom took his keys because he can’t drive) and got alcohol (2 15 packs)

 My mom took them, dumped them out. Mind you this happened after he stole from my parents to get alcohol. 


At this point I have slight PTSD( I am also suffering from depression due to other circumstances my mom and brothers are aware of this, it hasn’t been diagnosed as my mom won’t let me go to a doctor, but I do have iron deficiency which makes things worse) from alcohol and the smell in general makes me gag and cry. I was the one who had to dump them out. He then buys two more packs, which is when the main issue arises

 My mom took them, dumped them out, and then he went again. My mom then goes into his room, attempts to take them, he refuses, so she says she will take his door off if he doesn’t stop. He doesn’t stop, gets another Uber. So my mom takes his door off. 

My brother gets violent over this. He pushes my mom (I was outside the room to see what was happening as I heard a commotion) my other brother then protects my mom and my oldest brother goes over to his desk and pulls out a gun, and threatened to kill my mom and brother. I run outside and call the police after telling oldest brother I will call the cops if he doesn’t put the gun down, he didn’t so I ran outside. 

Luckily nothing happened, police came, no charges were made, it was probably the wake up call he needed. I feel immense guilt for calling the police, but I know it was the right thing. What I am wondering if I am the asshole for is not forgiving my brother. My mom and dad are very mad at me for not forgiving him, and holding this grudge. I feel horrible, but I can’t forgive him for pulling a gun on my family.  That event traumatizes me, and gives me nightmares. I was terrified that he might have hurt or killed one of us, but on the other hand he is my brother and i need to be civil with him and be caring enough to forgive him, because as my dad said it makes me the asshole to not forgive him, and I need to be the bigger person

 I want to know how, and if I should forgive him? I feel so bad, but I have a deep resentment for him after what happened but I want to be able to heal and move on.

Additional info: I might be holding onto this more because it happened a month and half ago, and since then my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer two weeks later, and passed away on the 31st of October which will probably forever ruin Halloween for me. my grandpa and I were extremely close and I was his favorite grandchild. He was the only person I felt completely safe around. So this has made me more stressed and sad, and just so much trauma has happened on top of COVID. So I

Might be holding onto this grudge longer because of the additional stress? ",14Nov2020,1
144,"I don’t know what is wrong with me anymore.
I suffered some crazy abuse by my father when I was young until I was 10 years old. I’m 23 now and I have listened to the words he told me since I was little. I feel like EVERYONE thinks and says them about me. I have barely any self esteem and I’m super anxious about my social life. 
I’m in school and I work and I’m going to get another small side hustle.
I’ll admit I’m doing better than I thought I would ever do but I don’t have no social life due to the fact that individuals can’t be trusted and they will treat me like my dad did. I work very hard every day to keep up with school and work but I don’t have anything else in between because I’m scared.

However another coworker is apparently claiming her as his girl he's gonna get, but I think she's cute as well so thats weird, plus the guy who ""claimed"" her is a good friend of mine. 

Anyway he added her into a work group chat we have on snapchat and through that she added me so I added her back. I never asked her in person for a snap or her number as she added me from the group chat. We haven't talked on snap at all but I want to, but I have no clue how to start. What do people normally send each other on snapchat? I rarely use it tbh.

147,"
It all started at the beginning of my sophomore year in my history class. Their was this girl,let’s call her Laurel,who I knew and became closer too. Over time we went from being acquaintances to being friends to being good friends. As we grew closer I grew a little crush on her and it seems she liked me back. We ended up hanging out and going on a “date” to the movies,unfortunately the next week afterwards disaster stroke. Coronavirus lead to major lockdowns and I fear that was the last time I saw her. We continued talking however,she even introduced me to some people from our school I didn’t know very well,we all became good friends and despite the world being hell things where good. Unfortunately life was getting hard. About two months after the quarantine started I found myself extremely overwhelmed between all my responsibilities and life in general. The result is I told them I might be off for a week,unfortunately a week turned into two,then three,so forth. Effectively speaking I disappeared. We spoke every once in a while but connection effectively died. We went from talking literally every day for hours to nothing. Looking back I can’t help but see this as my own fault. I feel extremely horrible and desperately want to talk to all of them again but I find I can’t. What’s even worse is I will be seeing Laurel likely very soon given a school concert we both play a part in. I have no idea how to introduce myself to them all again after all this time,any ideas?",14Nov2020,1

He and my Aussie are like best friends, but... he is AWFUL to my chihuahua. Who is smaller than he is. I don’t know why. The chihuahua has no interest in the cat never bothers him or instigates anything with him, but the cat attacks him so much that he pretty much won’t get off the couch anymore. Not even to eat. Also, the cat is not playing. It’s NOT play fighting. He does it to hurt. Goes after the throat/esophagus and claws the face. The vet found no known medical issues that would cause behavioral issues like these. Is this jealousy ? I DO NOT believe in getting an animal and then getting rid of it. I want to keep the cat and make certain he has a wonderful life here, but he is making my dog’s life miserable. So miserable he won’t eat unless I feed him by hand and he is losing fur due to the stress. Like I said I don’t want to rehome the cat, but if it comes down to it I may have to because my chihuahua is my heart and soul and he comes first js. WHAT CAN I DO ? 😭 I’ve talked to their vets, watched a million YouTube videos and read shit online. The cat has his own room (never locked in there the doors just always open) and everything to get away. I’m losing my shit over this 😭😩oh also I should add the kitten has been here with the chihuahua since he was 8 weeks old, so it’s nothing new to him. Any advice PALEASEEE ?",14Nov2020,1
157,"Hello. My friend and I are both in our early 20s. They've had a lot of stress in their life the past 2-3 years and I've had to emotionally and sometimes physically support them a lot, which I am happy to do. Unfortunately, I have a stronger emotional support system than they do, so our relationship feels pretty unequal often. Sometimes, I feel frustrated at the things they ask of me, and I'm not sure if my frustration is valid, or how to appropriately communicate boundaries. 

My friend is really struggling with mental health a lot and also has ADHD, which I know impacts our relationship. We live in different states, around a 16 hour drive apart. 

Today, they are staying with some friends but had some conflict with them - not an emergency situation, but they decided they wanted to move back to our hometown. They have been talking about leaving for maybe a month. They asked if I could help them move awhile ago, which I said yes to. But they never set a clear date. Today they told me they decided they wanted to move 10 days from today and asked if I could drive out to where they are to help and drive back with them. I wasn't expecting them to try to move so far in such a short time, and I feel a bit irritated that they didn't give me more notice, considering I work and I wouldn't even be able to request time off with such short notice. I've tried to express to them that I wish they had given me more notice, but I feel like I sound selfish and overly concerned with my own schedule - busy and cold, not making time for my friend. My friend said ""they don't want me to overwhelm myself trying to do everything in a week's notice."" I feel frustrated because it's not that I can't do it, or that I can't handle it, or that I don't care. It's that they chose not to give me more notice in a situation where they definitely could have. 

Part of my frustration is resentment. I feel like this person doesn't really take that much of an interest in my life or try to know what's happening in my life. I know this is a result of stress. At the same time, it hurts. It's not really their fault, though. They are being forced to make decisions alone too young and it's hard to do that. 

TLDR; Is it reasonable for me to be annoyed that my friend asked me to help them move across several states in 7-10 days? Am I being a selfish prick? Please feel free to be brutally honest, I think I can be selfish sometimes too. Thank you for your time.",14Nov2020,1
158,"I just turned 18 and my live has been pretty crazy lately. I live in a house with my mom, her husband, my two brothers, and my three half siblings (all three under the age of five). I have a job at Best Buy and on my days off I do postmates for some extra money. I am a senior in high school and all of my classes are online. 

My house I super stressful, I have to drive the little ones to preschool everyday and babysit them sometimes. I also have to do lots of chores, which would be fine if I actually contributed to the mess but I don’t really. My mother also makes me go to church every week and if I don’t go I have to clean the whole house (I do not share the same beliefs as her and I’m my view her church is a cult). My moms husband is super annoying and he hates me. I generally feel like I am under appreciated here and not very happy lately. 

I have a boyfriend who said that I can move in with him and his mom, who is onboard as well. I’m just not sure if I should move out. I want to move in with my boyfriend, we’ve been dating for a long time now and I like his mom also and she likes me. If I did move out, I would have to pay for all my stuff, like my car ($1500 payed to my mom monthly in $100 increments), car insurance, and my phone. I wouldn’t have to pay rent tho, which is nice, and his mom would pay for groceries as well. 

I think it seems like a good idea but everyone is worried that I won’t have any money (I figure I’ll be spending less than $500 a month and I make much more than that) and my mom says she’ll essentially cut me off if I move out. 

Any advice or opinions would be appreciated :)",14Nov2020,1
159,"So there is this girl, and I fell for her immediately. We were friends for a little bit before I asked her out, but she had just gotten out of a relationship where she had been cheated on and wasn't ready to dive into another relationship yet. So I said don't worry about it and lets just be friends then. Things have been going good for quite some time, but its low key starting to hurt by acting like these feelings I've got for her don't exist. Last week, I brought up the topic and she said that she's been feeling overwhelmed and just doesn't know.

I know that she has a lot going on. She has gotten special permission from the college to take more than a full load of classes, is preparing to enter pre-med, is balancing a rocky relationship with her mom, and has been diagnosed with some sort of anxiety disorder. So its no wonder why she feels overwhelmed. but here's the kicker, the rest of her college plan is just as hard as this semester is, I doubt her mom is changing any time soon, and her mental status isn't likely change while the rest of that is going on, and its all probably gunna get compounded if she actually gets into med school. 

She has said that she doesn't want to lead me on, which is why she is happy that we have just stayed friends, but she also knows that I want to be more than that.

In the past, I have been used by several women to help them get closer to something, and then discarded when I was no longer useful. Specifically, this has happened 3 times. And lately, I've been getting the feeling that my tally could potentially go up to 4. I've been helping her get good grades in her engineering classes (I know I said that she was pre-med, her college plan is fucking weird and I don't fully understand it so just roll with it) and its beginning to feel like she doesn't really talk to me unless she needs help on something.

I realize this has turned into something that would be more appropriate to post on r/rant so ill just sum it things up real quick.

I really like this girl, and she knows it and I'm worried that I'm getting lead on and will just keep waiting for a day thats not going to come. I don't really know what to do. I don't want to just up and leave because she has become a big part of my life, but i know that something has to change or this is just gunna keep hurting. 

I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks for your time.",14Nov2020,1

171,"I broke up with my ex fiance of a year and a half about a month ago, I pry should have broke up in person, I know. I was extremely overwhelmed and distraught at the time and felt that this was the right thing to do since we lived 2 hours apart and he would not give up his auto mechanic job for me. I also did not want to give up my Independent Service Provider job with my autistic brother (26M). He was really pressuring me to move for him and it just stressed me out and I figured I shouldn't feel that way. So after I broke up, he immediately asked about arrangements to get my stuff back and acted kinda pissy with me. Then some days later we talked on the phone and he gave me shit about how I ""gave up on him"" and left him to take care of his new apt. on his own and said that he would have never given up on me. Then he told me that his family is ""not happy with me"" and that they told him he should have kept the ring that I mostly paid for. So I texted him some days later and told him that I thought it would be nice if we could meet for lunch soon to go over things again since I felt like I was ready to do that. He seemed happy with that idea and kept saying how he still loved me and missed me and that he would let me know when he could do it. A few days later tho I didn't hear anything back from him at all. So I just asked him how he was doing and then said that I was just surprised he's been quiet with me the last few days. Then he said that he's confused, first I say I want to not talk but then I ask him why he has been quiet and that he doesn't know whether I want friendship or to fix our relationship with the lunch date idea and that if I wanted the latter, he doesn't know how it would work due to him climbing the ladder at his job and me not wanting to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and leave mine. He then said he ""sees something that would make it hard for him to be with me again unless it changed"" which I didn't know what that was. So I explained about how I feel like I might be ready to at least discuss our issues again and maybe try to come to a compromise of some sort and asked him what he meant by something needing to change. Also kinda told him I don't appreciate being told that I'm in my comfort zone keeping the job I have. (He thinks that my job is easy) Then he sent me a long text back and this is a big part of it:

""I don't think your job is not important.  I know I said it, but I know it's not true.  I guess I was just irritated because it was holding you down and I wanted to whisk you away to be mine and shape our future too.  I honestly didn't really know how I was going to do it, I just got desperate, because i love you so much and I made up my mind about keeping my job because I'm happy there and I'm improving financially. That opportunity doesnt come often. I didn't want to work somewhere miserable.  Somewhere that I would come home mad all the time to you.  I wanted a happy balance.  I didn't know what to do, I just was trying to make the best financial and healthy decision for our future and keep you at the same time.
I feel like you are very dependant emotionally and on a couple other things. I need someone that is independent and and can do things on her own too.  That way we can depend on each other.  I also need someone that knows what it is like to step out of there comfort zone to be able to handle different difficult situations in life.  I don't think I could do this if you don't move.  These are the things I was talking about somthing changing.""

Tbh the last part of the text insulting my apparent lack of ""independence"", etc. kinda pissed me off. So I called to ask him for more clarification. I wasn't like in a rage or anything, just pretty matter of fact in asking for answers and explaining/defending myself. I explained that I drove by myself, came to see him a lot, helped him pay for a lot of stuff, helped him upstairs when he would sleepwalk, etc. and idk what he meant. He seemed a bit dumbfounded but said that I didn't want to drive sometimes and little things like that. I'm like wtf ok. Then he said that he thought I was too sensitive/emotional about the things he said sometimes and he can't deal with that. Tbh, he would get irritated and kinda go off on me a lot to which I forgave him every time he apologized. I never screamed at him or anything abusive. I was pry just offended or upset which was warranted. I asked him why he couldn't say anything good about me and then he said ""well, aren't the bad things just as important?"" Then he said I was not confident enough, that he is happier w/o me, and that he lost feelings for me. I was crying and devastated. He hung up shortly after all this.

173,"Sorry for my english

I had a friend who i loved very much. We shared a lot and i always felt that i can trust her. She supported me a lot. Let's calle her M. 

Three years ago we were visiting my hometown with her and my mom. We were on the kitchen and she decided to share something very personal about her childhood. She told us that her adoption when she was a baby, wasn't very legal. My mom got very nervous and said something like ""oh, ok"" and changed the subject very quick. I start talking but M stood up and left the room. I wanted to talk to her but she locked herself in the bedroom. I talked to her a few minutes but she didn't answered so i thought that was respectfull to give her some space. I went to buy diner because the fridge was empty. 

When i come back M wasn't there. My mom looked worried. She told me ""M went for a walk and said that she changed her tickets and that she's returning home tomorrow. "" I felt very upset. ""She also told me a lot of things about you. Things that are not nice""  I was so confused so i asked her what was that M said and my mom told me that she said something like ""i can't sand her, she thinks she's perfect; she always wants to do exercise and i don't ; she's not nice;"" etc. I can't remember all of It because time has passed and apparently she talked a lot but she sounded like someone that hates me. I was so shocked and hurt. I was always good to her and i loved our friendship. For me she was like family. With her i felt safe. 

When she came back she didn't want to talk at all and the next morning she left. We never speaked again. She didn't return my calls.

The thing is that i don't know if i want to talk again with her because it's hard to forget all that mean things that she said.",14Nov2020,1

My problem lies with masturbation, I dont have trouble doing it, actually I do it a lot, but, I do it way too much  like 4 time a day which I want to stop, but that isn't my problem, my problem is what I masturbate to.
I only use to masturbate to normal porn, nothing else, but then it got boring and I started watching anal porn, then deep throat porn, then stepsister and stepmother and then I got into anime and started watching hentai.
Before I write this keep this in mind, im not attracted to men nor children whatsoever, when I'm flaccid I hate even the thought of it, so everything I'm about to write I hate.
After getting into hentai I went back to normal porn, then I started watching loli hentai then shota hentai mangas, then I was obsessed with trap hentai, then I started watching trap porn, but it wasn't hentai, as in actually guys.
Before I write im not attracted to my family members is disgusts me.
Then all off a sudden I was masturbating to my mum and my sister, I was genuinely gagging at the thought of it but when I was hard I just didn't care, what I watch changed loads, I watch dwarf porn, granny porn etc basically anything, but now I only masturbate to trap porn, stepmother, loli and shota hentai and I hate it, its like I just can't get off to normal porn (which I can) like it'll start by me seeing some woman who i think is fit going on pornhub and thinking nah, then going to some hentai site or watching trap porn.

once the summer began the cases were down and we opened our bubble up to close friends we knew we’re taking it seriously. tgis was all fine until fall. cases r going up again and i think it’s because of the colder weather. my family, though, seems unwilling to go back to the way we were before. i understand it’s going to be hard to go no contact, especially for my parent who aren’t as active in social media, but i just keep thinking life’s going to catch up and we’ll get it.

Maybe 1 week later I was in sport's class and I asked her to apologize and she told me she didn't regret what she said to me.I was really mad because I would've liked her to see that what she has done is wrong and terrible.

since then things have been pretty good, i’ve seen basically nothing when we’re hanging out and it makes me happy that he’s keeping it private since it took so long to get here. although, i’ve noticed now even when i’m watching shows, movies, or anime in this case, wether it’s by myself or with my boyfriend, if a sexual scene comes up i find i get kind of upset afterwards because i start thinking about all the problems we’ve had with porn before and “what if he likes this stuff” or “what if i’m not what he wants” kind of thoughts and so on, i hate feeling like this and i end up in a bad mood and i really don’t want to take it out on my boyfriend, 

i really need some advice on how i can handle this cause i’m stumped, i don’t know if talking to him about it would help or if there’s something else but i have no idea what to do",14Nov2020,1
218,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years in January. He met my mom pretty early because I was still young and she said I couldn’t be around him unless she met him. She’s never liked him from day one. One thing I will say about my boyfriend is that he is extremely nice and polite but can be chatty and isn’t exactly a super masculine dude. He’s also 25 and working at chevron but I don’t care about that. My mom has various issues with him, but I feel like all of them stem from the fact I’m choosing to be with a man who isn’t well off. I think she expects me to seek out a man that can take care of me AND her. She’s started many blow up fights about it over the years. At this point I’m sick of it I truly love my boyfriend and want to be with him for the rest of my life. He’s always treated her with respect and has never said one disrespectful thing to her even when she’s attacking him. Should I just give up and accept my mom won’t support my relationship no matter what I do? Should I continue to argue and plead for her to understand I don’t care about those things and just want to be happy? I’m very close with my mom and this is the only thing we ever but heads over. I would never want to ruin my relationship with her but her issues with my bf cause me a lot of anxiety and stress I’m not sure what I should do",14Nov2020,1
219,"Hello all. For this Thanksgiving break my father booked plane tickets for us to fly to his family. For Thanksgiving my 2 young cousins and 2 grandparents will be there. Also note that we are flying to a state with many new COVID cases, some of the highest in the country. 

What makes this worse is that COVID cases are going crazy right now and we are traveling during the busiest time of the year. If this happened during the summer I wouldn't be as worried. My main concern is that we bring COVID back and specifically I am extremely worried that we will give COVID to our grandparents. 

I would be less concerned if we drove but he thinks a 12 hour drive is the end of the world. 

How can I tell him how uncomfortable I am with traveling for Thanksgiving?

222,"Ok, it may just be an over exaggeration, but ever since last March when my uncle died, who I was really close to, I found no real meaning in my life. This person became my father figure ever since I was born because my biological father was working overseas in Korea and my mom died due to pneumonia and giving birth to me.  Fast forward to a few years ago, my father and his new wife decided to take me here to Canada. I was never really close to my father, and ever since living here, our personalities always clashed, same with me and my stepmother. Granted, they never did anything bad to me, but it's quite exhausting and most of the time, I find it hard to breathe living with them. I'm someone who keeps things to myself so I never really learned how to show my real emotions. These days, its just exhausting to even breathe (excuse the pandemic pun). Alongside this, I'm really frustrated with finding myself. All these years, I thought I wanted to be a Computer Engineer but now, I am very anxious of whether or not I can succeed with this passion. At the same time, with my current state of being, my grades in school have taken a drastic drop. All I have been managing from relieving my stress is by watching anime, going to my new job, and playing with the emotions of others through teaseful humour to satisfy the emptiness I've been feeling inside. I've been feeling a bit shitty about myself - most of the people at my work think of me as a good person but I believe its just a mask I've hidden myself behind. I've given myself high expectations but to no avail, I always manage to fuck it up one way or another. I've been linked to 3 broken relationships between my friends (mostly girls) and their SO's jsut this year; In my own relationships, I always managed to make things complicated and I always found a way to get out of them by finding flaws with them that would make me want to leave. I really don't know what to do anymore. All I want is to be happy. I just want everything to be better than it is now. A bit selfish to ask given our current circumstances but I'd rather seek help now, than to give up all hope and end it all. Thanks for reading this overlong cry for help!

223,"More than absolutely anything in the world right now, I want to be able to pine for someone. I want to be able to experience the feeling of longing so desperately for another person that it hurts. But I can’t. I fucking can’t because of my sexuality and it sucks so, so much. 

I want to love and lust for someone. To think about everything they do and fantasize about touching them and being with them. But I’m asexual and I can’t. I realized I was asexual years ago (18F now) and I was content with it for a while. But then I started to think that I was being silly and just hadn’t met the right person yet. I’ve come to realize that simply isn’t true anymore. 

This is cringey and childish, but I’ve been reading a fanfiction recently that’s based around a song. I went to listen to the song and it perfectly describes what my idea of pining after someone is. And it just hit me like a ton of bricks that I’m never going to feel that way. I feel so sad and empty now.

I don’t even need them to want me back. I just want to want someone that badly. It feels so shitty being just nothing. No feelings of romance or sexual attraction whatsoever. I hate everything about my sexuality. My therapist suggested I try out what is essentially female viagra to make me experience these feelings. But I don’t want to have to rely on drugs to feel normal. I just want to be normal. I want to want someone, anyone.

Has anyone else ever gone through something like this? Did you grow out of it like I pray every single day I will? I just want to be normal. That’s it.",14Nov2020,1

Before we did anything I later found out she would tell her sisters to stop talking to me cause she “claimed me” I tried to slowly cut her off and she lost her shit. I started to like my fiancé currently and she lost it.  She Started a bunch of drama in my family my parents hated me for months I moved out with my current fiancé. When I mean started shit I mean to the most extreme. I was left with nothing and stranded for my self had to pay for everything.

226,"So my roommate and I don’t really get along, but it’s nothing hostile.

However, today I took a shower, and of course when I took off my underwear I put it on the ground. Usually when I’m done my shower I take it out and throw it in my laundry bag, but today I must have forgot because I walked in and my underwear was on the ground.

The thing is, I went to pick it up and it is SOAKING wet. Like it just got dunked in a pool.

I know it can’t be from little splashes from washing hands, there probably aren’t any leaks from anywhere, and honestly had to be my roommate doing something with it.

I don’t want to sound crazy and accusing of anything but what other reason would there for a pair of underwear to just be completely soaked out of nowhere?

227,"Burner account here. I’m a teenage community college student. My plan was to do 2 years in community college and then 2 at a 4 year to finish my bachelors, but that has gone to shit. 

I started last spring at CC and I did fairly well. I’m an A student when I try. In order to fit my timeline, I needed to take classes during the summer too, which I did. This was as covid was getting huge so all my classes were online. I didn’t have a problem in the beginning, but with it being summer, and online, I couldn’t focus on my classes and my grades dropped. The dread of explaining to my parents why I wasn’t doing well(I have to meet a certain grade threshold in order to transfer) got to me and I stopped doing work entirely. I ended up with a D and a C for summer semester. I told my parents I got As. Next comes late August and I’m going into fall semester. I started off ok, but I can’t stand online classes and so I fell into the same pattern. They think I have A’s in these classes too.

Now transfer deadlines are coming up, my parents think I have a 4.0 when I’m about to be kicked out of college, they are pressuring me to do more research on my transfer pathway, and I’m panicking. I can’t keep hiding my bad grades from them, especially since due to my age they will have to be involved in meetings with the college some way or another. 

I know that this outcome is purely my own fault, and the only thing to do now is to own up to it I guess but I still feel terrified and trapped. I’ve wasted a huge opportunity in my life just because I was too anxious to be honest about my schoolwork. I know that killing myself is never the right solution and I don’t ever want to do that, but lately I’ve been thinking about it more and more. (I wouldn’t ever do it so telling me not to is sort of redundant)

236,"I had covid symptoms on the 29th of October and stopped having them around the 5th of November. I had to get a test to see if I had covid to go back to work and it came back as positive. My doctor said Im not infectious anymore because its been 10 days since I first had symptoms and Ive improved and I have no symptoms or fever, but I cant get retested for clearance because it will still show up as positive. I just got my results back today as positive but I havent had symptoms since the 5th.

I havent seen my parents in about a month but most of my things are still there. I got kicked out of my house when the pandemic first started because I was seeing my boyfriend at the time and I didnt take work off because Im an essential worker and I was still scheduled to work. Everyone in the house wasnt working so they wanted to quarantine. I lived with my boyfriend for a few months but he was abusive to me. I went back to living with my parents because the abuse got too bad but I again got kicked out because I went to the gym so I lived with my boyfriend again for a few weeks until the abuse got too bad and I had to come home.

238,"My family, or rather mother got a dog under the premise of getting it for my special needs sister. ex blind dog, 1.2 years old at the timeish. sister is 18 (fracturnal twins with her sister, who also has special needs.)   
I initially said absolutely not to getting another dog, that it would be the 4th dog that we'd gotten, and that it would just have to be rehomed again. all the previous dogs lasted less then a month or just over 2 months within our household. She said that dad and her were on board, and both wanted the dog, and also wanted to get it to calm my sister down due to her disabilitys (being on spectrum, ocd, depressive disorder etc.)   
fast foward a few months, dad finally goes in for treatment for the hernia he has, along with a gastric bypass surgery. surgery flops somewhat, and he somehow manages to get a gall stone, from his partially removed gall bladder. gall bladder is fully removed, may still have stones and is very slowly recovering but is off work for the time being on very limited money.  
at the same time gemma, the dog, gets pancrietis. parents continue to push this on us, saying that unless we walk the dog every single day were going to have to rehome her due to being unable to keep up with medical costs along with taking care of the dog and our two cats/the rest of the family.  
I work currently two days a week due to covid, one of my sisters was vehemently against getting the dog, and my dad can't walk the dog. mum refuses to walk the dog that she wanted, because she's afraid of it being bitten by other dogs (i call a limited amount of bs, because all the times i've walked gemma and come across other dogs, she's never been bitten, and has been the most friendly amazing dog i've seen. it would have to be down to the other dog biting her, which is a semi-reasonable fear, but parents are saying that gemmas been bitten multiple times by other dogs whilst out on walks which is why i call bs.)   


Basically parents are railroading the choice, or rather my mother is, on that if i can't take care of the dog that she got, for herself basically (under the premise of getting it for my sister) that they can't take care of the medical bills, and will have to rehome her.   
I have adhd, and clinical depressive disorder. i've never been responsible enough or able to energy wise care for a dog. thats why i was vehemently against trialing another dog on the possibility of a rehome, because even if we didn't rehome it, that would mean i'd become the primary carer for the dog, despite being physically and mentally not in the place to care for one.   
Over the past almost year, thats been exactly the case, with my mother getting into screaming fits over me walking her dog. Dad also came clean this evening as we finally all talked about it in a room, as i'd never asked his opinion over getting the dog, and he'd never asked mine - we both agreed against getting the dog, and my other sister (the one the dog was not aimed for) also was 100% against getting a dog, as shes afraid of dogs (Even though she loves gemma now, 9 months in.) So basically it was all my mothers doing, wanting the dog, with even the sister with special needs (again on the spectrum with ocd/depression) vetoing against her wanting whats best for the dog, and saying that she never would of asked for the dog if she would have known it would turn out like this. I also have an inkling that mum got it pretty much personally for herself as this is the 4th attempt she's made over the past 5-6 years at getting a dog, and the only one thats stuck. all under the premise of losing weight walking the dog, of which she's hardly done, and only ever with other people. There was also talk upon her diagnosis of putting her down due to the medical costs at the time, but currently the dog is alive and well, and very happy.  


the thing is. i absolutely love gemma. i don't want to rehome her, as im not a heartless bastard i got attached to the dog i never wanted in the first place. i don't want her to suffer with pancrietis either. im unable to pay for her solo (not on my current very small wages), hell even care for her solo (Can barely take care of myself) but i don't want to potentially rehome her into a home that doesn't care for her the way she needs. im so afraid for this dog, and don't want to lose her, either to panceritis, or to other people. even if i can't care for her myself and am fully willing to admit that. I really have no idea what to do, and it feels like its become my sole responsability and sole fault that this dog might suffer with or without me, or might live happily with others.   


TLDR: Mother gets dog for herself, under the premise of getting it for special needs sister. dog becomes my responsability over 9 months despite me emotionally, physically and mentally being unable to care for a dog to the degree that it needs to be cared for. Family comes under hard times, harder under covid, due to multiple medical issues. dog gets pancreitis and we may have to rehome her. it would be the 4th dog that we'd have to rehome (the others being puppy trials.) I've become attached to the dog. i know we basically are being forced into a wall here and have to rehome her. I don't know what to do about it. Mothers making it out to be my fault, and it feels like it is.

It must’ve struck a chord or something because he’s been silent and/or hostile towards me since then. I’m sure there’s something more there he’s angry and hurt about but unfortunately he’s completely unwilling to communicate that with me. I’ve tried to reach out to make peace, even though he’s the one who initially hurt me. I’m totally willing to talk and work it out but he won’t budge and I’m not going to push him. I’ve done a lot of work in therapy on boundaries. 

My dilemma: I finally have a well-paying job so I’m getting pretty nice gifts for my family this year. I know we’ll all be together on Christmas morning (B currently lives with my parents bc of covid) and it’ll be glaringly obvious if I exclude him. He definitely doesn’t deserve anything from me, but I also don’t want to stoop to his petty level.

I am currently roommates in a dorm with a friend from high school, but I am have some issues. First is that we are polar opposites, he is the most extroverted person I have ever met and he never stops talking. On top of that he is the most narcissistic arrogant kid I have ever meant. Among other things he is constantly on the phone everyday whether its his family, girlfriend, or on discord playing games. Some days I would say he’s on the phone for at least 6 hours at a time. Some days he even stays up to 4am playing video games. I am pretty introverted and need to be alone at least a little bit to stay sane but I am finding it very difficult. Whenever I am really overwhelmed I leave and go outside or to the lounge to read but it’s progressively becoming more hard to deal with. I am considering switching to a solo dorm room next semester but I don’t know to go about telling my friend.

there’s a girl who says she fell in love with me. i don’t know how it happened, but she says that we are “soulmates” often. neither of us are allowed to date, and i want to go to medical school and become a physician. i told her that it’s unfair for her to wait for 13 years for me, and especially because i don’t want to place a bet on something to last for 13 years down the road, and she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. i want her to be my friend, and not my enemy.
i also don’t want her to feel chained to my side for 13 years, through college, and medical school, and residency, wherever i go (it may be out of state). i feel like a complete douche, and a lot of our mutual friends are taking her side. am i in the wrong for telling her that we shouldn’t place our bets on each other right now? i just feel like i should focus on my career goals, especially since i want to go into a field that is educationally intensive.",14Nov2020,1

The situation begins when my moms goddaughter needing housing and coming for us to help. So we do. We have an extra room in our house and it became hers. Though the day she moved in with us my mom pulled me into her room and said that under no circumstance is she allowed to be in their room since, word is she’s a drug addict and a thief apparently. 

She settles in and tries to find a job. We’re in the middle of a pandemic in the US, so not the best place to come at the moment. No luck. She says she found a job one day, and goes out the next day all day apparently to “find a job.” She comes home very late. I’m writing this as she just left AGAIN and it’s only 10:36pm. 

It’s been about 3 weeks since she’s moved in and no job still and she keeps coming home late, though I will say she has helped around tiding up the house. That doesn’t make up for not having a job and coming to us for help specifically to help her find a job and stay for a few...idk days, weeks, months? My parents never told me. I have heard rumors about her wanting to bring her sister with us at her own mom’s request. Which annoyed me since she isn’t working and is just going out like a teenager, she’s 22 and has 2 kids in her home country. 
 
I keep trying to bring this up to my parents how she needs to act like an adult and a parent who needs to help her children back at home. They’ve accused me of just hating her for no reason and that I like no one but my own friends. Though they are sorta hypocritical since they insist I keep my door open to keep an eye on her when I’m at school and they are at work. 

I keep insisting to my parents that they need to set rules for her as they do me, but they keep saying they’re not her parents and they don’t need to raise her. But with the pandemic in the US becoming worse by the day it gets annoying seeing her come home late and seeing her go out knowing she might come home sick. My parents are both in their 40’s and they are aware of the seriousness of this pandemic and it still bothers me they don’t do anything about it. 

So are they being walked over? How should I bring this up to them?",14Nov2020,1

253,"My parents divorced when I was 8 and my mom has been my sole parent after my dad walked out of our lives and left us in a bad spot. I’m nearly 20 now, and after years of not acknowledging him I’m starting to think more about how it’s impacted me. 

I haven’t had a true father figure since then, nor very strong male figures. My mom is an educated and very strong woman and she’s done a great job raising me and my sister, but I still feel like I’m missing something. I don’t have a solid grasp on my place in the world and I feel like I’ve lost direction.

Furthermore, my father has never reached out to my sister or I, and the few times my mom has spoken to him he’s been uninterested. It’s weird thinking about how my dad essentially abandoned us. He’s been remarried and divorced at least once since then, so clearly he’s moved on with his life. Is it really worthwhile to reconnect with him? 

If not, what are ways that can help me find focus and carry on with my own life?",14Nov2020,1

258,"My mom forced me to go to a private school that I never wanted to attend. Ripping me away from all my friends, except for one, but she’s kind of toxic. All of my old friends go to another school, and I want to transfer there... but I can’t, because my ~~parents~~ mom would never allow me, and I’m not sure how to feel about moving schools in sophomore year or in second semester of freshman year (I’m a freshman right now). I feel so sad and I miss my friends, I hate it here. 

My mom is hellbent on my brother and I going to single gender schools, just because she went to one when she was in high school. She liked it, so she just thinks that we HAVE to also share this experience. And when she wants something done, by god, will she make it happen. My brother also resents her for making him go to an all-boys school, but he’s over it at this point, because he didn’t want to stand up to my mother. 

I also understand why my parents wouldn’t want me to go to the other school for real reasons. 1) My dad can’t drive me there in the morning and neither can my mom, 2) They think the education I will get there will be bad, 3) There are benefits to single gender schools, 4) It’s too much work to transfer, and I run the risk of not actually liking the school after all. 

I can counter these points because 1) I can carpool to school, there’s someone in my neighborhood who goes to that school, and my friends who go to that school think we would get along. (I’m not entirely sure what I’d do if she couldn’t drive me though, so this point isn’t fully functional). 2) The education I get at my current school isn’t really the best 3)There are benefits to single gender schools, but I don’t personally profit off them so it doesn’t matter to me. 4) I’m willing to go through that effort.

There are also other problems, like my friend who goes to my current school would be angry with me if I transferred, but... she’s kind of toxic. She punched one of my friends in the face after she “scared” her (I saw the video... she did NOT scare her.) and my biggest issue with her is that she talks about people behind their backs. That worries me because I’ve heard that people who talk about your friends behind their backs also do it to you... and she is good at making friends so I’m not too worried about her if I left. and there’s maybe like one other girl who would miss me a little I guess. But I just can’t see any benefit to staying.  

I also dislike the teachers at my school, they try way too hard to be our friends and I just dislike it. You’re here to teach me, not be friends with me? It’s just very confusing. And the school atmosphere is too serious at times, because girls can be that way haha. 

There are a couple disadvantages to me transferring though, like...
-I don’t dress very femininely, or, well, completely normal. So I may be a target for some people to make fun of. But I don’t see that as being a huge issue because we wear a uniform. 
-Actually getting to school might be an issue if I’m relying on a carpool, especially considering my dad also has to drive my brother to school...which is 15 minutes in the other direction. And my school is also 15 minutes in the other direction. So we’re talking an hour of driving total for him. BUT my brother is 15, so he will be getting his restricted license soon I believe. 


Please give me some advice. Should I even transfer at all or should I just work harder to make friends at my current one to be happier? How can I get through to my mom? I’m just so confused right now and I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated.",14Nov2020,1

Originally my mom wanted to fly to Florida, but we changed plans to drive because of COVID and so I could see my sister and niece.

262,"Skip to the end to give me advice I'm kind of ranting. So here's big wad of background, a large group of us are trying to help someone find their cat but we aren't that organized. It's a FB group and we don't actually know each other just on a look out for lost cats. One person shared a post of a person from a smaller town who found an orange cat kind of similar to hers. Problem was the picture was pretty crappy since it only showed the cats front  in bad lighting.  The cat had been missing for a month so maybe his appearance changed a little was the thought. The person looking for their cat got a little too excited and came off too strong by constantly posting multiple pictures of her cat in the comments of that single post and asking to see more pictures of the cat to give herself peace of mind. The person was apparently busy with family things and didn't think to respond. The teenage daughter decided to comment and asked the person looking for her lost pet to stop ""harassing"" her mother. Poor choice of words if you ask me. 

 There was only one person out of five actually harassing though who was calling the family liars and not kind since they wouldn't show more pics of the cat she was the only one to firmly believe it was the missing cat we were looking for but we just wanted to see better quality photos.

The women ended up blocking all of us associated with the woman looking for her cat.  I was unfortunately blocked too. But all I did was ask a person who said they saw the cat around often who they thought the owner was. 

I contacted the daughter and apologized for overwhelming her mother with comments and that one person calling their family liars did not reflect the group. I also stupidly asked if her mother could unblock me.  

""Thank you for your apology, but you and your group’s comments were scaring our family."" 

"" And since we do not know any of you personally and you are not customers of ours, my mother will not be unblocking you

There is no reason for us to be friends with you or your friends on social media platforms that include our personal information. It is scary.

We have found the owners of the cat, so there is no reason for any of you to be contacting us or even looking at our pages. We were just trying to be nice.""

After I responded saying I understood...

""Okay. Thank you. Please tell them that we hope you all find Tommy, but to please leave us alone. In the future, you all need to go about your business in a more polite and quiet manner that does not make people fear for their safety or sanity. Respectively, if any one else comments on my mother’s post or shares it, they will be blocked, and if we see anyone in person or if we hear of anyone asking personal questions about us, we will get a restraining order filed against them. 

 Thank you for reaching out. I will be blocking you at 8:00pm. ""

It just makes me really upset that they think the answer to things is blocking. Like the only one she needed to block was the one commenter insulting her family. This all happened within 24 hours. It's not like the comments were being asked for an entire week and multiple people were messaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need help getting this off my mind. I feel bad for them. But I also don't feel like I was respected as a person during our conversation. I was just trying to be nice too but clearly that backfired on me too.

Long story short, over the past few years, my friends have been victim of fake pedophilia and grooming claims online. They can’t provide proof and they never tell the same story twice and people who were there even call out their bullshit. They have never ever showed any sexual interest in minors, and the “grooming” was a general innuendo ONCE to one person. 

But it’s the internet and cancel culture is strong so even without proof (legit people saying they didn’t even check the post, they just saw someone saying it and believed it) so they were massively harassed to suicide. (They are okay now)

They are my friends and I have a strong character so obviously I defended them but I was just another person to call out. Because of this popular people spread my name that I was also a pedophile and a groomer. Obviously it’s not true, but it breaks my heart anyway and just knowing that’s what people say about me fucking taints me. 

They said I was a danger to minors. When I saw my niece and nephew the next day I broke out in tears, because what if I am? They said that I wanted to write a child book, and I quote, I am “not someone who should be around minors”. 

I had all my book planed. I had the designs and the text and everyone on facebook was encouraging me and were so excited to have their own copy. I was finally realizing my dream. 

But now when I thinl about it, about continuing, I just... feel disgust. I hate myself and I hate the book and I can’t even bring myself to draw the character. 

I know the claims are stupid. But it’s there for everyone to see and now I’m afraid. I don’t want to publish my book is that’s the message I’m gonna get. I’m terrified, and I feel like my dream is fucking ruined forever and my story will never be out there. 

I want to get over this. I want to be proud of my work once again without feeling ashamed or afraid. I want to focus on the people who encourage me, but I can’t. I just keep thinking about the people saying I’m a groomer, pedophile and a danger to kids.

I said that made me feel sad and guilty, that i’m sorry that i give him those feelings. Then he said: it is not your fault. Then i asked: do i give you the feeling that you need to help me with problems everyday? He said: no, sometimes.

Now i feel guilty and sad. I do not want him to feel that he has to babysit me. I did not see him during corona for 6months, he was at this parents. And i lived on my own before, i do everything myself. I do not have the feeling that ask a lot of attention or that I discuss problem to much. I do it more than him, but he rarely shares his problems (maybe 1x a year)
I makes me feel sad that he feels that way. I do not want him to feel sad or tired because of me. That was never my intension.
I have the feeling that i need to end the relationship with him, not for myself but to ‘save’ him.",14Nov2020,1
276,"So growing up, I (22F) had about 7 people that I would consider close friends of mine. I was never a very sociable person, I was (and still am) very awkward and insecure, so I admit that I wasn't the easiest person to hang out with sometimes. Over a year ago, I moved away from my old home after I got married to my Husband. (26M)

Throughout the course of over a year, virtually none of my friends have reached out to me at all to ask how things are going. I have taken the initiative a few different times to reach out to them first and see how they're doing. However, whenever I reach out, I either get left on read right off the bat, or I'll get left on read halfway through the conversation. After this cycle repeated for several months, I started to get increasingly anxious and depressed. 

I spoke to my Husband about this, and he basically said that I'm just overreacting and that my friends just have their own lives to take care of, so it's probably nothing more than that. I feel really conflicted and confused, on one hand, I feel that my Husband is right and they just have other issues to deal with. On the other hand, I have this sinking feeling that my friends were only ever friends with me out of pity, because of all my emotional issues. 

Now that I'm no longer in their lives on a regular basis and have moved away, I feel like they simply have forgotten about me since they no longer have to put up with me just to be nice anymore. This really hurts me, and I can't talk to any of them about this, because I don't want to come off as clingy or high pressure. It's already extremely difficult for me to make any friends, I have no friends where I live now, and the last thing I want is to lose the very few friends I've managed to make over the years.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Am I just letting my negative/irrational thoughts get to me? What should I do? 💔",14Nov2020,1

282,"Hi all! So my sleeping schedule is completely whacked out rn. It's not so that I can't sleep, more so that I can but only for maybe 2-3 hours tops. Then I'm fully awake. Occasionally after that I'll call asleep for maybe another hour.

For example, last night I fell asleep at (I think) 11:30. I slept really well until around 3:30 (I think) and then no matter what I did I could not sleep. Durning the day I feel tired but I can still do whatever it is I need to do.

286,(25 F) Hi so I’m just going to say I’ve experienced a lot of trauma. I’m not going to say what but I’ve battled depression practically my whole life. I was doing pretty okay until the beginning of this year when quarantine hit. Anyways I’ve been in a depressive episode for the last week and I’m just feeling really lonely. I feel like I have no friends to talk to. They’re all busy with their lives I also lost a very close friendship this year. I talk to people online when I play games and I made friends with them but recently they stopped talking to me. The loneliness is just really hitting me. Does anyone know how to get themselves out of this situation? I’ve tried doing things that bring me joy and that works for a little but then I’m back to being depressed and lonely.

The day of the campaign came and I was told it was canceled. No biggie. I asked about our other coworker who was going to meet us after work and follow us and they said they didn't tell her so I tracked down her number and texted her. I also asked the one it wasn't canceled for if he wanted to come to my place instead and he said he wanted to go home and spend time with his

The work night ends and we are all pulling out of the parking lot. The one who said he was going straight home turned toward our DnD host house instead, and because I was headed that way for food, I ended up following him almost all of the way there. I didn't mean to.

289,"I had a weird day at work and after work a couple of days ago, and I wanted to ask for advice on what to do should they happen again.

1) Probably 5-10 minutes before I opened the store I had a young girl and her mother tap on the store window. I thought it was important and opened the door (it’s locked) to ask what’s up, the mom was surprised we weren’t open yet. I usually open right on dot at 4pm, sometimes 5 minutes earlier but I was still waiting on tapioca cooking. (I’ve opened the store before while the tapioca was cooking, but there’s a high chance of burning yourself with the starchy water.)

I told her what time we open and to come back in 10 minutes. She came back then asked me to make drink A but add jelly, but if I could charge her for drink B because it’s the same thing right? I can’t even make adjustments like that. I simply said “no”, and I don’t know if there was anything I could’ve said either. Weirdest moment of work that day lol.

2) On my way home from work and it was fairly late (probably near 10pm) and this guy rushes onto the subway train through the door I (19F) sat nearest to. I looked up and he wasn’t wearing a mask (it’s mandatory on public transit where I live, unless you have health restrictions) but more importantly the whites of his eyes were red like he had taken something, he was also walking unsteadily. The guy sat down on the same bench 2 seats away, leaned in and asked my name.

At this point I’m slightly freaked out because of his eyes mostly, but I’m also not sitting that close to someone without a mask on. I live with parents over 50 that both work themselves, I’m not putting them at any additional risk. I got up and left, honestly it felt bad and weird to do but in this pandemic I don’t know what else I can do. I sat where there were four more people spread out, probably 25ft from my last seat. I looked back and it looked like the guy got up to follow but changed his mind when he saw the people (the area I previously sat in had no people within 10ft, but had a camera on the ceiling 2ft away from my seat).

I honestly felt bad moving away from the guy, I had conflicting thoughts (was he asking for directions? Etc.) after I moved but I’ve never had that level of shakiness hit me like that, after I got off the subway. Did I overreact? I don’t really think I did especially with the situation now, but was there possibly something I could’ve done better?",14Nov2020,1

She does not work at my location and volunteers to help us with overflow every so often. Would apologizing, especially a couple days or a week later be bad? My concern here is that perhaps by readdressing the situation she may feel further targeted and forced into a conversation she does not want to revisit.

297,"when I was 15 I met a guy online who was about 19 or 20 at the time. we met thru mutual said on Twitter and we became friends. my account was an anonymous stan account and he begged me to show him a selfie since he had himself as his profile picture. I did and he complimented me. 

eventually we traded numbers and talked outside of twitter. when we talked individually the conversations would always end up turning sexual in nature and he would talk about how my selfies would turn him on and how he wished he could see more. 

he pressured me into sending him explicit photos and videos on snapchat and he would send some of himself. he told me to call him daddy when I texted him and when I would send snaps. most of the time he would only reply if I was being sexual and since we lived in different states he would fantasize about what he would do to me if he flew me out to have sex with him. he always said that he had a girlfriend but was persistent with me. this went on until I was 18 though I stayed in contact with him on and off until recently. I reconnected with him and it was more of the same. 

During this time we were also in group chats with other Twitter friends but he wasn’t as explicit as when we were one on one. I also found out recently that he did the same thing to other girls on Twitter who were 18 and under, before I just assumed that I was the only one. 

I’m 21 now and there’s nothing I can really do because he’s apparently scrubbed himself off the internet and I never took screenshots of anything. I say I’m having trouble coping because I never really thought we were doing anything wrong. I think about it and I almost start crying and I just feel so dirty and gross.

300,"For a little background, we came from an extremely loving family. Maybe a little too loving. By that, I mean I don't think we ever received proper discipline or taught healthy habits growing up. My mother raised the three of us, an older brother, myself, and younger brother, mostly by herself with both financial and moral support from our family. Our father bailed on us as soon as he had the chance and moved several states away. I think from that, our mother was constantly working. She went back to school to provide a better life for us but in that, she never had time to cook. So began our weight gain from an early age. Whenever we struggled with something, she would offer to do the work for us instead of a real solution. I know she had good intentions. To this day, our mother is the most loving and supporting woman in our lives and we would be lost without her. I bring this up because I think it has left my little brother lost.

 He is 21 years old and currently in school. I think he has struggled the most with his self image. It has always been hard to tell what he's really thinking or feeling because he'll never take anything seriously. I now realize that he has always changed the subject with a joke or just plain out refuse to answer with a serious response to anything he considers 'emotional' or 'dramatic'. 

I just had a talk with my brother. It was probably the most serious and open I have ever heard from him. Long story short, he lost a lot of weight earlier this year and had a great group of friends to go out with. I think that gave him a lot of confidence as he worked toward his degree. Then the pandemic happened and we entered quarantine. During the event, he gained a lot of weight back. When the lockdowns eventually became less severe, his friends started to get together again but he would refuse to go because of how self conscious he felt about his weight gain. Now he's ignored them too long and they've actually kicked him out of their group chat. I don't think they had bad intentions. They probably just thought my brother wasn't interested in hanging out anymore. But that is so far from the truth. My brother doesn't blame them either. He knows why but I know he feels so upset. I think he might even be depressed and I've never realized until right now that he's been super good at hiding his true feelings.

Back to the talk I just had with him. He openly admitted to me that he felt useless. I've never heard him admit anything like this before or take a conversation so seriously before. I tried talking to him. I kept giving him all the support and love I could give in the moment. I told him he might be feeling bad right now but that it won't last forever. He can work towards bettering himself like he had before with everything, from his confidence to his success to his social life. I felt my heart break when he said he doesn't think he can. He kept saying he felt like he'll never be able to get out of this because he is too lazy and admitted that he is not happy. He knows what he has to do, but he just kept on repeating the same thing.

""I don't think I can.""

He's my little brother and all I want for him is to find happiness. I know he's not my responsibility. As his sister, I can show him support and try to introduce him to better habits, but I know he is an adult and he has to make the decision. But I can't bear the thought of him staying like this. I'm crying right now thinking about the state he is in and all I want to do is see him happy. I don't know what to do. What if he gets worse? What if he gains even more weight and secludes himself socially even more? What if this develops into depression? What if this holds him back and in ten years, he'll feel like a failure? What if this drives him to suicide??",14Nov2020,1

306,"Hi r/Advice, I have a fairly simple question for you:

I don't get along with my family, extended or close. I'm in my mid twenties. I don't think I've ever felt happily around my family, but I've gradually realised, over time, that they are... More toxic for my mental health than I probably ever knew before...

Anyway, I'm currently staying with my parents, due to the Covid situation, and being stuck in my home state, rather than where I would normally live. It's really, really awful. I've been here for six months, and I've almost never been this unhappy, in my life. I just... Can't bear it much longer.

Anyway, tomorrow my high achiever cousin has organised a gathering of extended family at her new house, local to where my parents live. She specifically wants to celebrate that she has gained herself a job that I always wanted, but which my Uncle deliberately interfered to prevent me from getting (this was a few years ago), because we don't get along, and he is head of that department...

I really don't want to go, to this gathering. It hurts me just to think of it. But I'm told I ""have to"", because the family wants to take photos, and my grandfather is old and has Alzheimer's (he was a prick when he was younger, but that's beside the point), so if I don't turn up, I'll be letting them all down.

I'm already refusing to be here for family Christmas. The only way I can justify that is to be as far away as I possibly can. I'm already planning a multi-day hike, on the other side of the country, so that they can't drag me back here against my will. I... Almost feel obligated to go tomorrow, considering this, but I also know that these same cousins, and other family members, manage to avoid the same events all the time, without needing to justify it, so why shouldn't I..?

Anyway, the pressure right now is enormous. From my parents, from my aunt, from my cousins. It's causing me a huge amount of stress.

I really don't want to do this, and I really want to get away. Any advice you might have would be much appreciated.

Thanks.",14Nov2020,1
307,"TW: abuse, mental illness

I’m 17f and have lived with my biological parents my whole life. Our house is unfit for human habitation with no water, no fridge, no stove, no toilet etc. But not poor or lower class — I just graduated from a relatively expensive private secondary school, we appear upper middle class. My mother is extremely mentally ill and my father passively lets her mental illness control our lives (see above unfit living conditions as well as almost daily psychotic rants - see my past posts for details). In my younger years she physically abused me as well, before I could defend myself. Her mental illness meant while she hated me she was also controlling down to a tee so I have no life skills. Can’t do a load of laundry or turn on a stove. Have no idea how to pay a phone bill etc. 

Now onto my issue at hand: I’m leaving home. I can’t live here anymore, it’s causing me harm. I have no will to live. I also have no money as I haven’t been allowed a job, I have no skills to gain one and no where to go. I have other family, however my mother has lied about our family situation so they perceive me as “out of control” and “abusive” toward her. And while she knows them, I barely do — I can’t turn up at their houses. Additionally because of COVID-19 my senior year was from home and while I had previously been averaging As, I flunked my final exams because I had no will to even pick up a book. 

So, to sum it up: No money, no job, no college, no school or work prospects. I can’t join the army in my country. I’m not legally an adult as I’m 17 but still above 16 so cannot get the state’s help. No friends or family I can stay with.

So I decided to do that thing where instead of cutting you just draw lines on your arm with a red pen. I was looking at the lines and I missed it. I missed when my arm actually looked like that.

I wiped it off and realized I must have went a little too hard my arm had actual marks. And I'm finding myself missing they say the cuts would raise up and I would run my fingers over them. 

I've noticed I've also been thinking about suicide alot more than usual and I'm getting scared for myself. I know deep down I wont do it but the thoughts are still terrifying.

I don't want to go back to that and I just feel worse now. I just feel like crying.",14Nov2020,1

She then tells me that she has been shipping me and herself for a year now, and has even made like these gacha movies about me and her getting together, and kissing each other... it just makes me feel so uncomfortable. Also she's apparently a 'yandere' (that's what she calls herself), and she calls me her 'little tsundere' or 'senpai' and stuff like that.. and I have no idea what to do about it.

19M in college. Freshmen. Some friends and I took a hike up to a local monument that is apparently closed at night. In the walk down my friend and I took a cardboard sign for a job offering on the walk down to our dorm. Cop stopped, got out, and told us to get over to the car and talk to him. He took our names, DOB, and general area of where we live. I do not want a disciplinary hearing. He said we won’t get in trouble but I don’t trust his pig ass. He said all this shit about how it’s stealing, and now that he has our names next time he catches us we’re gonna be in a lot more trouble. He took the signs back, then talked to all of our friends. Do campus police have to report incidents like this, and what should I say in case i get called to a disciplinary hearing?

And he ended up putting on a bondage?torture porno that had something to do with jigsaw?(the saw movie type thing I guess) he is 5 years older than me, so if I was 10, he would have been 15. I dunno.

315,"Hi all,

I've been working like crazy for the last couple of months and I'm supposed to take a license test. I just don't feel ready to. I've pushed it away several times - there were actual reasons to do so - yet my peers of course found out. So they keep taunting me about it. Everyone is somehow faster and better than me. Also I am the only one without any significant other on their hands. I feel stupid and worthless next to all the time, although I am working like crazy.

I have friends who try to be nice to me, but I know, they are only doing it to make me feel better. I have nothing to show for the last three years, although I had several prospects. Each turned out a failure. I blew it all. Not being lazy, quite on the contrary. I know I cannot do anything.

I made huge mistakes again and again. I find it very hard to change my working style (kind of a perfectionist) and I am terrified of making mistakes. Yet I do all the time and it gets worse every day.

The same with potential dates.

I seem to be an attractive person, because I regularly draw prospects. Yet - every time, I dare to ask someone out, it somehow fails. Either I am too eager, or too disinterested. It never works. I did have relationships, but they were with very odd people. Such people are still around me and I could date someone like that, but I know it's going to be the same abusive thing it was before.

TL:DR

I fail at every inch in my miserable life and am older than my now 'better' (in comparison) peers. I am pointed out and I feel constantly compared and unable to fit in. I hate myself. I know you're supposed to love yourself and be kind to yourself. Yet that is the truth.

What am I supposed to do with my lost life? I will have another try in three weeks, but I don't feel ready. Some peers are already asking questions about how I am procrastinating the license again. I know, that I don't know enough and that I don't want to fail - yet I also don't always want to be the 'weak' idiot.",14Nov2020,1
316,"I'm 21. From Country A.

At 3 y.o. Dad went to prison and my Mom was left alone with me and no Job.
Decides she'll leave me with grandma and goes to Country B.
1 Year passes, Dad leaves prison couse it was all a scam and they imprisoned the wrong man.

At 8 y.o mom comes from Country B, tells me:
"" Come with me to Country B"".

No more stupid school, can live life now yeah.jpg 

Mom scammed me, there was school and her at that time boyfriend which tried to be my ""Dad"", let's call him my step-dad. 

I hated school, I understood nothing and related with no one I didn't know the language.
Everyone just seemed like a dick, no friends but one, got good grades tho.
My step-dad was a dick, the old-forged kind of one, very bad tempered and agressive. I hated him, thought sometimes he was kinda good and caring, most of the time he was just mad at me for forgetting to do whatever chore I had to do, which resulted into physical punishment. I had good luck that he only came to that house for 1 week a month.

I never really struggled with getting good grades, but I always got yelled at for not studying (It is boring and repetitive).

From that point I and Mom changed house 5 times which envolved a School change every time.

Eventually  (3rd house change) we moved far and my Mom left my Step-Dad (probably couse he was a dick). And I moved where I'm now, a little port city with lots of turism.
Got into school, got some friends which are my friends now.

Mom never home (like usual), I'm left home alone most of the times until noon when mom comes to sleep after a hard day of work selling houses to rich people.

Got bad marks, have to retake the year.
Get to know girl during summer, meet her,  we like each other, we have sex and stuff.
7 months forward: Girl drops me, find another one. Ex meets her before I get to meet her.
WTF out of there, get depressed couse I thought I had found love but good proved a fool.
Miracolously pass the year (probably couse I studied good the year before).

Summer comes by, still depressed, ""would-be"" anniversary with my ex comes by, get even more depressed. Friends tell me to go out that day (months without going out), get to try weed.
Weed is okey I gueess as long as you don't abuse it much (like all the stuff).

Start new  academic year, half of the year and my mom decides to have out 4th change of house, so we have to move to her friend's house for a while. Mom went to other part of the country to work so I was at 1 hour on bus fron school and 0 to no cash for 2 months until we yet again have to change house couse she can't pay 2 rents, so I have to go with her to her place.


So i'm 18: 
New school, different subjects (not the one I wanted to study), no friends, no money, have to pay for mobile phone, food and internet myself, far from everything, living in a deserted Island with no trees but palms so it was always really Hot or Cold. Depression kick in again.
Stop attending school, can't focus on anything, just eternally sad about my life sitting in front of my PC playing games and crying.
Obviously mom didn't see all of this, and the problem as she sees it, is that I'm addicted to Video Games (same as what she thought happend when I was 8 years old and tried several times to trow myself trought the window).
Mom tries to break my PC, have to stop her, use minimal force, Mom begins to cry and says wtf I'm doing, that I assaulted her, etc.(she literally played victim on me wtf).

Say to mom: ""Look, I can't bear it anymore, I just want to be out of here where I don't have to stop you from crushing what little is left to contact with my friends and entertain myself so I'll go to the Capital to live with my friend""

Go to capital: All good and giggles until I have to find Job, no good Jobs, all shitty underpaid garbage, no money to sustain myself, friend has to help me with buying food.
Again no Job, always home alone couse friend has a normal life with a job and he's studying and has a gf.
Depression kick's in again, desperatly try to socialize, goes bad, get kicked out by friend.

Other friend tell me to come by and live with then for the time, do exactly that, all seems good, get to rent an apartment with 3 guys 2 of which are friends of mine. 
Think I can put my life in order, finish school, find a job.
Yea this is the perfect time fo- *Depression kick's in* don't go to school, just get high and drunk and play video games with friends.

Then Corona comes, we all have to get out of the house, go back to living at my friends house, changing houses every week between 2 of them.

Be me now.

In country B, 8 in the morning didn't get to sleep yet. Can't work couse no one will hire me, have no money, can't study couse you need money for that, can't rent a house couse you need money for that too.
Dad sends enought money every month to get to eat for that month.

Dad and Family in country B.
Can't got to country B due to Corona and Quarantine regulations.
Mom with her new Husband in Country C.
Husband is Rich but Mom has no money of her own. Can't go to country C couse even stronger regulations.

Friends sick of me couse I basically live with them.

Depression is kicking in again.
I have no meaning in this life, no purpose, no objective, I just exist to silently suffer in life.
I can't get shit done, I don't have a space of my own, don't have a life of my own, I posses nothing but luggage I use to get my shit from one house to another every week.

I'm just sick of it all, I'm not even mad, or resentful, I'm just too sad to ever stand up again and feel genuinly happy couse my life came to such an incredible loophole of shit I can't get out of it.

I'm starting to once again see no purpouse in my life other than just suicide.
I'm sick of trying to do something or trying to get a carrier or a job or studying, I'm genuienly bored 24/7 couse I just have no reason to live, I would be better in grave right now without thinking how my life became so miserable the moment I chose to go with my mother to another country.

I'm alive couse I lack the guts to suicide, and I do care about my Family and Friends and that they will grief for me, and they all tried to help me sooner or later... but I just can't function like a normal human being.

I think that if I don't suicide I'll probably end up in the streets with nothing to eat and no one to help.

I hate this world so much... I had dreams, I had objectives, I had a reason, but they banished somewhere.
I just can't think straight anymore, every day is another lost day where nothing useful gets done.

I want to live, I want to have a carrier and a Job and I want to meet my Ex again couse I loved her, and I want my Dad and Mom to see me succeed in life and my Grandmother to be proud of me, but im just so sick of this, of all of this, of all the shitshow it all is, it's like everybody laughed in my face telling me what a fool I am to expect more from the Human Civilization.

Guess I set my expectationes too high...
Maybe homelesness isn't so bad, nor is the end of the road, but I just cant stand this anymore.

It's all the same every day, something gets discovered, something gets cured, Trump this, Putin That, Brexit this, China that.
But nothing really changes, it's all the same, every day is just the same shit, every day I get fed the same plate with the same shit as the day before yet somehow today it's fucking better.

How it is fucking better? How?

We literally had Millions of years of evolution, we are the Smartest species on eartha and we can't even end slavery, or hunger or whatever.
Every fucking one of you just thinks bout their ass and how to get money which is a thing someone invented not to carry a rock with him all the time and we made it our fucking goal in life, we build our society around a fucking idea of a very expensive paper with value.

I'm sick of all the shit happening on earth and I'm sick of this life I've got to live couse my mom and dad dicided it was cool to fuck without a condom.

Don't get children, just don't. I don't want to reincarnate in one of your poor bastards to live a shitty life full of grieef and suffering paycheck after payckeck struggling to have enought money to go to a bar and buy a margarita for that nice girl that called me handsome.

I refuse to accept this is all life has to offer, but I still see more shit than good everyday and each day I just feel more and more powerless about everything to the point I just don't want to do anything at all couse it won't get any better.

Perhaps I have luck someday and manage to somehow die while asleep, which I doubt honestly but at least I wouldn't see it coming from a mile away, like we all saw Global Warming coming and no one, literally no one did shit couse no body cares about it.
We just all deserve to die, our genes lack evolution, we are genetically and socially underdeveloped. In fact we are so underdeveloped our society just lags behind our individual intelligence. Why? Couse there is no child control, literally everyone can have a child and you don't see a problem in that until what? Year 2000? 

We are just a conglomeration of ""succesful genes"" that strive to live and reproduce, we are that simple, yet we had to invent fucking locomotion and string theories and here you have it, me.

Just fucking kill me someone please, I don't know what I'm expected to do with all this mess, wtf can I do to convince the entire world that it's all just wrong? 

That we are creating the Hell on earth when we should be creating Heaven.
And yes, that's what Jesus expected us to understand yet we somehow got religion with pedophiles as priests and a re-edited Bible which we need to give some meaning too.

It has exactly 1. Actions have consequences: Good or Bad so you better do good or bad is gonna fuck you up.
That's the Bible, that's literally the Bible.

Guess I'll just go to sleep now couse dreaming became 1000 times better now that I can remember a litle bit of them at the morning (I normally don't dream much and most certainly don't remember shit).

Guess I'll just have to keep on living a life I didn't ever wanted to have couse that's the burden I have to carry like the Brain attached to a pile of bones I am.

Yeah life is so much better now that I can physically try it out, yeah pain is fucking amazing thank you god. Fucking thank you.",14Nov2020,1

(I changed the names.)

Holly,

I really need you in my life.  I need you in my life and I need you in Jane's life too.  This family doesn't work without you!  We can't do this to Jane or each other.  I'm gutted and I don't know what to do.  All I know is that you not being here is making my body panic.  It's withdrawal symptoms.  I've had Holly beside me when I'm wake since we moved in together and I can't live without you.  Please come home and let's fix this.  I held back my love for you and I took you for granted.  I didn't know what I was doing, just that I felt so much pressure along our journey and none of it means anything without you.  I love you!  This feeling is torture.  I don't want to say anything stupid, I just need you back or I'm going to go insane.  Some of this actually feels good to write.  I want to tell you that I love you more all of a sudden.  You don't have to worry about me being a jerk like I was before I got medicated.  I want us to survive.  We've sacrificed too much to throw it away.  Splitting up will be hell and I don't know if I can do it.  I love Janet so much and she's already asking me where you are and why you're not home.  How am I supposed to answer her?  She needs both of us to follow through with what we started.  All I can do is have faith that you're going to come home when you're ready.  You'll come home and I'll hold you and you'll scratch my back and my head again.  I'll tell you that I love you every day and maybe you'll start saying it before bed again, like you used to.  My body aches in sorrow for the loss of your touch.  I dropped the ball big-time and I thought it would be easier to repair things than it has been but I didn't realize how bad it was and I'm sorry for not acting sooner.  Your husband is here.  He's wanting to be better and hes finally got some sense shaken into his head.  I'm awake and sober if you want to call me.  I love you and I hope you'll come back to me. ❤️

No big deal right? I mean it’s 2020 and most people my age are gonna be drinking. The problem is that my immediate reaction is to put up shields and treat drinking/smoking like a sin (which also stings cause I’m not religious). 

Idk, I need advice on how to get out of this mindset. Cause after thinking logically I know this shouldn’t change how I feel about the girl, or how I treat my cousin. Addiction is a problem but casual stuff really isn’t, or shouldn’t be a problem, but automatically is in my mind.

325,"Hello there, I'm currently on unemployment funds thanks to all the lockdowns. The thing is that now things seem to be improving and restaurants are opening again. I previously worked as a bartender. I visited this place with the sole purpose of taking a look around while having a cocktail and check out their menu, ambiance and how is the staff.

One of their staff members was nice to me and when I mentioned my interest in working there he went to talk to the manager. I have an appointment to fill paperwork and the day after start the training but suddenly I'm not sure that working there is what I want.

Their customer reviews are really bad (rating 3.0), even though that place is usually packed. The manager was very nice. I observed a bartender basically giving out the alcohol for free to people (including me) for no reason at all. This guy came in an order 1 shot of the cheapest tequila, then proceeded to complain about the price and that the shot was too small. The ""bartender"" just take a rocks glass and free pour double shot for the price of 1. Another guy was seating next to me drinking whiskey (with an almost full drink) and the ""bartender"" just free pour a double shot neat and handles it to the customer. I was watching at his behaviour in disbelief.  I expressed my purpose for being there form the very beginning and stated that I wanted only 1 cocktail, he then passes by and drops a free long shot of pure spirit for me, then after I had paid and was getting up to leave he comes by again with a newly made cocktail (I took a few sips and went to the bathroom with my drink to throw away half ot it). 

I paid the price of 1 cocktail and got spirit worth of 4 drinks. I feel so bad for the owners of this place.

326,"So the title. My eldest niece came out to my mom that my sister isn't taking her kids to school, that she sleeps in until midday and yells at the kids to leave her alone. That she's getting her eldest daughter to help hide her habits and putting unnecessary problems on her daughter. The eldest is nearly an adult, however, she is suffering with her own mental health and this isn't helping. I don't know what to do.

My sister admitted to the problem and then when we saw her next and asked how she's coping, whether she has gone to the doctor, she was snappy and unresponsive. Turns out she started drinking again - which I know that's usually how it goes. I know this is a journey and it's not going to be a quick fix type of thing.

What I'm asking is what do I do? How do I help? Mom has organized to do an intervention - which I'm nervous about, their relationship ain't the best.. What I'm reading is that we need to try and be supportive, understanding, etc. But I also want to make this as easy as possible for her, sort of like she just has to do rather than think. I want to organize a doctor appointment, find her resources for AA meetings or rehab - which I don't know how costly it is, help her with the kids so she can focus on herself. Will this go down well or will it seem patronizing/condescending? What else can I do? What do I say? Basically, how do I be supportive without fucking anything up?

I was going to come clean as of writing this today and tell everyone what i said and why it was wrong.

The day before this, friday, the information got out. instead of me telling the person the lie was about myself, someone else told them. this ended up in them being absolutely disgusted in me and so shattered as we had such a close friendship.

Her mother died about a month ago due to her alcoholism which has practically forced him to step up but even now he still doesn’t really step up to the plate. I don’t see her as often as I’d like as her mother’s side of the family has some issues with our side of the family. Keep in mind, I’m only 20 years old and in college about 2 hours away from her. 

Whenever I come to visit her or talk to her over the phone, I constantly observe her eating habits and they are extremely dangerous for a 10 year old girl to say the least. 

For breakfast, she eats a sausage biscuit or McMuffin from Mcdonald’s with some type of sugary drink or Frappe. 

For lunch/snack, she eats HALF a bag of Taki’s with either hot dogs, other processed junk, or more McDonald’s. 

For dinner almost everyday, she eats a 10 piece nugget with a medium fry and a sweet tea, shake or other sugary drink. 

For snacks, she either eats Taki’s, Hot Cheetos, Candy, Ramen Noodles, or any other processed high sugar snack she has in her house. 

I’ve asked her multiple times if she drinks water or eats any vegetables and she says no. 

Although she is extremely thin and athletic,I’m really concerned about her health with the lack of nutrients she’s getting from her food. She has trouble sleeping at night and her temper gets really bad at times.

I’m just concerned and don’t know what to do since I’m not extremely active in her life and can’t physically be there to teach and guide her eating habits. I’m concerned that there might be some underlying health issues that come up for her later in life. 

Any advice on how to handle this?",14Nov2020,1
337,"So I’m scrolling through tiktok, way later than I should, when I stumble upon a familiar face. My ex. Even better, the video I’m watching is about me! And not only that but the comments were filled with his friends bashing me and talking sh*t about me. 

The video was a lip sync that said “when you thought the person you lost your virginity to would be your last”. He sang the part of the song that said “give me my mother fucking shit back”. And his caption was, “she already moved on it is what it is”.

So I’m confused as to why there were so many people bashing me. This is what happened during/after our breakup:

HE broke up with ME. I asked if I could wait for him because I was in love with him. He told me no and to just move on. He starts posting things about how he wants someone new, how he hates me, and how he started talking to other girls. So I take that as anyone would and start working on myself and try to move on.

Almost a year later I’m exactly where I’ve wanted to be mentally. I learned about self love and along the way I met someone special. I guess my ex found out and he texted me a week ago. Rumor has it he wanted me back. I tell him I’m happy with my man, and he says he’s happy for me and this and that. 

But then I find out he’s been posting all of this about how I did him dirty. Did I actually do something wrong or am I missing something? Why are all these people coming at me?",14Nov2020,1
338,"My mother is not an unintelligent woman. She prides herself on being informed. She's also a baby boomer MAGA Republican, who worked the poles. 

We didn't discuss the election results at all and I had high hopes she was a Republican who respected the electoral college and would continue to be on board with Fox News.

Yesterday she told me with what can only be described as glee she found new news stations: Newsmax and One America News. I told her on the call that Newsmax were anti-vax at the start of the pandemic and she flat out refused to believe it.

I was worried from the moment she mentioned them. Now I've read up a bit more on them and I'm just bereft. I don't know what I can say to her to get her out of this rabbit hole. I never thought she could be so brainwashed and I don't live in the same country as her. She thinks I'm a bleeding heart liberal and I need to find the original source cold hard facts to say anything to her as she doesn't trust any news stations I rely on, like BBC.

340,"A friend that lives across the country is going through an extreme mental breakdown and none of her friends can reach her. She has no family and the only person that lives anywhere near her that can/will help her is her ex-boyfriend. He was the one that was originally notified of all this (by her neighbor that lives upstairs in the same house) and told us. 

The story (via her neighbor) is that one morning she was walking around outside and looked ""confused"" (She has a history of some mental issues). She wasn't seen or heard from for a day or 2 and a missing person report was filed. She was  found by police walking around and given a ride home but then promptly disappeared again. She was found again in the middle of the night and was taken to some sort of shelter that could help her, but she can walk out at any time she wants. Supposedly, she can't be held against her will unless she's a danger to herself or others. 

Her ex is understandably beginning to involve himself less and less so our line of communication and knowledge of the situation is disappearing (he isn't getting much information anymore anyway. The police were reluctant to even tell him that she was found and taken to a shelter). 

It's a stressful situation, especially for a mutual friend of ours that could be considered her best friend. She doesn't have her phone so calling her or reaching her via social media is out of the question.

I'm here because I'm curious of the VPN that my work uses. First of all, I work as a support for a company which I won't mention. I work from home and I think there aren't any chips planted to track the PC's (you sign a paper to ensure that you will pay for the PC if it gets lost or broken).

Although, I'm not really familiar with VPN we need it to gain access to an app that counts our working time, breaks etc... (it's already on the computer). I've managed to figure out I guess that when you connect to the VPN you are transfered to the office? I'm not sure though.

I'm just wondering if I could work somewhere more far away from the office or would it not be possible? As I have to go back to my home which is around 100 km's from the office. Would this manage? Would they able to track me? How does VPN exactly work? Could they see I connected from a different location?",14Nov2020,1

My dad has expressed interest in joining me in moving country too where he’ll stay with his sister/friends. I want him to be over there with me but I’m worried about the time gap between when I leave and when he can move there including financial issues.

I won’t go into details about the divorce as that’s another story of its own but the underlying factors are that my dad still loves my mother even though she no longer loves him. She’s currently staying with a friend whilst me and my dad remain in our home. After she moved out, he’s been very depressed as you may imagine. It’s been just the two of us for a few months now and it hasn’t been an easy adjustment. Me and my dad have had a lot of ups and downs in our relationship but this past year, we’ve been closer than ever before. We’re each other’s rock. In a somewhat weird twist of fate, the divorce has brought us closer.

Recently, I’ve been lying awake at night thinking about how I’m leaving home and how it’ll effect him. I know I can’t revolve my life around his well-being if it cuts me off from my own future. I love my dad so much and I’m scared about how he’ll cope when I’m gone due to how much we rely on each other now. It’s even gotten so bad that I’m sometimes crying thinking that I’d be hurting him a lot. He’s lost so many people who he’s loved, I don’t want to be another.

352,"This all started when I lied to one of my best friends about an event that happened with another friend of mine at a party. i lied about some things that happened between us that were very, personal. I then, a bit later, told another friend an even worse lie about it. i said that i literally put ""my thing"" in them. after that i felt so disgusted but i couldn't just tell them to their face that i lied because i didn't even know why i did that.

I was going to come clean as of writing this today and tell everyone what i said and why it was wrong.

The day before this, friday, the information got out. instead of me telling the person the lie was about myself, someone else told them. this ended up in them being absolutely disgusted in me and so shattered as we had such a close friendship.

i also broke the trust of 3 others at the same time. the two people i lied to, one doesn't know what to say to me right now and the other is just really annoyed at me for fair reasons. the 3rd person, which i didn't tell anything about that night to, is really upset because they thought i was a good person and now they don't believe anything i said to them. they feel i have manipulated them in the past and don't want to speak to me.

As a result of this, i'm out of the friend group of around 9 people. they were my everything for a few months now and it's really hard not talking to them.

356,"Okay, so I'm not sure the term is the correct one here but here it goes. This is long, I'm sorry. TL;DR at then end.

First, a bit of context. I live in a very big city in a small apartment normally.  Because I wasn't working and wasn't going to go back anytime soon (Company is only calling in top managers to save money), I decided to go back to my dad's who live on an island where the situation isn't nearly as bad as everywhere else. A couple months later, my brother ( 
24) called my dad to tell him he was moving back permanently with his girlfriend (23) and his one year old baby and that they would be staying at my dad's for a month just until they find a place of their own.

So we've all been living under the same roof and I've been noticing a few things that really irks me and makes my blood boil about my brother's relationship:
- His gf (let's call her Amber) doesn't have any right to make decision about their son
- He's forcing her to continue breastfeeding even though their son now has teeth and bites her frequently until she's bleeding because ""it's not hurting him""
- If he has to watch over their son for an extended period of time, he's complaining and yelling at her to do her part because he can't possibly do it all day, 
- When they fight, he's always telling her she's a bad mother... 

Their son just started to walk and it should be expected that he'll fall a few times. When he does (nothing major, just, you know normal) and Amber's watching him my brother blows up and starts berating her and telling her how she's not really watching him, she's lazy, she doesn't care about her son, but when it happens with him, it's no big deal, don't say anything. 

He also tries to convince her opinions/beliefs are wrong using some b******* explanations and making it sound like science (for example they shouldn't put shoes on their son and let him walk on gravel without it because shoes make a baby stop walking, like wtf????).
He keeps belittling her family and telling her how they've never done anything for her (even though the two of them stayed at their place for years rent free while neither had any income) and she shouldn't go to them. Amber's sister is giving birth at the end of the month too and her parents want to pay for her tickets as a Christmas present so she can meet her nephew and Amber's parents can see their grandson. My brother told her she couldn't go un December as planned but in January so he could come too and that they would be staying there 3 days, no more then they would travel around for a bit because her parents didn't need any more time than that with their son. He's never doing anything, always telling her how everything she does is wrong, won't let her dress how she wants, etc

I'm leaving out tons of things because this already too long. I talked to Amber about it and she just told me that in private he's different and when they talk about it, he always cries because he's sorry. Honestly, her explanation only worries me even more.

TL;DR: For reasons, I'm currently living at my dad's and my brother and gf are here too. I've noticed some pretty huge red flags when it comes to their relationship. The constant belittling, criticizing, controlling and the continued attempts to keep her away from family... I'm genuinely worried about his girlfriend. Like seriously 

I don't know what to do. If I tell her she should leave, it'll blow up to my face I'm sure, because she'd tell him I said it but not doing anything feels wrong. 
So people of Reddit, I suppose my question is what should I do? Shoudl I do something or should I just leave it alone? Maybe I should just mind my own business...",14Nov2020,1

I have brung it up to her before but the thing id that I don’t know how I feel about continuing to feel like this because I am in love with her but she doesn’t want to date and it hurts when she goes and flirts with my friends and calls them hot and gushes about them. I spoke to her friend about how I feel because the girl and her friend speak about boys often but apparently a lot of mean stuff is said about me and reasons to not date me, but a lot of really sweet and cute stuff is said about me too. But it’s not just me she doesn’t want to date, she just doesn’t want a relationship.

She has my passwords to my social medias but she won’t give me her passwords, she just let’s me look at her socials in real life but she makes a fuss if she doesn’t have my accounts, I just let her have them now.

Some days she seems interested but other days she is completely off of me. She texts me a lot and can’t be using me for sex because she is still a virgin and we just take things slow but do sexual things every now and then.

This girl is a huge part of my life and I rely on her for any self love and happiness because she is what keeps me feeling secure and grounded. I was always quite lonely until she entered my life and I know that if I have to stop liking her, I can’t be her friend either, it just wouldn’t work.

So my husband hasn’t paid child support for almost two years.
We’ve been legally separated for 8 years however whatever I tried I could not get him to show up for court to process the divorce. 
Recently he called me to court to settle the matter... requesting I forgive the unpaid child support, which I did for a partial amount while we were in lock down.
Also requesting that child support be based off his income which he claims is 16,000 making child support for our two kids $180 a month. 
Based off a job he picked up for 20hrs a week for this sole purpose. 
However he owns and operates two successful businesses that he runs mainly with crash transactions....Both businesses are successful selling out often and booking numerous events. 
My lawyer stated that there’s nothing we can do to prove it since he’s not claiming that income.

My mom(who never kept a job and took my money since I was 16 and had summer jobs) of course started asking for money. Shortly after this turned into me completely supporting her for the past five years... I haven’t had more than two weeks off in a year. I am 23 years old and I am exhausted. I couldn’t put myself through school cause I spent all my money on her. It’s not stopping. I don’t know what to do. I hate her but if I don’t help her she threatens me with s*****de.

365,"I (15M) live in Australia so everything about school might sound a little weird idk. also sorry for bad formatting or grammar/spelling errors, im on my phone.

Im in year 9 at the moment and ive always been a pretty decent student. I got dux of year 8 (best achievement across all areas in my year level) and a lot of my good marks came from math. this didnt cause any problems at the time because math was fairly easy going but going into year 9 i was put in the advanced math class.

basically there are 3 different levels of math at year 9. foundation (easiest) general (standard) and advanced (the hardest). advanced math is a year 9/10 mixed class because not many people are in there. almost everyone agrees that the class is way too difficult and everything is thrown at us too quickly and it's too hard.

so going through this year ive always dreaded going to math class because its basically an hour and a half of depression and boredom and i feel like theres nothing to do that will help me do better in class. its so complicated and vaguely explained that i cant focus enough to take decent notes, and i only did well on one test which was the easiest part of the year, graphing. every other test ive struggled to get over 50 percent and i dont know what to study for because everything is so cryptic in this class.

also, i had a mid year exam which was personalised for each student (kinda). there were different year level tests that were given based on our skill level, not our year level. it was meant for year 10s to do but because im in the year 9/10 class all the year 9s in the class had to do it too. so for some reason my math teacher thought i was just lazy and understood everything just fine. he says im ""far too talented to not do my work"" when in reality im trying as hard as i can but get stuck on all of the work we do. in the mid year exam i got a year 11 test and ended up getting an E with like 35%. my parents were obviously not happy with this as it was on my mid year report and brought my gpa down quite a bit. (if its different in other countries, your gpa is basically your overall level based on what the teachers think of you. the max gpa is 4.0 and i normally have around 3.7, but in math i was getting around 2.8.)

in addition to this, my parents can see all of my progress and my mum recently saw that i had like 25 overdue tasks to do. when my mum mentioned this she was telling me to get my work done and whatnot. ive tried explaining the whole situation to her before but she just says i need to do my work (its that easy, right? wrong.) plus theres a lot of other shit at school to do with girls and a sexual assault allegation against my best friend that i wont go into right now, but my mum wont have a bar of it and keeps pulling this ""from one woman to another"" shit and never taking my side. im also not particalarly at a high point in my life anyway and my parents are not helping. 

ive also talked to school counseling and they didnt do shit except tell me to talk to my parents which, surprise surprise, didnt help.

basically, i feel like i cant tell my parents about anything and im really stressed because i had another exam 2 days ago that hasnt been assessed yet. i just wanna know how to cope with all this shit.",14Nov2020,1

My thoughts are never consistent. One day I want to travel, next day I want to write, I want to make films, then I want to study, somedays I just want to design something, sometimes I feel like I want to teach. It's just confusing and scary.

373,"When I was 14, I had a secret relationship with someone who was 10 years older than me. I’m 19 now, but when I think about this, I get grossed out at someone being 24 being attracted in every way to a 14 year old. I don’t want to sound like the victim of anything because I don’t think I am but I’m writing on Reddit because I don’t know what to think of this and how I can help myself get over this disgusting feeling and thought of him. 

We were close and still speak to this day or so every other day. When I met him, he was the sweetest, more caring guy I’ve ever met, that just loved listening. He listened and listened to whatever it is you said. Of course being 14, going through dumb nonsense, you just want someone to listen to you, advise you, be there for you even to this day, I still love that about him. He cares so much. But being 14, being so vulnerable, easily manipulated, it can do so many things to you. I feel like I didn’t enjoy my teenage years trying to satisfy him physically and emotionally. He taught me things no adult should teach a teenager. He taught me how to experiment with my body, what to do, what he liked. I allowed it though. I was sexually attracted to him as he was with me. Doing all of these things I felt a tighter bond with him but I feel like being so young and “in love”, men, especially if they are older know exactly what to say to you. I was emotionally abused for years. That if I didn’t show him this or that or did this or that because I was his, I wasn’t a woman so he needed to go find a woman (throughout the years even being young) That I’m lucky enough to be with someone like him and not some jerk and getting cheated on. I could be with kid and he could be treated me like shit. I felt like I couldn’t do better than that. He was right. I questioned myself for years and years and thought myself as lucky because what did he find in me? He victimized himself every single time. He would mention our age too, threaten me to go. He would play with me. He would verbally insult me because of his jealousy. It’s all torture emotionally and mentally. He tells me to stop talking, he says I’m annoying. And when I take the step to leave him, he acts up all crazy over 20 messages. What I find disgusting is that he would even do this to a kid.... me being this age I’m realizing a lot of things and like I said, I swear I don’t want to play by victim. There are people that go through horrible horrible things nothing compares to my situation. Please don’t judge me I don’t know what to do. That’s why I’m here.

379,"*TL;DR: I put in my two weeks notice at my part-time day job today and my full-time night shift job starts in less than a week. If I can't compromise with my old job to lessen my hours,* ***how can I make it through these 2 weeks of hell?***

\-

So I currently work for a big name paint corperation I want to keep good ties to for the future, but there are no full-time positions in my valley open at the moment and I'm currently too broke to move, so I decided to go full-time overnight stocking at Walm-lart so I could save to move and advance in the paint corporation. 

I communicated with my management at the day job that I had a new job in process 2 weeks ago, and I would put my 2 weeks notice in as soon as I heard back about orientation. I also communicated I want to stick with the company in the long run, but this is temporary until I could move to an FT position far away in the state. 

I got a call from Walm-lart a few days ago and wasn't able to answer back until the following day, which they never answered back. I called the next day, and they told me that I missed orientation and that I would get a call back when the next one came up. My best friend who referred me warned me that that means I was at risk of losing it unless I called back 3 times daily, and luckily I managed to get orientation but.... it was the same day as a shift at the paint job. They were really pissed about me calling out for orientation, but I didn't want to risk losing my full-time job because of some classic Walm-lart HR moves. 

Here's the thing. My management at this specific paint store...*. really easy to piss off.* I have 5 days scheduled every week, 2 of them open-close. That store is really understaffed, and they're really manipulative when you tell them that you wouldn't be able to stay/come in, even if it's a completely reasonable reason (I got in trouble for leaving 4 hours early for a family emergency). I have social anxiety already when it comes to putting my foot down to authority, especially when it comes to jobs I want to be friendly with. I work with my nice co-worker in a couple of days, so I'll ask him and management if he can take a few of my last shifts, but this paint corporation is STRICT with PT employees getting max 28 hours a week.

So that means I have to stick with the shifts I have, and ON TOP OF THAT, I start work at WM 10 pm - 7 am for 3-5 days a week starting Tuesday. I'm not excited, my best friend went through hell transitioning sleep cycles when he didn't even have a previous job. I'm not worried about the quality of my work after these 2 weeks is up, but, **how should I proceed with rest and taking care of myself during this terrible time?**

P.S., I'm crashing tonight before work at the paint store, and I'm working on planning a sleep schedule for when the jobs collide.",14Nov2020,1

hi [blank]. i’ve been meaning to say this for a while but just couldn’t find the right time to at school so i’ll just say it here. 

i’m so fucking sorry for cutting you off and pushing you away. i’m sorry for ruining our friendship and making you feel like i didn’t want to talk to you. i want you to know that i didn’t mean any of what i’ve done to you, and that it had nothing to do with you, it was all me

when i blocked you, it was 100% impulsive, i was in a really dark place with depression, anxiety, addiction, trauma, a fucked up family situation and was in one of my self destructive episodes. i had been doubting if anyone cared about me, and felt that everyone was leaving me and that my whole world was crashing down so i stupidly decided to just ruin what we had. i know that’s not an excuse, it’s pretty fucking weak but that’s what happened.

i want you to know that i still care about you, and that i don’t not want to talk to you, i just don’t want to make you put up with my shit anymore than you already did. you were literally the best friend i ever had and i want to thank you so much for that. i understand that you probably don’t want anything to do with me anymore and i don’t blame you, i wouldn’t either. i hope you can understand and know that i’ll always be here for you and that i care for you and appreciate everything you did for me, so thanks, and sorry for everything x",14Nov2020,1
386,"I just wanted to preface this with I messed up big time in this situation, and I feel like shit because of it. Basically my situation is I had a friend two years ago who I had developed feelings for. At the time I went to university about 4 hours away but we would talk fairly regularly and hangout whenever I was in town. Basically two years ago I confessed the feelings that I had for her and she didn’t reciprocate. That was fine with me, I was a bit disappointed but I was able to keep it cordial fairly easily. This was probably the absolute worst time for this to happen because I was going through a rough patch when this happened (I have depression so there’s a few of those,) and almost immediately after I entered one of the darkest parts I’ve had in my life thus far due to extenuating circumstances that rocked my life. I don’t say the depression part to try to gain sympathy but it is just an attempt to rationalise cutting myself off from pretty much everyone. When I finally got my headspace back to business as usual it had been months and I hadn’t spoken to this person, and I felt extreme guilt and anxiety talking to this person again. I felt they would think i stopped talking to them as a result of them rejecting me, so I simply didn’t. In retrospect this was a terrible idea and likely makes it impossible to salvage any friendship, however for some reason today my brain has decided it wants me to feel extra guilty about my behaviour. I don’t think i deserve to be forgiven or to be this person’s friend again, but I feel apologising would make me feel like slightly less shit of a human being. I don’t expect reddit to write an apology letter for me, and in fact it’s best I do it myself, but I desperately need help on where to begin with a situation like this as I’ve never been in a position such as this one before.

395,"So yea just like the title says I can't find a job. I also can't get unemployment.

I used to have unemployment from the beginning of the pandemic till July. I had it through my job in Georgia and I think it stopped because I had to move. I had to move because I couldn't pay for the place I was staying at with only unemployment alone or my job. I had roommates but they had to go and move on with life. So I took a gamble and moved to New York with my Mom. Ive been looking for a job since July putting countless applications to different places like best buy, bjs, McDonald's, different hotels, doctors offices, grocery stores, etc. EVERYWHERE!!! I've been doing that EVERYDAY for months. I've been going out to places and asking them if they're hiring and say no or their original workers are coming back. I got a few jobs interviews in which I put my soul and heart into it but for some reason when they call me each and every person said they are going to move on with an internal candidate. That's so weird to me because why post a job when you have internal candidates already. You might as well start there and not look online. It would save alot of time. I'm young, I have work experience, I don't have a record. I just don't know why nobody wants hire me. 

So I tried getting unemployment back but it turns out Georgia department of labor aren't answering calls or emails. Trust me I know because I've been calling and sending since August when I first touched down. For some reason I can't get back on it and I don't even know why. All it says is that I'm not authorized to make claims. I tried calling my old job but they said that they wouldn't be able to do anything because I don't work there anymore. The only way you can qualify Pandemic Unemployment Insurance in New York is if your directly affected by covid in some way and I'm not. Like you have to know someone who is sick or your taking care of someone that is sick, etc. 

I've run out of money I saved for moving into a new place because I need food and to keep my cell phone on. I also bought new shoes and a dress shirt so I can at least look presentable for interviews. Honestly I'm just at my breaking point and I just dont want to put in applications any more. I feel like if I don't, It would save me the depression I get just from hearing me get denied. 

Something was telling me to don't move. DON'T MOVE TO NEW YORK. Honestly I've been trying to move back to New York for a couple years now but everytime the moment comes, something unfortunate would happen making me stop my plans and stay in Georgia another year. I should've listened because I think even without the pandemic, this would've happened. I swear there is always something. Everything I've ever planned has went to shit or I never finished because of some outside force or whatever is just completely ruining everything and I solely believe that. Nobody has worst luck then me.

So yea breaking point. No money, no job, no motivation. If anybody has any ideas or anything that could help out my situation, I would appreciate it. I don't mean like oh go here donate blood for money or do this for just a little cash, no. I need something solid. Just anything solid. All I've been doing to scrape by is doing a old job for 20 dollars like once a month. Im living with my mom but she fucking hates the fact that I'm here because I'm not perfect. That's a story of another time though. So please I need something solid so I can moved up and move out because this whole situation is really killing me.

Since getting a job at McDonald's, I've gained valuable work experience and learnt useful skills such as teamwork and being able to work under pressure.

My location is one of the busiest in the city, always being chaotic in the restaurant. I personally work in the kitchen. 

Due to this, I've had to adopt a completely different mindset at work, which has allowed me to perform better and be more alert.

One drawback to this mindset is that ever since working there, my hands always become shaky, increasingly becoming more shaky as I become more stressed.

This specific mindset has managed to crawl into matters outside of work, making me more vulnerable to shaking when doing a school test or when nervous in social situations.

This has started affecting me negatively. Whenever I try to stop the shaking, I get stressed even more and shake more. I've become self concious of this shaking, as I've had others notice my shaking and point it out.",14Nov2020,1

400,"I met my girlfriend because of Eminem. Both of us were a big fan of Em and went to many of his concerts together. This entire week, we got incredibly horny and our anniversary is nearing in one day. Everytime she leaned towards my cock, all I could think of was Eminem. 

I once thought that I should probably play “Rap God” during one of our sessions but I wanted to save it for our anniversary. I also once thought of playing “Fack” jokingly but then eventually using it into leaning her into sex but then I got nervous because I got incredibly excited. 

We don’t really listen to Em together anymore since we are trying to listen to new and great artists like Lil Mosey, Nav, Joyner Lucas, Kendrick Lamar, and Lil peep, but there’s no better present for our anniversary than sex and the one thing that made us couples; Eminem. 

I want to have the best Eminem song to play during sex so I can give her the best experience. I’m sure several people have done this before and have had a phenomenal time doing it. I think it’s a great idea. My girlfriend’s favorite albums are TES, MMLP, MMLP2, Kamikaze, and MTBMB. What song should I play? Playlists are appreciated ❤️",14Nov2020,1

Tl.dr: My boyfriend's mom passed away a few years ago and his dad is going to get married (he was secretly dating before), my bf is upset about it now after hearing the news he says his dad was always unloyal to his mom

My boyfriend (M27, I am F22) is upset that his dad is getting remarried. It's been around 5 years since his mother died. He never said this directly but he blames his dad for his mom's death because they kept fighting before her death and she had a heart attack one day and died, he said she would always be upset or crying over her husband, panicing and talking to herself anxiously before that. Moreover his father didn't even go for her funeral. The fights were about his disloyalness as he often went drinking with other women after work, in other words there was no hard evidence that he was cheating but he neglected my bf's mother wouldn't even tell her he is coming home late for example and broke her heart. OFc I am not saying his mom isn't to be blamed for not leaving but i am telling you what my bf told me without taking sides but ofc I want to understand and support my bf. Anyway back to the story, my hates his dad because he loved his mom. I hope you don't judge him but I am saying this to offer insight to the situation.

I am not sure how to handle this or help him or what to say. I remember when I first met him, we had this conversation and I told him if I was to ever die, I would want my husband to remarry and be happy he disagreed but then said maybe I am right. However, I did not think this situation would actually happen to him and now I am no longer sure if I have the same view for his dad because I empathise with my boyfriend

I don't exactly know what is going on in his mind or what his concerns are, he is the kind that wouldn't say it directly even if I ask- probably because he himself is unsure of the reasons. He said he realised after this that he only has me so I guess he feels like his father is abandoning him and that is part of the reason why he is upset. I told him don't worry I won't leave him and his father isn't going to leave him either. By the way, it is my first relationship since I was 15 so it is my first mature one and I am not sure how to act and deal with this matter, it is our first huge obstacle where one or both of us is facing an unpleasant situation",14Nov2020,1
402,"Hi reddit,

everything is in the title basically. I have a PhD to complete, no motivation, been severely strained by the pandemic and everything seems difficult now. I used to be driven, do a lot, read a lot, etc.

**Now I try to create some projects and do healthy stuff like running regularly but it's always such a painful decision to take.** Aside from the PhD I'm learning Russian, which is one thing I'm regular at, which makes me feel good (if we forget about the times where I feel like shit because I'm always in the learning position, making mistakes etc, which is annoying given that the PhD also provides these feeling)s. 

Because of the pandemic, my job prospects are even thinner. Academia is slowly dying, especially my field. Months ago I decided to open my job search and look for something elsewhere than in Academia, but it is still very hard to be motivated as I know that I'll never be the perfect candidate for the said job (cause my formation will be academic, in medieval history. it's good, but not as good as people coming from politics undergrad, etc). **I have to combine being motivated to finish the damn PhD, but also being motivated in looking for other jobs, t**rying to convert my academic skills into company skills**. I end up worrying about the future without being able to do anything productive now.** 

Some days i'll be able to run, be productive, and life will be more or less okay. But some other days I just want to give up everything, lie on my couch and hate myself. I use to wake up 'happy' or at least fine, and now it's so random. I feel that my mood can decrease very very fast, which wasn't the case before. Looking at this motivated person that I was, that people around me love and admire, and looking at who I am now is especially hurtful. I thought about therapy but I don't know, really... Expensive and I'm not sure that it would be very efficient. 

I apologize for the whiny tone if the post seems whiny to you. It wasn't my intention. Thanks for your answers!

403,So there's a girl who I truly love but unfortunately we had kind of a falling out and we haven't spoken in over a year. I may still be able to get her back but I'm too fucking scared to do anything. Just for some back-story right now I'm a junior in high school and when I was in 8th grade I met a girl who absolutely changed my life. We never actually dated but I myself was deeply in love with her. From the moment our friendship started I was absolutely gaga over her.  She meant a lot to me and eventually we became really close friends. May-December of 2018 was the best time of my life because we were both pretty much best friends who talked everyday. I mean I loved talking to her and even though my romantic feelings were not mutual we were still great friends and I still deeply loved her in a platonic sense. But I fucked up bad in January. I became paranoid that she only talked to me because she was bored of school and she wanted an escape (we went to different schools after 8th grade so we pretty much only talked through text.) It was a crazy theory but I was scared for whatever fucking reason. Instead of actually talking to her about it I decided to ghost her and wait for her to confront me so I could have an outlet to talk about it. Obviously this ruined my friendship but what hurts even fucking more is the fact that I later found out that she had feelings for me and she was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I fucked up bad. Eventually we reconciled and tried to start over but things were never the same. One day we just randomly stopped talking and there it was... friendship over. Months later I was in a blind state of anger and I blocked her further ruining my chances of fixing things. In January of this year I unblocked and followed her. She followed me back and I'm happy about that because it at least shows me that she doesn't hate me. But my current issue is that I still truly love her and I can't seem to move on. We haven't spoken in a year and a half but I'm still madly in love with her and I feel like I need her in my life. I dont think she's ever gonna reach out to me and I know its on me to try to fix this. But I'm too fucking scared to message her. I need her back in my life but I'm so fucking scared of what's gonna happen that i almost don't want to do it. I know its my only way of fixing things but I'm so fucking scared. I genuinely think she was the one but even if we never end up dating and just stay friends I'll be happy. I genuinely think im lucky just to have known her because she's such a perfect human being in my eyes. If anything I just miss my best friend. But I'm such a coward that I'll probably never fix the problem. So what do you guys think? Should I just swallow my pride and do it or is it best to leave it alone?,14Nov2020,1
404,"I turned 16 last month and want to get a job as a deliverer for deliveroo. In my country 16 is old enough to work as a deliverer. But my parents won't let me because it's ""dangerous"" to cycle through the city.  I cycle to school every day but my parents don't care about that. 

At this point I feel like they just want to do this to so they can let me know I don't have any control and I'm getting tired of it. I don't think they have the right to choose what work I want to do, because the law says I am allowed to work at my age. They say I'm only allowed to work at a supermarket. This really isn't an option for me, everyone I know that has worked at a supermarket or has friends that work at a supermarket have stories about getting underpaid, working overtime illegally, getting fired if you're sick. I just don't want to get into that, it also pays much less and working on a bicycle is much more fun and ill get more exercise.

405,"He's a good kid okay, very respectful and not an asshole. But he's 13, so he's started rebelling a couple months back. I have explained to him all that he needs to know at this age about how to treat and talk about any kind of minority. He's aware about and respectful of  the LGBTQ+ community, and he knows the hardships that racial minorities face in the west. Also, he knows about the resourceful way to talk to and about religious minorities over here. 

Now, a few weeks back, he started watching videos of a black youtuber. The dude's funny, really, but he uses lots of curse words and also the n word in his video. My brother was inspired, I think. I don't mind my brother using curse words as long as he knows what they mean and he is not saying them to hurt anyone, but he has also started using the n word while talking. I tried to explain to him that it is a disrespectful word and he shouldn't say it since he is not black, but he counter-argues that if that youtuber can say it without it being something negative, why can't he. I've tried to explain the concept of reclaimed slurs to him but either he can't understand or he doesn't want to. Asking my parents for help is useless because they have never even seen a black person irl and I don't think they're even aware of the existence of the n word. I'm from India, and a person from any race other than mine is seen like 5 times in one year, and I live in a pretty big city. Hell, I was the one to give my bro sex ed cuz that thing doesn't exist in my country and my parents are definitely not gonna do it. In short, they're Typical Indian Parents.

Also, I suspect that his friends also say that word, cuz my male classmates said that word when I was his age. I have nothing to prove it, just a hunch. My brother's probably doing it to fit in with his friends. Should I confront him about that too?

How do I explain that saying the n word is not for an Indian boy like him? I'd say he'd grow out of it in a few years, but the boys in my class now still say the n word from time to time, so I'm not gonna depend too heavily on eventual wisdom that my brother may or may not receive.",14Nov2020,1
406,"She is the little sister of one of my best friends (we were roommates for the last 3 years). I've met her a few years ago, and seen her pretty much every time I've been at my friend's family home (a few times a year).

The last time I saw her was about a month ago, at a party my friend had at their house. At the party it seemed like she liked me. She didn't talk very much, and after a few drinks even less. I did not make any moves, as I really wasn't sure how it would go. Now because of Covid and another lockdown,  there were no more opportunities to talk to her in person. Sadly, I do not have her number (only IG). I don't wanna be creepy, and as I said, I really value the friendship I have with her brother.

409,So I woke up to the fire alarm not long ago. Apparently my roommate passed out drunk while cooking what looked to be nothing in the pan but the lid was on it and it had been on there so long I think the rubber seal around the lid burnt to the point were it was fairly Smokey in here. While it was still smoky I could taste/smell the plastic it it felt weird on the throat/lungs. I opened all of he windows about 30 mins or so ago so all the smoke is gone now. My lungs and throat feel relatively normal but will I be ok? Even when I went out in the back yard for a few minutes I still had the scent of burnt plastic in my nose. I don’t think I smell it now but I could just be use to it. I also put bowls of apple cider vinegar around the place with hot water because I heard that absorbs the smell. Am I in danger? Windows have been open about 30 mins or longer now. Do you think it still smells really bad for the tenants upstairs? I don’t want to get evicted because of this stupid ass I’m stuck with. I seriously need my own place. 😞☹️🥺 I think I’m going to have a panic attack. Seriously on the verge of tears right now. The stupid fuck is so drunk still when I tried to wake him up he just laughed/mumbled something and fell back asleep. Also I have a ceiling fan going full blast.

410,"I work at a retailer as a lead cashier.

The team at the registers have been making good progress and providing excellent numbers lately.

416,"This is sort of a dumb topic but anyways, I have a really close group of friends who I game with. In fact, they are friends that i've known since childhood. We haven't hung out much in-person due to pandemic restrictions, so we spend a good amount of time playing online games with each other. Usually these games involve a lot of teamwork and strategy. To make it easier, let's call my friends Alex, Kat, and Hannah. They have been my primary source of socialization in these past months.

Anyways, Alex has a tendency to ""backseat game"", in which he's always telling us what to do. I don't mind too much being commanded and neither does Kat, but if we're off doing some other objective in the game, he'll get a bit irritated. We were playing a few days ago and Hannah kept having internet and glitching problems. Alex told her to restart the game client, but she didn't, insisting that it shouldn't have been an issue. Alex got a bit annoyed. Things eventually worked out so we were playing a level...then Alex got bothered because Hannah was far behind and hadn't caught up to us yet. She insisted that she was helping out by clearing out enemies on her side, but Alex told her that she should've stuck with us as a group and blamed our loss on the fact that she wasn't grouped up with us. A little while later (after we had restarted the level for the 10th time or so), she dropped from our Discord call/game and told us that her internet was being buggy and we ended the night on a loss. 

I had a feeling that Hannah purposely left the game. She went silent over the next couple days and eventually told me that she wasn't going to play with us anymore because Alex was being a b\*\*\*\* about it. Then she continued to list reasons why everything was Alex's fault and that it was never fun to play with him. Today Alex asked us if we wanted to play today and Hannah replied with that she'd rather play with her other friends. To my disappointment, I don't have a tight-knit group of friends whom I game with other than them, so if Hannah were to quit then I wouldn't feel compelled to continue playing that game (or any other game). Alex and Kat -- who are much closer to each other -- are usually fine playing 2-player games with themselves. The only reason i'm playing this game was so I could hang out with all four of my friends but now I don't think we're all going to be in the same call anytime soon and Alex and Kat are probably going to go back to their own thing.

Basically i'm asking for advice on how to re-invite Hannah back to our group and I don't want to make it seem like I just told Alex to apologize to her. I know Hannah has another group of friends, but my small group of friends mainly consist of her, Alex, and Kat...",14Nov2020,1
417,"So, I'm a small streamer, I started streaming to build confidence after an abusive relationship and as a hobby. It has done wonders for my confidence and I've met some really cool and genuinely kind people. 


However, I also have met so not so great people. At the beginning of streaming I was welcomed into a streaming community for new streamers. A way to network, build friendships, and have fun, it was wonderful. Through that I met a streamer we will call A. B was additionally part of this community but I didn't interact until this story. 


A and I played games together and it was great. Then he invited me into his group where I met B and C. B was fairly quite and kept to himself. Where as C was out spoken and talked about some outlandish things. I.e. working for the FBI, being arrested, etc. Stuff that didn't really add up. I figured C was just lacking self confidence and I just ignored it because overall the group seemed fun and like they did want to have a good time.


The more time I spent with the group, the more I realized that I was uncomfortable with things being said and that I wanted to distance myself from them. The key moment was when C stated that ""black people are genetically more aggressive"" which made me incredibly uncomfortable and I went off at him for it. Additionally, C would speak how he ruined other streamers.


I decided that I would just gently distance myself by playing less and less games with them. It got to the point where C would message me multiple times a day. I finally asked him for some space and hoped it would end there. It did not. 


I finally was fed up and just told him I would like to end our friendship because of different view points and it was negatively effecting my mental health. He went on a long rant about how he the victim from everyone and so forth. I decided to say that I would like him to leave me alone and I wished him the best and blocked him.


This is when the attack began. A and B unfollowrd me which I did expect. I had sent A a message expressing that I am no longer friend with C but I respect there friendship. C blocked me on every platform and went on social media saying how toxic I was without name. B joined in. This continued to there streams where A,B and C wouldn't refer to me by name but state how they are reporting a charity stream I did and made it very obvious it was about me. Additionally stating they planned to weaponize things against me. This was told to me by a friend in the streaming community who was watching there stream.


At this point I contact 2 mods part of the streaming community I was part of and explained the situation. A, B and myself along with mods had a call where A and B denied everything. At the end of the call. A wanted to talk to mods alone and admitting to the harassment. 


I never mentioned them in a stream, I respected there decision to stay with C and never stated anything publicly. After speaking with the mods they agreed to basically stop or further action would be taken. 


Within a day, it started again. This time they played it off like it was about something else, even though clearly it wasn't. I could report this to the mods but I feel petty. I just want to be left alone to stream. But I fear more retaliation just because I didn't want to be one of there friends. Apparently im on there ""hate"" list. 


I have no idea how to deal with this situation. I just want to be left alone and live my life but I feel like they will continue to try and attack me. Im scared of them dmcaing all my streams and content. Idk where to go from here.


Side note: I get people will shit talk, its the reporting, and attempting to weaponize things against me that I have fears and concerns about. 
A- 22 B- 25 C -28 


TL:DR; being harassed by streamer group because I didn't want to be friends with one of the members.

I hand the grand Idea of punching abrasive surfaces (walls,trees, punching bag,) and it was working. It didn't look pretty but no one looked at my hand often so I didn't care and was satisfied with not getting scratched on my hands everyday. And then my mom found out and I told her. She had a bit of a breakdown and started saying stuff like I can't make rational decisions and that even a 3 year old wouldn't do somthing this stupid. This kept on for a good 4 minutes and honestly i was hurt. This was purely practical and as I mentioned, I don't care to have skin smooth as butter. But I wasn't about to argue with my mum in this so I just said somthing along the lines "" ok if you think it's harmfull then I'll stop"". It wasn't worth to fight with her to prevent a few scratches. She went on to say that not only will I not get the pc o was planning to build( with money given to me for birthdays and other occasions) but she will also be seeing everything I see on my phone and laptop and that I will not be allowed to work out or go running unless I am told to by a gymnast or coach(I'm greek I'm not sure what the correct translation is sorry). I think that's unreasonable and that making 1 mistake isn't somthing to take away all privacy and freedoms of someone. I could see she was not listening to me. It was sad , every word I said was thrown under the bus and ingnored. She went on to tell me she will get a therapist for me to tell everything I think about weekly (she can definitely not afford a therapist during the lockdown).

However the last time he was here, he and I had a very serious falling out that has never been resolved and if I’m honest due to what happened I really don’t want to resolve it either. I just think he’s a total dick at this point and not worth the time any more.

I really personally don’t want to do any of this this year due to the brother in law being down and unavoidable and there obviously going to be some definite weirdness (not necessarily tension) due to how things are. 

I don’t really know what to do with going to see my mother this year, and I don’t want the kids to not see their grandma nor aunty either though. Yet I’m really really feeling like I don’t want to be in that situation either. 

What would you do?

Any more info needed please just ask and I’ll try be as concise as possible.",14Nov2020,1
425,"So just a few months ago I was basically a failure except for the fact that I'm studying for a degree. I had 0 friends, got kind of fired from 2 jobs. All the jobs that I had were nothing to do with what I was studying with. Too depressed and anxious to make friends or join any student organisations.

So a few months ago I decided to do 'copy and paste'. Essentially copy other people to a T in order to get friends, job prospects and all the good things in life. And it's very difficult for me because I'm autistic and friendless.

So I joined a lot of projects and groups. But I bit off more than I could chew. I ended up having to quit a project and it left the team very disappointed in me, which actually might affect my reputation with the rest of the organisation.

This project was for a physical event but on 3rd November it was announced that it had to be put online because of covid. Originally I was part of the planning team, but since the event was online it made things more restrictive, leaving most of the planning team with nothing to do. So then they had to pre-record the event and begged for volunteers. I signed up even though I was hesitant and not sure how things were going to go, and I'm sure they noticed this. But I didn't want to quit just yet because in the past I quit too many things before I even tried.

Things got pretty intense. That week a bunch of things happened at once. I was coping with all my studies, I had difficulties with my dissertation, I suddenly had a lot of work to do for another organisation, I signed up for a 2 hour thing that would take up 2 hours of my time, I had an interview coming up, and someone decided they wanted to be friends with me. All in all for 4 days straight I had not more than 2 hours to properly wind down. I was tired all the time and just felt like sleeping, and I wasn't enjoying anything I ate.

And then we had the meeting to explain the details of the activity and the recording. They'd done something unexpected, which was switch the script to our 2nd national language, that I wasn't as good at. And the activity that they were going to do was very text-heavy as opposed to all the other ideas, leaving me with a 700 word script to learn in 6 days.

To add to that. My partner in the script was taking too long to even take a look at it (he didn't even attend the meeting). So we didn't know what parts we were going to say until 4 days to recording day.

I was so stressed with everything. I knew I wasn't going to learn a script in my second language in 5 days with all the other shit I had to do.

I had to voice my concerns with the project leader. I told her that I wasn't the right person for the job and I didn't think I could do it. She begged me to stay, she offered to switch the script to my 1st language. By then I had tried memorizing it but nothing was getting into my head and I was panicking. And I found her begging and passive-aggressiveness quite off-putting. Plus I didn't want to work my ass off so that on the day I would have a breakdown and the recording would look like shit or not happen at all because of me.

So I quit. As politely as possible.

I know that I left them to pick up the pieces, and that probably someone else had to work twice as much as I would have to learn that script. But I was so stressed and so behind on my other commitments that I had no choice.",14Nov2020,1

427,"TL;DR: friend lied by omission about getting tested for Corona, I met up with her and now I have Corona, but can't prove it's from her, and honestly it might not be. People are telling me to chill, but I'm mad. How do I get over it?

\_\_\_

Monday last week, I (31f) was supposed to meet a good friend for dinner. On that morning, she wrote me ""I have cold symptoms and just found out that ten days ago I had lunch with someone who now tested positive. Do you still want to meet? Up to you.""

I've been taking the pandemic very seriously, respecting all the rules, keeping contacts to a minimum, wearing a mask, disinfecting everything etc. so I told her what our government says: ""if you have symptoms, go get tested. If you're negative, happy to hang out, we can do dinner with the spouses"".

She replies ""ok, scheduled a test for Wednesday.""

On Wednesday, I check in with her, asking how the test was, if she's feeling nervous. No reply. On Thursday, I write again, asking ""did you get your results? Are they negative? Are we meeting up tonight?""

No reply for a while, so I message her husband, with whom I'm good friends, asking ""did she get her results yet? Are they negative? Are we having dinner?"". He replies: ""lol it was just a cold"". 

A short while later, she writes me ""yes let's do dinner tonight"".

We proceed to have dinner all together at their home, not keeping social distancing. 

Fast forward a week later: I have cold symptoms. I don't feel well. I get a Corona test and surprise: I'm positive. I inform all my friends I was in contact with (who almost all got tested immediately and are all negative). On the phone with this specific friend, she hesitates then says ""um just so you know I actually cancelled my Corona test last week, because I figured I couldn't have it"". I said ""well guess that explains why you didn't reply to my asking what the result was"" and she said ""oh did you ask? I don't remember.""

So there you go. Anyway we will never know where I got it, and those friends were actually super helpful about helping us with stuff since my husband and I are now stuck at home for at least ten days. But I can't help but feel resentful. 

We've been close friends for several years, and of course we have different personalities etc. But we live in a democratic country that has excellent, inexpensive health care, where the Corona tests are free and can be booked online for the same day and you get same day results, and where information is readily available for everybody who cares to look for it. 

Am I an asshole for being mad that they lied, be it by omission? I got tested because it was the responsible thing to do, and if I'd dismissed it as just a cold, I would have met up with another friend this weekend who is planning on seeing some older-middle-aged relatives soon, and God knows where it could have spread and what damage it could have done. 

Intellectually I know that there's no point in being upset, what happened happened, and obviously she might never have had it and I could have picked it up somewhere else from sheer bad luck. 

But I'm not sure how to get over it. It's so irresponsible of her and I feel really violated. Advice?",14Nov2020,1

433,"Hello, I'm on mobile hope you don't mind. I'll hop right in. It's a bit long but I want to give full picture because I am very unsure about what to do.

I: myself 21 (lady despite my name)

BL: Boss Lady (older 60~)


So I started a new job about two weeks ago. I live in America and because of the pandemic I know that jobs have been scarce and a lot of pressure has been being put on my mom who I live with. My mom told me I have until January to start paying a bill and my phone bill, which I understand so I began looking for a job. 

My grandmother was talking to a lady about insurance and mentioned that I had just recently graduated college for social work and was unemployed. The BL was being overwhelmed being the head of a small insurance agency that offer both auto and home insurance and even commercial insurance. BL was interested in my profile because I have my life insurance license which I got to advance my financial education but it was for a company that use solicitation from friends to build up (basically a multi-level marketing company). So we do a informal phone interview and she hires me. She also told me she has the intention of retiring soon and that she wants to leave the office with someone she trusts after a few years. 

A few weeks later I start working and I arrive BL tells me that the next three weeks will be hard. I am currently in week 2 of 3 and it's been crazy. I was expecting to feel dumb and clueless as is the case of starting a new job but I think I'm starting to see a few red flags.

BL has been in insurance for the last 15 years and definitely knows what she's doing, but the office is a bit unorganized and she has no patience. I have been learning while dealing with actual customers and information is being thrown at me left and right and I'm being told to take notes while also assisting real-time customers. BL has on multiple occasions berated me in front of customers and once I even cried in the front of one as I attempted to do an auto quote for the second time. Another red flag came out when I saw that my employee worksheet was on the outside of a file stand she had. On the sheet what's my name address number and social security number. The file wasn't really close to where people could see it but it was still sort of out of the open, where employees can see it. Other than myself and BL, there is one other co-worker, a young man age 19. I raised concerns about my information being somewhat out, specifically my social security number, which resulted in the BL mocking my concerns and telling me how I would be the shady one because I'm new and I deal with people's socials and credit card numbers on a daily. This immediately sounded alarm bells and BL even ended the interaction by calling me a weird person for having those concerns. Is this weird? I've been taught my whole life to protect my social security number and even when I interact with other social security numbers on the computers they are stricken out except for the last four digits.

On the same day as that social security interaction I made a few minor mistakes such as asking for customer service numbers, which I have to write down or she'll berate me for not having the numbers written down already. Throughout the week I have been forgetting minor steps in processed that have been taught to me while in a real interaction with a customer leaving almost no time to take notes in the moment. I have been getting work done and made no major mistakes. BL tells me on Friday of week 2 she's going to hold off on putting me on the payroll until the third week because I might not make it. BL starts fussing at me along with this and I begin to cry and take a second to recuperate. I get back to work because I need the money and if I get fired I at least want to make the most money I can from those few weeks. When I come back she's being encouraging and telling me to fight through it. She has been a mix of berating me to tighten up for not having everything memorized or written down correctly and encouraging me to do better and work through it.

Part of me thinks this is a good job because there's room for promotion and the hours are decent and it's pretty close to my house. I'm thinking I can save up for college while paying a few bills. The other part of me knows I want to go back to school for my masters in something I'm passionate in and maybe I should look for a simpler job.

 I think maybe I'm getting in over my head working at a insurance agency. If I continue to work here with BL I would be studying for my an insurance license soon (after week 3) and eventually be expected to head the office when BL retires. I don't really have a problem with this because I can see myself doing it for a few years and then train someone to take my place. I think BL is running a legit business with integrity, but when it comes to her treatment of my social security number, her slight disorganization with files and chaotic training, I think I might end up quitting before even getting to the point of being the head of the office.

I just want something to get on my feet as I start to pay my own health and car insurance as well as phone bill. I always wanted a masters and it will not be in insurance.

What do y'all think should I quit or should I try to stick it out for a few years to save up for graduate school? Thanks in advance.",14Nov2020,1

After that, I started gilding comments that I thought deserved more than just upvotes, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money. I paid 20 dollars for four golds and decided that I would hand out these golds to comments or posts that really deserved it. 

After that I wasn’t going to spend any more money on gold. I gave away those 4 golds in two days. I promised myself that I would stop purchasing reddit gold after I gave away those four, and I did until I saw a comment that was even better than the five I had previously given gold too. It was a reference to futurama which is one of my favorite shows. It’s not every day that you see a perfectly timed futurama reference, so I thought what the hell it’s just five more dollars.

446,"Hey guys - so back in October I got made redunant from my job as a graphic designer due to covid having such a big impact on the business. I was there for nearly 3 years. 

So that means I've been applying for jobs. One of the first jobs was a makeup company who I won't name here - they aren't hugely well known but they seem quite established. 

I got through to the second stage of the interview - which was designing infographics for Amazon adverts. I was a bit hesitant about this, knowing they could very well steal my ideas but thought I was being paranoid, as quite often in designer roles you're asked to do this. Also in the brief it specifically said it was just to establish our skill set. 

I looked at their existing adverts on Amazon and they weren't particularly nice - a green back ground with kind of pink ink splodge clip art. Their logo is monochromatic so I thought I'd design the advert in black and white - with diagonal split screens and close ups of either ends of the makeupdrush (it was a duet brush so I was doing this to highlight it's different functions). I even played with placing the photograph of the brush diagonally to match the split screens. Anyway in the end it looked really good (Sorry for nerdy rant). 

I sent it off and got invited to the final stage of the interview. Before I went I noticed the design office was on an industrial estate really far from where I live - I don't drive so that's an issue. Plus due to covid, quite a lot of companies are letting people work from home on some days - but they confirmed to me I'd need to be on site every day. I also found out that they were offering quite a low wage which was apparently non negotiable. So in the end I told them it wasn't suitable for me and that was that.

I have another temp designer job now which suits me far better. But thats irrelevant to this story.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this morning curiosity got the better of me and I thought I'd check if the makeup company had updated their Ads and they have. It's pretty much identical to what I'd send them - the monochrome palate, diagonal split screen and even the brush placement. They've did it in such a way that it's JUST different enough from mines that I probably can't do anything but also it's SO FAR from what they had before that's it's blatantly emulating what I sent them. I'm upset because they've essentially fully rebranded their adverts based on a concept I sent them and I haven't been paid anything. Plus they said they weren't going to do this? Should I say something? I feel like designers are so f\*cked over by stuff all the time that maybe I should.

I have no social connections here. It's a small group of people who work for this sheep farm. They work full time. They are older than me, and I've only really connected with one of them who hasn't already left. The job has a high staff turnover. No school connections either.

My dad NEEDS this medicine this morning he wasn't doing well since he was supposed to get his medication yesterday during the evening and it never came, because of the severity of the rash he desperately needs this medication ASAP before his Enzyme gets worse.

And I'm just saying this, I don't think COVID-19 is why the medication wasn't delivered, this would be no different than someone needing medication for their heart or something. I would also like to clarify this has been happening for months.

460,"So a bit of backstory. My parents divorced and a few months later my mum met Dan(fake name). They were together for a few months and he world always buy my mum pretty expensive gifts (bracelets, perfume etc.) since they’ve broken up, the 2 years he’s been sending her flowers with super short notes. They’re not always for special occasions, she’s had about 4 seemingly randomly and 2 for her birthday over the past 2 years. For example, my mum turns 50 soon and he’s sent her a massive floral arrangement with “congratulations on the big one!” - Dan. That’s it. My mums not fussed but I’m concerned for her. She’s a police officer so I do trust her opinion on the level of creepy this behaviour is but still I’m worried. Should I suggest my mum send him a letter back or something telling him to back off? A restraining order? I’m not sure so some advice would be appreciated.",14Nov2020,1
461,"So, I went to Goodwill to donate yesterday. The man filling out my receipt was having a hard time spelling my name, so I offered to show him my driver's license (it was the only thing I could think of). There was another man who worked there who started looking over his shoulder and his mouth was moving (not sure how I know his mouth was moving since his mask covered his mouth, if not his nose - maybe he lowered it to take a drink? Anyhow).

Looking at the inside of my wallet, of course, there's my driver's license, with my name, address, date of birth and driver's license number. Then, credit cards, he couldn't see the numbers, but he could know what cards I have. And my debit card, so he knows where I bank. I'm not actually sure how much of my license he could read from that distance anyway.

So, the possibilities, from most innocent to most save me:

1) He was just curious what my name could be that was so hard.

2) He was planning to come to my house to rob/ rape/ murder me (not that worried, because I live in a secure building and  I rarely go outside).

3) He's going to try to steal my identity.

462,"I am freaking out. My boyfriends mother (&amp; whole family) is a very intensely Pro Trump. I am  not. That is the basis of this story, and I hate that it has to do with stupid social media but here we are.  A few day’s before Biden won, I posted a link from CNN about Donald  resembling a likeness to early Hitler. I am Jewish. His mother commented some nonsense drivel on it about America and how rioters are losers blah blah. All lives matter type of stuff that makes me ill. I ignored it to be the bigger person, I have tried, there’s no reaching her. 

This week- his mother posts a lunatic rant on her own page about how the election is rigged and how Biden supporters are lowlife losers, etc. It was as if she had a personal vendetta to defend the Orange man. I was set to ignore it as I have for four years. But I lost it. She mentioned that some of these Biden supporters compare him to Hitler- even some Jews! That “Jew” must be me.   I texted my boyfriend about it and he immediately confronted her. Not great. He said she is upset and the whole family is talking about it now. He loves her very much and I never wanted to harm the relationship in even a small way. 

So now I have hurt his feelings because I want nothing to do with his family, and don’t know how to fix it. I don’t think being pro Trump is political by the way. It is human rights versus supporting white supremacy and tyranny. I don’t regret my ideals and morals, but now I’m feeling like I shouldn’t have said a word.

Now even that I dont really mind but this is what I need advice on, I dont particularly want to just block the number, that feels really rude and if they are as depressed as they sound I dont want to make them feel worse. However they have given me alot of their personal information. They've talked about various friends and family and various issues they have. They've talked about their benefits so I know their income and they called from a landline so I know what village they live in.

Need advice on what to do. I dont want to just straight up block the number or tell them to stop calling me incase that makes them start feeling worse. I dont want to go to the police as I cant see them actually doing anything.

All the other girls who experienced the same thing thought he was creepy and I know it is creepy; he's probably a pedophile or something. I never really get compliments on my looks from guys so maybe that's why I felt flattered when he complimented me.

I don't really know why he does it when he's married(and happily it seems). He seems to like pretty women. Am I weird for not thinking he's creepy? Like, I would involuntarily smile when he complimented me. Typing this all out, I sound pretty weird and crazy.

Please refer to my original post for context. Well basically the girl I’m interested in doesn’t make an effort to talk to me anymore. She just leaves me on read, and the conversations are carried by me with simple unexcited replies by her. I want to say I’m overthinking, but it’s evident things aren’t the same. I don’t have social media anymore, and we met through tinder (yeah I should’ve already known lol). I went to look at her profile because I liked seeing her face. I see she updated it with new pics and a new bio. I feel stupid because I was so into her, gushing about her to my friends too. I’m not the type of person to fall for someone this easily, so it’s a kick in the gut. I’m not sure why I’m taking this so hard? Maybe it’s because I’m so confused. The date went real well, and to get hit with a 180 a couple days later is weird. Maybe I’m assuming too much, but I believe the writing is on the wall. Any tips on what I should do? How to move on or should I still have hope?

468,"I’m 20, I work a full time job, and live on my own. I found myself in the situation of having to use almost all of my savings to fix unfortunate situations-my car broke down and I lost my phone. At the time, I was really hurting for money. So, I decided I was going to try selling herb to my friends/coworkers/people I knew. 

For the most part, my customers were great and never gave me any more trouble than “get here faster.” That is until I started selling to “Chris and PJ.” Being way more naive at the time, I didn’t think anything of selling to people who weren’t of the greatest intentions or character. After selling to them for a couple months, they kept demanding better deals and for me to be at their beck and call. I’m a person who, if you push hard enough, eventually gives in to pressure (usually). So I give them great deals (that benefit them much more than myself) and try to fend them off by dodging messages and calls. No matter what, they persisted. 

Eventually, Chris started bringing another dude named “Michael” by. Michael always seemed to have money and always picked up big amounts (for me). After selling to Michael a handful of times, again all big sales, Chris tells me that Michael is going to grab a very large amount. I have my doubts and had a legal firearm ready in case anything threatened my life, not to protect any product from being taken. Chris and Michael pull up, and of course, they rob me of everything I had. 

This wouldn’t be the largest issue, as I was going to stop selling after they were supposed to wipe me out of product that last time. But, instead they’ve threatened my home, myself, and my significant other. They know where I live and they have broken into another person who used to sell’s house. They have guns. 

I feel paranoid, I don’t feel safe in my own home, and I feel like any day they will be watching and waiting for me to walk to my car. I don’t know what I should do. I am on a year lease with 6+ months still left on it, so I don’t have the money to move.

I (23f) had a friend (23f)who i loved very much. We shared a lot and i always felt that i can trust her. She supported me a lot. Let's calle her M. 

Three years ago we were visiting my hometown with her and my mom. We were on the kitchen and she decided to share something very personal about her childhood. She told us that her adoption when she was a baby, wasn't very legal. My mom got very nervous and said something like ""oh, ok"" and changed the subject very quick. I start talking but M stood up and left the room. I wanted to talk to her but she locked herself in the bedroom. I talked to her a few minutes but she didn't answered so i thought that was respectfull to give her some space. I went to buy diner because the fridge was empty. 

When i come back M wasn't there. My mom looked worried. She told me ""M went for a walk and said that she changed her tickets and that she's returning home tomorrow. "" I felt very upset. ""She also told me a lot of things about you. Things that are not nice""  I was so confused so i asked her what was that M said and my mom told me that she said something like ""i can't sand her, she thinks she's perfect; she always wants to do exercise and i don't ; she's not nice;"" etc. I can't remember all of It because time has passed and apparently she talked a lot but she sounded like someone that hates me. I was so shocked and hurt. I was always good to her and i loved our friendship. For me she was like family. With her i felt safe. 

When she came back she didn't want to talk at all and the next morning she left. We never speaked again. She didn't return my calls.

The thing is that i don't know if i want to talk again with her because it's hard to forget all that mean things that she said.

479,"I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's in IT, and I'm starting to think I made a huge mistake.

I'm still in my first year, I thought I could handle everything, but the further I continue down this road, the more I hate myself for it.

I remember working on an assignment, coding what was supposedly a simple program, when I suddenly got stuck and didn't know what to do. So, I went down a rabbit hole of tutorials and lecture recordings, asking classmates for help and whatnot. When I came out the other end an hour later with nothing to show for it except for a headache, I started to realize something.

I don't think I can do this.

Not the assignment, I mean everything.

All the subject matter that has been thrown at me were things I struggled with and couldn't care less about.

Why am I following a degree that I have no interest in, why am just perpetuating that empty feeling I had in high school? 

It's like a cruel fucking joke I played on myself (pardon the language). I've been telling myself ever since I was a kid that after high school I'd be pursuing a creative career. Laying down the groundwork so that after a few years I could be making a living off of what I loved most. Unrealistic, sure, but it just felt *right.*

Instead, after everything, I ended up choosing the safe option. I went to college because that was expected of me; I did IT because that was something that could guarantee me a job after graduation. I chose everything based on societal expectations and ""future-proofing"" my life or whatever. I hate myself for it. I hate this. 

The workload is piling up now, I understand less and less of all the esoteric computer jargon that's being throttled down my throat. Deadlines are closing in, and I'm slowly realizing that I've created the perfect framework for four miserable years.

I never wanted this. I never wanted any of this. I get anxious just thinking about school sometimes, and I hate the fact that I not only understand nothing but have no actual motivation or reason to understand any of it. I envy everyone on campus, everyone is there because they want to be there. I don't even know why I'm there. 

At the end of the day, this is all my fault. It's my fault that I chose something out of safety, rather than out of interest. I lament for the choice I didn't make back then, to just follow my gut instead of my dumb ""logic"". I'm not even a technical person, I actually suck at that stuff! What was I thinking?

I don't know what to do. There are so many things to get done the following week, I don't know if I can do it. I just want a nice reset button to appear right next to me. However, I know that life isn't easy, I know that all I can really do is continue down this path and see where it takes me. It's still my first year after all. Still, something is telling me that I'll hate myself for all of this.

Ive worked a good number of different jobs, each with their own challenges. Ive never had anyone there to save me if something went wrong.

Ive known this friend for about 10 years, we met just after he graduated high school. He was diagnosed with a mental disorder, and as a result has recieved paychecks from the government since he became and adult. He took some time to work a few jobs, usually for a few months, before quitting and going back to his life of playing video games. I didnt mind, he has problems, i get that. He never had to worry about being homeless as an adult, and he spent almost all of his time playing video games. His partner meanwhile went to a good school with a very lucrative job lined up, a job he will start next year.

Up until about a year ago my friend was a very progressive type. He voted for bernie sanders, was a big promotor of gender rights, and had a very leftist philosophy about how governments should operate and invest tax revenue.

Now, all of a sudden, he has pulled a 180. Now he boasts about how he has ""earned everything"" he has. How he has worked hard. How he is a ""self made man"" (his words). He wants to move to a place with lower taxes because he doesnt think his partner should pay taxes now that they will be making good money. He thinks there should be no laws or regulations, and that society should be a libertarian-capitalist utopia. He thinks people who recieve governmemt handouts are leeches. He mocks other people, including veterans, for thinking they have earned more than he has.

I asked her who that was and she said he was asking her about some friend that they both allegedly have in common. Needless to say, I don't believe her so I asked her to prove it, which she refused to. But my question is, am I just being paranoid at this point? Was it too much for me to ask her to prove what she was saying? The only reason I'm even trying to keep our marriage a thing is because we have four children together and I don't want to put them through a divorce. My oldest and her oldest have both already witnessed a divorce.",14Nov2020,1

490,"I had a fall out with a friend in March. Let's call them John. We were close friends for 5 years, until mid 2019. Ever since John became serious with their significant other, their personality changed a lot. I noticed a lot of John's friends have left him around 2018, that's the time where John started dating their s/o. I was there for John when that happened and I didn't realize that John was just using me as an emotional outlet until last year. John and his s/o would fight every now and then, and I would be there to listen. 

Last year, John lashed out on me when I replied late when he was having issues with his s/o. And this would happen multiple times when he saw me hanging out with my friends. He would tell me that I didn't care about him and to just hang out with my other friends instead. He would get angry for not inviting him sometimes. 

Then on March, I finally had enough, so I just stopped talking to him after telling him that I didn't like him lashing out on me multiple times earlier this year. Only until August he realized he was in the wrong and apologized through text. Word for word, he told me ""that's what I felt at the time, sorry for making you sad."" Then two weeks later, he asked if there was a reason to fix this relationship. I told him it was more complicated than that, and he basically just told me to pick yes or no. And I told him no. He got mad at me again.

Honestly, he's just... so weird. He wasn't like this before, that's why I'm just so upset with everything. I know he doesn't mean his apology, he just said that just so he could use me again. I'm just upset I lost a good friend. I didn't realize his personality was changing like this until last minute.

492,"Hi this is my first time posting on reddit because I really don’t know what to do in this situation.
I (F16) have a friend (also F16) who’s boyfriend broke up with her a little bit before quarantine and called her all sorts of horrible things (fat, ugly etc.) She really is nowhere near fat and is very beautiful and he was just saying those things to hurt her. She took them to heart despite me and others saying they weren’t true.

We had a lot of time off school due to quarantine and we just recently came back. By the time she came back to school she was pretty much unrecognisable, she’d lost so much weight and was a lot thinner than before. My friends and I were very shocked and at lunch and recess she doesn’t eat at all and will only eat gum. I tried to voice my concerns to her and our friends but she says that she’s fine and only eats when she’s hungry, which I know isn’t true because she used to eat all the time and now doesn’t even eat much at home.

I became really worried and told her I wanted to go to either the school counsellor or her parents or to call someone. She kept laughing it off telling me not to but I’m really worried about her because even if she is thinner now it can cause so many problems later on.

I don’t know what to do because I know that if I go behind her back to her mum or the counsellor she’ll hate me. Pls give some advice.",14Nov2020,1

a bit of a different post, i’m jw if you guys could tell me a ~fair asking price for whats listed? i would do this myself, i actually was but then i saw the wii u going for anywhere from like $300-$1000 depending on model condition etc. on amazon...which blows my mind considering it pretty much flopped but anywho.

its a launch edition ps4, white 8gb wii u, and a black (newer-edition 8gb? 16gb?) 360, i cant remember how big its harddrive was, and whatever games i have for them except maybe some ps4 ones i decide to keep for once i finally get a ps5

i’m selling probably all of then them in a bundle to a long time family friend who has a grandson who loves games so i’d like to know what you think a fair price is

i was thinking maybe 200-250 for the ps4, 100-150 for the xbox, and i’m not really sure what to offer the wii u for?

the games i guess i’ll have to figure out on my own, but does ~5-10 per 360/wii u game sound reasonable?

500,"Hey everyone...

A little backstory here before I begin. About 2 years ago, I quit my job because it drove me to become addicted to alcohol. I sobered up, and only drank on vacation and special occasions.

I decided to go to college shortly after, but I would drink every now and then and I got blackout drunk maybe 3 or 4 times.

I knew it was bad, so I stopped drinking again.

In March, my country went into full lockdown, the girl I loved didn’t want me anymore, and it overall was just a shitty time. I began drinking again because I couldn’t cope anymore.

Fast forward to last night: I had some coworkers over (we are a cohort so we are allowed to keep in close contact), and I got blackout drunk. My current job doesn’t drive me to be reliant on alcohol, but it helps with the stress (I don’t work a 9-5, I work a 24/7 gig). I got so drunk that I called my ex girlfriend (fml), and I blacked out.

My fear is that every time I drink, I get blackout drunk and I need to fix that. I’m not sure I’m ready to go cold Turkey and quit, but I just need to get it under control.

Does anyone have any advice? I feel hopeless...",14Nov2020,1
501,"I don't consider myself fat, overweight or anything like that. I'm just 124 lbs my height I'm not sure about bc the doctor always measures me differently. I could be 5'6 1/5 or 5'7 or even 5'8. I just don't know. But I do have a friend that is 5'4 1/2 and when standing next to him I look a few inches taller.

My parents have been calling me fat/overweight/ugly since I was about 6 and I am 16+ now. I did go thru a time from ages 7- 12 where I would hardly eat anything at all bc of what they would say to me (homeschooled during all this btw). I try not to undereat anymore but sometimes I feel like I don't eat enough still bc I feel ""wrong"" for eating a full meal of 300 to 400 calories (normal amount). 

Bc my parents shame me and call me names. Why should I even have to lose weight if I don't want to? I walk like 15 miles a week sometimes more even(my part time job all of us employees walk around all day non stop(theme park).

503,"I (43f) have this friend, we can call her Beth (28f).  She's tough as nails,  strong,  successful,  and often kind.  

  I can't begin to express how much I love this woman.   I refer to her as my heterosexual life mate,  and in the past we did everything together.
A few years ago,  I got a job as her assistant.   It's a great job.  We now spend 40+ hours a week together, in a power dynamic that i admittedly don't always understand. 

There's a lot of back story here on both of us, but suffice it to say we've both got issues.   We both have depression and ptsd but for very different reasons.   I was abused over many years,  she had a sudden intense trauma. 

I try to live my life drama free.  I don't gossip, I don't break confidences,  and I find life is easier for me if I approach it from a place of empathy and compassion mixed with humor. 

She lives her life from a place of confidence, authority,  and expectation.   You are expected to meet her standards,  and if you don't,  she becomes contrary and sometimes angry. Then she tells everyone and their uncle about it. She's a gossip,  and when I called her on it she told me she was just helping me understand the people we work with. She recently found out I knew something and hadn't told her... because I was sworn to secrecy.   She was really mad. 

She completely lacks empathy for anyone she's ever lost respect for.   Sometimes I think I'm on that list.   I get the distinct feeling I annoy her.   We're supposed to be best friends,  but I'm not even invited to her son's birthday party.   But then,  it's a kids party with lots of other kids,  and I only like HER kid,  so maybe she doesn't think I'd want to go.  

She often talks to me like I have no idea how the world works.   Admittedly she's quite worldly, and i deliberately live under a rock,  but I've been around a while... I have skills to offer that I just don't feel she respects or needs.... she corrects me even when I'm right, just because I didn't phrase it the way she would have... she takes things away from me and does them herself  if she feels I'm taking too long... but it's stupid things that aren't pressing.  As soon as I hit 40, I feel like it takes me twice as long to learn new things... she's frustrated by that.   

I'm not stupid,  but I'm pretty certain she thinks I am.   She'll ask me to evaluate applicants,  and look them up online,  I'll tell her what I learned,  ""he's a stoner"" and she will argue ""no he's not,  he didn't give off that vibe when he interviewed ""... but 4 days after he started.. guess what he admitted to me?  He's got his medical card. 

She often not on site,  which as her assistant,  puts me in charge in her absence... but when she comes back,  I get put in my place.  Twice I've had to write ""I am not a supervisor"" memos and issue them to our crew because they come to me instead of her. 

I'm fairly certain if I applied for my dream job,  she'd do everything she could to keep me from getting it (she's usually on the hiring committee for these things)... use every mistake I've ever made... just to not lose me.... and honestly,  she doesn't need me. 

We no longer spend much time outside of work.   But she also got a boyfriend,  that has become a fiance... and I've got my own things to deal with... so i know time is scarce. When she got engaged she maid me her maid of honor... something I know NOTHING about,  and was a responsibility I don't have the energy for right now... but I love her,  so I was going to do what I could.   Much to my relief I've been replaced as MOH. I'm not a bridesmaid,  and this is still all new to me. 

However,  her Bachelorette party is to be a wine tasting in another state.   It's assumed I'll go,  and I've been told to start saving.   I'm not sure where I'm going to find this money, I'm the only income for my family.   I also am a recovering alcoholic who doesn't drink.   

My ptsd presents through anxiety.   My job and my friendship have provided me with much fodder to feed my anxiety... so I no longer trust my feelings. 

I think I'm blowing this out of proportion,  but my hubby thinks she's toxic.",14Nov2020,1

506,"Hi all,

So I play this mobile game with my husband and we are both in the same guild. I never really talk to anyone in the guild. The guy in question dm'ed me a few days ago basically just telling me to stop attacking lower ranking people in the other guild we would attack that day in an extremely rude manner. The only requirement in the guild is to attack during guild battles. That's it, there are no specifics on who you should go for or anything. So I told him that and that the goal was to just earn more points than them. He just started posting screenshots of battle record and was like you hit this guy and died when you should've went for someone else. He is in no position of power in the guild and I told him straight up that im a casual player, this is a casual guild, it takes time and effort to research who to attack out of everyone. I dont have that kind of time for it and I probably don't make an impact anyways.  

So here is when the guild leader dm'ed me and apologized for the guys behavior and just nicely asked me to aim higher since he thinks I am one of the strongest ones. I personally saw myself as probably one of the weakest in the guild so I thought whoever I attack isn't important and won't make an impact which is why I'm casual and just attack. Since he said he saw something in me I thought ill try harder then. He said great and told the other guy.

The guy at this point knows that i agreed to aim higher. The guy then starts calling me ""defiant"" as if he was my boss or as if I was just a child when I was only stating guild requirements. I tried to tell him that no one would want to listen to a guy if you talk down to them which was what he was doing the whole time. I thought he just doesn't know vocabulary very well and how words have connotations and how those can invoke different reactions. So I tried to teach him the difference between synonymous words he used and how he could've made it sound better instead of straight up talking down to someone to make them follow ""orders"". 

He started calling me a snowflake that likes to play victim(??? I got no clue how I was playing victim when I'm just stating my opinion and helping him out) so I went along with it and told him that im happy for him to see me like that even though this was our first time ever talking. I also told him that using certain words with people will have consequences in the outside world so I was just trying to help him avoid those. 

He told me to drop it and move on. In my head im just like ""from what? From helping?""

Then he startrd calling me a whiny b**** (also ???)and to stop responding. And then it clicked in my head. This was the guy who spent hundreds of dollars trying to pull for a character he wanted and never got him and thus rage quitted the guild and the game for a good few weeks before coming back.  So I told him that there's a mute button in chat and he should probably use it if he didn't want to keep talking. Then I helped him with that issue and just blocked him.

Is there something I'm not understanding here? It seems that he is just extremely rude towards me even though we've never interacted before this point. He is pretty normal sounding in group chat though. I feel like how you approach a person the first time makes a difference and how you word things is important especially if you text someone as the first interaction.

So long story short, I asked her out and she said yes, which was really great!
Here's the issue though: Since I've never been the most confident person, I've always had paranoia that others want to ridicule me or talk about me behind my back, even if this absolutely not the case.
Because of this I've always had the image of me, that no one would actually want to be with me, because I've always doubted myself in that aspect, but I really don't want to have these thoughts, because I'm sure that it really isn't like this 99% of the time.

511," I'm sorry, but I honestly don't remember

I hope you are well.

I know you don't want to hear from me. When we last spoke I said what happened was wrong and I'm sorry, but I wasn't honest with you, mostly because the truth comes across as fiction.

You knew I am ill but even I didn't realise how bad it was. My pain has been with for over a decade now. I jumped from doctor to doctor to no avail. The pain has affected my mental health, with depression (but most relevant here) mood swings and memory loss.

I finally found a doctor who helped me and prescribed a new medication. I started on small doses with no benefit but I have now been taking a large amount. The pain has gotten worse but the medication has helped to plateau it. If it wasn't for this I doubt I would have been able to function properly and live my life at all, even though now it is a reduced state.

But the medication came with side effects. They are very strong psychotropic. Though it helped my pain the side effects were, rough.

My mood swings became more sporadic, more severe and memory loss becoming the norm.

The memory loss has, to be blunt, been devastating. I do get patches, but nearly the entirety of last year has become a write-off. I don't remember the last conversation with my uncles before they passed away. My father is ill and I spent as much time with him as I could in the last year and I don't remember doing so. I don't remember my wedding. This lost year is killing me.

And my mood swings are/were very worrying. Out of character, acting aggressive or unabashed but combined with my memory loss I would only find out retrospectively. The patchiness of the lost year hurts so much. I still have problems with my memory now, but due to the lock-down, there have been less “memorable” moments anyway.

I had been pushing for more and more help but was coming to a dead end. Hardly anyone knew what was really happening with me. I was worried I was going to come across as mad.

We met some months after I began having these symptoms. We used to hang out and watch game of thrones. Though I would have to often rewatch them by myself sometimes as I couldn't remember even the next day. But I know this is the bulk of how we became friends.

It's strange. I remember the feeling of friendship, even some of the in-jokes we had. The magic sofa, me being a pimp etc. But, I guess the “timeline” is lost. I don't remember our meeting. I don't remember us working together at all.

When I visited you once you moved from the city. It's patchy as well. I remember one of your friends being sick on the night out, visiting a wildlife park. I remember us kissing. After all this time I fear we did more. I fear that I cheated (even more so) than a kiss.

I was having problems with my phone and messing apps were not working well, so we moved to Snapchat as you already had it. In hindsight, this was obviously a bad move as I can't look back on old messages.

I began to keep notebooks. I knew my memory couldn't be trusted. But I was embarrassed and ashamed of what I had done. Even though I know we were good friends, we shouldn't be friends after this. In my notebook I had written: Reduce contact. End friendship.

The fact that I kissed someone other than my wife kills me. It will forever be a mark on my soul.

But you were my friend. I wanted to end the friendship face to face not over the phone.

That was my plan when I met you next. The memories are uneven. I remember you asking if I wanted to meet your family. I knew I shouldn't, I was planning on ending the friendship. I knew we watched movies but I can't recall which ones. I know I talked through them.

But I didn't end the friendship. I remember getting on the train and you at the station.

I knew it was going to suck but I had to make a phone call to end this. As much I as I enjoyed being your friend.

I kept notes of when I asked to call you, but you were not free to do so. This was a lot. This is when I knew something wasn't right.

Then I got the message from your mom. Then later a message from you. Saying what had happened.

That I tried to kiss you. I was aggressive That we apparently were more than just friends. Though I'm still fearful, you didn't mention us actually having sex. Though our relationship apparently seems to stem so much deeper. And I am sorry this happened, that I ever made you doubt the person you are and messing up our friendship.

But I don't remember.

I am trying to get better. I have been referred to mental health services, I'm going to therapy, medication is being reviewed. I no longer meet people 1 to 1 to prevent anything like this happening again.

There are talks that I could be bipolar, or that the medication caused me to have a long term altered states of consciousness.

I'm not trying to make any excuses for how I acted. But just an explanation as to why.

I'm just sorry it had to happen at all.

The guilt is crushing me. I haven't had real closure, and my old friend hasn't had the truth. Should I send the message or is it me just being selfish?",14Nov2020,1

514," WIBTA If I moved in with my dad?  


This is going to be a long story and sorry for the spelling mistakes.   


Background(Pretty long)  


I am 15 years old and live in the Netherlands. 

My parents are divorced. 

I have a little brother(M12) and a sister(F19) the 3 of us switch every week from home. 

I have a Karen for a mom and my dad is awesome. 

Me and my older sister are bise\*el and (we are out). 

I am also trying to become trans. I am born male but mentally I am more of a woman. (I am only out to my close friends and a small part of my family) I am trying to be more me around them. 

I am in my last year of middle school.   


My mom is a karen because she asks for the manager for no reason and she is such a hypocrite because she doesn't wear a mask and then complains about other people not wearing masks. 

My dad was a very verbally abusive dad in the past but he changed 5 years ago. But now he cooks everyday talks, doesn't scream and is awesome and accepting of lgtb people. 

The law where I live is everything I own Isn't mine but my parents until I’m 18.  

My mom is telling me that I am pretty much her slave and that I should do everything she asks even when I have a sister and brother that can do things too. (She does this because I am the oldest male from the kids)

I do the dishes, throw out the trash and do grocery shopping. And I have exams this year. My sister also has exams this year. 

I also am dealing with the fact that I don't have any memory from 5 years ago. 

That was because I was the kid that got bullied. I can think of the worst that a kid could do to you. It probably happened to me and I lost  my memory because another kid was bullied so much and the bullies demanded that he killed me so he tried and smashed my brains into a wall at school. And the worse the bullies never got punished the school actually tried the kick me out for getting bullied.

My mom and my dad were of course furious about all of this. 

I was a happy and positive kid but after I lost my memory I lost myself or at least who I was and I changed so much that people don't see me as me but have some twisted fusion of me. I am pretty depressed when I am with my mom. 

When I am with my dad my feelings aren't changed when I'm with him in a bad way. I feel safe when I'm there. 

I am a pretty closed kid, don't have a lot of friends and dont talk to others that much. 

When I’m outside I put on a mask(figuratively and literally) and try to hide myself. 

I don’t show my feelings around strangers. (strangers are to me just anyone i don't know personally)

As you can see I’m having a lot of mental problems. 

There is no arguing with my mom what she says goes, what we do does not matter. 

My mom has a broken rib and can't do groceries or outside in general. 

When I have important tests I don't want to be In my moms house when doing all the chores in that house and learning for school is my life full and I can't have any kind of social life or be mentaly stable at the same time. 

Because I don't have a lot of people I trust or love. It's hard to lose one that I am supposed to trust. 

I am out. I’ve pretty much lost 3 of my best friends last year and now my mom is telling me that she wants to decide everything in my life and sell my old stuff. without giving me the money that was paid for this stuff. 

My sister is also thinking of leaving my mom for other reasons. 

I found out that my dad can not have both of us in the house all the time because of money. 

I don't know what I should do.   


AITA &amp; WIBTA

515,"So I (28F) have been seeing this guy (29M) officially for about 3 months. I have had 2 serious long term partners in the past, who were both women. 

I have never hidden these relationships from this guy, however I didn't explicitly tell him they were with women as I didn't think it was all that relevent, it doesn't effect our relationship which up until now has been great.

Last night I stayed round his house and when I woke up this morning, he was really cold and off with me and  when I asked him what was wrong he told me that whilst I was asleep last night he went through my phone.

He told me he'd looked through my internet history and he'd seen I'd been searching for girl on girl porn. He asked me if I liked girls and I said ""yes."" He got really angry saying he didn't care, but he didn't understand why I had lied to him about it and he said it was like I was ""living a double life"" and that he felt like he couldn't trust me.

He then told me he needed some space to think about it and get his head round everything, which I respect so I left his and came home. That was about 8 hours ago and he hasn't been in contact or messaged me or anything.

I know I messed up by not telling him from the jump about being bisexual, but I was terrified how he would react. How do I get my boyfriend to trust me again?",14Nov2020,1
516,"I'm in my final year of school now, and i have applied to 5 universities, 2 in my city, and 3 away from my city

I'm a child of immigrants, and my Mum speaks very little English, so I am expected to help out a lot around the house. Every night I have to be home alone with my little brother (8 years old) to take care of him and feed him when my Mum is working the night shift, and helping them out doing bills and taxes and stuff digitally.

I don't mind that much, I love my family, but because I'm expected to help out all of the time, I feel stressed and anxious a lot. I have never had a sleepover, gone to a concert or a festival, and I can count the amount of times that I have been out with my friends on one hand. I have no extra-curriculars because I can't commit to anything as both of my parents have zero-hours contracts and I would be expected to baby-sit on very little notice.

I'm not really close with my parents, to be honest. I'm so used to being independent and doing stuff on my own and doing stuff for them that they have never been a source of support for me. This might be a cultural thing, but they mostly just criticize me.

They started acting nicer when I was sending off applications and telling me to stay at home with them, i'll save money, family is important, blah blah blah.

I want a life. I want to be able to find a hobby, make friends, and do things without constantly having to devote my time to my family. But, I don't want to leave them in a difficult position financially, and I don't want to leave my little brother alone with them. My older brother (23) would be moving back in next year, but he doesn't help around the house whatsoever, so I'm worried I'm going to leave them overwhelmed and be guilty about this.

TLDR; Should I stay home and help my family out while I am doing my degree next year, or should I do my degree in another city and move out? What should I do?",14Nov2020,1
517,"Like the title says, im 19 about to turn 20 in 4 months. My family and older friends call me a kid and also treats me like one. I can understand when strangers call me a kid because I can easily pass as a 15 year old or even 13 at times. But when my family or friends who actually know how old I am do it, it gets pretty annoying.

I dont mind when they call me a kid as much as I mind when they treat me like one. Im not allowed to go to parties (pre covid) that my older friends (25) goes to because apparently im still a kid. Heck, my parents still uses the infamous 'you are not old enough to understand' line on me. 

Im not a very immature person so I dont see why this is happening to me.

519,"My sister just had a baby 3 months ago. She was really excited about it and was around the baby all the time for the first couple weeks after she was born. After that, she just stopped paying her much attention. She makes sure that she's okay but she does not care for her herself at all and makes her boyfriend do everything, she's just super lazy. For example, the baby was screaming and crying in her crib while my sister was asleep, and my dad heard it from all the way downstairs and came to wake her up. My sister got up, went to the bathroom where her bf was taking a shower, and made him get out and take care of her. She does stuff like that all the time, won't even hold the baby. She has been getting back into drugs (weed, acid, alcohol, etc.) and goes out until late every night with her friends, leaving her bf and my dad to take care of the baby. She suffers from depression and borderline personality disorder and straight up asked me to adopt the baby because she does not want to care for her.

520,"Background info: I am a 20F med student,was studying abroad, moved back home due to the pandemic, have been doing classes online, just finished exams and have a ten day break before second year starts.

I live with my parents 50F, 49M, grandma 73F, siblings 18M, 15F, 13M, and cousin 13M. My cousin and grandma moved in with us after my grandpa and my cousin's mom died. They've been living with us for five years now.

Problem: The kids have been attending school online since March. I found out a few weeks ago that my cousin skips online school and plays games instead, meaning he's gaming for about ten to twelve hours a day (8-2 under the pretense of schooling, and then 2-12 just because no one stops him)

In effect, he's missed about eight months of classes, and has exams coming up.
I brought this to my grandma's notice, as she acts as his primary caretaker (his father only visits once in two months or so, has no clue what his son gets up to). My grandma gave me full control over his access to electronics, so I've locked his phone and he can use it only for classes from 8-2 under my supervision. I've said he can game for two hours a day if he studies for an additional two hours after school.

The issue is that, he doesn't know anything, and I've no idea how to teach him. He 'studies' for two hours but when questioned, or given a paper, he can't remember anything. Sitting him down and explaining things to him, asking him to revise, teaching him myself- nothing works, because he says he can't remember.

So how can I help him study? What methods could I use to help him remember things? How can I make him a study schedule and get him to stick to it?
And how can I help him long term (because I have classes from 8-5 Monday to Saturday and will probably be going back to uni once things settle down)?",14Nov2020,1

The thing is, I’ve always been used to having such extreme emotions, and medication makes me feel so numb. I’d rather feel the way I do than feel numb, because when I feel that numb, I make rather bad decisions to feel something— drugs, sex, alcohol, anything of the sort. The only real difference is that I CONSCIOUSLY make those decisions when I’m on medication. These decisions and my disorder effect the people around me, too, which is where I start to feel guilty.

530,"I (20F) was born to a traditional Indian family, who come from the region of Punjab, India. My parents raised me in a very white suburbia, oftentimes the western culture would clash with the culture within my house and how my parents raised me. I made a lot of friends, all from varying ethnicities but many are white, and are either Christian or raised within a Christian/Catholic household. I love my friends and I know they love me, I oftentimes go above and beyond to try to make my friends feel special to me and loved, especially on Christmas I’ll always tell them merry Christmas, and obviously I will always try to make their birthdays special. When it comes to me, my friends often complain that it’s difficult to buy gifts for me and I’ve simply expressed I prefer sentiment over material. That if they simply wrote a nice paragraph in a card that’s enough for me. Now, I’ve expressed that I would be very happy if my friends could remember when Diwali was and would wish me a happy holiday considering that I don’t celebrate Christmas, this is one of the only holidays I celebrate throughout the year as I am Sikh. My heart would literally burst if any of them could remember and send me a simple happy Diwali text on the holiday. However even after I express my interest, year after year I’m disappointed. It hurts that I make a lot of effort for them but they don’t make the effort for me, I love them deeply and I know they care for me as we’ve expressed this mutual love and appreciation many times. However their words are hardly backed with any significant action to make me feel loved outside of the realm of being there for me in tough situations and saying happy birthday (they often don’t tend to get me gifts or honestly at this point try to, one of my closest friends simply never even texts me happy birthday even when she knows when it is.) In all honesty I don’t care about my birthday, I just want them to say happy Diwali. I just want to know am I wrong for wishing they would remember Diwali for me, I understand I can never expect others to do the same for me however I always text my friends who are of other religions for their holidays. I know I rambled so in short 

1) Is it too much of me to ask them to remember Diwali (date changes yearly but can be easily googled) and wish me a happy holiday the day of

531,"So it wasn’t long ago. Last year from September up until February, that it was what felt like the best time of my life. 

It was the first time in my life that I had an actual group of friends that I went out with, every now and then we would have many problems and drama cropped up often, but eventually we just got past it and kept going out every single night. 

Around January a very close friend (who I had been friends with for 3 years) had started questioning me and kept trying to get me to help him with his mental problems, without actually going to get him real help. But the way he’d try to bring it up, was by asking me what my situation is. 
That kept going for a while until I caught on and just told him I knew what he was doing. He clearly didn’t like that. And he was holding a grudge from how I was ‘weak’ by ‘giving up’ on a relationship that was abusive (this relationship didn’t last long, only a month, last year around June).

But what’s keeping me in the past is that in February, he just lost it. At all of us. A close friend I had for years just completely changed and left us all. Leaving just a giant hate message behind. It put my down a lot. He said I was a bad person for prioritising my girlfriend over him. He said I “gave up” on all my friends because I was going out with my girlfriend more often than him. He really hated me. I saw him like this before, he had depression since he was 13 and his parents tried many times to get him to a therapist, but he’d only want to talk to me about it. So after helping him for that many years, seeing him hate on me this much. Telling me I did nothing for him. Saying I’m a shit person. It hit me. Hard.

After he left, I never went out with my friends again. And then Covid came along making sure of that. To this day I really just want to redo all of it. I loved going out. I loved having a girlfriend (I’m still with her but I haven’t been out properly with her since all this happened). 

But this problem has been going on for so long that I know I just need to move on from it. And I have no idea how too. I’m stuck here hoping for another chance to fix it all. I know I could fix it if I had another chance. Tell him the right things. But I just need to let it go and stop all of that thinking. How do I do it? I’ve searched on the internet, asked my girlfriend, asked my best friend (who’s been with me the whole way through) but none of them have managed to take my mind off of it permanently. It just keeps coming back to me. 

(Keep in mind me and the guy who hates me go to the same school. And I have a couple of friends who are also his friends. So I see him often. Which makes it worse. He often bumps into me on purpose, acting like I’m not even a person. And I’ve heard from one of them friends, he just refers to me as “ginger” whenever he has to say my name.

It's our 2 year anniversary and he put up 3 pictures of me saying he loves me and it has been the best 2 years ever and I feel like a monster. We had agreed not to get one another anything for it and he got me this book I mentioned wanting 2 weeks ago, chocolates and a cute card. He still really cares.

 We had a really bad rough patch summer 2019. This happened again from June-early September this year. He has a serious mental illness that makes him a shadow of himself. He can unload on me for weeks at a time. We fought almost daily because I was so fed up and wanted him to get therapy for our future. About 2 or 3 months ago I was so resentful of all the crap this untreated thing put me through, I started worrying I needed to end it because maybe I'm too insensitive to handle it. Suddenly I wanted to spend less time with him and felt less attracted as my head was filled with guilt or anger of stuff the illness made me feel. The last 3 times I've met him though, I have had a lot of fun like old times and found myself getting aroused!! This hadn't happened for like 3 months. 

I'll admit, he has been a lot better the last 2 months and I still have hope it' won't come back or if it does he'll get help. I just want to fall in love again and not be thinking so negatively. I yearn for how I felt. Is it possible to get it back? And if so how? We've been long distance for the last 8 months, which in sure hasn't helped either.

537,"I’m considering going back to school for a career change to healthcare from engineering(Bs in electrical engineering and working in O&amp;G). I have tried talking to friends in healthcare (two NPs so far, I plan on talking to MDs too) to get a better idea of ...
1.) what I might expect making that kind of career change, 
2.) the reality of going back to school, 
3.) the amount of schooling involved for Med school if that is the route I decide, 
4.) the potential earnings for NP/PA vs MDs
5.) work life balances

I’m early 30s with my own natural curiosity for healthcare and I really want to help other people and I’m just not going to get that satisfaction in engineering. I make six figures in engineering but the current reality is that I’ve been furloughed since June (thanks COVID 🙄). If I go back to school (read as: become a debtor again (finished undergrad school loans early this year btw)) I do want it to be financially worth it, but the financial piece is NOT the motivation for the change. I just want to ensure I can pay off my debts from changing careers and recover the lost wages. Another consideration is that I want to have a family and start a family soon (next few years). 

I tend to think over things a lot and over analyze so I will probably edit or comment on this as more thoughts come up.

Then two days later he stopped texting me for like 4 days so I texted him and asked him if he’s okay and he said he’s busy. I said oh okay then he said “maybe I was waiting for you to text me” meanwhile I never texted him first in my life. Then he stopped answering me again. I’ve been ghosted. Why cum inside of somebody and put them at risk of being pregnant if you don’t like them?,14Nov2020,1

547,"I just found out that my dad is cheating on my mom  
No one else knows it I think, but i don't know what to do. It would tear my entire family to pieces if I told them, but not saying it would make me the second biggest asshole in my family. I know it would destroy my mom, and probably lead to a divorce. I've read some of the text from my dad and the homewrecker, and he is also contemplating to get a divorce. Im living at home and moving out soon. My parents also want to move soon, because they have a house and want to live in a apartment. They are waiting for me to move out before they move, but I feel like if I move, and they sell the house and move into a apartment, my dad will leave soon after and just leave my mom alone in that apartment, which she of course can't pay for herself. So then she say to move again alone while being heartbroken. I know they are older and that they have lost a bit interest as u get older. But this will tear my mom up. So i don't know what to do. 

Should I come out to the family, and make my mom unhappy and maybe depressed, should I keep the secret, and just have a broken heart until I die. Or should I talk to my dad or big sister about it before???

As u probably can tell i've just found out and feel sick and my heart hurts like crazy, and it's not a metaphor it's really hurting. I dont know what to do I hate this pain!",14Nov2020,1

549,"To preface this, I attend a Catholic school with a rather conservative atmosphere, run by a principal and an administration who clearly care for their image much more than the wellbeing of their students. 

Since the fall, we've operated on a hybrid schedule due to Covid, and although I had no confidence in the system at first, it has seemed to work so far. The principal, however, has been pushing the boundaries of the system, calling for more and more kids to be in school each day as opposed to online, and completely throwing the basis of the system out of the window. Although I disagreed with this, there was never any real evidence of cases being spread through school, so nobody could say anything. Yesterday, however, the county health board voted to suspend all in-person learning starting on the 23rd. My principal, being the retaliatory and reactionary piece of shit he is, decides that he wants to spite the county health board by having every student in school every day next week, completely throwing safety out the window. It's hard enough social distancing with half of the school in at once, and it's going to be functionally impossible to do so with all of the school in. Now, they have given an option to spend the next week in online learning, but they are basically holding the students hostage here, as they say if you opt to be online you are not allowed to come in any day that week. To add insult to injury, they've decided to throw a football tournament this week as one last middle finger to the public health officials who clearly know more about the situation than they do.

The dilemma that I have here is a social one. I do not want to come into school at all due to health reasons, and due to the fact that I don't want to play into my piece of shit principal's power fantasy. On the other hand, most of my friends said that they're going in, and I really don't want to be that one guy who's online while the rest of the class is in school. I know the answer here of what to do should be obvious, but I'm at a loss and I've been going back and forth in my head for the past day about what I should do. Being a senior in high school with social anxiety during a pandemic is not fun.",14Nov2020,1

553,"Yes probably changing my perspective. But if that was so easy I would have done it already. It just feels like a thousand steps back after I came so far. As if all my progress is erased and I can't move forward as there are blocks in every part I want to improve. 

What are the things in my life I CAN change right now? I give you an overview: 

\- I live downstairs in a flat that belongs to my parents house. It smells like old basement and everything on me (hair, clothes) smells like that. It makes me feel worse somehow, because it's so dark (it's souterrain). I know I should be happy about having a place on my own and even rent free. The last half year I lived with my mom and it wasn't easy at all it was really hard and we still fight about super dumb stuff. The only thing I could do is move to a shared flat with new people in the city I work in (ca. 30min drive away from my parents place). I just don't know if that is the right step, the moving in a shared flat because I was actually really sick of sharing flats after living in those since 8 years. 

\- I have a part time job that pays minimum wage, and at least I don't have to worry about money that much but I also can't really afford living on my own with that money (except for downstairs in my parents house). I like the job, it's fine and I like my colleaugues but my boss is notorious for firing people for being sick (and I am sick quiet often because of an autoimmune disease). Also I am actually looking for a full time job since I have a Master's degree and a brain I would like to actually use . The part time job is basically just a supermarket job. 

\- I have basically no one of my friends in my close vicinity. This is the hometown of my parents, and I went to school further away, so all my school friends also moved away after graduation. Same with my friends from my Bachelors and my Masters. They are all either 3-5 hours away or more. I feel lonely very often, because of my circumstances (father died in March because of covid19) and because I have ""no one"" here friend wise. It is also extremely hard to find new people as the lockdown has been in place since March here. 

\- My mental health of course(!) has been struggling under this even more, depressive episodes haunt me and I hate feeling like that. I am either anxious about the future or depressed. I have medication since this week and some appointment next week, so at least there's that. 

Can you help me? What is there that I can change? Or is it my inner world that makes the whole living situation feel so horrible?",14Nov2020,1
554,"Me (female, 26) and my boyfriend (male, 26) have been together for about 4 years. He is the nicest guy in the world. I can’t imagine finding anyone who would love me more than him, who has a bigger heart than him, or who is kinder than him. He struggles with a lot of anxiety which has led to a lot of issues in our relationship (wearing me down, acting short) and he can be a little lazy. But other than that, there is nothing inherently wrong with our relationship. We have lived together for a little while. I just never feel a SPARK anymore. And I find myself judging his appearance in my head (which sounds terrible, but true). We never have sex. Partly because of meds we are both on. I find myself thinking about “what ifs” with other guys. Every time I think about breaking up with him I cry and feel so sad though. It would BREAK him and frankly break me too. I get scared I would regret it. But also get scared that if I stay, my whole life I will be thinking about wanting more. He is just so kind hearted and loves me so so much. I love him too. I just don’t know if I’m in love with him anymore... I pick at him all the time and get annoyed at him constantly and I feel bad. I used to be so sure I would marry him. Idk if I am just “bored” bc of COVID and living together and being together so constantly OR if I’m settling and should always crave a “spark.” I just don’t know if this is normal after your been dating for so long or what.

555,"We’re supposed to get married in 3 weeks. It’s been planned for over a year. The current situation is effecting every aspect of the wedding. Currently the county is on orange status meaning there is a serious hotspot occurring, hospitals are nearly overrun, and the venue is at risk of shutting down if it goes to red status.

We only have 50 attendees to the wedding, mostly family that already interact with each other regularly. Half of my family I invited declined and the other half are starting to drop off. I assume that by the time of the wedding I will have no family or friends attending if the venue stays open.

My soon to be spouse is dead set on having the wedding and getting married, and having the full event if the county is open and the venue is open. I’m not terrible concerned about the event causing spread, we have good social distancing in place and again its all family who interact regularly. However, I am going to be disappointed if it’s only her family that seems to totally suck for me. But also I don’t want to have her upset at me for the rest of time for insisting we reschedule.

I don’t know what to do. The best thing that happens is the county closes and forces our hand but until that happens I am living every day dreading everything that is happening. I’ve tried to communicate this to her but shes been planning this day her whole life and it’s hard. This is such a tough situation I literally can’t win.

I've always had trouble with addiction. I see a candy bar and even though I know it's bad for me in the long term, I eat it anyway. Then I feel regret and tell myself I need to stop doing this, yet when it happens again, I eat the candy bar again.

My brain must be evaluating the immediate benefit as better than the long term cost, otherwise I wouldn't do it. How can I change that? How can I change the evaluation I do?

561,"My dear friend has been unlucky in love for the better part of her life. Last year she finally found the one and we are all extremely happy for her. A year ago they started planning their December wedding but when Covid hit in March we started asking questions about what would happen if the pandemic continued. At that point it didn’t seem like an issue because few  thought    We still be dealing with Covid.

Around June or July she mentioned that if worse came to worse, she’d have a small ceremony in December with her family and then have a big party the following summer when Covid was much less of a problem or when restrictions were less stringent.

Something changed and she decided to have the wedding anyway. Where we live the local government has strongly urged that people forgo  gatherings and we are going back into lockdown mode in some areas.
In fact, the county were the wedding is is only allowing gatherings of 30 people or less but the wedding is on private property...

She initially invited, including children, close to 300 people to this thing. Due to Covid and other reasons she’ll probably get closer to 100 but that’s still far too many people to safely gather in December In an event space. 

The crazy thing is, she works in healthcare. She understands the  dangers of this  disease. She is a loving, giving, self less person so this just doesn’t make sense. 

I know many of her closest friends aren’t going and we’re thinking about pulling the plug too.  Except our daughter is in wedding...

563,"I’ll try not to go into a pity sob story rant here, but I just need some advice. I’m a 20 year old F full time college student. I plan on graduating in a year and hopefully going to law school. Ever since I got to college, it’s been a total mess of up and down depression. In high school I had tons of friends and was likeable by pretty much everyone. I consider myself to be an extrovert and I’m unhappy when I’m not around people. When I got to college, I found it pretty much impossible to make any friends. I tried to join clubs, rush for a sorority, talk to people in class, nothing worked. I’m a pretty fun person, I’ll party or go to bars or whatever because that’s fun for me. I’m a junior now and I have one single friend that goes to college with me and is also my roommate, he’s been my friend since middle school. He is super inconsistent though and just does his own thing, and stays at his boyfriends house pretty much all the time. I have acquaintances I’ve met, but really no one that I truly enjoy spending time with. My boyfriend is my best friend and I love him to death, but our relationship has been super tumultuous. He got caught up on pain pills and (thank god) hes getting help now in inpatient, but it’s been really hard. I love him with everything in me and I cant see myself with anyone else, but now his family is moving from the town both our families live in, so I don’t know where he will end up when he gets out of rehab. I’ve been staying in my family’s house just to have some type of interaction, although my family isn’t the healthiest. My mom has a delusional disorder and has fallen apart. My dad works 80 hours a week and my sister has a boyfriend so she’s never home. But, If i go back to my college apartment (which is only an hour away), I’ll sit there alone all day.

I’ve been trying to stay positive but it’s becoming progressively harder. Everyday I wake up and it’s the same thing as it was the day before, and it breaks me down. Nothing new, nothing exciting ever comes up. All of my classes are online so I don’t even have the opportunity to get up for campus anymore. I hardly have anyone to talk to or get support from (although, of course, I’m always right there for everyone who needs me.) I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed Zoloft but it made it even worse. What is some advice you can give me to keep myself sane and not go back into a full blown depression? What are some healthy habits? How can I make friends? Any other advice is appreciated. Thank you.",14Nov2020,1

565,"So my sister was extremely careful when she was back at home, she would clean off surfaces and stayed home almost all the time, but when she went to college in August she started hanging out with her friends, going over to other's apartments, etc. She is coming back home for Thanksgiving, and she has been more careful these past 14 days and she is getting a test before she comes back. 

My family is very healthy and my parents are at relatively low risk for having serious complications because of COVID. My sister would likely still be more careful at home than at school because we are concerned about them. We have been careful with COVID, we don't interact with friends or even extended family members without masks, social distancing, and being outside, but we are definitely not on the extreme end of care.

My parents are very thoughtful and they asked me (the younger sibling, 16M) what I think we should do. I suggested that she should get a test when she gets home, quarantine for 3-5 days waiting for the results, then if negative, she can stop serious quarantine and get a second test in a couple days to make sure. We all agreed that if the tests is positive she should quarantine for at least 2 weeks.

I felt a little out of place suggesting this because I only don't go anywhere because I have online school, whereas my dad and my mom have to leave at least once a day for errands and/or work. My mom then brought up the point that my dad is the likely the least careful among us and when he comes home he can be just as much of a risk as my sister coming home from school. I then argued that just because my dad isn't being careful (we also all agree that he should be more careful from now on) doesn't justify not being careful with my sister. 

After we talked about this, I fell really terrible. I'm not really sure if I am being unfair to my sister. I want to be safe, but am I overreacting? I trust my sister but she also wasn't careful at school. I really don't know what to do,any suggestions for solutions to the situations or towards my stance are appreciated!

TLDR: My sister is coming home from school, how careful should we be without going to far (we have been careful but not as careful as we could be).

Disclaimers:
- My family is wonderful, they are all respectful, kind people who are concerned about COVID, I do not want to criticize them, I am more just looking for advice about my own approach and the situation.

- I likely left out some details because of my bias, so please ask questions to challenge my story and I will clarify!",14Nov2020,1
566,"Hey, 
My brother is 6 1/2 years younger than me. A couple weeks back I had a really bad mental breakdown and panic attack. We weren't that close when we were younger, mostly because I had turned into the problem child of the family and my parents were always there to set an example of me.  I was being severely bullied at school back then and my grades had suddenly gone from straight A's to B's (Asian Families :') ). After I finished my 12th grade, we did grow closer. And until recently we shared almost everything in our lives with each other. I'm not in a good place rn and I'm literally hanging on at home alone because of the pandemic situation, I really need him but ever since the attack he's become more and more distant and he said he needs to be distant to keep his sanity. He says I did not scare him off with my attack but I don't know. He is at a really delicate age rn and Ik being distant as a young teen is needed because that's how you understand and establish your place in the world. I really need him rn, but whenever I talk to him he feels so cold and analytical. He says I take things too personally and it's all in my head, he says he's listening but he really isn't because it almost feels like he's doing it out of pity. Am I overreacting? I'm so lost. And it hurts so much. I do not want to be a burden to anyone but I really need him and he's just not there, I feel like I'm begging for scraps honestly and it's hard to act normal. I have one best friend and I'm moving in with her in a couple days because I have my finals soon and I can't study at home. What should I do about my situation with my brother?",14Nov2020,1
567,"&amp;#x200B;

I hate to come across as a karma whore which btw I don't want to just farm karma from this post but I'm in and have been going the worst five months of my life by now. It all started five months ago when I self harmed for the first time by cutting my forearm.

My mum found out the next day after she saw the cuts on my arm. It was at this point that she decided to take me and my sister out of our house because she assumed my dad was the problem he was a big part of the problem always being highly manipulative, controlling, emotionally abusive and generally a shit person but that wasn't everything that was wrong with me.

For the next three months we lived in a family friend's house far away from my actual house. I never got to say goodbye to my friends there and I didn't get to bring any personal belongings with me. It was the worst! I was doing therapy over the phone and to this day I don't know what my therapist actually looked like because of Covid and we couldn't do zoom calls or anything like that for some reason. It didn't help and I stopped therapy after a few months because of that. I felt I had no one since I hardly knew anyone there and just felt as though I would be intruding by trying to get to know them.

Fast forward three months into this after self harming again in that house my mum found a rental property not far from my school and since school was going to start up again in a month or two we moved there and I'm still there. I don't know when or even if I'll ever be back in my own house and I've just been obsessing over the ifs of it all. No matter what house I'm in as long as its not mine I will not be happy and just to get the point across I took 12 solpadeine pills in just a few minutes when there is a warning saying to never take more than 8 in 24 hours. I wanted to die. In between all of that I've had to deal with school and I have hidden almost everything from all of my friends.

I've started to get a little better being on medication but there's been some weird side effects that make me feel pretty ill at times. What I really need help with however is how I'm going to tell what I've just told everyone reading this to my friends and more. This post is but a quick summary of everything I've had to endure but if I included all of it even the TL;DR would be too long.

Tl;DR I've been going through a really rough patch the last few months struggling with self harm and suicidal thoughts and I need advice on how to tell that to my friends.",14Nov2020,1

573,"Dear Redditors,
2 years ago I began college in Europe. I chose a tough STEM major and the workload wasn’t normal. In first year I was working everyday from 8am-12pm minimum sometimes even from 6am-12pm. We had to take quizzes almost every single day in a week, everyday a different subject. It was sick. I worked so hard and still couldnt barely pass exams. I took an exam 4 times and worked for over 4weeks everyday for at least 12h and still didnt pass. At that point I got so angry and additionally to that I got kicked out of university. Ever since I was a little child I wanted to persue a job in astronomy. So a university degree was required. Anyways, after that kick in the butt I decided to go back to my home country and persue the same major again. And let me tell you, the entrance exam is even tougher here. I dont know almost anybody and overall this entire situation is daunting. I had to retake a hella lot of classes and on top of that my „team”mate in a lab course is not doing anything and I am dependant on him because there is an issue on my computer which doesnt allow me to run the software, so I can‘t really tell him my opinion on his lazy behaviour and the lab assistant is getting suspicious already regarding the deadline. I could go trough the roof. I hate any other 9-5job and becoming a youtuber or anything related to media is just not it (at least for me). I constantly think about restarting college again (in the US though) with the same major because it seems to be easier than in Europe. I am so tired of failure and not having no freetime. Somehow I just hate Europe (I am European myself). Has anyone been in a similar situation? I feel so lost with my life and also very sad😔 I would be grateful if someone could share their advice with me",14Nov2020,1

576,"Me and this guy, have been friends for the past 2 years. I've liked him for almost a year now, and he was really nice to me. We clicked almost immediately once we met. He makes me laugh, and we can text for hours into the night sometimes. I've never met a guy who understood me better. Anyway, I never told him how i felt because he once dated a mutual friend of ours for a few months and also because he actually told me liked someone else sometime last yr. And, although he makes me very happy when we talk, he's actually a pretty problematic/toxic guy. He can get quite clingy sometimes, telling me he loves me and misses me, or wants to study with me because he wants to spend time with me.

 

But at the same time, we can go weeks without talking because he forgets to reply me and i dont want to come off as too clingy... He guilt trips me quite frequently as well, for eg, he used to complain about how i didnt study with him enough, or question why i didnt say hi to him when i saw him around because i just happened to miss him. Anyway, we stopped talking because he admitted to me that he found me a little boring sometimes and because of that he sometimes struggled to carry the conversation between the two of us. That was kind of the last straw for me, so i proceeded to stop talking to him over the next 2 weeks.

 

i finally confronted him about it, and basically told him all about how i felt over the past 2 years, how i liked him but at the same time felt uncomfortable about him. He admitted that he might have crossed the line sometimes, but he also admitted that he had feelings for me at some point, but felt that it was impossible between us. We managed to talk some things out, and he apologised for ever hurting my feelings. But we agreed that we shouldnt be friends anymore. Now months after not talking to each other, i rly do miss him. Should i give him a second chance and try going back to being friends?

 

I feel like if we both set clear boundaries, we might still be able to go back to being friends or something idk, i dont want to lose him.

579,"My (16F) boyfriend (17M)'s parents are divorced, and typically when he's at his dad's house he'll drink beer with him. And in general he does drink - before lockdown there was a festival in his coutnry where he was pretty much drunk for a week solid after his father gave him money to buy beer, knowing that my boyfriend had started to drink.

We've been together since August. For context, we're ""never-met"" dating \[see r/wemetonline or r/LDR\] - long distance (but we video call, etc; he's real and everything is fine. That's not the issue here). 

In September (we've been official since August) my boyfriend got drunk at a family gathering. He sent me random drunken messages; nothing bad, but drunken ones. And I absolutely *hated* it. I was up early the next morning; we have a few hours' time difference and so I started pretty much bawling my eyes out at 5.50 a.m. when I woke up to these messages. I hated, hated, *hated* reading them, knowing that he was drunk.

For more context, I've never tasted alcohol in my life. My dad has gotten tipsy at family occasions before, and I've never liked how he acts; brash and loud and just weird in general. Other than that, I've never had a real problem with alcohol; being a teenager in school, I know people around me are drinking, but it never bothered me that they were and I wasn't. My social circle is pretty limited and I've never had the opportunity to drink, but frankly never had an interest.

I still can't understand why these drunken messages made me literally *cry*. They were pretty fine; I love you, we're singing, I'm drunk haha, etc. etc. Nothing terrible; in fact, pretty nice, as far as drunk messages go. After that, my boyfriend hasn't gotten drunk again; he's been to his mother's house a couple of times and back to his father's. Now he's back at his father's today after being at his mother's for a couple of weeks. And I'm *dreading* the thought of him possibly drinking while he's at his dad's, and even worse getting drunk. But I don't know what to do - to his previous drunken messages I responded nicely, and never even mentioned that it made me really uncomfortable (never mind that I was sobbing for an hour and took a while to calm down). It would be stupid to bring it up, considering that this is almost two months later, and that I have absolutely no right to tell him what to do. But I just really, really, really don't want to see any more drunk messages, or even *know* when he's drinking. 

I don't even know why I'm making this post; I'm just wondering I guess if anyone else has had a similar experience. Or maybe someone will tell me that I need to rob a liquor store and get drunk myself; that I'm being stupid, and that it's all down to the fact that I've never had alcohol. I don't know. I know perfectly well I can't tell him not to drink, and I certainly don't think of myself as being better because I don't drink. I just don't know what to do, and am at a complete loss.",14Nov2020,1

584,"I have been living in my current home for about 8 months now and shortly after we moved in, a family moved into one of the other flats. Since the lockdown here started and the kids in the other flat were at home more often, the child has been playing more online games during the day. The issue here is that this child is not quiet about it. They shout, scream, swear and kick the radiators, pipes, walls and what sounds like a wooden desk or door. We can hear them clearly every time they do this and even though they have gone back to school now, every day, just after 3 in the afternoon until very late some days, the noise continues.

Now the problem I have here is, I don't know which flat they live in. My block is split into 3 floors with 2 flats per floor. I am on the top floor but the sounds are so loud that they sound like they are coming from every direction to me (my hearing is not the best which makes the volume of this noise even more surprising). This means they could be my neighbours to the side or below as both families moved in at the same time and both have young boys.

Additionally, I have been working at home since March now and I spend many hours talking to people on the phone and some of these people have commented on the sound through the phone also. I need to get this kids parents to deal with the noise their child is making but they do not seem phased by him. 

My final issue is that both me and my partner suffer from very bad social anxiety and face to face confrontation or conversation will not be an option from either of us as we are simply incapable of it.

How can I address this issue without offending the wrong flat and without sparking any verbal or in person conversation with the family in question? I know this is a lot to take in and some pretty bad restrictions but any advise would be greatly appreciated.",14Nov2020,1

587,"So here’s the soup:
I work at a Organic Food Co-Op (basically an over priced grocery store with membership dues) as a shipment receiver. They treat me really well, the staff are all very friendly and understanding and really work with you on scheduling to such a degree that I’ve never seen before in service jobs like this. The problem is that the work is hard and sloppily organized and it is taking its toll on my back, my sleep and my mental health. Getting paid $2 above minimum wage is not enough to essentially run an entire grocery department (mind you Im not manager I just work hard and the management are notorious for delegating tasks and then never checking up on them basically making to so you have to train yourself, worked for me but not so much for others so I essentially have to pick up the slack).
So due to this I’ve been looking for an out and I’ve noticed that every GameStop in my area is hiring. I’ve never worked retail (aside for a two year stint in a cheap headshop) but I’m assuming the work would be pretty easy compared to what I’m used to. I’ve only ever heard bad things about GameStop, but I love video games and wouldn’t mind being in that environment. My worries are that I will be underpaid to such a degree that I won’t be able to attend classes this spring and pay rent. I also worry that it might be an even worse nightmare than what I’m dealing with rn. Idk
Any GameStop employee experience whether it be good or bad would be appreciated. Thanks so much I’m advance.

591,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post, please direct me to the correct place.

I'm 16f and homeschooled. I realized that I will have all of my graduation requirements by the end of this school year. I'm taking a lot of CLEP's and DSST's this year, as my local high school wouldn't let me sign up for AP's.

The only reasons I have to stay in high school next year are to take AP Spanish Language, AP Spanish Literature, and maybe AP Studio Art for fun. I can honestly take Spanish as an elective in college or sign up for a class if I really wanted to after saving up. I don't really have much reason to graduating early though other than getting more challenging coursework and moving out sooner.

My mom said she is okay with this as long as I only take online courses until everything calms down, as she and my grandma are at risk. I will be a first generation college student. I don't know if it matters, but I am also half Nepali. I lived below the poverty line in middle school and some of high school.

I will be taking the SAT at least twice by June (haven't signed up yet) and I am pretty certain I will score at least a 1200. My GPA is around 3.87 (weighted, forgot what it is unweighted) and I am trying to bring it up this year. I have only gotten a C in ENG 100 (covid was difficult) and majority of my grades are A's. I plan to write a novel this year and maybe start a small business selling candles.

I am working and I will have at least 70 volunteer hours by the end of 11th grade. I wanted to have more, but there isn't a lot of opportunities in my city and I don't have a lot of time.

I am going to teach elementary or secondary English as a career. If for some reason teaching doesn't work for me, I am going to switch to a degree in either Organizational Management or Accounting. The colleges I am looking at are the University of Southern Maine, Indian River State College, University of Central Florida, and Florida International University.

My actual goals in life are to be an author, help people learn English, learn Spanish, French, German, Mandarin Chinese, Nepali, and at least one more language, and to be a stay at home mom when I am older.

At the end of 11th grade, I will have 31 Credits:

English: 4.5

English 1 Honors, English 2 Honors, ENG 100 College Writing (USM), English Literature Honors (CLEP), Creative Writing (0.5)


Mathematics: 5

Algebra 1 Honors, Geometry Honors, Algebra 2 w/Trigonometry Honors, Statistics &amp; Probability Honors (DSST), Precalculus w/ Trigonometry Honors (maybe CLEP)

Also studying for College Algebra CLEP, but not for high school credit.

Science: 5

Biology Honors, Marine Science Honors, Astronomy Honors (DSST), Environmental Science Honors (DSST), Chemistry Honors (maybe CLEP)

Social Studies &amp; History: 5.5

Global Issues (0.5), Early US History Honors (CLEP), Modern US History Honors (CLEP), Human Geography Honors (DSST), US Government Honors (CLEP), Macroeconomics Honors (CLEP)

Humanities: 7

Intro to Drama: Performance and Design, Art Fundamentals, World Religions Honors (DSST), Art History Honors (DSST), Spanish 1, Spanish 2, Spanish 3 Honors (CLEP)

592,"Hi there,

I've been in a relationship for a year now and just found out that my girlfriends parents are not so great. They both like me, but her mother is a literal witch. Everything my girlfriend does or doesn't do  comes back to her at some point so she is guilty for everyting. If the house is not clean, her siblings homeworks aren't done, her grades aren't good, her mothers health isn't good - everything comes back to her and her mother says that she is the reason for that and somehow makes my girlfriend feel bad although she knows she isn't the reason.

Her mother manipulates her everytime, on the phone, in person or wherever - when my GF critisizes something about her mother, she turns it around so that my girlfriend has to cry and then she doesn't realize that she is the reason that her daughter is sad, or just doesn't realize what she does.

Since the mother is sick and in the hospital right now, my girlfriend has even more obligations (Pack her mothers stuff, care for her brother (Her father doesn't do anything either at home) and more and my girlfriend is afraid that her mother can do even less when she is back home, so that she would need to do everything.

I wanted to live with my girlfriend for a while now and I asked her now and she loves to move in with me, but is scared of her mothers reaction because she would either not accept it, or say that my GF just does not want to be with the family, just runs away from obligations or just runs away when the situation is serious.

Whatever happens, she'll lose.

Now she is scared because her mother might just say something like ""If you want to live with him, then don't even bother to come back"" - and not let her come back home. I mean we're both in the early twenties and I occasionally go to my parents in a different city for a couple of weeks (now even more because of corona and online classes for university), and she might want to go back home for some weeks too. But is afraid she can't.

  
I told her to raise her voice in front of her mother but she can't because that makes everything worse apparently.

I've heard a couple of phonecalls between them and she is a literal witch which makes my girlfriend cry everytime.  


What can I do? I feel so sorry for my GF and don't want her to lose her family because she wants to live with me but also don't want her to live in that terrible hole with that woman anymore.

Thank you.",14Nov2020,1

He started working again at a local restaurant/pub that we used to hang out at when we dated. He isn’t there much and I have been there twice since moving back without issue.
Last night, 11/13, was my birthday and I was all alone. I wanted to get some dinner and have a drink. Maybe catch up with some regulars I used to talk with at the pub. I mentioned during one of my previous visits that I may come in on my birthday. 
Well upon arrival my ex walks out of the kitchen saying ""yeah thats her, she can't be here"" and the bartender as well as manager tell me I have to leave. My ex pipes up stating that it was ""court order"". Rather than cause a scene I left and called the manager. I explained that my ex was lying and there was no court order and if there was I was not made aware of it nor is there any paperwork/documentation of it. The manager thanked me for not causing a scene and stated that he would speak to my ex about supporting documentation for his claim.
My ex is being petty and I have reason to believe he knew I would possibly be there that night. I don’t ever sit inside, usually stay out on the deck. I don’t talk to people about what happened between he and I beyond saying it did not end well. I do not call him names to people or anything.

I've been struggling in math particularly, and from time to time even if I'm over all not having any problem with the assignment, I'll hit one tiny bump and suddenly I'm yelling my head off and hurting myself in a number of ways just to get the aggression out. Funnily enough I'll hurt myself long before hurting my phone or computer.

Long story short all I'm asking is if this is normal, and should I expect it to go away with time and effort, or if this could be something more. I fucking hate it and I hardly even feel like myself on days where it happens because I've always seen myself as nonreactive, yet now it takes the slightest little thing to piss me off.

Prompting this post, I was working with roots of numbers and variables and so on, and on one of the problems the number was being square rooted by 5, that is to say for example 25^1/5, but the 5 in the problem was literally indecipherable unless you increased the browser zoom to 150%. It really angered me and I feel I handled it decently but I still had to step away for like twenty minutes, and prior to this the assignment was breezing by no problem. Since I got angry I've spent at least a half hour being upset with myself and struggling through the last bit that wasn't even very difficult.

Not only did my mom complain every minute I spent building it she got mad at me when she saw me playing on it saying that I only got it to play on it.

However, her bank charges 22€ to receive money via IBAN/SWIFT so whenever I sent paid rent, it was 22€ short. Now she's claiming that I haven't fully paid rent for the past months and that i owe her all the discrepancies.

IMO, I shouldn't be the one that has to pay for her banking fees. The full price of rent was always sent and received in her account but its the bank who charges her 22€ and that not my fault.

You can see a photo of her if you go on my profile I think it was r/aww. My mom brought my cat to me around 5 days ago. Her name is chicken nugget. My roommates cats name is tapioca boba and we were super excited for her to have a friend! She gets so sad when we leave the house without her and are gone for awhile, we just started letting them closer and not having them closed off from each other.
         Everything has been going amazing honestly, they aren’t meowing and screaming and they aren’t fighting just low growls and small hisses sometimes. They can coexist in the same room and play with the other one in the room. But the issue is, I do not properly know how to adjust boba without her getting upset and territorial, because this is her space. in fact she’s started gorging herself and throwing up around the apartment, and she tries to eats chickens food when she wanders away. I need advice on how to better help our kitten get adjusted to having chicken in her space and understand that the food will not disappear. I’ve showed her that two bowls exist and then bring her back to hers to try to show that hers is still there and different from the other one. My mom said I might have to put the two bowls by one another, but they are not comfortable enough around eachother to eat around the other one yet. So please if you have any advice or article that gives me more information on cat behavior and how to help them adjust better! :(

Chicken is acting just fine btw! Eating her wet food and her dry food and not throwing up and using her new litter box which I put right by her food so she didn’t have to really look. It’s just bob being weird.

Tl;dr. Brought my cat from home to live with me again, kitten we already have is very upset and gorging.",14Nov2020,1

608,"A little backstory, I met this girl online a month or so ago, and we have talked almost everyday since. She has quickly become an important part of my life, and recently she confessed to having suicidal thoughts. I already knew she was depressed, so I tried helping her, but this is the first time she has told me she wants to die so directly. I don't know what to do, I don't think she'll go through with it, but I do know that having those thoughts could make her do something. I can't stand the thought of losing her like that, she doesn't deserve that, so I want to help her.

What can I do to help her? I've been thinking a lot about it but I can't find anything useful besides telling her she's loved and trying to support her.

609,"I really want to move out of my apt. I'm currently renting a super small studio with no balcony or porch in downtown Santa Monica, where the rent is crazy, the people are loud, and the homeless issue has gone out of control (to the point where I have to make sure i don't trip outside a homeless person on the way out of my building).

i want to move to silverlake/echo park area. i found a studio that offers 150sqft more space, a porch, separate kitchen. and i would be saving about $50 each month. 

the building is older, but renovated and the neighborhood i really enjoy. 

the problem is that i think my parents won't think this is a good idea and it terrifies me. I know they'll ""think"" the neighborhood isn't as safe and i shouldn't constrain myself to be in a 12 month lease with no job at the moment.

I currently pay for my rent either way. I think this move would make me happier mentally,. Should i just do it and move? I feel like i've been living my life by what-if's. I'm just so worried about the one year lease screwing me over...

612,"So I know and have probably known for a long time that I’m a bit narcissistic. I rarely think about other peoples feelings and sometimes have to force myself to care. 

it’s not that I have bad intentions but I can be a dick sometimes - like the other day I asked my boss how his day was, what I meant was how his day was as it effects me, but he told me a bunch of meeting and admin stuff I wasn’t expecting. That’s probably the most harmless way I can be inconsiderate. At worst I’ve caught myself gaslighting and exaggerating or treating people like crap. I’m just super apathetic but it’s not like it benefits me (as far as I know).

I do think I’ve improved as a person a bit but I’m not sure. As a teenager I smoked so much weed I got insanely anxious and depressed and thought I was sociopathic for a while. I’ve also gone through a long period of attention seeking to try and get people to think I’m nice and approachable and good. 

But in the absence of all that, attention seeking was the only thing that drew me towards people, without it I just try and get on with my life. I’m lonely but I don’t want to be a negative influence on peoples lives. 

I don’t talk to the few friends I have because I feel like my introverted, Internet-all-day personality ranges from boring to self absorbed - so I basically feel like I have literally nothing to talk about. 

Basically I’m super lonely, depressed, and a shitty person but I’m in a space now where I’m calm and more resilient and I just want to work on myself.",14Nov2020,1

615,"So early January this year my dad passed away, my family was never financially stable but with him gone they really needed my help. (I'm the oldest of 4)  So when my lease with my roommates was up in march I said I would move in with them and help with most of the bills and keep everyone fed.

At first this seemed like the right move but now I'm really losing my patience with them on a daily basis.  It's little things that keep adding up but this recent thing has my blood boiling.  I went on a work trip that was one week long, when I get back there's a new (BIG) hole in the wall and no one knows how it got there, My dog had zero food or water in her bowl and the washing machine had dirty clothes in it for a week and it smells absolutely awful.

I try talking to them and asking them to help with chores or keeping just their basic hygiene up and it always ends with them screaming at me for when I left in the past. (We were homeless, I said fuck this and moved in with my friend.)  Since I'm the oldest I feel a responsibility to help them.  However my own mental health has been steadily going down the drain.  I've been suicidal before and I'm worried I'll start to feel the same way again.

When I tell my mom I'll help them look for a place but I can't live with them anymore she starts crying her eyes out and screaming about how she can't handle it on her own.  It seems like I'm in a lose-lose situation so if anyone has been in similar shoes I would really enjoy hearing some other perspectives I've maybe missed.",14Nov2020,1

I (22F) have been friends with a guy (21M). He seemed like a nice guy and one who could keep boundaries .We're in our second year of college and I decided to invite him to hangover and sleep over at the house on the couch last Friday with my other female friend to drink and eat pizza.

We were drinking and then my friend left her handbag in the living room and we all went to bed in the bedrooms upstairs while my guy friend stayed downstairs to sleep on the couch. During the night, I felt hungry and went downstairs to warm some leftovers. The sight of what I saw was horrible. My friend was naked with my friends handbag near his genitals and tissues nearby presumably using it to masturbate. I shouted at him and this woke my friend up. We threw him out during the morning.

Since then, neither of us has spoken to him. He tried texting us saying that he has a 'fetish' that he can't fulfill naturally but we just blocked him. My friend spent the entire day washing her handbag with hot soap.

618,"I'm 16f and I will have 31 credits at the end of this school year, meeting all of my requirements for graduation. My mom said that I am allowed to graduate early as long as I earn a degree and do online programs until the pandemic is over (she and grandma are at risk). I was wondering what the pros and cons are of graduating a year early?

I want to be an elementary teacher or secondary English teacher. If I decide not to do teaching, I will go for organizational management or accounting. I want to attend the University of Southern Maine (took ENG 100 College Writing here), Indian River State College, University of Central Florida, or Florida International University.

I will list information about how I'm ready for college. You can skip it if you want to.

I am taking a lot of CLEP and DSST exams this school year, 12-14 (might take the Precalculus and Chemistry CLEPs if I am confident enough, but not guaranteed). My weighted GPA is around 3.87 (I forgot what exactly) and I plan to bring it up this year. I want to take the SAT twice by June (haven't signed up yet), and I am pretty certain I will earn at least a 1200. I will have at least 70 volunteer hours by the time I graduate, hopefully 100 though. I also have a job.

I will have 4.5 credits in English, 5 in Mathematics, 5 in Science, 5.5 in Social Studies &amp; History, 7 in Humanities &amp; Languages, and 4 in Life Skills. 21 are honors credit and 1 is from college.

I'm half Nepali, homeschooled, lived below the poverty line for most of my childhood, and will be a first generation college student.

My goals in life are to be an author, learn at least 6 languages, teach others English, and to be a stay at home mom when I am older. I want to write a short novel this school year and maybe start a small business selling candles once I can afford the materials.

The only reasons I have to stay in high school in 12th grade is to take AP Spanish Language, AP Spanish Literature, and AP Studio Art for fun. I could honestly sign up for a language class or art class once I save up money or even take them as electives in college if I wanted. I'm taking the Spanish Language CLEP in June anyway, so it really is just for fun and more experience. I want to graduate early to finish college early, begin teaching, move out, and to travel.

I'm pretty certain I can earn a scholarship and other financial aid that covers majority of my costs.

Are there any pros or cons to graduating early?",14Nov2020,1

My dream of being an entertainer failed at age 25/26, after experiencing a traumatic event in the industry that left me confused and lost. Luckily, I managed to obtain a Bachelor's Degree while I was in Hollywood. In survival mode, I sought a job related to my degree, hated it and went back to school without giving my Master's any thought. I realize now, that was my way of compensating for failure and that I just wanted to impress those that I had let down. This belief and motive led me to stay in a junior role because I took the easy road in a Master's program that had no foundational courses in business. This led to another downfall and 5 hard years in an industry, while trying to ""wing it."" In my late 20s I almost married my best friend. It didn't work out, which led to serious self-esteem issues for me afterwards because I'm officially past my prime.  I was never concerned with a family or husband and now I feel the itch and wish I had married in my early 20s, while I was still ""youthful and attractive.""

631,"Female 30’s UK

My husband and I have lived in London since 2012, having come here after he graduated so that he could find work. 

He worked for a design company for a while, then started freelancing a few years ago. I immediately got work in retail, then eventually ended up working in admin

Unfortunately for one reason or another his work dried up and (without me knowing), he was living on savings for quite some time. In March he took part time work to keep some money coming in and then the pandemic hit.. 

I was fortunate to keep my job and have been working remotely since March. He was furloughed but was made redundant a couple of months ago and has not been able to find work since. 

The last of his money has been enough to cover bills while I pay the rent, but my salary is relatively low for London and so paying for everything alone once his bank account runs dry is going to leave us with nothing.

We stayed in London this long because we felt it was the best place to find work, but now this is seeming less likely the benefit of being here is not really feeling like it’s worth the costs, particularly as we are both suffering with stress and finding it more and more difficult to cope with city life. 

Our lease ends in March and we are considering moving closer to my hometown. Job prospects there don’t look great either, but living costs would be lower and my family are nearby for a little more emotional support. 

I am hoping I might be able to continue working remotely, but there really is no guarantee and I also have no idea if my husband will be able to find any work either..

I should probably point out he’s not from the UK and although he has permanent leave to remain, he feels like being a foreigner makes his chances of being considered for work even slimmer.

638,"Oculus Quest and Strict Parents

Hi, this is my first post on this sub so I’m not entirely sure if I’ve posted under the right flair.

To cut a long story short I get benefits from the government for looking after my disabled father, something like £250 a month, and in case you are wondering, yes I am trying to get a job but the pandemic isn’t exactly helping.

I made an agreement with my parents that I could keep £60-70 each month to spend on whatever and put the rest of the money into my savings account to save for car insurance and driving lessons as I will be learning to drive in about 5 months.

I missed payments the past 2 months due to going back into education but it was finally sorted and I was backdated £625. So today I saw I was paid and figured maybe my parents would make an exception so I could perhaps treat myself and I decided to buy an Oculus Quest 2, something I’ve had on my wishlist since it was announced a few months ago.

I was so happy and full of excitement, rushed downstairs and told my mother, who was very angry. She told my father who was equally as angry and have now vowed that as soon as the parcel containing the Quest enters our front door they will take it to the post office to return it. I’m very disappointed and I’m searching for arguments that would convince my parents to let me keep the Quest.

Believe me, I totally would have asked them before making my purchase but they never let me buy things on my own, even with the money I’m allowed to spend from my benefits.

I appreciate you reading this and if you have any suggestions for what I could do it would be great.

Again, thank you.",14Nov2020,1
639,"I’m desperate. I can’t live like this forever. I’m finding myself wondering if death would be more peaceful, I’m not suicidal, they are just thoughts, no plans. I’ve been in chronic pain for 3 years. 24/7 pain since this May. I’m going fucking crazy. Each appointment takes weeks and I’m in fucking hell most the time now but my face doesn’t show it. I know covid is a factor for delays. I haven’t worked since September, I just couldn’t do it anymore. Looking for online work. My savings is shrinking.

My last ER visit they had to shoot me up with morphine in a hallway after hours of agonizing 10 level pain in the waiting room where it took all my concentration not to scream in pain and scare kids. Before getting in They forced my poor panicking fiancée to drive around the block to the normal entrance while I was screaming in the car, I had passed out from pain and woke up screaming on way there with trouble breathing. told her they would bring a wheelchair. They didn’t bring one and my fiancée had to run around screaming for one to bring to me. Then I could barely walk for over a month without a wheelchair handy.

I’m definitely a bit stoic about pain. Maybe I should allow myself to be more vocal/cry for attention.

They ran tests. Everything is negative. I had a tumor removed but it didn’t stop the pain. I know Kaiser isn’t doing nothing for me, but it’s also nowhere near enough. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. 

I hate our medical system so fucking much. I have a phone appointment soon. Just to tell Kaiser I’m still having the same symptoms.

If your curious: it’s abdominal pain. It sucks so much. Diet changes haven’t changed anything. I rarely drink, never any hard drugs, I rarely take pain killers because addiction runs in my family and I’ve lost several family members to it. Food passes through me fine, no long delays. No stones. Blood and urine normal. Scans normal. No ulcer they could find through endoscopy. If this is my life forever I don’t think I’m going to make it past 40 before killing myself. I can only hope my dad goes before I do, I couldn’t make him bury his son. I feel like a burden on my fiancée.

I spend a lot of time on Reddit these days as excessive movement causes pain. At least I can still be play piano, I can no longer play my beautiful drum set for long. It’s difficult to concentrate on anything. I hate hating life. All I know now is pain.",14Nov2020,1
640,"I recently started a new job and immediately got along really well with one of my new coworkers. Today I bought my first car, which I told him one week ago and offered to drive him home after work since he doesn't have one himself. 

At first I was worried about the Coronavirus because he lives in a tight space with a lot of other people, but he seemed to be a responsible man so I let go of that fear. Well, yesterday we talked about Corona and he told me that he thinks it's fake and the government made it up + he goes to the city everyday to meet with his friends because he doesn't think the virus is real.

At the company the restrictions are pretty strict and we are not doing the same tasks anymore, which means I can avoid him at work. But me and my family can't afford to get the virus, so now I don't want to have him in my car, but I also don't want to make the work atmosphere weird.

This morning he texted in the group chat if anyone wants to hang out at his place tonight. I thought it's kinda weird that he invited me through the group chat and on such short notice, but  I figured since the group is rather small (our circle of friends only), that meant I was invited. I said I'll show up, he never said anything. A few hours later I asked what time and his reply was ""we're already there"".

Like many times I am this sad feeling which i can't really get out of, the feeling that don't let me do any work. When I talked to her about these feelings she just told me to stop feeling sad. I have many times pointed out that I feel unmotivated to do work and she just told me to stop procrastinating. Also there are many things that I have never told anyone for years. She was the first that i ever talked to. One of the things that happened to me when i was around 13. I have a younger brother who is 3 years younger than me. So one day i caught him looking through the keyhole of the bathroom while I was inside, bathing. I did not say anything, because I was in shock, nor did I talk to my parents. I don't know why. I don't know for how long this went on. I did not say anything. I just started hanging cloths on the bathroom keyhole. I guess he stopped eventually.  While yes I can see this might be not a big thing for many people but it affected me. It was one of the things I never told everyone.  When I told her, she just said to me that it was normal and that I should just stop thinking about it. Also she couldn't understand that why I was talking about something that happened years ago. I  don't understand am I over reacting to it? Though it may seems to be little but it did affect me. I am very awkward around guys especially. And frankly speaking I just wanted to tell someone. Although it is not something that I thing constantly but whenever I am reminded about it. I do get depressed and do have thoughts about harming myself. I mean what should I do?

I am stuck in a tough decision, thus I am turning to the wonderful internet for some answers. 

Quick background about me (24M) working as a telecom technician, I've been here for almost 4 years. My growth the first couple years was great as it was a new job and the work as all new to me. I grew in so many ways. I have now settled comfortably and the work has become second nature. I'm part of a union, I get great benefits, share plan, pension, pay is average and get over time when I want it. 

I've recently been contacted by an old acquaintance (coach  from highschool) who reached out and offered me a position as a construction site manager for his small building company, which is currently growing. It is a salaried position, and the work hours will be around 50 hours a week, which is a lot more than I'm used to (my week is 37.5 currently). Pay is going to be about the same around 75k/year after everything. I've always had an interest in propety/real estate as that's where the bug bucks are at, but not sure if the headache/grey area is worth it. Would appreciate any insight. Thank you.",14Nov2020,1

650,"To summarize: I'm a 26 year old male &amp; the friendship group was all girls besides me. (Now also has two boyfriends) 

* There was issues where two of the girls didn't like me (more so on their side and was ongoing throughout high school) I thought I was mending our issues (last we spoke in person they were happy to see me) but I have since been faded from group. (Last I saw of anyone of them was late 2018)

NOW HELP AND ADVICE PART!

Anyway after another failed attempt to reconnect with them at the beginning of 2020 and seeing them all hangout consistently on Instagram I'm accepting their no longer wanting to associate with me.

* While this had happened I've also tried to make friends with other guys on Tinder and have somewhat made a lot of acquaintances where we add on Instagram but I've never met them in person and would really like too! I just have no idea how to take our communication offline to in person. I've tried to get myself invited to a open setting like a bar or club but nothing sticks. Then 2020 hit. 
* They have established groups so when they make plans its with their social groups i'm not thought off (which is my problem!) because I want to be considered but don't know how to integrate myself or get myself invited into the mix! 
* Also another problem is most gay guys who speak to me don't usually want to be friends and mentioning the word friend usually ends their interest in talking to me because they want something romantic or flirty in the moment. (And this happens because they have that established friendship group)

I asked if there was anything I can do to help, but my friend (A) took that as insensitive. I suppose I understand why: offering help could make it sound like there is a ""solution"" to the issue of depression.

My friend (A) added that this person (B) has been depressed for a while. Apparently something happened that was making (B) upset in a place of distress.

I don't know how to respond to that. Not responding might be offensive, but there is nothing else I know to say. (A) certainly knows what to do, but in terms of the conversation I really am interesting in doing something.

658,"I've been leaning towards candles lately after trying those 19inch incense sticks as I personally like the more even throw of the 3 wick mainstay candles.  But then I've been reading online that wax warmers last longer, which, if true, and the throw is just as large as regular 3 wick candles makes me want to buy one.  I looked up how many watts of heat a candle produces, it's between 40-80 watts apparently.  The wax warmers only seem to go up to 40 watt lightbulb ones that caution putting higher watt bulbs due to fire hazard. 

For me so far the greatest amount of area covered by one of these items is:
Incense 19""&gt; 3 wick scented candle&gt; 10"" incense sticks&gt; single wick scented candle&gt; essential oil diffuser.

A lot of my friends get allowance and I just get money for eid (a tradition to give money to children you know/relatives that are children) and it comes out at around 100usd/year.

I want to do a lot of stuff like decorate my room and possibly save up for a gaming rig. I also want to be able to do stuff without having to ask my parents (i have an irrational fear of using someone elses money so unless they say that this money is for me to do whatever i want with I don't do anything) so I've basically never bought anything on my own.

I've also got no friends nearby that I can hangout with as my school is atleast a 30 minute drive away and all my friends are from the school. I've also never really went out alone so I never got to explore the area around me and I'm just starting to (went on 3 walks alone in my life all in the past 2 months). 

I don't know much about my parents financial situation but it seems fine although we live in a old 1978 apartment (for context the country was made in 1971 so it's a pretty old building) I think it's because some of our relatives live on the floor above us. 

I've also never really picked out clothes or anything more than just shoes and went with whatever they got me. there's no malls nearby so there's really nothing I can do alone.

661,"I’m not very good at talking about how I feel. I stammer when nervous or sometimes outright tell a lie about how I truly feel or think. I sometimes don’t say anything at all. My philosophy with people (strangers and close relationships ) is basically “easiest way out” so as to avoid conflicts and give them the emotional satisfaction I think they want from me in that given moment (that doesn’t bother me,  they almost never try bothering me again but their resentment is obvious). I often refrain from giving my take on a given situation because my mind goes “it doesn’t matter, it won’t change anything” even when I feel totally wronged. I always look for tangible ‘proof’ so I can remove myself emotionally  from the situation and discuss the issue “logically “. It’s messed up, I know. Speaking up, self advocacy takes courage but sometimes it’s just not worth it. I’ve been working hard to improve my mental health but it sometimes feels like pushing a tree. There are moments where I think I should have said this or that, but the intensity of my feelings and what I could do scares me. I’m really scared of being pushed so far that I react violently. 

I get so angry and sometimes wonder/gaslight myself into downplaying my feelings even when I’m certain about my feelings. How do I speak up for myself w/out feeling like I’m betraying myself or feeling shame for how I feel? 

I’m no longer suicidal, but I wish for people to leave me alone. I already leave people alone. So why am I so angry and how do I get rid of it? It feels like hot oil coursing through my veins every day.",14Nov2020,1
662,"This happened yesterday in my third session with my therapist. This really puzzeled me and I need help with this because my next session will be in two weeks and this is a long time. 
After my first session she gave me the assignment to take notes when I am feeling a certain way during the day. 
I read out my notes and we talked about them. 

Now comes the thing that mad me really insecure. 
There were many small things on the list which most people wouldn’t even be bothered by. Whenever I talked about one of these little things, she asked me if I thought that they were actually important or nonsense. I replied that these things should not be a big deal but somehow the are a big deal to me. 
This went on for about 40minutes. 

Then she told me that she can’t really see anything to base her therapy on. She breifly summarized what I told her and then said that this is nothing to be depressed about. 

I was totally blown away by this and started crying on the spot. (It was super embarrassing but I could not help it)

Then she asked what I am thinking. 

I told her that I honestly beleive that she was fucking around with me (at that moment, she looked almost shocked)and that I didn’t feel like she took me seriously. 

Then, she asked further questions which were actually more helpful in discovering things about myself that the previous 2.5 sessions combined. 
I still had some tears in my eyes when she told me that this was my actual problem underlying everything. 

Now that I think about it with some distance, it starts to make sense to me but I am still very lost. 

Since I was crying so long, I ended up staying fifteen minutes longer that intended so she only asked me one more question when I was about to go home. 
She asked if I thought that she was taking me now seriously to which replied yes. 
She was usually taking notes on her computer during the sessions but when I started crying, she sat on the chair in front of me and kept eyecontact and was really focused the entire time. 

She also told me that it was a trick and she was trying to open me out. 

Now I have mixed feelings
on the one hand, she helped me discover a deeper issue, on the other hand I think that I am still hurt inside by this.

A brief intro of myself - I'm a guy in the early 20s with a decent job in IT. I am a good guy. I had a girlfriend earlier and later on I also had a serious kinda fling which ultimately didn't take place as expected. I talk to people ( I meant a few of my friends) To them I'm like a listener. 

The thing is I'm not confident in myself. I also lack self-esteem. I get defensive when someone in my group or anyone taunts or challenges me or critisizes me( while I know I should be doing fine but deep down I know I'm not). I try to put a brave face and act happy. I lack the skills to approach someone in a social or professional environment. Even in my career after having the right amount of skills, I feel nervous and end up in failing to do the assigned job which I'm being asked to do. I try to hold myself in a protective way. The main point is I'm not good enough. To be honest, I enrolled myself in gym to make myself confident ( I read it somewhere that it helps in being confident). All of these results me being an average, a mediocre. 

How do I come out of this cocoon? Are there any books or practices to resist this? Also please tell me your experiences. I'll really appreciate if someone help me. What should I do to overcome this?",14Nov2020,1

I think I might be confused with my sexual orientation?

Lately I’ve been trying to put it together  in pre-K i would attach myself to girls I thought were pretty or were chirpy . I always thought it was a friend feeling but idk if I had a crush on them. I continued to do this until someone classmates  started getting suspicious that I would only talk to the “pretty ones “ and I didn’t want any rumors . 

Since I was 12 I had sexual thoughts about girls and at 15 I would imagine going things with girls front my school while it was hard to imagine a cock in my head . 

I always had crushes on boys but when I turned 14 I haven’t been as attracted to them . I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I simply don’t clique or I’m just depressed and that caused me to feel “numb” 

But when I see a pretty girl walking by I can’t stop staring wondering if we could be a cute couple . But I have no problems mingling with either genders.

I only find myself being particular with boys personality but I couldn’t care how much a girls personality sucked .

677,"The holidays are approaching. For my wife and I, that means spending Thanksgiving and Christmas with her family.  This is the only portion of the holidays that I absolutely despise.

I am in the field of academia and unfortunately have had to limit myself to a 4 hour radius of finding a job because my wife does not want to be far from her family.  We live in Upstate NY, so 4 hours does not offer many opportunities.

I despise my in laws due to three uninhibited bigotry.  They are Trump supporters, science deniers, and tribal in nature. Outsiders are not considered in their decision making leading to a natural setting in which I feel like an outcast.  I am a progressive individual which typically draws many off the cuff remarks and/or jokes during family gatherings.

My wife and I typically argue a great deal around the holidays due to our interactions with her family.

I have suggested hosting dinners in our home so that we can allow both families to attend, however her family would refuse to attend which leads my wife to not want to go that route.  I am looking for my wife and I to create our own new family instead of succumbing to the pull of our family traditions.  However, I have become frustrated that my wife cannot.

I don't know how to feel or what to think, but I know that I am frustrated beyond belief.

678,"I have memory problems. My trauma is remembered in only pieces and it honestly hurts. But my situation is so fucking unique it hurts. Seriously, I am so confused right now. Fucking hell.

Let me start off by saying my sister in her adult years molested me by grinding on my lap when I was a child. 

However, I initiated it. And I fucking hate how I can't remember if I asked her if I could first. What happened was that I asked her if she could sit on my lap, and when she got on I started moving around. Then I asked her if she could move on it and she did. 

BUT, if I am remembering things right. I obtained consent during and not before. She still molested me and absolutely took advantage of me, but I can't possibly feel like I'm the good guy here because of this loophole. 

She also calls herself not a rape apologist, and continues to talk to me. Meaning that she doesn't think I'm a sex criminal but the thing is she is one herself and said to me she thinks she did nothing wrong when I confronted her about this. I told a mandated reporter about it and it was serious enough for them to call the DCF. Contacted counselors who worked for the DCF and they don't think I'm a rapist but they agree with me that it was an improper way to go about having sex. I find that very hard to wrap my head around, I don't feel like I'm a good guy.

I got molested and she committed a horrible traumatizing and scarring act when I was too young to realize that it was wrong. But am I a sex criminal too for what I may or may not have done?",14Nov2020,1
679,"I’m a 17 year old female and have lived with my mom MOST of my life (few years i lived with my grandparents) and i didn’t have my dad in my life until i was 16. my mom doesn’t like my dad (for obvious reasons) but i forgave him, and in my opinion, and everyone else’s who i’ve talked to, that’s all that should matter. My mother had a one night stand with a married man with a family, so part of me thinks “what did she expect?”, she also thought someone else was my father until after i was born and there was a paternity test. Yes, he should’ve been there but i understand why he wasn’t, and i forgave him for it. My mother on the other hand was not a great mother 90% of my childhood. When i was real young we lived with my grandparents together, then my mother moved out and left me. I was very very attached to my mother, even more so when she wasn’t there for me. Then she married a man who has treated me like complete shit since day one, and she doesn’t care. It’s not a simple bossy step dad, it’s that i get yelled at for things i’ve never even done, i get yelled at for asking questions, i would get yelled at for sitting next to my mom to the point where i was afraid to talk to her in-front of him, on top of many other things. He’s also bullied me through my whole childhood calling me names like retarded, and saying shit like “this is why you don’t have any friends at school.” and it got to the point where my mom also says stuff like that to me. He was the reason for the first time i have ever self harmed because i couldn’t handle it. At one point my older brother (who didn’t live with us) started going around telling our family to try and spend time with me and be there for me because i might kill myself because of the way i’m treated. So, i’ve been fed up and i want to move in with my father, who has been supportive and has been there for me more in a year than my mom and step dad have been my whole life. he listens to me talk, gives me advice, doesn’t put me down, and supports me with whatever dream i want to follow. How should i come about this? Any tips or ideas? I also wanna be able to experience living with my father while i’m still a teenager.

TL:DR- I’ve had a shakey relationship with my mom since i was a child, and my father came into my life a year ago. I want to move in with him or somehow change things with the way i’m treated at home, how should i do this?",14Nov2020,1

682,"Hi, so this is going to be a long complicated post so brace yourself. Also please be gentle when commenting I’m just really confused right now and I’m trying my best to make sense of everything. So basically I live a pretty normal life (I do online school, go to gym, volunteer, work part time, and visit friends as and when) and I really love being productive and I also feel so rewarded when the day is done. I don’t feel any intense emotions, everything is pretty neutral for me all the time. I obviously get my days when I’m down but it’s so rare for that to happen out of nowhere for me. I do calorie tracking and I’m doing pretty well with it, I’ve been doing it for like 3-4 months and I haven’t been dropping my calories too low, so I’ve made sure it’s sustainable. But all of a sudden my appetite has increased and I just feel extremely demotivated for everything that I usually love to do, and I feel sad, and just like a complete mess. I feel like I’m falling apart FOR NO REASON AT ALL! Nothing happened to make me feel this way, I just do and I don’t understand it. And the fact that I’m eating more for no reason is also kinda bumming me out because I know its taking away from my progress, but in general I just feel no drive to do anything at all. I feel like life has completely changed within an instant and it’s kind of scary. I’m so scared in case I’ve just entered into this “slump” and it’s not just a momentary feeling. I started feeling this way at the beginning of the week and it quickly progressed, so I decided to stay home this weekend and try and figure out why. I really hate feeling like this and I would appreciate it so much if I could get some understanding as to why maybe everything is going downhill for no reason? This is all emotional/psychological, so it’s not like anything happened to me to cause this. And I do want to stress that no way am I trying to victimize myself or pity myself. I’m genuinely just confused as to why this happened so suddenly and I’d love any advice I could possibly get right now&lt;3",14Nov2020,1
683,"There's a girl in my school who very outwardly, blatantly dislikes me - and not in a love-hate way. I mean ACTUALLY dislikes me.

We have to be in the same space a lot because we share a friend, but we usually quite obviously show our dislike for each other.

The general idea of our ""dynamic"", if it can be called thar, it this: I don't like most parts of her personality, but overall I have always had a weird respect for her. In fact, she really inspires me to be more open about my emotions, which is something I'm quite bad at. I disliked her when I met her, but tried being friendly at first. Now, though, after she began acting rude and dismissive towards me all the time, I responded by being cold and annoying on purpose.

From her side, she seemed to like me fine at first, but then I guess she though I was annoying and ""boring"" (and also we have VERY different political views) so now I just retaliate for her hatred more than anything. Also she is bi, and we liked the same girl for a while - I shared that with her, which may be another reason for her dislike.

Anyway, dispite all this, recently, I began realising that the fact that she hates me turns me on, and I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. Why is this happening, and how can I mend our hatred a bit if I ever want to go for it? HELP",14Nov2020,1

686,"**Disclaimer:I dont need anyone complaining about how long post is, if you dont wanna read it just dont, I just need advice.**

 This is about my gf,she's just changed, I literally haven't done anything but try to love her and take care of her. In the beginning of our relationship and even now, she refuses to talk to me about anything thats bothering her, and shes been having issues with shit that happened in the past that I never knew bothered her. She'll pretend shes happy for days and act like nothings wrong and then out of nowhere she'll say shit about how she hates me so much and how im an asshole and I ruined her life and she wants nothing to do with me and im the problem. For the past like 2 weeks, shes been so fucking horrible to me and making me feel bad and then manipulating me and saying how shes a horrible person and then yesterday when I told her about how I feel about how shes treating me she just said ""I get it but Idc"" but when she has a problem she gets even the slightest bit mad when I dont get something and yet she always ignores how I feel.

 Im no saint, I have done and said shit that I shouldn't have in the past, but I always try to change my behavior, truly apologize to her, and reassure her that I wont keep doing it. Every time I try to have a civil conversation she literally loses her mind and HAS to argue or HAS to say something rude or passive aggressive. She has refused to apologize to me and always justifies her actions by saying ""Im standing up for myself bc I was quiet for so long"" but I never ever suppressed her feelings I have literally from day one told her to talk to me about literally anything and shes now blaming me for all of it. I'm bipolar and I manage it well and try not to bother her with it anymore bc she treats me like im a burden to her, I just had a really bad upbringing and when my mom died in 2018, we had just met and she helped me a lot. When I was younger I had R.A.D and I think I have an irreversible attachment to her bc I have sacrificed so much for her bc I love her, but she literally doesnt give a shit about me or this relationship, if im not the one fixing it then she always threatens to leave me. 

I always have been the one to try to make things right in this relationship she does nothing but guilt me and bring up shit from the past. Im just so hurt because I have trusted her with so much shit and I have never confided in someone or trusted someone like I have with her. I dont know why shes being like this and she wont tell me why, she just ignores me and makes it my fault. Shes not even willing to fix this bc she said ""its a waste of her time"".Last night when I told her ""Im so hurt"" and she was like ""do u cry urself to bed and get a sharp pain in ur chest bc been there"" it's almost as if she says and does things to intentionally hurt me for her enjoyment. She doesn't care about how much shes hurting me, she only cares about whats hurting and bothering her even though everytime she mentions it which is almost everyday I feel like we resolved shit and then she just brings it up again and I just dont know what to do anymore. I always listen to her and try to make it right, but its like this is the only thing she has against me and she has to keep using it over and over to make a point I guess. Any advice would help, I really don't wanna lose her but I just cant treat her with upmost respect while she treats me like crap.",14Nov2020,1

689,"Okay context, I have been dating my boyfriend for nearlt 3 years and generally everything is great. However every once in awhile I'll see he gets a snap or a message from his ex. Their streak goes farther than our own relationship. I've brought it up to him that it makes me feel uncomfortable and how he would feel if I talked to my ex everyday,  he said he wouldn't care because he trusts me and I appreciate that but it still just doesn't sit right with me.

If he gets a snap from her and Im around he won't open them while he does for any other snap. I asked him why he still talks to her or what purpose there is in talking to her and he doesnt answer my question. I know to him he probably doesnt see it as an issue because he always tells me he loves me and not anyone else. I guess the way I see it is that when I break up with someone I'm okay with being friends or even just civil but I don't have a 3 year long snapstreak with them and I don't keep in contact often.

I'm concerned because he didnt answer any of my questions as to why they still talk and that he doesn't open her snaps around me. He doesnt seem concerned about it or really grasp just how upset it makes me. I guess I just don't what I should say to him about it, I don't want to force him to stop talking to her because even though I am very insecure I don't want to limit who he speaks to.

It's also worth mentioning that last time I couldn't call back within a week because of fear, they froze my file, and the fear that that will happen again is paralyzing.

At this point though, I'm starting to sink again, partially because they haven't called. It's time I do something.

it kinda leaves me with this gut wrenching feeling like im being phased out? even though when ever these people have problems im the first one they come to (break ups, depression, etc etc..)

(awkwardly as if to suggest they got caught?)...we've been friends for 10 years+...i also feel like im coming across a bit crazy and obsessive? but im pretty good at catching on to social queues and things like that its more of just observations, like if they just out right said thats what theyre doing i wouldnt give a shit? ive never said anything to them in an attitude or about their lies, besides today i said to them ""oh yeah 15 minutes before you leave i get an invite? im  not an after thought"" and left.

He doesn’t want to take his medicine doesn’t believe that therapy would help. He deals with it by smoking weed and other drugs occasionally. Whenever i tried bringing it up in the past he got anrgy/upset and didn’t wanna talk about it.",14Nov2020,1
706,"From what I’ve seen on this page it’s not really the same but wasn’t sure where else to post.
I like to shave. I like my skin to feel smooth(ish). My problem is I always get little red spots when I shave. My lower legs and armpits are fine but my thighs and top of my vagina get a rash.
I’ve tried everything - shaving foam, shaving gel, soap, nothing, baby oil. Tried cheap razors, more expensive ones. Moisturising after, not moisturising. Scrubbing my skin, not scrubbing it. Shaving this way and that way.
Also when I do shave I’m always left with light stubble. I’m hardly ever completely smooth. 
Just looking for any advice on how I can stop this, it’s driving me crazy. I want to look good for my boyfriend but I’m always covered in a rash",14Nov2020,1
707,"(Full disclosure I knew ***EMILY*** through a fast food restaurant wayyy before ***Mike***) 

My boyfriend had a girl best friend. At first I trust him. I just wanted to know when they would hang out, just so he would communicate that to me. 

We all worked together at a grocery store. 

People would come up to me asking how I felt about their “special friendship” confused I asked what do you mean? My coworkers would go on and on about how she (let’s call her *Emily) Emily would go after people’s boyfriends. Give them her numbers. How she knew they were taken but didn’t care. How when my boyfriend hangs out with *Emily he pays for her and her daughter. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I got a facial, and my facials person(sp error?)  asked what’s wrong, I told her my worries. She worked with *Emily. She had said Emily got fired for flirting with customers and harassing the men in the gym area. Also was sent home for wearing slutty Halloween costumes to work on Halloween. 

Three weeks into my relationship with my boyfriend let’s call him *Mike. He told me we were going to hang out. I waited and waited on him. He finally came over, he had dog hair all over his legs. I asked *Mike “ Who did you see?” (Emily has three dogs) and he said “Emily and her Dad.” Which I thought that was odd, because he didn’t tell me he was seeing her today...&amp; why wouldn’t he communicate that? I asked him to communicate that they were hanging out to just build trust because we were just starting out. So I felt like he lied to me.

Then, I felt like he was trying to be with her. I asked myself “Why would he lie about seeing her to me?” 
If someone wants to build trust with you they wouldn’t want to lie. They want to build with you. Especially within the first month of dating. So I left the area where we were sitting and went inside the house and told him to leave because he lied to me, and I didn’t appreciate it. 

After that lie, (*Mike told me this when I was drunk btw) that *Emily wanted to get ice cream all the way out in another State with her and her daughter. Mind you. My boyfriend *Mike and I never went on a long drive like this ever in the beginning of our relationship. Then apparently he picked her up with hid car. They didn’t drive separately. She sat in my seat.... I asked if I could tag along, I told him that it makes me feel uncomfortable she doesn’t WANT me there, he chose her happiness over mine, and I was excluded. 


Her final attempt with hanging out... *Mike hung out with *Emily but for hers daughters birthday party. Mind you, her daughters birthday isn’t until December and this was JULY!!!! And it was a POOL party. Where her friends and her were in Bikins!!!!!! 

After that we still all worked together, I felt like I was competing with *Emily. Her stance. Her gaze. Just overly sexyalized. You can tell people’s energy. 

Then when I personally made it uncomfortable for her, and out of frustration I messed *Emily on Facebook. Yes. Call me insecure or whatever but I said this “*Mike is growing with me and my family now. I’m done seeing you together. I’m done with your little games. I don’t care what you want, how you feel or what you need. I’m not being nice anymore. He’s in a real relationship. You had your fun. Now it’s time for you to go. And I am going to ask him to choose me or you.” 

In December of 2019, I was so depressed about their friendship. Hated myself, I locked myself in the bathroom and I cut myself, so deep I had to use super glue to close it. It took months to heal. I told him right then and there how much I hated myself. How much I was done feeling second best to *Emily. How much I wanted to be his everything. And then he needed to choose. 

Me or *Emily. 

He chose me. 

I said then “take your phone and physically block her, now on every platform.”

He did.

Part of me regrets killing his friendship, but he admitted to liking her. 

Idk how to getting over of feeling inadequate.",14Nov2020,1
708,"I'm just...so tired of having to hear my parents argue all the time over the most stupidest shit. So basically my dad ""fucks up"", he doesn't clean up his food bed he goes to sleep at like 8pm for work, he sneaks stuff (juuls, liquor, shit he doesn't need to spending money on) behind my mom's back. This has been going on since they've been together so about 20 years. 

Yesterday, my mom found an almost empty water bottle, maybe a sip left, with a dark liquid in it. She told me to smell it and try to figure out what it was, I thought it was motor oil from the looks of it, but it smelled like soda mixed with something else. It was liquor. And the sad part is I'm not really surprised by him getting caught doing shit like that. I'm used to it. Anyways later that night, I was playing on the ps4 then heard the usual complaining from my mom, it was about the bottle. My dad started raising his voice then he shouted my name, he told me to grab the bottle and show it to him. At this point I was really irritated because I don't want to hear them arguing when I'm just trying to chill at 11pm. Along with all the other times.

I threw the water bottle at him and he exploded. He came after me while my mom was yelling at him to not touch/hurt me. He was going to hurt me, beat my ass. He was yelling ""The fuck you do that for huh?! You lost your damn mind?!"" I tried to act tough but I scurried away from him, which unfortunately, makes me feel weak and that I can't speak/defend myself. I'm 5'5"" and he's 6'1"" what am I supposed to do? I started crying obviously. My mom told me to go upstairs because she was afraid of my dad trying to hurt her trying to protect me. 

My dad started yelling about how he's tired of being blamed for shit he didn't do and how he needs to get out of the house because my mom's crazy. He acts like a child and lies like one, he's 50 fucking 1 years old, not some teenager.He threw the kitchen trashcan and trash spilled everywhere, and he semi trashed the living room. My mom called me downstairs and he was basically yelling at me, asking me if he hurt me. I said no. I wanted to call my aunt or cousin because when these kinds of fights break out, I'm not allowed to call the police, even though I have every right to. If my dad were go to jail for domestic abuse, which the abuse has gone on since I was 6 years old, my mom and I would have nothing because they both struggle financially, bad credit.
You don't put hands on your 20 year old adult child. It's not child abuse, it's full on assault. 

I tried my best to get to him emotionally. I said that this had been going on for years (the fighting and abuse), but he's so ignorant that he said ""oh it's going on for years? Yeah and it's going to keep going on for years!"". If that doesn't tell you what kind of person he is, I don't know what does. I grabbed my taser, my dad didn't see it, but mom mouthed to put it away. I called my sister who lives in another state because if I called my aunt, cousin, or grandparents they'd have no choice but to call the cops. 

I told her everything. She explained to me that when they'd fight, she'd tell them to stop and they'd stop but they won't listen to me. I'm too scared to intervene. I shouldn't have to hear this anymore, the trauma has developed into anxiety. Every time I hear someone raising their voice, I get really uncomfortable, sad and anxious. 

I can't move out, I don't have a job, and I'm special needs so transitioning to the adult world will take time. I could go to my grandparents' house or aunt's house but I don't want them in our business...but I guess if your dad is about to hit you or your mom, it is their business. I wish they could divorce but they can't..again financial problems. Plus I wouldn't know where to go long term because of covid and my family is a little toxic. Like my cousins and grandparents, so fighting wouldn't end there. 

I think I need advice and someone just to talk to about it. Maybe someone can relate, maybe help me mentally prepare just in case they separate.",14Nov2020,1

On the other hand, desktops tend to be cheaper and perfect for what I want to do. However, my main concern is portability. I know there will probably be stuff I have on my computer that I’ll want to have with me on the go, and a desktop wouldn’t be able to achieve that.

This is a throwaway for numerous reasons

Context: So basically a couple months ago I sexually harassed someone online. Now before u go to the comments and say I'm trying to make myself feel good don't, since then I have contacted my victims and apologized personally. I have been trying to be a good person(Which I found to be very easy).  The following are my ""feelings"" on certain issues which pertain to this.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I noticed that someone I knew personally(not well, but I knew him) sexually abused someone and my gut started churning because I was sexually abused. Afterwards for some odd reason I felt less bad of what I did. And very honestly I feel bad for feeling that way. I mean how could someone feel better, when they just read that someone they knew sexually abused someone. I feel so fucking dumb for feeling this. 
2. I haven't felt bad for what I did, for a while and im not sure if thats normal. I obviously regret what I did, but dont passively feel bad for it. And im so confused if this is normal",14Nov2020,1

I was really interested in doing something that has to do with foreign relations or just something that requires me to travel a lot, so if there’s someone out there who knows anything about this, do you mind helping me? It is greatly appreciated.

717,"Just a little bit of information real quick, I'm a 22 year old male Marine Corps veteran. I have gained 120 pounds since I got out 2.5 years ago. I have been married for just over a year, have been living with my wife for about 2.5 years, and been together for coming up on 3 years. My wife doesnt get pleasure from intercourse because she has a medical problem that causes her pain, so she doesn't want to have sex. She also has gained a good bit of weight since we first started dating (about 80 pounds). I'm not as attracted to her as I once was. I still love her for who she is, but everyday she nags me up and down. She consistently talks about how shes so organized and clean, but our house is currently disgusting. Dishes are piled in the sink, she moved in with 2 trash bags of dirty laundry that we have moved 2 now, and still haven't been clean. We have a 9 month old son. I took a break from working at a pizza shop, to focus on school, my health and family. I have a service related disability that causes me pain everyday. I'm using my GI Bill to go to school so we get money for me going to school.We have VERY tight finances, after bills at the start of the month and grocery shopping for 3 weeks ahead, we have $0 in the bank. We have no savings, and 12k in debt. Every month we struggle to eat, and get gas for our one car.

I have been depressed for a little while now. Id say about a year. Just recently I called the veteran crisis line because I was having suicidal and homicidal thoughts. The police came, took my guns, and toon me to the VA. I stayed in the psych wars for 3 days. I have a court date coming up to get my guns back. I plan to take them to my dads house 8 hours away til I feel better. I take sertraline 150mg and yet everyday I still feel like crap.

I feel like I want to leave my wife, but then I wouldnt have a place to live because our apartment is in her name. I have terrible credit. I dont want to abandon my son, or put him out of a place to live. I wouldnt have a car because its in my wifes name.

I dont know what to do. Im lost, depressed, unsure, and confused. My son is really the only person or thing that makes me happy anymore. I hate putting that on him too. I feel like my wife is only with me for my disability money but if she was in it for money why would she still be here?

720,"***Disclaimer - This is my first time posting on Reddit. This is a subject that is deeply disturbing me and may upset others so please be cautious proceeding if animal abuse is a trigger for you. I’m reaching out because I tried calling the police before it got worse and no action was taken to resolve things***

I know a super completely out of control super spreader who is abusing her pets. One is now dead. I don’t know what to do. She’s breaking lockdown recommendations on a weekly basis and is running an incall (for seeing clients as a prostitute) out of her apartment. My partner and I pleaded with her to stop after briefly “reconnecting”, telling her that we can’t  tolerate her lifestyle because it’s so damaging to herself and everyone around her. She didn’t show any remorse or consideration in regards to the pandemic despite me warning her that four people I know have tested positive who have minimal contact with the public in my community so it’s closing in. She’s literally having one on one contact with desperate Johns who most likely see other providers. Being a hooker during a plague has got to be one of the most dangerous professions imaginable. Churches and small “Mom &amp; Pop shops” are shut down while totally deranged people like this still run their “business” in the shadows putting the rest of us at risk. She laughed and was so dismissive when I was crying and begging her to seek help before telling her I can’t associate with her what so ever, ever again. Her reasoning for not quitting is that she only has “70 grand in her account and needs more” - Unbelievable. 

I reported her to the animal welfare agency about three years ago and since then the dog in question has died, his brother is still alive and has a broken leg FOR THE SECOND TIME and she has a new large puppy locked in a cage who howls everyday. The puppy also looks completely emaciated. Her partner just finished law school and visits her on a weekly basis while she works the rest of the week as a sex worker out of her apartment. She is in complete denial about her circumstances despite me telling her that she’s putting peoples lives at risk. The animals and the people living in her building are my biggest concern as clearly she’s given up on herself.

Some points to add....

* I am afraid of her and want to remain anonymous because she’s shared that her associates are involved in gang life. She also joked that if her partner wanted to have somebody “whacked” if he wanted to. 

* She’s expressed that’s she’s suicidal, threatens that to her partner but won’t seek help and flips into another personalty when confronted

* She’s shared that she’s physically assaulting her partner by punching him in the face

* I gave evidence of neglect, had a case file open on her about the animal abuse to the liaison officer for animal welfare in our area and they didn’t take the animals away because they claimed they had no visible bruises and had food/water. She admitted to me in person that she picks them up and swings them around by their tails. Now the dog is dead and his brother has a broken limb, for second time. She changed vets and blamed them for the dogs issues. She also got a large puppy immediately after who looks ill and underfed

* She’s shared she is actively robbing people and calling the police from her apartment to get the cops to drag them out instead of her while she uses the new dog to intimidate them.

I always thought since we knew each other things would go smoothly and no one would try to fuck anyone else over, but I guess that’s just me. One of the first weeks they got drunk and sprayed the fire extinguisher everywhere, then proceeded to leave for the weekend without cleaning anything up... Their dogs would shit in the apartment and they wouldn’t clean it up and would get mad when you asked to clean it up, hours after it’s been sitting out. Wouldn’t do dishes, again would get mad when you asked. And this is after like weeks of disgust and already cleaning their stuff before. Constantly stealing and lying about the stupidest things like chargers, and shampoo etc. and the icing on the cake stealing rent and not paying it towards the actual rent then ignoring everyone, including co-signers and then playing the victim.

My best bud's parents are both doctors. He's super loaded and has never really had to struggle throughout his life. He's super chill and bit too generous at times. 

Anyways, a while back he starts talking to this chick who was in his college course. They become class friends, but nothing really happens since he has a long-distance relationship.

A couple months later he ends up giving her a referral to the place he's working at. While this is happening I graduate from college, come back home, and start working at the same place. I basically get trained and start working alongside this chick. 

I got some early vibes she wanted to date but she had a boyfriend during that time. I was honestly just trying to not mess up the workplace vibe. So, I just kept things chatty and friendly.

Anyways, she sees me talking one day with my best-friend and she is honestly surprised we're actually friends. She finds out my dad is also in the medical field and starts acting ""way too"" interested in me from then on.

Over the course of 6 months later, she gets cheated on by her BF and we keep talking. At this point I have no idea about it, but just hear through the grapevine that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

So, I said fuck it, asked for number and started dating her. Anyways, we've been dating for like two months now, everything is chill, but too chill 😑😑

Since well, I've never actually dated anyone before. I've just been too focused on school/work and tend to just be a bad BF in general.

I'm just sus'd out because well, I told her I was hanging out with my bud yesterday and she said ""what're you going to say if they ask you who's your girlfriend.""

And I said I'd say it was her and she seemed super happy. But like today... she said herself that she's emotionally manipulative and well... I know my bud has a small crush on her.

736,"I have a friend who is now my roommate. We were friends since middle school and now she's 21 and i'm 22. She's moved in with my family since the pandemic in march and we share a room. However, recently I've learned she's super negative and always leaving me in a bad mood.  She's always complaining about her life, and I understand why, she's been through a lot, but it's repetitive and the same thing over and over again.

 She's lesbian and has a 'girlfriend', but is constantly complaining about her yet talks to her on the phone for hours on speaker and gets annoyed when my family is ... living? They're in the living room but she walks in the living room and is mad that they're 'loud'. She has no consideration of noise and has her laptop on full blast or is on the phone while I keep my headphones in (because manners). She's always complaining about how hard life is but we let her live with us for free, i gave up my personal space, my mom lets her use the car and we feed her. Even I pay rent, but she stays for free. 

She's often nice to hang out with and is my only friend I hang out with, but it's becoming unbearable. If I even try to express my feelings, she gets angry and cuts me off. It's as if she expects me to tend to her needs, when I rarely ask for anything and then she gets upset if I don't want to do something. I'm very introverted and am content staying home doing nothing all day. I make this clear all the time and she always gets annoyed by it, but I was always this way. It's who I am. 

One time she wanted to walk to 7-11 at 11pm to get drinks and was upset when I said no (keep in mind, I have walked with her dozens of times)(and also she didn't even ask me to go, she just expected I would). I told her to ask for the car and I'll go with her, because it was cold and I don't feel like walking 20 minutes, but she just walked out of the house saying ""guess no one cares about my safety"" in a shouty tone. She got mad when I didn't want to go with her to her orientation yesterday, but I would be sitting out in the car for 2 hours at 9am and felt no need to get up to go with her. I go with her places all the time, including to get stuff for her hair and food, and lately I've been saying no because I'm sick of doing everything for her. 

She gets mad when my mom won't let her use the car or drive her to her new job, but that shouldn't be her responsibility. We've done so much and it's like she's not grateful. I never hear a thank you or appreciation for what my family's done for her. And yet she has the nerve to say people are not grateful or rude, she even questions why I apologize to people in public but I was just taught manners I guess. And then she gets so mad and jealous when my father sends me money or when my family wishes me a happy birthday, because her family is pretty awful. However, I hate that I should feel guilty over something I didn't control. I never rub it in her face, yet she makes me feel bad for it.

I have no idea what I should do. We're moving in a month and she's ruining my mood every day. I get upset too, I get sad and have bad days, but it's like she wakes up in a trash mood and makes me feel horrible the whole day. I feel so awkward and hate how she has to ruin my day because she had a...bad morning? She's never happy and I get that depression sucks, I have depression too, but I force myself to put on a smile because I don't want to ruin my own day every day. Or at least I try to be considerate of others.

Two of them that I've grown close to have trusted me with some of their personal stuff, and they're both in pretty bad situations and have recently told me that they're cutting themselves. They both live in different parts of the country than me. 

\- one is a girl who's dad was abusive and is going to be on probation soon, and she and her mom, who also don't have a lot of money, are really worried he's gonna hurt them again. she barely has any friends and her cousins, who have helped her get through the shit she's gone through, are moving away. she's incredibly insecure and hates herself and she told me she cut herself last week and said she was disappointed in herself and only told me bc she's worried everyone else would be ""disappointed"" in her. 

\- the other is a boy who's parents are divorced and his mom is borderline abusive and neglects him. she fights with her boyfriend all the time and they have barely any money. he also gets really lonely and his mom keeps threatening to kick him out. He keeps ""joking"" about killing himself and it's super fucking concerning, he says shit like ""oh its not smart to have a suicidal person in a house full of guns lol"" and ""i'd be super suprised if i don't kms in the next five years"" among other stuff like that. 

I don't know what to do. They both see me as their sorta best friend and their only support system and they know that the other isn't in a good position either. I've given them all the advice that I can and both of them keep telling me how much I'm helping them, yet they're both still cutting and beside themselves. I don't know what to do. I've suggested the self harm/suicide hotline to both because I used a crisis hotline once and it helped me a lot, and they both seem open to it. But I literally have no idea what to do I live so far from both of these ppl and I don't have time to keep texting them because I have school. I know the boy's address and he told me that ""he's gonna tell me when he's gonna kill himself"" so i'm literally considering calling 911 on him if I think he's gonna kill himself. 

Idk what to do. Ik i shouldn't care because they're just online friends but they keep telling me that I'm the only source of moral support for them and I don't want two people to fucking die on my watch. Help. I'm sorry this is so long.",14Nov2020,1

I ended a friendship because I felt it was one-sided and felt like I was being used. She only ever wanted to hangout or talk when it benefited her somehow. I brought these issues up and she tried to turn it around on me, and make me look crazy for wanting to spend some time together. I should also note when we started out things were really good, we were actually fwb for awhile.

Anyways am I wrong for bringing up issues in a friendship in order to keep it healthy or should I just keep quiet and move on? I like giving people a chance to address the issue because I value the people I call friends.

Am I wrong for wanting to spend time with a friend and then getting upset when they constantly turn me down and make excuses time after time.

The reason I decided to finally end it was I distanced myself and stopped talking to her until eventually she told me to hit her up if I wanted to hangout and so I did ask, a few times, and she decided to go out with other friends and not make time for me. Like why even tell me to ask if you’re gonna turn me down? Am I wrong for being upset about that?

Everyone agreed and shared the same concerns of “if something happens it was the Omar.” Should I go to the police with my concerns or is this something that I need to let management decide on?

748,"This is going to be a long one so this is your only warning before you continue. So to give others who read some context I (19M) had hurt my friend's (19F) feelings. While I was joking around talking to them on the phone I had crossed the line that I didn't realize and that they didn't realize and said some things that I shouldn't have. I tried to smooth it over in the moment but that didn't seem to be working and it was late at night so they were tired so they're a lot more unresponsive so there isn't really much I can do at that point so after the phone call had ended I decided to give them some space for a few days to give them time to process their emotions because we have gotten into an argument before and that has been resolved but that time it wasn't a good idea to immediately talk to them the next day But that story is not important right now.

 After a few days had passed I called them again to see how they were doing and as I expected they more or less gave me one word or single sentence answers so I knew that they were still upset. Me wanting to resolve the problem decide the best way to resolve it is with the conversation as that makes the most sense to me for any relationship. 

So first I start off by asking them if they wanted to talk about it and they responded with ""Do you?"" So the next thing I said was ""(Name of 19F) I want to fully understand how and why what I said made you upset. If possible I would like to fix it. But the only way to do that is with a conversation. It is completely up to you whether or not we talk about it, But if you choose not to talk about it then the only thing I can do, the only thing I can say is sorry and hope for your forgiveness. I can't take back what I said, But I can try not to do it again and that is only if you allow me that chance. I would like to talk to my best and in all honesty  most important friend again. If you solely want to do the talking and just have me shut up and listen that as well would be good. I will completely shut up, not say a word and only listen."" They said we could talk so we did.

 I suggested that they talk first so then they could explain their feelings or get any sort of emotions or what they need to say out. Because currently I didn't have much to say other than an apology and for me I was completely calm and at peace with everything and understood that unless they forgive me there's really not much I can do about it it would be completely up to them whether or not they forgive me and what comes next that would be my personal opinion. But they're not the type to voice their emotions very often Even though they are passionate person. So in order to get any sort of information or to get them to talk I basically had to pick their brain for a while to understand everything. 

At this point roughly 3 days has passed and I barely remember the conversation that we had in the first place for me I can barely remember any conversation I have with anyone it takes a minute to jog my memory. My friend explained as much as they could to me as they couldn't exactly remember everything either but they do suddenly remember that the whole conversation made them upset and that I shouldn't have said what I said which I completely agree with. But in the end nothing really had changed they still don't forgive me and they're still upset and as of right now there's nothing else I can do about it except for try to move on and have a normal conversation. 

So I try to do that and that was the wrong move because it only made them more upset so I asked them what should I do and they had replied with they shouldn't have to tell me what I should do and we ended up in another argument about showing compassion. For me all my life I have never been able to show true compassionI didn't grow up in a household that was especially close and until high school I never really had especially close friends where this sort of circumstance where I would have to show a compassion would arise. 

During the argument they had said whenever I am feeling down they try their best to show compassion and try to help me with whatever problem I have so they find it hard to understand why I can't show them the same compassion when they need it. They say I use logic and reasoning instead of showing compassion. But for me that's all I really know how to do. I've never been good with people or good at dealing with emotions for the most part most things I do in life are for my benefit even when it comes to helping people or being a generally nice person. My friend had said that about me too and I told them that they were right, I'm person who tends to put things bluntly but everything I say is honest while my friend says I don't think about what I say and how it affects other people. Before I say things I try to put myself in other people's shoes and that's where the compassion comes in again I don't show compassion I use logic and reasoning.  

To finally get to the point after this long long post I just want to understand how could I possibly show compassion to my friend how can I make up for all the wrong that I've done All I know is to apologize and they say because I don't understand that's not good enough But in my opinion the fact that I'm trying to understand and the fact that I apologize at all shows that I do care. I just really don't know what to do I'll be honest if after reading all of this and any of you think I'm a toxic person I wouldn't say you're wrong in fact I agree with you. And in all honesty I'd completely understand if my friend no longer wanted to be my friend anymore for me I've come to peace with that possible reality for I see that unless they decide to forgive me unless they aren't upset there really isn't anything I can do. 

If any of you can give me some advice on what to do other than sit and wait for them, because I've already decided that for right now that would probably be the best course of action. Then by all means please give me some advice I'd really like to hear it. If you want to meet to explain certain things and further detail before you give any advice just DM me and I will respond I would like to have someone else to talk to in order to figure this out. But also any advice I would like to be in the comments of this Reddit post as maybe it could help someone else going through a similar problem. Thanks for reading this long post.",14Nov2020,1
749,"Hey there,

a little tough decision for me to make here, I'll try to keep it short.
My wife currently is living and working in America, I'm in Europe. Last time I visited her was for two weeks end of August. Next visit is planned to be this Friday, also two weeks.
Now it seems like my grandmother (father's side) might pass away in the next couple of days, which would also mean that the funeral would right during the time I was supposed to be visiting my wife.
Some additional, but important info: my relationship to my father and his family is not that great. I've barely seen my grandmother or my uncle (who's mentally retarded and emotionally still very ""childish"") during these last years.
They are pretty embarrassing people, also generally not very nice, so I never invited them to our wedding (which my wife didn't like at all, but that was something I insisted on. I didn't want them to embarrass me/us.). Since I'm a doctor my uncle reached out to me a lot during these last weeks when my grandma got weaker and weaker, and even though I don't particularly like him, I'm also not cold blooded and of course I feel very sorry for him and besides giving medical advice I tried to offer some emotional support.
Also an additional peace of information: when she left to America, it was when we really had a big crisis and it almost broke our marriage. But we decided to give it another shot, but she really got a great job over there and we decided that she'd keep it for a year, we could save up some money and if we work out fine, we'd have a lot of savings to buy a house. 

Anyway, I told my wife about the situation and that it might interfere with our plans of me visiting her, that I might have to come a few days later or postpone the whole trip.
Right now, she's totally freaking out, telling me I've gotta choose between her and my family if my -quote- ""grandma kicks the bucket"".
She says no one would need me at the funeral, I didn't even have a good relationship with most of the people that will attend etc.
While all of this is factual true, I still have the feeling that it would be a total faux-pas not to attend... 
I deeply hope she'll pass after the planned trip to my wife, but in case it happens before that or during the trip, I really don't know what would be the right thing to do.... 

She says if I choose my grandma, it's over.


I know she's just angry and exaggerating and that she'll probably feel sorry for all the shit she's saying right now, but what she definitely means is that from her point of view there's no question about that I should come visit her instead of attending my grandma's funeral if I find myself in the unfortunate situation that I'll have to choose.

I personally always, also before we were married, supported and often even paid for her trips to America to visit her family for holidays etc, even if that meant I had to spend those holidays without her. I never complained, especially not when her grandma died and she flew over because she didn't want to miss the funeral. OK, her family is great and they have a really good relationship, but still... I would've wished a little bit more support from my wife in this situation.
Like we're both adults and I feel even if I had to postpone the trip for a month, meaning that I'd miss out on Thanksgiving with her family, of course it would suck badly, but I'm absolutely sure her family would totally understand and it's not the end of the world. We'd just have to wait four more weeks or so...


Am I completely wrong here?
I'd appreciate any advice, opinions and perspectives.

Thank you very, very much!
Have a great weekend!",14Nov2020,1

If I got a B+, the reaction from my parents would always be ""well why isn't it an A?"", just really demotivating stuff like that.

752,"Hi, hello this is not a new suspicion for me and I have talked about it with family and friends (but not a professional) but most, if not all, have dimissed the idea. I want to ask about it because as I look at the symptoms, especially in adult women (I'm 22), the more stuff makes sense. For example, when I was 12 I saw the movies *Tangled* and *Tron: Legacy*. I *loved* both of them especially *Tron* and so I would watch it, over and over again. And I mean I watched the entire thing, straight through the credits, all day, every day. I memorized the soundtrack (at one point I could tell you the name of the scene a song was playing in just by hearing it), the actors, the script (""Now that is a big door"" is Garrett Hedlund's first line) and I started a little spin-off obsession for Daft Punk. 

I'm not a hypochondriac, I am not an attention seeker. I don't feel that all of the symptoms apply but a good majority.

So I'll be as concise as possible

I had a bf that I was head over heels in love with but we had to break up due to family reasons... No we weren't cheating or toxic to each other nothing like that just external ones. He was the only guy that I could see myself married to. Anyway soon after the breakup which happened abt 3 yrs ago he took a job outside of the country and left. He'd come every 6 months and ask to meet me. Sometimes I went sometimes I didn't because even though we had a very nice relationship our break up wasn't as nice. I just expected him to prevent the break up but he didn't. So I kind of resented him for it but still loved him idk if I'm making sense but yah.

Anyway cut to the current scenario. He's coming back after a yr due to covid restrictions etc and he wants to meet me. The thing is I don't love him anymore but whenever I see him old feelings resurface both good and the bad. All the what ifs come back. But he tells me that we should try being friends which we are on text but I can't physically meet him and he gets hurt by it.

We're both single so no third person will be affected by this other than us.

TL:DR. Ex is coming back into town, wants to meet me but im conflicted because all the unresolved feelings come back to me.",14Nov2020,1
755,"Ever since I was young I kept getting a message from mostly my family and other people around me that I needed to change. I needed to be less sensitive, less emotional, more active, more aggressive, etc etc.

This lead me down the wrong path and into so much grief, hurt, and frustration, wondering why what I’m doing is not changing myself into that type of person.

In the past three months I went away from home and went through something that broke the delusions and revealed the truth I guess you can say. I was doing things, being attracted to the wrong type of people and going into environments that made me miserable, feel stupid, incapable, etc.

So now I’m trying to accept the person that I am but it’s hard because I kinda don’t want to be like that, I want to fit in with my family and be like them but I’ve tried and I can’t. It hurts

756,"hello everyone

my friend is currently going through a dark depressive episode right now(not the first time)

im quite used to it - i know how to act, what to say, dont take things to heart.

i know theyre going through a lot and i completely understand them, i used to be depressed too. to keep things normal/usual i ask how theyre doing and if they answer i tell them how im doing too and they dont really want to hear how im feeling or how am i doing. they either change the subject or doesnt answer, no matter the news(bad, good, neutral).

its become a little tiring, because deep down i want them to care as much as i care about them. i dont tell them these things just to not make them sadder since they feel like a burden anyways.

i want to rest, really badly, i want to take a break, but i cant. if i wont answer them, they are going to do it and i dont want that.

im fine with continuing this because i have hope it will end soon(the episode).

is there anything i can do to ""replenish"" myself? ive been practicing meditation and im taking care of myself, it helps a little, but ive been wondering if there are more effective ways.

We never actually dated but I myself was deeply in love with her. From the moment our friendship started I was absolutely gaga over her.  She meant a lot to me and eventually we became really close friends. May-December of 2018 was the best time of my life because we were both pretty much best friends who talked everyday. I mean I loved talking to her and even though my romantic feelings were not mutual we were still great friends and I still deeply loved her in a platonic sense.

I became paranoid that she only talked to me because she was bored of school and she wanted an escape (we went to different schools after 8th grade so we pretty much only talked through text.) It was a crazy theory but I was scared for whatever fucking reason. Instead of actually talking to her about it I decided to ghost her and wait for her to confront me so I could have an outlet to talk about it. Obviously this ruined my friendship but what hurts even fucking more is the fact that I later found out that she had feelings for me and she was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I fucked up bad. Eventually we reconciled and tried to start over but things were never the same. One day we just randomly stopped talking and there it was... friendship over. 

Months later I was in a blind state of anger and I blocked her further ruining my chances of fixing things. In January of this year I unblocked and followed her. She followed me back and I'm happy about that because it at least shows me that she doesn't hate me.

My current issue is that I still truly love her and I can't seem to move on. We haven't spoken in a year and a half but I'm still madly in love with her and I feel like I need her in my life. I dont think she's ever gonna reach out to me and I know its on me to try to fix this. But I'm too fucking scared to message her. I need her back in my life but I'm so fucking scared of what's gonna happen that i almost don't want to do it. I know its my only way of fixing things but I'm so fucking scared. I genuinely think she was the one but even if we never end up dating and just stay friends I'll be happy. I genuinely think im lucky just to have known her because she's such a perfect human being in my eyes. If anything I just miss my best friend. But I'm such a coward that I'll probably never fix the problem. So what do you guys think? Should I just swallow my pride and do it or is it best to leave it alone?",14Nov2020,1
761,"So the thing is is I feel like I have a lot of people to shop for that are close to me so it’s not like I can just get one thing and i feel ok about it. I have five people in my family that I need to shop for and a girlfriend of three months. I’ve already spent 600 and still barley have anything. And I realize the holiday is more about spending time with family and the people you love but it’s just tough financially every year. Especially when it’s hard to find stuff they all will either use or keep, simply because we’re all grown (the youngest being 18) and anything we want we cannot go buy ourselves during the year. I feel like I should start shopping for them throughout the year, which is my intention but I’m not always thinking about Christmas either so by the end of January I totally forget until about October.

762,Need advice. I sprained my ankle really bad at work. I am a nanny that takes care of three kids during the week. I twisted my ankle right in front of my employer and was in so much pain but my boss did nothing. I had to crawl my way around to find some place to sit. I was able to call my doctor and get an X-ray and by doctors orders I have to rest my foot for a week. The foot is swollen and I can’t walk. I have been working at this job for 4 years with no personal time off except for thanksgiving and Christmas. My problem is that my boss couldn’t care less that I am now unable to walk. She was more worried about who was going to stay with her children while I am off and I am not getting paid during this time. Now....This is obviously unexpected and I was counting on my weeks pay to cover bills etc. I don’t know how to feel about this as I have not been in this type of situation but is it right not to get paid for the 8 days I have to be off work? Should I say something? My boss frankly doesn’t seem to have any sympathy at all and made it seem like I can easily be replaced.,14Nov2020,1
763,"okay hi so i'll give a little bit of context if that's okay!
we are both minors first of all.
the reason why im worried about her / want to help out is bc she has a difficult home life , from what she's told me her mum and her often fight / dont get along well at all and she finds it difficult to be at home. secondly, she got a new boyfriend not long ago and has been with him a LOT, now smoking and etc. her mum found out what has been going on and now things are even more difficult.

she also tells me that she doesnt like the way her bf treats her right now and shes already told him how she's unhappy w the way he speaks to her, etc (couldnt get much info) but he just dismisses it and makes excuses like about his sick dad and things like that. and she also suffers w her mental health a lot and finds it difficult to come to school but eith her bf she's dependant on him for the smoking etc so she doesn't want to leave, snd she's frightened that her new friends will leave her if she breaks up with him.


im just super worried as to what i can do/if theres anything i can do. particularly about the bf, i don't really know what to say and i want to be the best friend that i can be for her. i didnt want to give away too much bc its private but im just super concerned and need some advice :( please let me know how i can be a good friend to her",14Nov2020,1
764,"So, today I had to go to the ATM to withdraw some money. It wasn't an emergency or anything, but it was convenient for me to go today rather than later in the week. 

Now, I had a ""tiredness"" since I had woken up, especially around my eyes. Prior to this, I had also had a similar feeling about a week ago, and many times recently and yesterday I had a stuffed nose but not today. Since I was having these symptoms (especially tiredness) on and off for quite a while now I attributed them to seasonal allergies and decided to go to the ATM. I did wear a mask and didn't interact with anyone and was well within 6ft, even 6 meters of everyone. 

Also, my tiredness improved as the day went on. I also had burning eyes, which I had especially when looking at a screen. I read that burning eyes are very common in allergies but not common in coronavirus cases. 

The last time I had gone out before today was yesterday, and before that was 8 weeks ago

It occurred to me after I came back that I should check online what to do in my scenario. However, I found conflicting information, with the NHS saying to only self isolate if you show a fever, or a continuous cough, or loss of sense of taste or smell, of which I have none. But the CDC says that you should self-isolate if you show any covid 19 symptoms, including tiredness and fatigue, so I am not sure which to follow (I don't live in either the UK or USA) 

So, my question is (1) What should I have done in this case? Should I have self isolated? And (2) If I should have self isolated, should I inform the bank authorities that I visited the ATM so they can sanitize it or something? I am feeling really bad and guilty about going to the ATM, because what if I actually had corona virus and may have spread it to someone? What if it may be an immunocompromised person and they may develop serious disease or die even? I feel really reckless about doing this just for a minor convenience",14Nov2020,1

770,"My father is finally ready to meet people again. My mother and father were officially divorced earlier this year, but have been separated for about 6 years. My mother just recently told me and my sister that she is seeing someone that my family has known for more than 10 years and my sister and I suspect that she has been cheating for as long. Needless to say, my father, a devout southern baptist Christian, has been in a visible state of depression for about 5 years. 

My sister spoke with him today and said he should get online and find a godly woman to be with. He asked us to look into Christian Mingle and get back to him. After a quick search, it became obvious that the site is full of scammers taking advantage of older Christian singles, which is messed up because the sites premium feature costs 50 bucks per month. I did about 20 minutes of research into other Christian sites, but all of the reviews are very low. 

Are there other sites, subscription or not, that cater to religious views and are easy to use? I considered farmersonly.com because I would assume a lot of farmers are Christian, but I could be wrong. Or if anyone has personally used a site and could give me advice on which way to steer my dad.

773,"Title's a bit pathetic, I know. But that's my current situation and for the first time in a very long time I want to try to make a genuine, deep, connecting friendship. Something that feels real. It may not be in my best interest to ask for social advice on a website infamously known for housing the socially-inept (sorry, but it's true) but just incase anyone has gone through what I am I'll shoot my shot. 

I consider humans to be like machines, comprised of nearly innumerable parts that miraculously work together to make who we are. My months of therapy are making me slowly realize that the part of me responsible for keeping and deepening friendships isn't destroyed, it's just a little dusty and broken. And it can be fixed. 

I'll be real here, I haven't had an actual friendship with anyone since middle school. Due to some bullshit that would turn an already-much-too-long post into an essay, I ended up homeschooled for the entirety of high school. I got to see kids my age at clubs sure, but I really couldn't past that surface level of small talk simply because I didn't know how to. I really didn't want to self-disclose anything that would deepen a friendship, nor put in the work required to keep anything going. 

That problem carried with me to college. I met some nice people, could talk a good talk. I even started going out to places with one before the pandemic hit. But I really didn't... feel anything. It all felt very superficial and, very strangely, everything in me wanted to run away from these budding friendships. And as the pandemic hit, I did just that. I haven't talked to anyone my age for over eight months.  

I guess I have two major problem to overcome. The first is self-disclosure. I am terrified of saying anything personal about myself. I feel like they're just waiting to use that as ammo and fire at the perfect time. I've never really could trust anyone outside my small family, and even then I can't trust them to handle well what I tell them. My second is the preemptive exhaustion I feel the moment I noticed someone even slightly going deep with me. It feels like they want me to carry their burden and problems with them, but don't want to shoulders any of mine themselves. Having to maintain a friendship feels like so much work I just don't have the motivation for. 

I feel like a contradiction; I really not equipped for friendships and yet I'm bound by my biology to crave them. But whether I like it or not, and in my effort to finally become an adult, the benefits of having friendships are simply too much to ignore. I think I can start with an online friend (I have a lot of anxiety talking to people online but I don't really have a choice right now) and I'm just looking to see if anyone can relate to what I'm experience and any advice to not feel this way. Thank you.",14Nov2020,1

775,"So a friend (18) just asked me(20) if i want to move in with him, but I've already made plans to look for an apartement with another friend. They don't know each other so moving in with both of them isn't an option, plus i'm living with four flatmates right now and don't want a bigger community for the next apartement.

The problem is, he is my oldest friend, I've known him for as long as i can remember. I've jokingly posted pictures of nice apartements on IG about a year ago and he (and the one i want to move in with) responded to them and i didn't flat out tell him no back then. He's also living with very manipulative and transphobic parents right now so I want him to get out of there asap, but i do not want to move in with him.

I had originally wanted to move back to my apartment about an hour and a half away in September, but my family was super worried so I made a deal with them that I wouldn't move until January. The past few months the thought of being able to move out is what has kept me going. I'm supposed to be living with 2 other girls in the apartment.

However, one of the girls just informed me she docent think she'll be moving back in January. And now I'm starting to doubt if I should. My main concerns are that I might start feeling extremely lonely from lack of human contact, as I'm not friends with the third girl living in the apartment. However, I'm also scared that by staying home I'll feel even worse because I will have been with my family for too long. I'm also a college student, and a main reason I want to move back is so I can focus more on my studies. Its also suffocating living at home with my parents. I'm just so scared of moving back and regretting my decision due to loneliness.

After I decline her invite, she always ignores me for a few weeks until she gets over it and acts like nothing has happened. 

And the strange thing is that, when the other girl declines her invites, she’ll answer her back cheerfully and reassures her that it’s okay and that they will hangout next time.

783,"So I just found out my best friend is going to die.

My(19) dad(44) has just been diagnosed with a rare type of spinal cancer that’s stage 4. He’s been in the hospital the last 2 months numb in most of his body and unable to move much. He baffled most of the doctors and they only now know what’s going on. He’s a great guy who gave everything he had to raise me, and he had sole custody since I was an infant. He had his struggles with substances but he never stopped doing whatever he could to give me a better life.

A week ago my mother(42) was taken by police into an institution. Shes bipolar and schizophrenic, as well as off of her meds as per usual. She smokes a lot of weed which for her mind, isn’t good. I know she has been on the pipe but idk if she still was. After 20 years she still doesn’t believe she is ill. The things she says to and about people are awful, most times sounding so utterly insane in a way you would think it’s some sort of sick joke, but it’s not. I know it’s due to her illness but she doesn’t do anything to solve it so in my mind she’s hopeless. She was never in my life much so in the end she was always more of a stranger than a mother.

I don’t know what to do. I just started on antidepressants 2 months ago but I think I smoke to much green to actually have it work properly, but I’ve been struggling with quitting for awhile. I just cave in under the stress. Ive been out of work since September and I’m living with my dads parents. I’ve had to live with them since covid hit, and to be close to my dad as his condition worsened over the year. I’ve been wanting to move out again on my own and now I think I need to, I can’t be in that house anymore. 

To add to it I’m dealing with 7 charges right now. I can’t say much but in fear of having you people think it was an asshole crime, I’ll say that the person that filed the charges against me was scamming tons of people and just an asshole overall. No one was hurt so I’ll just let you guess what allegedly happened. I digress. 

I feel lost and empty inside, constantly. I usually try to fill my void with a new partner, or an old one, but I know that’s not going to work this time. My dad is slowly going to deteriorate and it’s going to kill me inside to watch that. I’m grateful enough with covid to be able to visit for 3 hours every other day at the hospital, but it’s breaks my heart every time. He needs me and I need him so I’m going to be there until the end, but I’m afraid of what I’ll do after that.

I know it’s going to be a rough winter, however as I write this I feel some sort of relief in getting it r/offmychest. I have no plan and Idk what I expect to get from posting this but in conclusion fuck 2020.

This is due to her girlfriend giving her little attention, and is in constant need of ""comforting"" as my sister puts it. They have never met, and never will due to them both living across the worlf from eachother also. One of the most recent red flag she has told me about was the time out grandma passed away. My sister told her girlfriend about this, yet all she talked about was her constant worrying of the election. Putting no effort to let my sister vent, but to allow herself to claim the spotlight (As she has done several times). Me and my sister talked about these issues, and she even said the only thing keeping her in the relationship is to not be lonely. So i suggested in a week's time, she end it. I suggested this because i knew there was a toxic atmosphere in their relationship. My sister WANTED arguements, and hoped they would come so she can add to the list of excuses as to why she would break up.  
2 weeks go by, and i ask her for an update on the situation. She tells me its done, and shows me her breakup paragraph. Along with what her ""ex"" responded with. It was the usual ""i can change, give me another chance please"", which i saw one reply my sister made: ""I'm sorry."". She had told me that they were just friends now, but i was skeptical at first, since she did not want to show me the rest of the convo. And today i find out they are still together, so i confront her on it, and her whole mindset on wanting the relationship to end has magically changed ever since she originally tried to break up. I believe that she managed to be blinded by the ""i can change"" bs that is almost always a lie. And now my sister calls me manipulative for ""forcing her to end the relationship"". She just will not listen anymore, coming in with threats to spread my private life around to people who do NOT need to know about.  
She's put me out to be the bad guy in this whole ordeal, when i personally believe that her girlfriend is somewhat responsible for her sudden change in mind.  
I dont want to believe i am the bad guy, but i know that if my sister stays in this relationship any longer that it has already, then it will be so much harder to get out of when she does come to realise it. Am i the bad guy? if so, can you point out as to why and how i should deal with it? Thank you for reading this whole thing.

I dont want to get my boyfriend in trouble if he helps me in any way. Thank you for listening to my rant! Any advice is much appreciated!",14Nov2020,1
791,"Me (19M) &amp; my girlfriend (19F) have been together for 2 months. My girlfriend is autistic (pdd-nos) and has adhd. 

In the relationship I don't feel like I am her priority. First gaming, tv, fellow workers, parents and then me.

Some context: 
- She doesn't want to tell her parents about me, if she did we could spend more time then a couple hours a month together. Even though she did ask me to tell my parents wich I did of course, I give everything for this girl.
- She doesn't want to ask her manager if she can get free on Mondays, because that means her fellow workers have to work a little more on Mondays (I did ask my boss and now I can  get free on Mondays so we could spend every monday with each other, that was the plan we agreed on)
- Yesterday she told me was going to buy a ps4, as a fellow gamer is was really happy and supportive for her, yesterday we couldn't talk a lot (for other reasons) so we agreed to talk more today. Today she got her ps4, but that ment that instead of talking to me, at all, she was going to play Mario Bros. She talked to me 6 hours later then we agreed to. She doesn't understand that it hurts me, she thinks that it's normal to spend time with something new and exciting as soon as you can, I know it is, I just hoped she could talk to me at least 5 minutes before she started to game.
- Sometimes right in the middle of chatting she says her show is on tv so she won't be responding for the next 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I support all her hobby's etc. but for me nothing is more important then chatting with my girl.

I have talked to her multiple times about these things, but everytime she sees the confrontation as a fight, wich makes me feel like the bad guy. I just want to talk about the things she is doing that make me feel sad. Do I just have to get over my self if I want this relationship to last?

Sidenote: Don't say I should break up, just don't, I'm looking for a solution. I know there is a solution, I just need help finding it, thank you :)",14Nov2020,1
792,"Before I get to the story, it must be communicated that we are from a very conservative society - India. Women liberty is frowned upon. Add alcohol and you have the textbook definition of a ""spoilt"" lass with loose morals and everything else that you can imagine. Crimes against women, especially late night, run high in our society and is the primary concern for all stakeholders in this situation.

We are just two siblings (M24) - Myself, and my sister (F19). We live in a small, respectable, upscale neighbourhood and our parents live up to the idealistic notion of innocent, simple, and sophisticated doctors.

This evening, her neighbourhood friends hosted a get together, and involved harmless fun - except they weren't staying indoors. Around 2AM, I call to check on her because she was supposed to be back by then and my parents were asleep. Her friend answered the phone telling me my sister isnt in the state to talk and I should get her home. So I piggy backed her home (from the streets) as she was absolutely knocked out.

The kids had probably had a few drinks and were roaming around, drunk. Our family, including myself wasn't aware of the alcohol (maybe more?) involvement. Or that she would roam about this late at night. 

**The dilemma is: Should I bring up this matter with my parents (52M/F) to police her? Or should I deal with it myself? This is the second time a similar situation has happened. First time, parents didnt know and she promised to handle herself better.**

More Details: Me and my sister share a close brother-sister bond but I wasn't aware about her drinking. The last time this happened, she was deeply apologetic and promised me to stay safe - I don't really have a concern with alcohol as long as her safety is guaranteed. 

Sister grew up deeply protected and is a total proverbial ""babe in the woods"". Its probably the lifelong repression of a patriarchal society or the thrill of breaking  rules that made her venture into such shenanigans. 

She leaves home for the first time ever to attend medical school next month. If my parents find out, they will not let her go, or worse, stay paranoid themselves all the time. Plus, my sister will never trust me with secrets anymore.

I want to make sure she stays safe - without learning it the hard way. I also want to teach her a lesson in safety and preserve my bond with her.

**How do I proceed? For now, I put her to bed and she wakes up in the next x hours.**

**TLDR**: Younger sister's safety in a crime prone society - she's immature and experiments with alcohol late at night in unsafe environments. 

Should parents be involved or is there a way to get my point across?",14Nov2020,1
793,"For context, I'm a teenager so I'm not sure if I'm just being emotional or going through a phase but yeah. I don't feel love or affection for any of my friends. I don't think I ever have. Most of the time I strongly dislike them. When I can stand to be around them it's usually just for my own entertainment. I don't like talking to them or hanging out. My friends aren't bad people either. On paper, they are all caring funny people that I should but don't like at all. That sentiment has started to spread to my family too. I hate being in the same room as them or listening to them talk. The sound of their footsteps going by my door can sometimes piss me off for absolutely no reason. I don't know why I'm like this but I feel like a horrible person. I just hate all of them. I have zero emotional connection to any of them. Sometimes I feel like I'm a psychopath or something.

797,"I don't know if anyone can help me here but it's worth a shot. I literally don't know what to do, there's no one who can help.

I live in the UK, in a little village where there are no jobs. The nearest bigger town is half an hour away. I don't drive, I can't afford it, so if I'm going anywhere I have to get the bus, which is so unreliable and had hardly any times on the bus schedule. I have a levels, but nothing higher so I'm not really qualified to do anything. I could go back to college but I'm a lot older now and I honestly don't have the money to spend two years doing a course where I'm not working a full time job. 

I suffer from a lot of chronic pain. It's really bad. I used to work in McDonald's and it was hell, I was in so much pain every day. It got to the point where I was suicidal because of the amount of pain I was in. I'm still fighting to be seen by doctors, everything's being cancelled because of covid so it's really hard right now. Most days I just want to stay in bed because of how bad the pain is, I struggle with doing simple things like cleaning, cooking, showering however I'm not 'disabled enough' to get financial support from the government because I can technically still do these things, it just causes a lot of pain and knocks me out for a few hours afterwards.

No one wants to employ me because of my pain and I can't find a job that's suitable for me with my pain. I really don't want to go back somewhere like McDonald's where I wanted to die everyday. That's no life. I've tried applying to work from home jobs but they all have over 1000 applications, how can I even compete with people when I've only got 3 years working experience. I even tried to apply for a job that I knew would cause me pain and that had over 300 applications, this was in the town near to me which is a shock because it's a small town too.

I'm very lucky that I'm able to live with my fiance and father in law and he charges us no rent. He buys food for dinner and cooks dinner for us, but as my fiancé is unemployed and his disability makes it even harder for him to find a job but he is also not disabled enough to get financial support, we have no money for anything else so most days we go without breakfast or lunch. I really just want to get out of this house and into our own place, we have no heating, no hot water, no washing machine. I'm fed up of having to go to my parents house which is 40 mins away to wash our clothes and be able to actually have a shower that isn't freezing cold. We can't live there because there's no space.

I literally don't know what to do because I don't qualify for any government financial support whatsoever. I know I'm in alright place now and I am so lucky to be able to live with my father in law rent free and that he makes us meals but I hate this situation. I hate being freezing cold every day because all the windows are broken stuck open and there's no heating to warm us up, I hate being hungry all day, I hate worrying about this, I hate seeing all my friends having their own homes and kids when that is what I want so badly but I can't have it, I hate having to decide whether I should put myself through hell with pain every day or not eat.

I don't know what to do, does anyone know what I can do?",14Nov2020,1
798,"This girl DM’d me yesterday and asked if I wanted to smoke with her. I told her I would after work. So, after work I went home and grabbed my stuff, and we met up. I haven’t seen this girl in a couple months, and we briefly talked in the past. I used to work with her for a bit, but I barely knew her tbh. I only had about an hour to hang out with her because I had to go pick up my sibling from night classes, but I thought she was nice and cool so I agreed to meet up with her. 

So, we’re in my car cruising a blunt, and everything was chill at first. I really didn’t know what to talk about with her so I was kinda asking her simple questions to just get a feel for her. But when I asked her one particular question about a mutual acquaintance we both had in the past, she got really quiet. I had no knowledge that it’d be a touchy subject, so I apologized and told her we don’t gotta talk about it. 

(Side note- it was not a question about an ex or anything like that. Just someone we both knew)

So, when I apologized, she told me it was ok. And then she went on to say that she has bad trust issues and she had abusive relationships in the past. Tbh I barely know this girl, so this really caught me off guard. I just said, “Wow. Ok I’m really sorry I brought it up and made you uncomfortable. We can talk about something else if you want.” But then she told me she trusts me, and she just wanted to vent. Then she just started going on about all of this crazy shit that happened to her recently. I just let her talk, because I was honestly really high and I’m good at listening to people lol. But she was just talking about so much personal shit with me that it honestly made the situation kind of awkward for me. I just didn’t know what to say in response to a lot of it. I just did my best to let her know I was following along with the story and I understood what she was trying to say. 

But every time I would respond I felt like I was giving her really short answers and came off as boring or awkward to her, because I really did not know how to respond to all of the personal stuff she was telling me off the jump like that. I kind of felt like an idiot and like I was boring her lol. But I did my best to stay engaged in conversation and changed the subject a little. I tried to make her forget about all that and laugh and it started to work. We stopped at a gas station and picked up some snacks, but right after I realized we were already hanging out for over 2 hours, and I was an hour late to get my sibling. The time just flew by. So I told her I was really sorry and I had to get going. 

When I pulled up to her car to drop her off, she gave me a hug and said if I ever wanted to smoke with her again, then hit her up. I was kind of surprised by this because of the mixed vibes I was getting the whole time. I told her I would, gave her a hug,and then we parted ways. I think she was giving me signals that she wanted to kiss me but she was just so all over the place with her thoughts and vibes that I honestly could not tell. So I just told her I’d hit her up in the future and left it at that. I still can’t tell if she actually wants a second meet up or not.

Anyone else ever been in an awkward situation like this? If so how can I handle this in the future so it’s not so awkward?",14Nov2020,1

2 years ago, I met this amazing guy through a mutual friend. We were together a couple weeks and broke up with no hard feeling what so ever. Because we clicked so well, he became my best friend. We would hang out, go on fun adventures. He introduced me to his friend group and I’ve kinda been accepted into the “Wolfpack”. We started having sex again but there were no feelings involved (at least on my end). About a week ago I was chillen with one of our mutual friends and kind of realized I had a crush on him. We hooked up. Now I have a full blown crush on him. And I think my best friend wants me back. I am single, I feel like I should be able to do what I want but I don’t want to ruin a friendship all around. I love EBF,he’s always been there for me and likewise he’s like a brother almost .

So I am aware big butts are considered attractive right now and I don't hate my big butt visually. What I do hate is that it's disproportionate to the rest of me. I'm a UK size 8-10 on my torso and waist but for my butt and thighs it's a whole other story. Trying to get any pair of shorts, jeans or dress past my butt is such a struggle even though around the waist it'll fit perfectly or even be too big. I often have ended up buying XL and XXL to get past my butt but then the waist area has room for days and I have to wear a belt which can often look weird too. I also can't wear dresses which I love because either there's too much room up top and it all sags or worse, I rip the bottom half of my dress if I sit down. I've tried dressing to my body shape but idk why but most plum body shape dresses I can find seem to assume I'm a rich business woman and not a goth kid.  


I've heard body shapers can help in a quicker sense at keeping the butt shaped while going out but I can't find much information from sources that aren't actually trying to sell me body shapers. I'm also willing to exercise so any exercise routines are welcome. I'm also up for any suggestions of clothing companies that do goth clothing for plum shaped bodies. The only thing I can't do is dietary changes due to me already being on a specialised diet to ensure I'm getting more vitamins and protein. Thank you in advance for any suggestions.",14Nov2020,1

One being the whole friend group minus me, and the other being just my roommate, two really good girlfriends we made, and another kid I'm good friends with who's also on the team.

I don't want to dwindle on this but it hurts having to constantly go through this. I know they are keeping it a secret, as they spontaneously make plans within the group chat and since I'm around due to being friends with them, it's like they have to ask me to come along. I've tried my best these couple of months, being there for them and helping them out like one should do to me, as I live by the rule of treat others how you want to be treated. Just really stuck and confused as to why this is happening and what to do.

804,"24F. I ask you to please bear with me, read this completely, and offer me some guidance. 

My entire life, I have been known as the girl who is completely mentally checked out. In elementary and middle school, teachers literally felt bad for me, because I was so stupid. In high school and community college, I got sympathetic looks and was made fun of by my friends for continuously making mistakes that could have been easily avoided. At my first job, when I was 16, my boss and coworkers used to make fun of my intelligence and ask me how my mother “handles me.” Ive met the family members of some of my bosses and some have hinted that they’ve heard of my mistakes and stupidity. I’ve been screamed at constantly since I was a child (from a variety of people) due to me not being able to answer simple questions or do simple chores/tasks (example: my anxiety forced me to not be able to drive that much except to places I am only comfortable driving to (I get made fun of a lot for this), I cannot speak publicly, although that’s basically my job, I cannot get good grades, I can’t make friends, I am socially awkward, I cannot handle simple tasks (like washing dishes or doing laundry thoroughly), if there is an easy way to do something, I choose the harder way, etc). I am now in graduate school (I got in through the “special” program where you take additional classes to prepare yourself for the rigorous schedule before the actual school year begins). I am now almost done and have well over $130K in debt. Nothing is better- if anything, I feel like I am getting more and more incompetent. My sisters and parents often tell me that I am stupid, useless, and question how I am not able to do simple, easy things in life. My brother in laws treat me like I am a stupid child. Since I can remember, I’ve felt different and mentally inept. This has caused me to not be able to have a relationship for a long period of time. I have no friends. I’ve refused to leave my house and go out to social gatherings, because anyone I meet will eventually figure out how stupid I am and make me the butt of the joke. My professors and colleagues have made sly comments and remarks about my abilities. I’ve had bosses give other colleagues projects to work on, instead of me. I’ve given up on almost all of my hobbies and dreams and goals because I never follow through with them. I was born 3 months prematurely, and though I’ve been told that I have been tested negative for any mental disorders, I have always questioned whether this has caused/hindered intelligence. Everything I do seems to be or go wrong. I don’t think a therapist will help. No one can actually help me become more intelligent. I feel like once I graduate, no one will want to employ me, because they will eventually see how moronic I am. 

This is my question: If I have no sense of future, no sense of confidence, no sense of happiness with myself, how do I move forward in life? I feel like my stupidity only hinders my life and those around me. I question how I will be able to live on one income and live a happy life when everyone around me (friends, family, bosses, colleagues, etc) seems to find me inadequate. I feel like everyone around me is so successful and is able to live a happy life with friends, family, and spouses. Except me, the girl who performs poorly in every. single. thing. (I kid you not).

I don’t think this post fully encompasses the issues I experience with my incompetency, but in short, I’ve always been and always felt and done stupid things. One of the most popular comments I get from people is “why did you do it like that?” Or “I have no idea why you just did that” or they just look at me like I committed the most moronic and idiotic thing they have ever seen.

I am my own worst enemy in every facet of my life. Help? Advice? I apologize if this makes no sense, and I haven’t offered much information. Thank you in advance.",14Nov2020,1
805,"Hello! Ok so to start I should mention that I was born with really bad ADHD and moderate anxiety. So this sort of starts in middle school, when I was diagnosed I was put on an IEP that gave me extra time and help for tests and required I attend a ""Strategies"" class, which really was a special ed class for high functioning mentally challenged students. I **hated** this class as it had sort of labeled me as one of the disabled kids. Sure I was really hyper and annoying but I wouldn't have considered myself as one of them, I'm more mature today and I always acknowledged that many of these students needed this help but I was an insecure middle schooler and didn't want to be labeled. Not only that but for most of my life, my Dad has encouraged me not to use ADHD as an excuse for anything. So in about 7th grade, I asked my parents to take me off the IEP, as I honestly do very well in school and I didn't need it.

Then I went to high school, I did pretty well in high school, with a 29 on the ACT and a 4.1234 GPA. Being said, I always knew I would do better if I had an IEP that let me have extra time on exams, but my grades weren't bad enough for me to want to go back, still due to being feared of being labeled and being put back in a strategies class. That brings me to my first semester in college.

So I currently am taking Calc 2 at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, and it is **kicking my ass**. I have taken two large tests for the class and I got like a C on both.  I know it's just a tough class, but then I looked at why I got points off in the first place. I realized I might have gotten a high B - A on both of these tests if it weren't for really stupid mistakes. Like I simplified (n^(2)/n^(5/2)) to n^(3/2), or would misread a question and get the whole thing wrong. These aren't mistakes because I don't understand how to do it, they are just because of stupid mistakes. I'd say about 60% of the points I lost at least were due to stupid mistakes, which was a lot. I'm now questioning if this is actually because of my disability, that I get distracted quickly that I don't pay attention to detail and I rush because I'm worried about running out of time. 

See but I have no way of proving this, so I am considering emailing the teacher and asking if these stupid mistakes are actually common for people, especially because I get a full 8 hours of sleep every night and study a lot compared to other students. This leads to the part that I need advice on. I recognize that when I was in middle school and high school my disability didn't affect me a lot. But if I had an IEP my ACT would have been considerably higher and some of my grades higher as well. And I know a B- in calc 2 is actually average, but if I would have gotten an A if I didn't have these disabilities, is that fair? And not only that, but my classes will only get harder as I'm going for a Ph.D. in data science and dual majoring in computer science/data science. 

I'm stuck in a moral quandary now, whether I should go back and get an IEP. My thoughts for it are I do better, have less stress during tests and maybe sometimes homework life gets easier. If my GPA goes well, then I very possibly could do exceptionally well and maybe make it to a really prestigious grade school. But on the other side of things, I am terrified I use the IEP as a crutch like I use my Adderall today almost. I worry I'll just start turning in all assignments late and will develop poor work habits. I know it is possible to get around this but remember I have ADHD and that makes me want to take the easy route. I also fear needing to have meetings with all my teachers and my parents. My biggest fear is definitely when I get my P.h.D with a 3.9 GPA and excel in my classes, feeling that I didn't actually deserve it, that I had help because of my disability that I didn't actually need, which terrifies me.

So Reddit, I have no clue as to what my plan of action should be. I don't know if I should go and get a college version of an IEP, should I contact my teacher, or if I just need to study more. What should I do?",14Nov2020,1

Being middle class, I don't really have the privilege of being able to dropout whenever I want because I don't ""feel"" like it. I know they're both artistic degrees that are kind of similar to each other and some have said that it won't really matter as long as long as I have a degree but what about the time wasted? Being good at a skill requires at least 10k hours and I want to know what skill I want to improve on for that amount of time. The sooner I start the better.

So, what do you think i should do?",14Nov2020,1

Should I get back with my ex?

Im gay a gay male (22)and my first love male 
(24)came Into my life at 20. I loved him deeply more than myself tbh. We dated six months broke up for three then dated again for six months. Everything was great until covid and his friends got involved. We both had cheated on each other in the first go around but this second time was different. When we lived alone everything was fine... however we moved in with some friends of his and covid hit at the same time and everything become tense and started to fall apart. In also bipolar so the insecurities of his friends judging my relationship and the constant fighting from not having any space also created a problem. The last thing he ever told me was “I love you” then we both ended it. Looking for some advice, it was a toxic relationship but in not sure if we were not compatible or if it was situational. All I know is when our friends on both sides but mainly his got involved they both kept telling us we were being held back by the other. 

Should i try and reconnect? It’s been 4 months with absolutely no contact from either side.",14Nov2020,1
815,"Hello :) 

As the title says, I want to shave my hair off, but im a pretty hesitant/nervous about it. 

My hair gets tangled quickly and it’s such a chore for me and worrying about having to spend so much time detangling my hair makes me put it off and then I touch my hair and feel how bad it is and it stresses me out. I have little motivation to do much and standing in the shower for a long time makes me dizzy, so it makes me procrastinate on washing it even more. I sometimes have to go outside and it’s a bit embarrassing to have such tangled and matted hair, even when I style it so it isn’t really noticeable. I have tried to have a schedule to wash my hair, but I haven’t been able to stick to it.

I am hesitant because I don’t know if I would look good. For really short hair you have to have sharp features, right? I don’t think I really have those, so I don’t know if I could pull it off. Also I love my natural hair, it’s just annoying keep up with right now, so I looked up if head hair grows back differently after shaving and the internet said no, so it’ll be fine, right? Hope so, aha

816,To start out I met this girl about 5 years ago through another friend but we never hung out just one on one and only really hung out with each other in a group setting but 2 times. I tried to message her to hang out a few times and no dice. Ever since I laid eyes on her I always believed she was the most beautiful person I have ever seen. She ended up moving to a different state. Fast forward and I have a job that has me travel a lot. Well I ended up getting an assignment to be in the same area as this girl on and off for the next year. I messaged her and ask her what is fun to do around there and she gives me somethings to do and says we should hang out. Well we go out and hang out a few times and we’ll it was the most fun I have had hanging out with anyone. Learning more about her personality and who she is I find myself thinking that she checks everything I would want in a woman and is pretty much a real life version of my dream girl. After about the second time hanging out she says she’s not looking to date anyone right now for personal growth reasons. We have had a lot of drunk discussions about attraction to each other. We talk pretty much everyday and are finishing our days talking with each other till we fall asleep now. She tells me she couldn’t date me because of the long distance basically. Well I agreed to stay friends because she is like a best friend now. I keep catching myself falling for her and getting feelings. I enjoy her friendship but feel like the feelings are unhealthy to have. Should I continue hanging out or should I just cut it short and stop while I’m ahead?,14Nov2020,1

818,"I opened a letter today and all that was in the envelope was a folded piece of paper with my name &amp; address (for the envelope window) and the words ""Have a Happy Holiday Season!"" printed in large black text.  

It seems totally innocuous, but the fact that there's no identifying information in it is freaking me out a bit.  I have no idea who would send this to me or why it would be totally lacking in any kind of identifying detail.

Here is all the information I've been able to get from the letter and the (now ripped) envelope:

* The envelope has a window 
* Above the envelope window, the words ""**Please do not discard**"" are printed in bold black type
* The upper right corner of the envelope (where the stamp would be) says ""**First-Class Mail** / Presorted / U.S. Postage / **PAID** / Pewaukee, WI / Permit No. 1891"", where I've used the slashes to indicate a new line.  For reference, I live in Wisconsin.
* The back of the envelope, above the seal, the following address is printed: ""260 Williamson Boulevard #731989 Ormond Beach, FL 32173""
* On the letter there are also some numbers, a barcode, and a QR code surrounding my name and address - I haven't tried scanning the QR code but I assume it's my address information.

I don't know anyone in Florida or Pewaukee.  I looked up the Florida address - at that street address with zipcode 32174, there's a post office, so I assume the numbers in that address might be a P.O. Box.

background info: I am a first year university student in canada and i am experiencing a personal crisis in relation to the current situation of covid and tuition. thats that

normally in school, things would be all good as long as you go with the flow and work as hard as you can, as you should. but with my experience so far into this semester i feel like ive been scammed. im really interested in the major that i am in because it relates to a hobby of mine but i would never pay as much as i am paying right now to experience the mediocre home-school value that i am getting in return, and yeah, i know that youre just supposed to just learn and theres not much to it but c'mon... im paying enough money to to get the ball rolling for something magnificent and in return im getting less than the value of a highschool experience. +theres all these pointless fees, like i was charged 25$ for an orientation?? like, what? I literally just sat on my chair in my bedroom for 1 hour to hear about how people go about their regular days in school but i wouldnt even pay anything for that if i had the choice, to be honest. 

i feel like ive been taken advantage of for trying to manifest my personal interests and it truly is an injustice, especially because i feel as though there isnt a thing in the world that i can do to reverse the financial damage on my end.  

 Universities know that they cant serve the same standard of quality this year that they were able to offer in the previous years before covid but the price of the tuition is actually increasing! it seems like schools just try to keep things going on their end without any consideration of the burden that they impose on the actual paying members of their institutions that are just trying to make strides towards achieving their long term goals.

It started as sex deprevatiom. We haven't had sex in a month now because she says she's too fat. Now today I tried to touch her breast, flirting, and she physically moved my hand away saying she's too fat.

Otherwise we're great. We don't argue, we do well together, and communicate effectively. This has put a serious wedge in our marriage and especially sex life and I'm starting to become unhappy, NOT because of her weight gain, but because of how it is affecting her.

826,"I need serious advice from a non-biased point of view because this has been the most confusing situation I’ve ever been in. I met this girl around a year ago, and we hit it off instantly. She is the most beautiful girl I’ve ever met, and she loves me dearly. I’ve never been with someone who loves me so much. Her family is incredibly nice, her friends are really nice to me and I consider them my friends, and I feel the most confident I’ve ever felt in all areas of my life. My life was really good. Around February of this year, we started becoming more serious. I always had a great time with her and felt like I loved her. The moment she told me she loved me, I got incredibly stressed. I started obsessing over this other girl I just randomly thought of, and my anxiety from feeling like I’m a bad person destroyed my confidence. I felt very confused, and started acting more insecure, and ultimately I was a bad boyfriend. I broke up with her multiple times, and saw other people in between but it was always such a horrible experience emotionally after. I just honestly felt like I couldn’t be with her and it was heartbreaking and I felt like a horrible person. I really hated myself and thought something was wrong with me. I got a therapist which cleared up a lot of shit in my head, and after some time apart moving on, we reconnected to exchange clothes. I didn’t think anything would happen, but it felt like old times again before everything bad happened. We had such a good time, and have been seeing each other since then. The crazy thing is, it’s going great. We are both getting on better than we ever have before, she’s literally my best friend, and I feel like it’s a new relationship. I learned to manage my anxiety better and not beat myself up so much, so I feel more confident and like a better boyfriend. I enjoy my life now. I still have times when negative thoughts come up, but I know she loves me and being with her makes me want to be a better person. I just want to love her better.

I still struggle with the same old issues, but I’ve become more open about my insecurities with her and she’s very helpful. I feel like I never really gave her a chance.

827,"General gist is that he was embedded in our friend group for a hella long time. One day, we had a meetup where he was conveniently absent. We began questioning some of the shit he'd been doing, such as sexually talking to some of the members in our friend group &amp; even groping one of them. Turns out he'd texted around \~25 girls, harassing them &amp; trying to masquerade it all as a ""fun game"". Sickening, yeah. We're still in high school, btw.

We accumulated screenshots from everyone for proof, reported it to our school, they seemed eager to treat the case but then all they did was change his schedule around so he wouldn't have to mingle with the victims. He still has classes with some of them, aswell! Shows how much they don't care.

In his mind, he's practically won. He keeps returning on alternate accounts to mock us. We paralyzed his social life, reducing his friends to only a single kid who doesn't know of the shit he did. What's our move now? We're ready to do anything to get this bastard away from us. Our worst fear is that a repeat of the past happens and he starts sexually harassing girls again.

Also, he didn't return just to mock US. He also teased the victims that he unfortunately got lewd photos from. He made fun of everyone he had tricked.

We also invited him to a chat to have a little sit-down with him and he said the n-word about 10 times, hard r once, and the f slur about 2 times. This is totally contradictory to his previous personality, which he commonly advocated for social justice &amp; was absolutely against anything relating to the nature of racism. 

We believe this switch happened because his personality before he was found out was only designed to appeal to girls of the same nature.  Now that he has no chance of anyone in a 20 mile radius having the crossing thought of dating him, he's molted that skin into what he truly was: a racist, homophobic sleazebag. 

His only means of salvation now is this website. He has an account here where he posts nearly everyday. To think he got away with the shit he did is simply mortifying.

We stopped responding to his alternate accounts. It's only attention seeking at this point. The police did get involved when the school launched an investigation, but they only searched one of my friend's phones and that was it. Nothing else. We're not sure exactly what they were doing. 

What do we do now? Just leave it? We're at an impasse right now, whether to let this go, or take any possible action we can now.

This is really difficult to post about, at the moment I feel rock bottom and like there's no way up. I'm a full time chemistry student and I love my course, I'm good at it and enjoy it. However, I don't fit in and other students are making my life a misery. 

I'm not your stereotypical student. I don't drink, party, smoke etc. This has meant I don't have many friends but thankfully I do have a couple of good ones.

Recently, a girl on my course has started spreading lies about me and is twisting my words at any opportunity. She'll admit she doesn't know the context of a situation but still twist what I've said anyway. She's written statuses about me that are false and don't have all the facts so others believe her. It's all drama that I can't deal with. 

Also, a guy on my course is constantly wanting my help and I've had to tell him multiple times that I can't as I don't want to give him the wrong answers. He's also been asking me for money, I haven't sent any but I feel bad saying no.

This is a reoccurring theme, I spend my free time (away from work) studying as chemistry is really demanding, more than I thought it would be. So people always come to me for help, even though they need to do it themselves.

840,"TL;DR: A deep dive into my drinking, sex and general life problems; hoping for some wisdom.

Hello kind strangers. I am a 20 year old male from the UK currently at University. I drank a lot last night and am going through my post drinking depression. I've noticed the day after I just feel like arse and my serotonin levels plummet. This unearths issues that I usually can just bury or wouldn't bother me otherwise. It was a brilliant night nevertheless and a lot of fun. I had sex for the first time in 9 months last night and the condom split. I didn't finish (thank god) and I spoke to the girl morning after and she said she was on the pill and was tested recently for STD's which came back clear, so that's a plus but still a concern in the back of my head. I'm slightly worried about getting an STD but I haven't had one thus far so hopefully luck is on my side.

I'm supposed to going out on a date with a girl next Thursday. We've been speaking on a dating app and she seems cool. The prospect of a proper relationship is really appealing to me but I've never really got it right. I'd always end up getting FOMO and bailing. I think a relationship would keep me in check though and I really do want that solid companionship.

I hate the way alcohol makes me feel the day after (psychologically). I feel likes its a trade off for the good times that come with a night of boozing which is fair and makes sense logically. I've thought about going straight edge but I don't really see the benefit other than a reduction in promiscuity, but that isn't too much of a problem as I've not been having too much sex of late (probably because of COVID). I do enjoy drinking and it isn't something I really want to give up. I'm definitely not an alcoholic by the way, just a heads up.

842,"For context. Almost a year ago we got a second dog. We live separated because we can't afford an apartment or something at the time (we live with our parents). The dog came from Romania to Germany in a shelter, where we bought it from. The dog didn't always listen to us. One day on a Sunday we were in her backyard and the dog jumped onto the naighboring hall roof. We tried to call him down and he walked onto the other side of the roof. I told my gf to stay put and look out for the dog while I go check out the other side of the house and hall. Some minutes later I hear a loud cracking and a yelp and rumbling. I sprinted back to the driveway, then into the backyard to find the dog, but not my gf. I take the dog inside and started looking for my gf. Calling for her while I go around the house into the backyard and then back. After a minute or two she came back. With some bruises on her leg, blood running down, crying and dirty.

843,"Hello, as the title suggests, I’m in a very tight spot. I want to be an artist/animator, but my drawing skills are horrible. But whenever I try to practice, school gets in my way, and it’s been going on for so long that now I’m feeling like I have wasted this whole year doing nothing but procrastinating. 

Let me explain: I can’t practice my drawing because of all the hours I have to spend in school, doing classwork, homework, makeup work, Etc., and when I finally do get time off from school, I’m too tired to even practice. This is really stressing me out, because I wanted to at least get a good start to it before the year ends, but now with the year coming to a close and nothing getting done, I’m not so sure. This stress is starting to seriously affect my grade and I don’t know what to do about it. 

If any of you guys could please give me some help, I’d be really thankful",14Nov2020,1

846,"This is going to sound like a rant I'm sure, and possibly even unjustified at that, but I need to vent for my own mental health at this point. I work as an essential employee at a restaurant and as we all know, covid is a thing. I feel as if I am the only one who takes the pandemic seriously. I like in a city in Ohio and much like a lot of other states in the US, we've broken case records by a wide margin over the past week. I constantly wear my mask with the exception of taking a drink of water or stepping outside for a cigarette. 

I am in management and I recently wrote up the only employee yet for not wearing a mask. This employee claimed to be exempt from wearing a mask due to prior health issues and when I asked what they were and if they had submitted the proper paperwork, they then threatened to sue me for violating HIPPA laws by simply asking what the health issues were. I did not receive a call from their lawyer like they promised and I'm honestly not worried about that happening. 

Since then, a fellow manager who has made no attempt to hide their friendship with this employee has started harassing me. Not in a sexual, physical or violent way but, in the sense that they are constantly rude to me and blatantly disobey instructions when I am the manager in charge. This fellow manager has refused to wear their mask, shown up 30mins late to a shift, walked out an hour early on a shift because it was their birthday, and taken every chance to express distaste towards me. I have tried talking to upper management and they refuse to due anything about the situation because the fellow manager has found another job and will be going part time soon. Upper management has even expressed to me that they want me to document everything that this person does and email it to them but I don't see a point when I often get no response and they haven't given me a concrete answer on what they're going to do with this information.

I normally would just put in a two weeks and find another job but I'm getting older and tired of working in fast paced restaurants so most options are high risk when it comes to the pandemic or are just no longer hiring in my area. 

I will welcome any advice or (if you're like me and your favorite defense mechanism is Misery Loves Company) to hear similar stories of people just being terrible so I know I'm not alone in this terrible times for the world.",14Nov2020,1

849,"You know that feeling when you can tell they don’t love you anymore? I’ve been watching my boyfriend slowly fall out of love with me. It hurt. I don’t feel anything anymore. I love him more than I can even  comprehend. He has depression and he’s struggling with it. But I’m struggling too. He just doesn’t see it. I’m so wrecked. I started cutting. He wants to die every day. I’m just so drained and exhausted. But I love him. I cannot live without him. But our relationship has worsened these past few weeks. We don’t FaceTime anymore, we don’t talk much when we hangout, we barely even see each other anymore. I miss the old him so fucking much. I miss him. And I feel so guilty for saying this since he has a real disorder and it’s not his fault. But I’ve never felt this way before. The emptiness and at the same time endless sadness are overwhelming. I can’t even imagine how he’s feeling. It’s all so complicated. When he’s having a good day everything is so great and I feel like we’re back to our normal, happy selves. What we used to be. But when he’s having a bad day he talks about killing him self and how he doesn’t feel anything anymore. And that hurts so much and I’m just trying to stay strong while I’m with him. But when he leaves to go home I break down and cry myself to sleep. I hate this. I want to back to normal. I don’t even know what I’m asking advice for.

I have bad anxiety so my mind wanders everywhere and I freaked out and told him it seems like he only wants me for sex. He was really offended and told me that it hurt a lot and its not like he doesnt get on me for my issues a lot but I wanna fix it. It was just me being super insecure and connecting little dots from out of nowhere. I told him I felt super guilty and he keeps telling me I need to be nicer to him (he said this over the phone a few times) and it made me feel worse and worse about it to where I feel like I heavily damaged the relationship. I didnt 100% mean it but ofc the way boys are sometimes im used to it and it kind of came out of little things that he's done. 

How do I fix it? I keep telling him how guilty I feel and how i'm going to make sure next time I see him that he gets all of my love and attention and we can do whatever he wants but i feel like he 's not letting go of it, which isnt his fault. We agreed he'd stop with the things he does that hurts me and I'd stop nitpicking. How can I fix this other than just being 100% honest about my guilt, apologizing, making sure he has the best time this week and just being less nitpicky? Any advice?",14Nov2020,1

So, I’m an alcoholic and recently I found out one of my favorite coworkers quit because I got drunk and hit on him. Apparently I was saying a lot of graphic things and it’s just embarrassing. So I know stopping drinking is obviously a key factor for that particular problem. 

What I’m struggling with is that I’m a very “touchy-feely” person. I don’t like feel people up, but I’m a huge hugger and I’ll touch people when I talk with them. Like a pat on the shoulder and things like that. I don’t feel like it’s extremely inappropriate, but I think other people do. I feel really bad about it and I feel really bad that I’m just now starting to realize it’s something that probably creeps a lot of people out.

859,"Valentine’s Day weekend 2019, I was working 3rd shift at a small mom &amp; pop hotel. Staffing included myself, my boss, &amp; her sister. Each day split into 3 shifts, so we worked alone during our shift. This place was really lousy &amp; violated several fire codes, as well as Department of Labor legality issues. I have no clue how this place isn’t shut down yet. 

I’ll spare you the details, but I witnessed a violent sexual/physical assault at work. Being a rape survivor myself, my PTSD was in a spiraling rage for a long time after. I quit one month after the assault. In September 2019, I finally sought medical attention for my suicidal ideations. I got a new job in healTHCare shortly after. I was promoted less than 3 months after being hired. I have clearly been thriving in my current atmosphere. However, one of my patients is the victim of the Valentine’s Day assault. There have been several times that we have come face to face and I freeze every time. It feels like the wind was knocked out of me. In 2019 we briefly spoke after the assault, and I held her. I don’t know if she recognizes me or not. 

It’s not fair to the victim that my PTSD is reignited, and I don’t feel it is appropriate to approach her about that experience. My close-knit coworkers are aware of this patient &amp; our past. They’re usually good about giving me the heads up so I can take a 10. However, like I said, I’m not always that lucky. We bump into each other about 1-3 times a month; whether it’s in my place of work, or just around our small-ish town. 

How do I cope with this? With a laundry list of physical ailments, this just throws me into a deeper depression. I start therapy in 2 weeks &amp; my medication was recently adjusted by my psychiatrist. I know I’ve got a lot of internal work to do, but what else?

With second lockdown I figured I didn’t want to be alone (as my boyfriend is at sea) so I came home. From the south to the north. I’m staying with my dad but originally planned to stay with my granny. I’ve spent a week with my dad and I can’t help but feel sorry for him/ guilty that when I go he’ll just be in his house alone. With Covid obviously he doesn’t see his friends face to face at all but he barely goes for walks and doesn’t really do much except play computer games. 

Without getting into too much detail he doesn’t have any family around him and I’m just scared he’s lonely. I feel so guilty that I can’t always be around but at the same time I know it’s not all my fault. He is perfectly capable of living alone just fyi.

I've posted this issue a few months back when I thought it was related to my partners situational depression.

Update:

I'm a 31 year old female. He's a 35 year old  male. Up until a month ago, he had a job he absolutely hated which was making him depressed. I was patient and supportive and understanding. Now he's off until January, when he'll hopefully start a new job he'll like better.

Despite the current lockdown, we still get on, we don't particularly argue, we kiss and cuddle but he's completely lost interest in sex.  It's been like this for the last 7,8,9 months, when he still had the horrible job. But he doesn't have it anymore!

Every now and then (maybe one every other week), he'll have a minimal morning urge and I take the crumbs I can get. But it's not like how it used to be. It's gone...... flat. 

It's started to piss me off- it's always on his terms, every now and then and with minimal awareness or consideration to my needs, despite me raising this sensitivly a couple of difderent times. He agrees but doesn't make any further effort. 

We just celebrated 2 years together....is this what a comfortable, secure realtionship is? If so, it's not enough despite how funny, caring and sweet he is. Other than this issue, are compatibility is very strong.

So I’ve (M17) had a pen pal (F19) since February. Initially we were writing back and forth a lot (like once a week over email). But since lockdown her responses have taken longer and longer. It’s been almost 2 months since I sent my last email. I’m worried that she’s lost interest in our conversations. 
I almost want to send a check-up email, just to make sure she’s ok, but she’s still active on Reddit so I know she’s ok. Should I send an email anyway?
Maybe it’d be useful for you to know that I have mild autism, so maybe I’m misreading this situation and maybe this is how penpan-ship is? Idk. I just wanted to ask your advice: do you think I’m being ghosted, or is this just how pen pal stuff goes?
