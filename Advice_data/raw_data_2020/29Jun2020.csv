0,"I’m sorry if my wording is confusing, but I’m a book-writer and I’m trying to solidify my time period a bit and keep it as factual as possible. It’s set in a stereotypical towny setting that you may see in most movies, with a blacksmith, pre-technology, wells, and home style farming. What time period does this closely match? I’m not very good with history and want to make sure vocabulary, settings, and atmosphere are in keeping with the image I have in mind. Any help is appreciated! r/askreddit couldn’t fit my question very well so i thought this might fit here. if not feel free to have reviewed, i’m fairly new to reddit :)",29Jun2020,1
1,"As the title says, girlfriend of 6 years left me for someone she only met online and never met irl. She took everything from our joint wedding account while im busting my ass off working 12 hour shifts (yes, even during this pandemic) for the past year to get her dream wedding.

Believe it or not, she met the guy playing a mobile dance dance sort of game and suddenly told me ""she feels an instant connection and chemistry that we never had"". 

Can't do anything about the account as its a joint account, both parties can withdraw with no problems.

I'm in a city far away from home, working for a job I don't enjoy, for something thats never gonna happen. I'm just lost. I don't even know what to do anymore.

2,"So a month or so ago I watched the movie, matrix. It was an okay movie until a few days ago when my brain told me “what you’re experiencing isn’t real” and after lockdown I’m always at home and damped and gloomy. Whenever I have free time it always gets to my heady and takes over me thinking that our world could be a simulation. I know it sounds stupid but every night I shiver as I sleep from these thoughts. Please, somebody give me advice or help me.",29Jun2020,1
3,"About an hour ago, my Mom came to me and admitted that she's worried that my Dad. She said that she thinks he ""might snap"" and is worried for her safety. 

Mom has called the police for help once when I was a child. She's mentioned shelters before, possibly moving out, but has never said that she's now fearful for her well-being. 


I quickly looked into the emergency housing my university provides in case and emailed them asking if I needed emergency housing, would I be able to bring her. It's a Sunday, I don't expect an answer anytime soon. 


She says she doesn't want me to purposely cancel things that would have me leave the house. But is there anything else I can do to protect her? It's just three of us in the house.",29Jun2020,1

6,"I’ve known this guy for nearly 9 years. I’ve had him on every form of social media for many years and I’ve met his friends and family through FaceTime. We drink together, play games, and talk like we’re best friends. Seriously, the other night we had a nonstop 3.5 hour conversation. Sometimes we flirt and I’ve always known there was a little spark there but we were both always dating other people so neither of us ever acted on it.

We’re planning to meet up halfway between our states. I’m bringing 2 friends with me and if something feels off about it then it’ll just be a fun road trip for us. I don’t have any bad feelings about it other than maybe some nervousness since I’ll be seeing him for the first time but that’s to be expected.

9,"okay so i’ve had a MAJOR crush on my “straight” best friend for the past 9 months

it started in October 2019 and it’s still going strong, i’ve tried to rebound but nothing has ever lasted. 

she came out to me as bi a week ago BUT she likes my other friend (she said she’s almost over her).

she’s been acting different towards me since then, i’m not sure how to put it but it’s like she likes me? which i highly doubt but she’s acting like it? 
like she’ll text me more often, be sadder when i have to go, blow up my phone, when we see each other at school (i live in australia so we have school back) she’ll be physically closer like hold my hand, grab my arm, wait for me at my locker. 

around november/december last year she found out (before she was out) yet didn’t let it ruin our friendship which i thought was odd. she knew i felt bad and she still feels bad to this day. 

a week later i told her my feelings were gone but that was a lie.

13,"I am an extremely superficial, egotistical, jealous and insecure man (Bad traits but I can acknowledge it). I work very hard on my appearance because I believe it's important to have a stand out look that really showcases to people your competency and league. It is also because I am very insecure. I have a girlfriend \[22 F\] and she is extremely attractive, redhead, huge rack, short, extremely in shape and her nails are gorgeous, she usually gets really expensive manicures/polish jobs done every few weeks. I'm SO insecure that she gets DM's secretly from men, or hit on when i'm not around that it's all I can think about, even in my dreams (Or as I call them, nightmares). I know she gets stares when we go out in public and it makes me so sad to imagine her ever cheating on me.

14,"If anyone else could chime in soon, that would be really helpful because he wants to talk about it and its got me scared... 

Basically, he comes from a troubled past. Drugs, alcohol, violence. Here's a list of stuff he just now told me he did in the past:

1.He tried to kill himself on 15 different occasions

2.He is over $6000 in debt to 2 credit cards, 1 loan service, and 5 phone companies.

3.He is over $2000 in debt to family/friends because of his past drug use

4.He tried to burn his family's house down during a black out

5.He tried to kill his abusive father, I already knew this one

6.He was chased over state lines by police because he was suicidal and driving to his grandmother's house for whatever reason.

He said he's ""found god"" and changed over the past 5 years. He doesn't drink or do drugs anymore. I've known him since before the quarentine started and we've been dating for about 6 months and NOW he tells me this. I come from a house of violent people and its traumatizing. I'm supposed to go see him tomorrow but now I'm worried.

Like, what if he's got some secret temper that he's not showing because we're still relativly early into the relationship? What if he's still doing drugs/alcohol? What if he has a criminal record he's not telling me about? What if he tries to kill himself again and I get pulled into it? I'm concerned and don't want to be a b\*tch, but this is really scary. I've been with some pretty crappy guys but this is a new level of concern and sort of fear.

If I ghost on him or told him we shouldn't talk anymore or just told him my concerns would I be a terrible person? I'm scared now and I shouldn't have to be but I don't want to be a terrible person and judge him by his past. What do I do?

23,"Hello, I just wanted to start off by saying that im new to r/Advice and reddit in general, so im sorry if I break any rules i didn't know about.

I (13M) started playing hockey when i was about 8, and I truely enjoyed every second of it up until a couple months ago.

To give some context, the year before last was when I played select and my coach reccommended that I start figure skating on the side to improve even more, so I did and I enjoyed it. However hockey was still my main thing. Then I moved to A and at first I was thrilled, but after a couple games I realized the climate was quite different than in select. Every time I made a mistake I got yelled at. I would have understood if I kept making the same mistake over and over again, but I always put lots of work into fixing them and I almost never repeated a mistake. The fact that there were a couple of people on the team that where almost house leauge level (Lowest level there is) and those kids where getting more ice than me on most days didnt help either, but I put up with it. (I should also add that there was a change in coaches, but im afraid it will be more of the same)

As I mentioned above, I stopped enjoying it a couple weeks after Covid shut down most of Canada. I feel like I realized how nice life was without an overly zealous coach breathing down my neck.

On the flip side, my coaches in figure skating were always nice to me even when I made mistakes. They even asked how my week was and I feel like they enjoyed being around me and that made me feel really nice about myself.

Now we're at today, I now would much rather do 4 hours of figure skating than 30 mins of hockey, but when I present this to my mom she usually says something alond the lines of, ""This is a great opprotunity, do you know how many kids want the chance to play on your team. I know last year was rough but there is a new coach now and your doctor wants you playing a team sport"" Im also afraid that 5 years of training will go down the drain if I stop playing hockey.

The thing is that these are all valid points and now im just getting confused. I should also add that I started on ice training a couple weeks ago with a seperate coach and even without the pressure of an angry coach it just doesn't feel very fun anymore. Its getting to the point where sometimes i get nervous when my mom tells me to get ready for hockey which I know is dumb because there is nothing to worry about but it happens nonetheless.

Then there is the stigma that surrounds a boy doing figure skating which my parents don't care about, but if anybody at my school finds out it won't be very good for me seeing as they already make fun of me a bit.

I don't really know which way to go at this point.",29Jun2020,1
24,"I'm 20 years old and I've been dating my boyfriend (21) for the past year and a half. He is the number one person in my life and I can see myself spending my life with him.

I rarely get to see my boyfriend since my dad doesn't know about him, which makes it hard on our relationship. My mom doesn't seem to care about my feelings as to why I want to tell my dad and why I love my boyfreind. My dad is very strict and I'm not sure how he would react to me having a boyfreind.

25,"This is soooo much but please bare with me.
I (21F) was a receptionist at a salon and lost my job due to covid. It was really hard for me but my boss informed that she wouldn’t be able to afford me when the salon were to open back up and she didn’t even know when that would be. 
A little background. The women in this salon are terrible. They think they run their own reality tv show. No joke. I worked my ass off trying to be the best receptionist I could be for them and I was never good enough. I tried to keep up with laundry as best I could. I had to walk to get their lunch everyday (if they needed it) and if the food was wrong, I would walk all the way back to get it fixed for them. Those are just little examples. 
At the time, I had just graduated cosmetology school and was working on getting my license. My boss would tell me that I could walk around and watch the girls do color and cuts and just assist if they needed me and so every now and then, that’s what I did. After all, when they hired me, we agreed that I would be learning from the other stylists there as well. 
They hated when I would walk around and watch them for a little bit and 2 of the women would inform my boss that I was being lazy &amp; slacking off by just “standing around” And I was NOT. They told my boss that I would make their clients uncomfortable when I would watch. It’s bs. It’s not creepy or anything at all. AT ALL. 
I eventually became so bitter working there. It was so hard to come into work and feel like I wasn’t good enough to be there. Or I didn’t fit in with them. Because if you’re not trash talking someone or being sassy, then you’re an outcast. One woman would pull me aside constantly and lecture me about things she didn’t like about me and what I needed to improve on. And while she would claim that it was just constructive criticism, it most definitely was not. Not even close. I went home crying most of the days I spent there because it was just so mentally and emotionally draining. 

So the salons have reopened and they have a new receptionist. Looks like they could afford one just fine. And they’ve just announced that they’re building an even bigger space to move in to. They’ve started investing in videography for the salon. They post all over social media about how great their new receptionist and how they’ve never had it so good. And this just hurts. I never fought back. I never spoke up for myself. Because I felt that it was better to take it with a grain of salt and move on and have a better day the next day. And when I would talk about it with my bf, he just agreed that they weren’t worth fighting with. And he was right for sure. 
I just can’t help but see all of this and let it get to me. Why wasn’t I good enough? Why didn’t they want to be my friend? Why did I have to stoop to their level for them to like me? Was covid just a convenient excuse to let me go? Why don’t they like me? I did everything I could. 

I’m a licensed stylist in a new salon with a great group of women. Uplifting and supportive women. I am so grateful for where I am now and I’m doing what I love. But I can’t get over my last job. Every time I see or hear something from my last job, it just seems like everything is so much better without me. And I just can’t get out of my head about it. 
It’s a mess. This whole post is a mess but I hope someone can offer some sort of suggestion or advice. Thanks in advance!",29Jun2020,1

41,"So let me start off by saying I absolutely love my nephew more than anything. I stayed school in the spring so i haven’t been able to see him.
His birthday is in late July and me and my sister had plans to go down there and see him.
He turning 3! 

My younger sister wanted to bring her new boyfriend to the party so she asked my brothers girlfriend if he can come and she said she will think about it. Which already threw everyone off but it’s her right to say who can and can’t come. Her initial reasoning was because my sisters ex was gonna be there, so she didn’t want any drama at the party or for it to be awkward for either of them. Cause the boys have not gotten along. We still consider her ex a part of the family so we all keep contact. 

My brother girlfriend told my sister that she didn’t want him coming to the party cause she didn’t know him and it wasn’t a good time to meet him and that she would rather meet him at her graduation. Essentially telling us don’t bring him, which she has no say on people we can bring on vacation with us.
So I i told my sister to have her boyfriend sit this one out, there was no reason for him to go cause he wouldn’t be meeting any family( we don’t really talk to any other family that’s back home). She said she wasn’t going without him and that she would go to the zoo and that’s it. My brothers girlfriend told her to not come at all and that she was being selfish. Her ex had said some pretty nasty thing and has cussed her out on numerous occasions, she doesn’t want to be around him. Which I can understand. 

So my sister makes the decision or to go at all cause she doesn’t want to deal with drama. Both my brother and his gf cause so much h drama in the family with their toxic relationship together and with my mom. Every time we go back home we always end up in something that we never wanted to deal with in the first place, hence why we haven’t been back home in a while because it to much to deal with. I’m the only one with a car and I don’t want to spend a ton of money anyway. Plus we have been omg saying for moths that we didn’t want to go back home.

We made the decision not to go, me and my 3 sisters, but we have told her yet me and my sisters are close I’ll always side with her except when Ik she wrong,
If you tell one of us not to go your telling all of us not to come. She was being petty and said we couldn’t stay at her house we would have to get a hotel and I’m definitely not paying for that. We said we would send his gifts through the mail. We are drained from dealing with drama and it’s all the time with them and we are over it. Are we wrong for not wanting to go? My sister had also uninvited them to her graduation the next month. The family is really broken up. 

TL;DR: brothers girlfriend won’t let my sister bring her bf to my nephews party. Now everyone is fighting and not going to attend",29Jun2020,2
42,"I’m 31, from London.

There is a girl I dated briefly about 6 years ago. She was argumentative and toxic, so I broke it off very early. 

Shortly afterwards, she poisoned me socially on two occasions (that I know of). One, she claimed we didn’t have sex because I wasn’t able to perform. I confronted her in front of people and she admitted she made it up. Two, she told a mutual group of friends that I had been rude and made her cry. That group shunned me for a year. I had no idea why - until they fell out with her and informed me that they took her side over her claims. 

It’s now 6 years later. We’re civil, and we very rarely see each other. We have mutual friends so maybe 3 times a year.

I was just told by a close friend that when my name came up in a conversation between her and some people I don’t know, he witnessed her saying that I was a sex pest and that I had pestered her whilst with my current girlfriend.

It is completely untrue. I’ve barely seen her and have not exchanged any messages with her in years. 

I’d be willing, reluctantly, to let this go...but she has now moved into a similar work industry to me. I am self-employed and have to pitch for jobs with my clients. She is connected, now, to at least 3 of my clients. 

My concern is that if she is saying this claim to strangers, she’d likely say it to our mutual clients (we’re the only mutuals on insta, so it’s likely I’d come up). If she says to my clients that I’m a sex pest etc, this will easily spread - and I’ll find myself unable to get work, with no proof of why it is. I’d just suffer without ever knowing that this claim was circulating in my industry.

I don’t know what to do. To confront her might risk adding fuel to the fire and putting me higher up on her gossip list, hurting me more. She makes things up about people often and is a controversial character - but not necessarily to clients that don’t have any social connections to her. 

I can’t sue for defamation because I have one person’s word, and I can’t prove loss of income as it’s so nebulous.

Advice really really welcome!

Thank you,",29Jun2020,4
43,"Quick background:
I was “homeschooled” K-12. Not only was I never taught math or many other subjects, but I have trouble teaching myself things so I never learned it. I never understood numbers and Math in particular is wrapped up in specific instances that trigger my ptsd. 

Add being diagnosed this year with inattentive ADHD amongst other disorders/mental illness to the mix. 
☠️

Learning materials for Adults™ might as well be a car manual in a different language to me. 

I also have memory processing issues and sensory overload is a thing that puts me into meltdown-mode. Plus a lot of internalized shame and guilt for zoning out all my life. I have reading issues too. I can write a lot but I have trouble formulating cohesive thoughts and I spend a long time editing and reading back my posts using TTS. I “read” books by using Audible. 

Numbers and their relationships and “ratios” don’t make any sense to me as a “language” let’s say. 

If you have any easily digestible resources that’d be cool, even if it’s made for kids. If you have kids and their math shows/apps don’t annoy the shit outta you I’ll try those, too. 

Any advice?

44,"I (m) did not plan on going out the previous night, however was convinced by my friend. Our relationship is platonic. I hesitantly decided on choosing to go because she has previously left me on other nights to go elsewhere. I decided to go and for about the first hour it wasn't too bad. We got some drinks and were hanging out, but she began meeting many people who I assumed were all of her friends as she goes to this bar often, I don't. I am quickly ignored and for the remaining two hours of the night, I was simply a placeholder in lines and spots at the bar. I would use the bathroom and later she would ask where I went and ask me to meet her somewhere, as soon as I would get there, she would be gone and getting drinks from other men who she had been talking to for quite some time. I wait where she told me to for about an hour without seeing her. I walk in again and she is still with the same group of people, some of which she had introduced me to earlier as her friends. I felt embarrassed and disposable and choose to leave the bar without saying anything as I was embarrassed for making the same mistake over and over. She texts me about ten minutes later asking where I was at and I was about a block away. I told her I went for a walk and sent her my location, then asked where she is at. At this point I do not hear from her for 30 minutes, my phone dies, and I am forced to walk home. Then she texts me at 4am saying she is scared and in a bad situation. When I wake up I have a series of texts about how it is my fault that this happened to her, and that last year she was r\*ped in a similar situation. 

I have been subtweeted at all day, been slandered about to my friends, etc. for me making this happen to her. I feel as though I was ignored for 80% of the night, and when I finally chose to leave, it was my fault for not being her friend and looking out for her. I left believing she was with her friends I had never met, and I looked for her without a reply until 4am when she finally did claiming she was scared. I have apologized for leaving her and I wish she never had to be scared of reliving an experience from the previous summer, but I was tired of feeling as though I was an accessory to her and as though she had convinced me to come along just to babysit her throughout the night. Am I fully accountable for this, am I partially accountable, am I not accountable? Personally I do not blame myself nor her, but the people that made her scared. She was not drugged, just drunk. I do not know how many drinks she had as she kept running away to groups of guys trying to get free drinks. I also drank a considerable amount that night too. Please let me know what you all think and what I couldve done better.

48,"Note: I am receiving talk therapy and I'm on antidepressants. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old female college student who recently started struggling with an eating disorder (I am receiving treatment). Ever since I moved back in with my family for quarantine, I've been having almost daily what can best be described as temper tantrums. I scream at the top of my lungs and cry while beating and kicking the floor or rocking back and forth with my hands over my ears screaming ""lalalalalala don't talk to me don't talk to me don't talk to me"", I run outside and throw rocks at trees to avoid throwing valuable objects and hurting the people I love. Many of these freak-outs are triggered by my parents making me eat more than I'm comfortable with (which is fair, and good that they're doing that), but many of them are brought on by other extremely minor issues. We're in the process of moving out of a rental house and I had to fold the sheets and put them on the bed. I didn't fold the sheets correctly and my dad told me to re-fold them. He wasn't exactly nice about it; he was kind of patronizing. But whatever, a normal, nice person would probably just refold the sheets. Maybe they might snap at him.

Not me. I immediately began to cry with rage. I didn't want to throw a full blown temper tantrum over something so minor, so I sat down on the bed, covered my ears, and gritted my teeth to keep from screaming. He got mad at me for having this reaction (fair, tbh), because he knows I'm better than that. This just caused me to become even angrier. He left the house and came back 30 minutes later when I was able to calm myself down.

About an hour ago, I actually ended up shattering my phone after flying into yet another rage. When I do have one of my tantrums, I feel that I am completely out of control of it. It feels like diarrhea. I can hold it in to some extent for a little while, but it's unbearably uncomfortable and bound to come out at some point. Or holding back a very angry bull all by myself.

The only thing I've found that works is if I close my eyes, cover my ears, and everyone stops talking to me. That's the only way I can avoid it. My family tries to do this, but you can understand how frustrating it must be when you're trying to get someone to be a basic f\*cking decent human being and they react by crying. So they don't always stop talking when I ask them to: you can't just walk away in the middle of an argument. I can't expect them to be able to control themselves at all times, especially when I barely do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely ashamed and embarrassed by this. I'm 21 and I act like a child. My lack of maturity has always been a point of insecurity for me, as I grew up with ADHD, a learning disability, and debilitating anxiety. My feelings of anger are constant; I'm pretty much perpetually irritated. It's mostly at myself but also everybody else.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working through this with my therapist. But does anyone have any methods of dealing with not just anger, but genuine blind rage? Breathing exercises, counting, etc. How do you stop yourself from turning into a screaming toddler or a cringey teen who punches holes in drywall?

I come from a healthy, loving family. I've never been abused by anyone. I'm also white and pretty well-off financially. I would like to not be the screaming spoiled brat that I act like. I truly believe that deep down, I can someday be a kind and tolerant person.",29Jun2020,2
49, I let one of my music friends that I've known for a couple years borrow my guitar amp. It's a $550 amp and he recently traded it in for his new guitar (admitted to me). He says he feels bad and would like to make it up for me. I told him to get my amp back but I'm not feeling confident that he will.

I [f19] have been in a relationship with my bf [m27] I’ll call him Colt, for about 3 months now but we were dating for 4 months before we became official. 

He’s the manager of an Oil company and he works long hours, but we always keep in contact. I have my own place but he likes for me to stay over his place a lot, even when he’s not there, which I don’t mind. He has a really nice big house. 

Today he got off of work early, which is really rare. We greeted each other and talked a little bit before I went to go shower. While I was in the shower, Colt joined me and started trying to be sexual with me. I got uncomfortable about it and asked him to get out. FYI He and I are not sexually active. While we we’re dating I told him that I was celibate and he seemed very happy for me and respected it. He got out of the shower, I got out maybe 10 minutes after that. I walked back into the bedroom, Colt started calling me ungrateful and saying that he does everything for me, basically really upset that I kicked him out of the shower with me. I’ve been celibate for almost two years, when he got in the shower with me it just kind of scared me, being that he’s only seen me naked twice before and 1 of those times was an accident.

I didn’t mean for him to get upset but this was established before I started even staying the night over his place. He hasn’t really spoken to me since then, except little comments here and there. I like him a lot I don’t want to end things. I guess what I’m asking is should I just give him what he wants? Was I too harsh about it?

62,"I'm going to start this post off by saying that first of all, I feel terrible for letting politics come between me and my friend, and for letting it affect my opinion of him as a person. But I find it extremely difficult lately, with everything going on in this country, to just let it go.

I met my friend about a year ago, we bonded over dealing with a similar situation in our lives, and became fast and close friends. To give you an idea, he considers me as a sister to him. And honestly, he's a great guy with a big heart and is very thoughtful and caring towards his friends and family, and has only ever shown me love and support.

So, one day last year, he brought up the fact that he supports Trump. My immediate reaction to this was a little bit of shock and disappointment, but I tried to keep an open mind. We had a talk about it, and decided to agree to respect each others views and keep politics out of our conversations, seeing as we have quite a differing stance on things.

Over time though, it has become harder and harder for me to accept his views. I'm sure most of you can imagine why, given the state of things in the US. Fast forward to Covid spreading through our country, and we're chatting one evening and he decides to bring up his thoughts on Trump's handling of Covid, and how happy he has been with it. My immediate reaction was, once again, a bit of shock, and I quickly became uncomfortable and told him that I disagree and that I don't think we should talk about it, so we moved on. I should add that this isn't the first time he's broken the rule of not bringing up politics.

2020 has been quite a hectic year for everyone, and now more than ever it's getting more and more concerning how things are looking in our country. I am having a hard time prying myself from the news since it's been such a trainwreck lately that it's hard to stop watching, and almost every day there's some new scandal coming from Trump and his administration. Every time I read the news, I can't help but wonder what my friend is thinking, as he stands by and openly supports this man, and it's eating me up inside and causing me a lot of stress and frustration.

Every day I want to ask him what he thinks about this news article or this happening or if he still supports Trump, but I hold my tongue, for fear of things getting uncomfortable between us, or for fear of learning that he still is turning a blind eye to everything going on. 

It's gotten to the point now where I just can't really stomach being his friend much anymore, and this is why I opened the post with saying that I feel terrible for letting this come between us. He doesn't know how I feel though, and I'm afraid to tell him. 

I feel like the obvious choice here is to just ask him, with an open mind and genuine curiosity, what he thinks, so that I can at least know for sure how he feels. I'm just so afraid of hearing what he has to say and ending up feeling even more put off from being friends with him.

Here’s some of my problems that I think can be classified as symptoms:?
-It takes me really long to actually make eye contact with someone. When I first meet people, it’s impossible for me to look them in the eyes. 
-Whenever I’m around a crowd, I get really hot and sweaty. Sometimes my hands shake. 
-I can’t stand being alone in public because I feel like everyone is watching me, and they’ll think that I’m just some loser who’s alone. At school, whenever I go anywhere, even to my locker, I need someone to be with me. 
-I rarely raise my hand in class, but when I do, I have to work out everything I wanna say for nearly 10 minutes. And even after I say it, I can’t stop thinking about how I messed up somehow. 
-In my mind, there’s never enough time for anything, even though I know there is. I have a schedule I follow every day, and I become really stressed when something interferes. 
-I can’t stand presenting/public speaking. I know many people get nervous about this, but my hands and knees shake so bad, and sometimes even my face twitches from nerves. I also feel like I’m going to throw up, before I speak. 
-I’m terrified of people in general, but I can’t bring myself to talk to people that I consider “popular.”
-I’m constantly invalidating myself, and saying how others hate me, and I’m a horrible person and useless. All my thoughts are so irrational, but they consume me sometimes. 

Sorry for the long list, but what do you guys think? Does it sound like an anxiety disorder, or just average nervousness (I didn’t list everything, but just the more general ones). Also, if it does look like a disorder, how do I seek help? I can’t even imagine trying to tell my parents. 
Any help would be appreciated!",29Jun2020,1
74,"My(23F) younger brother(21) is in a relationship with my stepsister(17) who lives with us every other week. He shares a room with my other two brothers and I share with her. They started sneakily seeing each other a year ago, and stopped hiding about 9 months ago. Just to lessen the judgement, we weren’t raised together as siblings and only started living together a month or two before they started dating. My dad, who was raised in a religious Mexican household, doesn’t approve. My stepmom, who grew up in a more open household, doesn’t see any issues and fully supports them. They’ve been fighting about this issue since they found out and it’s been causing a lot of tension. At first I stayed out of it, but now I’m getting dragged into it all bc my stepmom is starting to complain about my boyfriend and I. It started off small, her saying he should come around or complaining about where he parked while he was waiting for me. Then it got worse. She calls us sketchy for hanging out in his car and comes outside multiple times just to stare. Even though my dad said he doesn’t mind him coming in my room, she sent me a text telling me he couldn’t. She’ll complain when I go out with him and she even started tracking my location to see if we’re going on expensive dates. Its been giving me a lot of anxiety so I talked to my cousin about moving in with her, 2 hours away. When I brought it up to my dad, he told me not to leave. He said she was just upset about my brother and stepsister and since she lost control of that situation she’s getting on my case. It’s still not fair on me and all of the stress is affecting my relationship. I’m just not sure what to do if I’m not even the real reason she’s being like this.",29Jun2020,1
75,"We have a dog named Callie (the one in my pfp actually) and she is an amazing dog. She is super smart, playful, and gorgeous, but my mom is slowly killing her with human food.

As you can imagine, Callie is very overweight and unhealthy because of all the human food. She has grown a rather large lump on her tail, which I am assuming is from all the food she gets, but it could be something else (I want to take her to the vet but my mom doesn't want to). Ive talked to my mom about the issue, but she just says ""it's hard to not give her food"" or ""I feel bad if I'm the only one eating"" and basically plays the victim. I've tried everything to stop giving her human food, but she just plays the victim and makes excuses (like that her giving Callie human food every damn day isnt the main cause of her obesity. It 100% is). I even offer to take Callie out of the room so my mom doesn't feel the need to feed her, but no, she didnt want that to happen. What can I do to persuade her to stop giving Callie human food? As you can tell I am very frustrated with her attitude towards the whole situation and disregard she has for Callie's health.

79,"My late teens and early 20s were a very rough time. I made just about every wrong decision possible. Drugs, sex, booze, petty crime, you name it. I've hurt many of the people I cared the most about and that's left me alone. I've turned my life around over the last half decade but I'm still filled with nothing but regret and guilt, unable to feel any satisfaction in my accomplishments so far. I'm bitter, angry, and I have trouble letting new people into my life. I've heard most people see themselves as the heros of their own stories. I dont. I see myself as the villain in everyone elses story. It feels like my soul has a stain on it. I'm afraid of myself sometimes. I worry that the impulsive version of me who hurt those around him without even realizing it was the true me, and that if I lose control of this tight discipline I've imposed on my life I'll hurt people again. All the easy to find advice says I need to learn to forgive myself but thats something I've never been able to do. I don't understand it. I'm afraid of living the rest of my life like this and winding up a bitter lonely old man dieing alone.I don't like being this way, but I find it impossible to let go of the mistakes in my past.

81,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not exactly the most appealing SO. I'm physically unattractive (extensive burn scarring, fat), have several mental illnesses (Anxiety, Schizophrenia), have negative money, no significant career prospects, am unable to be physically 'intimate' with a partner, and I have a lung condition that is steadily killing me. I don't have much to offer in a relationship, which begs the question: is it fair to ask anyone to even consider being in a relationship with me? It would likely be a very difficult time, as I have difficulty with social interactions and would be nothing but a drain on their finances. I am also likely to be permanently hospitalized by my 40s and never see my 50s. How could I even consider putting my burden on someone else's shoulder?

Not attempting to get into a relationship is the most straightforward choice, though I dread the prospect for the loneliness. Should I simply accept the fact that it would be kinder to others for me to die alone?

83,"I (18F) believe I’ve been struggling with mental illness for many years. This began in from an extremely young age, throwing temper tantrums and screaming at my family. This came to a head when I was around 11 and my mom took me to therapy, the therapist suggested I had depression on the first visit and my mom called her a quack and never took me back. I began struggling more in 8th grade and began to cut and burn myself. I came to my parents then that I had suicidal thoughts and it was a lot for me to open up about. My mom dismissed me and said it was normal, but if I really wanted therapy that bad they would take me. 

They never followed up until about 2 years later when I would refuse to go to school and have breakdowns often about hating school (I was an A+ student). I just hated being there everyday, hated waking up, hated homework, felt no joy. I went to a woman who diagnosed me with general anxiety but once again my parents refused to medicate me. Her exercises didn’t help me at all and I eventually stopped going after a few months. After this time, from then to now I gained about 40 pounds and have lost half of that. My self image has always been awful and I hate myself. I struggle with suicidal thoughts and am sad every day. I almost lost my university admission senior year because I started smoking weed everyday to try to cope with the pain I felt. My average dropped 20%. I truly believe that everyone around me dislikes me and I’m a burden. I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with me that is unfixable. I have no ambitions or motivations and feel as though there is nothing to look forward to. 

Because I have constantly brought up that I know something is wrong with me and I want to be medicated my parents now refuse to talk about it and get mad when I bring it up. I used to want to be a doctor and now I have to go to university for biomed which is the absolute last thing I want to do. I hate school and want to do nothing for the rest of my life.

First time posting

I live in a country club in the suburbs for context. So I have a friend group of about 5-6 people I know it doesn’t seem like a lot but where I live it is. Growing up I had a good relationship with them and got along but as we got older they started to distance me at first I kinda went along with it but then high school started and they wouldn’t even talk to me and would go the other way if they saw me coming. So I can ignored them and like that I had no friends where I live. I have friends at school but I only see them at school. I cant go out with them or do all of the things friends do because all I ever see them is during school. So I asked them why they dont want to be friends with me and they said that “your too childish” so I act a little uptight then they say that “I am too serious” what am I supposed to do about that I am a only child who matured at the age of 12 and for some reason cant relate to anyone in my town because I am a teenage boy who doesn’t like any kind of sports who cant even talk to anyone and make new friends because if I even try to no matter what I say it only makes them to hate me more. 

Its not like I cant talk to people its just since our community and school is so small and I am always the laughing stock of my town because of rumors that everyone thinks are real every time I talk to someone they always remember me as the person who cant do anything so I cant even talk to people because of this preconceived notion that I am a bad person and the friends that I have at school only talk to me so they can get answers to the homework or if there is nobody else to talk to. I know that in a year I will go yo college and be done with and I have been waiting for 5 years to graduate high school and go to collage across the country so I never have to see anyone in my town ever again. 

I still have 2 more years until I can go to collage and I dont know what I am going to do until then. I know after 2 years I can get a fresh start across the country and no one will know who I am and I will be able to hopefully make some friends. But it will be hard because I have trust issues now and it takes time for me to let people in because I fear that if I let someone in they will betray me. So can someone give me some advice on how I can make it through the next 2 years trying to be less humiliated and maybe repair whatever social life I have in this town.",29Jun2020,1

So about 8 months ago me and the girl I’ll refer to as “C” became friends now her and I work together along with her boyfriend. I knew going into the friendship she had a boyfriend but I didn’t see her in that way just as a friend. Well long story short her and I have gotten to know one another in the time we’ve been friends and she has pretty musk here from the get go called me her bestie. I didn’t and still don’t really think I’m her actual bestie but nonetheless I’ve come to value her friendship and sadly I think I’ve started developing deeper feelings for her. I’ve kept those feelings in check and haven’t allowed them to influence any advice I’ve given her about her boyfriend when she’s asked what to do. I’ve also kept how I feel about her boyfriend to myself because I know she gets a lot of flak about him from work, family, and other friends. So rather than tell her that I’m not the guys biggest fan and that I don’t think it’s a healthy relationship. In case your wondering I don’t think it’s a healthy relationship because on multiple occasions he’s flirted with other girls in front of her, talks about better time with other girls, refuse to admit his female friends bullying her even though he’s seen them do it, doesn’t say anything about his friend who takes pics of her threw security cameras and send them to her with captions like “I hope to see you on your knees sometime” and shows her unsolicited d pics, and he doesn’t seem to care about her well being at all. What I mean by he doesn’t seem to care about her well being is work treats her and only her quite badly because of their relationship due to the fact they have supposedly been caught making out at work and you’d think they’d punish both of them but no just her by not allowing her to talk to anyone without getting reported. When she told him that when someone is seen talking to her the our bosses are told and have to deal with it treated her like she had a highly contagious disease by backing up and say “I don’t want to get in trouble” before walking away she then cried in the bathroom for about 40 minutes and she told me what happened. These are only a few examples of things he does that make it seem like an unhealthy relationship furthermore she has trouble saying no to people especially him so at work she wants to go home but since she doesn’t drive she gets a ride well she gets off before him he asks her to stay and since she cants say no she stays and has told she doesn’t like staying. She has also said she doesn’t like telling him what she tells me about how she feels when they’re fighting or when he does stuff like I previously said because she’s worried he’ll breakup with her. So I suppose the question I’m asking is have I been doing the right thing by not telling her my opinion on what she should think about doing?",29Jun2020,1
90,"for as long as i can remember, my brother (18) and i (17) have never physically had contact with one another. like we live together and see each other everyday, but even as kids we NEVER  fought each other, or even arm wrestled. the only time we've touched is when we accidentally bump into each other, or if im giving him something and our hands touch, once again, accidental. we hardly ever get into arguments, we just disagree at times (as siblings do). is anyone else like this?


also, its not that i want to be physically close with him because its never bothered me before, but the thought just crossed my mind whether its normal or not. it seems like all of my friends are the exact opposite with their brothers, im just making sure that we have an overall healthy relationship. thanks :/",29Jun2020,1
91,"This has obviously been a work in progress. I was born during my dad's third/most recent/longest lasting marriage (my parents are now divorced; bet ya didn't see that one coming...), but during my dad's second marriage, he had a son, my half-brother who I'll call ""X"". My dad must have left his second wife, X's mom, when X was young because we're only around 11 years apart. 

Doing a lot of mental digging with my mom, now divorced from my dad, has proven that I was around 4/5 when the incident occurred which made X 14/15 y/o at the time. Because it happened when I was so young, I began to recall the incident more clearly around middle school after I saw the piece of furniture it happened on causing the memory to come flooding back in bits and pieces; I guess going through a traumatic incident can cause parts of your brain to literally block off those memories/pictures until certain images/sensory things help recall the trauma? 

Anyways, I'm not going to get detailed about what happened because 1) I'm worried about my anonymity and 2) I don't have very many concrete details besides fragments and persistent uncomfortable feelings around the area of my body that it happened on. I've struggled immensely with the idea that my trauma is fictional and a figment of my brain due to the lack of evidence of my molestation as well as the lack of support and acknowledgment from X, his mother, and pretty much everyone except my mother. When I began to recall the incident, my mom eventually confronted my father who was sort of oblivious to the situation and still is. I love my dad but he tends to avoid/forget what I've gone through both mentally and physically; it's just who he is. He initially said that he'd be willing to sit down with us if I confronted X, but of course that was a really scary and overwhelming idea for me. 

My mom and I both remember how shortly after being molested that I, still 4/5 at the time, casually mentioned to her after she came home from work one afternoon that X and I ""did something"" in a certain room of our home. My mom knew something was up; she was a social worker. She had a woman come in and sit me down so that I could point on a chart of a girl's body where I had been touched. I remember all of this pretty clearly. Because there was no evidence, the molestation wasn't documented well and therefore sorta swept under the rug. My mom attempted to contact X's mom in order to talk to her about what had happened in addition to confronting X about what I said and whether or not he did anything. No one really supported her, and thus the estrangement of our family began. The unhealthy relationship between my dad and his kids from his previous marriage came between my mom and eventually the end of the marriage (much needed divorce).

Years later and here I am. In my past teen years I avoided X the best I could. But now he has a daughter, my niece, and I'm just now coming to terms with the idea of being an aunt. My dad babysits her from time to time, and just in the last month have I really spent some time with her when X or his wife drops her off. However, I can't see myself having a healthy relationship with her, X, or X's super sweet wife (my sister-in-law) without eventually confronting X. 

With confrontation comes the fear of denial and the complete severance of a potential relationship with any of them. I can never get over what happened to me, but I want to be present for my niece. I have considered forgiving X even if I don't really forgive him to try to get him to admit what he's done. I'm lost and I find myself growing more and more anxious since I've talked to X and his wife recently due to my dad babysitting their daughter. Been to 3 therapists, one of them when I was younger who specialized in adolescent trauma. I want to know what you would do. I need some kind of closure, and I don't want to wait until he's on his deathbed or I'm on mine. 

TL;DR: I want to eventually confront my molester (to be able to have a healthy relationship with my niece and maybe sister-in-law) but I'm nervous about what will happen to my family/his family if things go awry.",29Jun2020,0
92,"I'm 30 years and old and still a virgin and obviously struggle with self-confidence and insecurity issues to this day. I've never actively sought out therapy, although looking back I definitely should have. I would also say I have/had body dysmorphia or some degree of it cause I believed I was unattractive when that was not true. 

The reason why I;m writing this is I was starting to turn my life around recently by hanging out with friends again and have even gone on a few dates for the first time ever. But around the same time, I started losing a lot of hair, and hair was always something I'd consider my best feature. I took my hair for granted and hated myself for other reasons.

93,"(throwaway because a few of my friends follow my main account)

To give you a bit of backstory, I have a close group of friends that I've known for the past 2 and a half years, and we have been getting really close since November, we met online through vrchat and discord. I have this one person who has shown me actual appreciation and love for the first time in my life. Since I'm from a conservative posh British family, love isn't really the first concern.

Recently me and her have been getting close as friends, spending nights talking about meeting up, a cabin trip we have planned for our group and talking about stuff. however there is another person who is closer to her as he told me serious shit about her that she hasn't told me herself. (Abuse/rape). And she generally spends most of her time with him, which i don't mind personally,

It's just the fact is that she told me that she loves me, even if it is as friends. We both have spent countless hours together, and told eachother we appreciate and love eachother as friends. But whenever I fuck up by me being overly anxious or overly worried, she literally pretends I don't exist, not responding to my dms, not reacting to posts I make, while responding to posts above and below mine, going offline when I come online, it's just driving me crazy.

It's happened twice before, both times we made up and became better friends because of it. (one because the before mentioned friend got friendzoned by her and I made a joke about it, and just a couple weeks ago I asked her about her saying stuff about me with other people, and she blanked me for a week) and however recently it happened, my other two friends were talking to her on dms and she said that it was because I apologize to her about stuff that was already sorted and that I was being sorry for stuff and apparent that was the reason she's been ignoring me for the past few days. 

I just don't know what to do, I can't appogize to her about apologising to her. She's giving me so much mixed emotions, and I've grown too attached to her to leave her. Even though all my friends agree that I'm in the right, I can't help but feel guilty.",29Jun2020,1

Now, any time my Dad buys more food, he will tell me I'm not allowed to eat certain foods because I ""ate it all last time"". I know for a fact that my Step-Siblings have been eating all the food.

95,"A little background on me and my parents. I am 18NB and about to go off to college, but before I go, I want to come out to my parents. I identify as both bisexual and nonbinary which means my preferred pronouns are they/them, though I will still answer to she/her. My parents are pretty okay regarding LGBTQ+, though both face struggles with internalized homophobia (something I also had to battle while figuring out I was queer). They both are people who “can’t agree but can’t say no” type thing. While they believe people are born gay (but just shouldn’t get married) they don’t agree with someone who is trans/NB/gender-fluid etc. and believe it IS a choice. Financially depending on them is not a problem, as I had already planned on paying for college myself and taking out some student loans (though I’ve been in the process of saving for a while and already have a job lined up at my new college).

97,"For context: me (f21), my mom (f57), my sister (f32) and her finance (m28) are all living together for the summer. My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer about 4 years ago, and was given 4 months to live. It’s a miracle she’s lived this long, however the cancer has spread to her brain. She already had bipolar depression and anxiety. It was rough growing up, but we got along fine most of the time. 

My mother was told she was not fit to live in her assisted living facility anymore after she accidentally set a fire while she was confused. We either had to find her a nursing home (would not allow her cat) or stay at my sisters apartment. We obviously wanted her to be happy, so we moved her into my sisters spare room, and I would stay the summer to take care of her. She is paying me $400 a month to help her with her meds, cleaning the appt, and getting her food. 

This is where the problems start. I have to sleep on the couch in the living room, because there are no other rooms. The living room is connected to my mothers room. My mother insists on staying up to the wee hours of the morning. I try to get her to go to bed at a reasonable time by giving her melatonin, however lately she has been refusing it. She comes out multiple times early in the morning (2am, 4am, etc) to look through the fridge (the kitchen is right next to the living room.) she often falls during these nightly trips, and I have to get up and help her. She gets mad at me for asking her to go to bed, and we fight about it loud enough that my sister wakes up. I feel like I’ve been getting no sleep.

She also is a bad hoarder. I try to clean her room once in a while, but she just makes a mess again, so I gave up. She is really mad at me for not cleaning her room more, but I am just not patient enough for that. 

She also constantly asks me for more of her Ridellan. She cry’s, begs, threatens to kill herself, and so much more when she feels like she needs more. She is prescribed 2.5 a day, and often tries to find them in the house and take 10+ at once. I’m going crazy and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m not saying I’m the nicest person. I’m a difficult roommate. I have to sleep at a certain time, get alone time, and go out. I have been able to do none of that so far. I’m going crazy and being mean to everyone. 

Because of this, I’ve not been the nicest to my mom. I’m getting irritated so easily, which sets her off. We fight about everything; what we eat, what we do, how long the fridge is open, how long it takes me to get her food, etc. It’s driving everyone in the house crazy. I’m not sure what to do, because I try to be nice to her (she gets really confused and emotional sometimes) but she constantly berates me, causing me to berate her, and the cycle continues. I know it’s up to me to be the nicer person, but I feel like I’m just not at that maturity level yet. Moving out is not an option because my sister works full time, her fiancé is in med school, and my mom is not supposed to be alone for that long. None of us are happy. I just don’t know what to do.",29Jun2020,0

I have a job as a lab tech/supervisor. It's a fun job, but I dont get paid well at all and HR is ignoring harassment complaints from me. A lot of people who've worked there 10+ years are applying elsewhere as well for similar issues.  There's another company nearby who is known to be a generally good employer and pay reasonably well, and I could apply for my exact same position. 

The problem is that there is someone I know works there, in the position I'd want, who I have a strong mutual dislike for. There a man who was convicted for molesting his barley teenaged daughter, and is still serving time to this day. I was friends with his daughter. His wife and son decided that the only logical thing to do was victim blame and hate his daughter, saying she must have seduced him and was an evil person for turning him in. I've fallen out of touch, but I was friends with the daughter around this time, and did my best to be a good friend to her. Person I don't like, is the son of the pedophile and brother of the girl. He hates me on principle because I didnt decide to hate her, and also didn't decide to welcome dear old dad with an open heart and mind when he wrote a story to the church where we all met saying how nice being incarcerated was, and that he had changed and repented. 

A lot of people there thought he was the greatest thing ever. I did not, and left that church shortly after. Some of the members had the nerve to show up at my brother's funeral this past August to tell me how great this family is doing and where son worked, then start insulting my brother. I asked them to leave. They did not, but didn't approach the rest of my family at least. 

So. Do I leave my job, where I'm activley being harassed and threatened in a sinking ship, and go to another job where someone who already works there hates me? Any ideas?",29Jun2020,3
100,"Sorry if this post is a little scrambled it's just I have a lot going on right now. I have one more semester to go to college before I graduate. I live with my parents. My father is the type of person that whenever a situation arises he just wants to stifle the conversation. He doesn't want to resolve anything and just stays quiet. My mother and father fight a lot. Ever since I was young they fight almost every three to four days about something. This leaves me in the crosshairs of whoever is angry with the other. Usually, my mother is the one I spend almost all of my time with. Whenever she gets angry then she takes it out on me by treating me like crap. I put up with this because I am going to school and have most things paid for. The problem is though this behavior has gotten worse from both of them making it very hard to live with them. Especially my mother. I have to walk on eggshells whenever I spend time with her. Any little thing that she may disagree with will start a fight if I bring it up. Little things like talking about current events will trigger her. So I generally try to just agree with her and stay clear from her triggering topics. She spends an extreme amount of time on Facebook so I am guessing this is where she is becoming so angry. I am thinking about joining the military just to get out of my situation. I haven't had any previous work experience or any savings. This was the deal that she made me agree to if I were to stay at home to get an education. It was either go to college and be on your own with no help whatsoever or stay at home and don't work. Whenever I start to have some sort of social life there is contention in the home. There are always fights that startup whenever I start to have someone in my life or have some activities. I can't even have pleasant conversations with people when we go out otherwise there will be an attitude. I have confronted her on her taking her anger out on me but she never owns up to it and changes her behavior but she admits that she does it. If I do something that's not to her standards or liking she makes godawful faces or snide remarks. If I do the same to her then a fight erupts. Therapy is not an option for the family. Just today we had a fight about the same issues. She instead starts to fake cry and threatens to leave the family. When I try to talk and reason she twists my words and walks away. I am tired. I have put up with this for far too long. I have one semester of college left but I do not know if I can make it. I literally am at a breaking point. I want to get away from both of them even though I have a decent life I am not living my life if that makes any sense. Thanks for anything you guys have to offer. Sorry for the long post.",29Jun2020,1
101,"Okay so I am a 17 year old girl and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my future. I've narrowed it down between two options and I need advice or input on them from people not biased by knowing me. I'm trying to decide between going to college at the University of Arkansas to study poultry science and become a mail carrier.

Pros and cons of college, the college is close to me, the program is excellent and I would be make 6 figures within 10 years of graduating there. The job placement is 100%. My dad really wants me to go. I would be ok with a job in this field. 
Cons, I'm not sure if I want to study for 4 more years of my life, I'm homeschooled and not sure how I would do in a classroom setting, the program is really hard. Big con: I might have to live in a town for this job and I want to live in the countryside on a farm.

The other option, I'm considering just become a mail carrier after getting my GED. I would have hours of 7-3ish and be making about $45,000 a year, which according to google would put me in the middle class. (I don't know a lot about how much money do you need to make to live a comfortable life so financial advice is super welcome). I would also have good benefits. My mom supports either decision. I can live pretty much anywhere because everyone needs mail.

Cons, it makes considerably less and my dad will be disappointed. I'm afraid that I will regret not going to college or having the college experience and I won't have college qualifications for jobs.

Other things to consider, I want to raise sheep. I've grown up around them and know how to take care of them and with the amount of sheep I want I'll be making about $15,000 a year on them so that would add to my mail carrier salary. I also want to get married and have 2 kids. Growing up my parents weren't always around a lot in my life because of work and I really want to be able to be there for my kids and spend time with them. I also want to make enough that I can provide for my kids (like if they have any extracurricular activities they want to do or go to college). Can a mail carrier provide this? I would definitely have plenty of time to spend with them.

109,"I've been struggling with what I deny to be a ""mummy issue"" to this very day. (18F)

My mother has been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Severe Depression from the time I was born. When she stresses or panics, she lashes out by screaming and yelling in an angry way. Originally, I thought I could deal with her by finding sources for narcississtic parents. I believed she fit the description as blame is always shifted off of her and onto others in the family unit, but I began to realise with time that it might not be the right idea as I discovered she has a crippling guilt complex that makes confrontation a huge issue. The verbal assault has been frequent since the time I was in elementary school, becoming relentless by the time I was in high school. The progression is the same for my brother who is six years younger, and even worse for my father, whom she has been married to for twentyish years. I will be off to college come august, but due to the pandemic I will have to come back home by thanksgiving. I thought college would be my escape from this extremely stressful environment, and now, I can no longer see where the end goal is. Leaving the house is improvement already, but if I cut her off completely, I'm scared she might take drastic action.

This is my first job so I don't know anything about work. 
 But it still feels wrong?

 I'm a housekeeper at my town's resort. I was able to get the job because the previous months, I had volunteered at their Halloween event and was already known by the staff. 

 Because I was having issues finding work, I decided to take them up on their offer. Plus the manager of the housekeeping department said she often had employees with mental illness so it wouldn't be an issue making certain exceptions for me if I was struggling. 

 I wanted the experience and to learn how to properly clean when I get my own house so I was excited to start and began within a week of sending in my application. 
 It was fine at first while I was in training but I quickly realized that I wasn't actually getting any of the benefits I had been promised. 

 There was a few times I was forced to go in early and start working without clocking in so I wouldn't be paid for it, as I wasn't actually on the schedule but the manager had me go in early. 

 Still, it didn't bother me, because I was getting money. 
 I'm not allowed to sit down and rest, despite having arthritis in my back and being in so much pain I can barely walk. I've expressed I have back issues and can't do heavy lifting all the time and need to sit down for a few minutes often, but I was rejected anyway, saying that if I wanted to sit down, I would need to schedule 10 minute breaks. 
 Which is understandable but a few of the times feel unreasonable. 

 I often get scolded for standing idle after I finish everything I was assigned, and given miscellaneous work just so I can't take a break after not sitting down for hours.

 Still, I didn't think anything of it but the most recent events make me uncomfortable. 
 I keep my phone on me as an emotional crutch during the day. I never take it out unless I'm on break, given permission, or idle. 

 A lot of times, we need more supplies and have to sit and stare into space while the coworkers deliver it. It's times like those I pull out my phone and listen to a quick song or something. 

 Even when I'm given permission at times, I still get scolded after taking it out. 

 When I get warnings, I feel I understand them, and yet I've started getting warnings without reason. 

 I've stood in place waiting for a new task, and suddenly the manager has turned around and yelled at me to get off the phone I wasn't on, the manager reporting me to the head boss for having my phone out when she was having a bad day, and a co-worker vouching that I never had it out, but I got a warning anyway. 

 And just today, I put it in my employee locker to prove I don't use it during work, and not even an hour after doing it, the manager came in and demanded I get off it and hand my phone over. 

 I feel like someone is out to get me, falsely reporting me to get me written up or fired, and on top of everything else, I'm not sure if the feeling is just or selfish. 
 It's my first job, so I don't know if this is bad or not. 
 I tried asking for a department change but the head boss denied my request, so I'm unable to leave the housekeeping department.",29Jun2020,1
122,"i grew up in a family that struggled financially until i was in high school. the message that was drilled into us as kids was: don't be too ambitious and don't ever take risks in life, because if you do you'll fail spectacularly and irreparably and end up alone and homeless. they clearly had a lot of fear and stress and lacking beliefs about money and passed that on to us as kids. whenever I had some crazy idea (or even just a goal that could improve my life or something that I wanted to try) - I was always discouraged from attempting anything and lectured about how success in life is just having a roof over your head and being able to shop for groceries at the store, and that wanting anything more was foolish and prideful and would lead to failure, as if there was no other possible outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

as an adult, I consciously reject that mindset, but I haven't been able to get beyond it on a subconscious level. I have a massive amount of fear and anxiety about taking any sort of risks at all, which has led to missing out on countless opportunities and spending most of my life stuck in situations that seem ""safe"" but aren't at all what I actually want, and I justify staying (mostly related to jobs/income, because my greatest fears are about money for obvious reasons) because ""it's better than taking a risk and ending up homeless and alone and having nothing"". i just turned 31 and i feel like i haven't lived because i've never tried to achieve anything that I really wanted. (It doesn't help that a lot of the things I want to achieve probably are pretty crazy - i.e. one of my dreams for ages has been to start an online business and earn enough from it to be able to move to Ireland.) I really envy people who are bold enough to take risks and trust themselves and their intuition.

and the irony is that most of the jobs and things that i've pursued because they seem safe and secure actually aren't. My current ""safe"" job just cut my hours in half. (my job also involves working with aged and sick people everyday, and hearing patients talk about the things they regret not doing in life and realising that it's too late for them tears me up.)

I always fear the worst-case scenario and I don't trust myself to land on my feet and succeed.  but i am exhausted and incredibly frustrated at living like this, always holding myself back and spending my life wondering ""what if?"" I want to change this mindset, and get rid of the fear and anxiety and learn to trust myself - but i genuinely have no idea how to do this or where to start. I've tried traditional therapy/CBT, psychedelics (please don't judge; i trip very infrequently and have had nothing but positive experiences and they've actually really helped me to have breakthroughs and mindset changes about other things), books about changing your beliefs and mindset, hypnotherapy, and nothing has really worked so far.

Any advice for how to learn to trust yourself and become more comfortable taking risks? Anything that's worked well for you, if you've struggled with the same thing? Many thanks in advance.",29Jun2020,1
123,"I feel like the title might be a bit over dramatic but honestly I feel like it the truth sometimes. Like I know they love me, but I feel like I'm the outcast of the family. I've always felt like on the the outside of friend groups, and havent ever really belonged anywhere. it's only one on one with a few people that I actually fell like I belong. Out of my extended family I'm the second youngest out of the actual grandchildren, second only because my brothers younger, the rest of the cousins are all adults in there 20s and 30s, and they're children are all babies or little kids, which while they're cool and all, and I love them, I always feel out of place. 

On my cross country team, which I dearly love, I still feel like I'm on the sidelines, I'm not very good, my PR is the tale end of the boys races, and my brother ended up joining the team last year, so it's no longer really ""mine"". prior to that I had been running for 5 years, it was ""my"" sport, to not have it be, stung. And on top of that I have no will to actually run this summer, despite that fact I want to and I know I should, but i cant help but compare myself to everyone else, we can all see the miles on strava that we've run, and I hate myself for not doing so more, and for not having the will, which spirals into a self defeating cycle I don't know how to get out of. 

I've never found solace in the theater kids or the band kids. I enjoy piano, and I love doing the behind the strange work, but when I tried to join, I lasted one day and immediately left because the director wasted 2 or 3 hours of time, have the strange crew sit and do nothing (litterally nothing, we weren't allowed to use our phones) and then after dinner go and actually do shit. I was mad. 

and honestly I could go on and on. But I'm not an extrovert, and have anxiety (I'm pretty sure? I got diagnosed with it when I was 10, according to my mom, but it was one visit and the dude never even talked to me, just my mother) and so I'm not really good at meeting new people. But I also just feel like my parents dont care? like very much anyways for example:

They litterally refused to do anything about the bug problem that's been going on  for over a week until I ask my mom to look at the back of my knee and turns out they're was a large cluster of spider bites. And this was dispite the fact id try making it they're problem by making them take care of the larger ones (in reality my dad probably only took care of a 1/4 the actually amount. and it got to a point I've been loosing sleep over it. 

Hell I've once had a straight up mental break down and they'd said they'd discuss therapy but I'd have to find a therapist that's compatible with are insurance, except I dont know how to do that. I ended up getting lightbulbs that look like sunlight and put on birth control, which helps mood swings but has done absolute jack shit for what cause the mental breakdown in the first place, and I'm this point I'm litterally loosing the will to take them which is equally bad. But I feel nauseous everytime I take them, or I'll forget they even exist for days on end.

Speaking of therapy, I probably desperately need it. There was a traumatic incident 3 years back with my grandparents and aunt, I wont go into detail but my aunt had my mom pinned to the floor trying to drunkenly punch her. (she was fine though, my mom was in the army and said she probably let her get onto the ground because she could fight better that way) but neither me or my brother got any form of therapy for it. They've also never had any reaction to any time I've ever said I had a panic attack. I also used to go to the school counselor, but when I moved to high school I'm apparently not eligible for what is basically a therapist via the school because my parent make too much. 

Honestly I've said several time over felt depressed and theres never really anything done. this might partly be my fault because how do you explain you've felt this ways for years. Litterally at least since I was 10, though i didn't know how to explain it at the time. I remember being in a group with a counselor, and asking everyone to discribe how they were feeling that day, I knew I was feeling ""happy"" or ""sad"" but nothing else ever seemed accurate. So I simply said I felt content everytime. I suppose it makes sense? how do you discribe what is most likely depression, when you don't even know such a thing exists, and dont have the emotions to discribe it. I've long suspected I've had depression, or ADD or both, (ADD mostly because I have a horrible attention span, and zone out or get distracted really easily, among reasons) 

sorry this got kinda ranty, but I guess just, how can I get my parent to notice, i feel like they should be able to help me, not just because they're adults, but because they used to be social workers, its litterally was they're job, and yet they dont even notice in they're own daughter things that are obviously wrong, and I dont know how to say it.",29Jun2020,2

132,"So as the title says, my best friend just moved out to Cali (from Virginia) with some guy she's been seeing for about a month now. So I should mention they did date before over three years ago (when she was still in HS) and they got engaged. Which was quickly ended when this same guy moved away and at the time cheated on her but now the story has changed and he broke up with her for someone else instead. I mean I've met the guy and he seems nice and all but that's not so much the concern.

The concern is more so that she has a pretty strong history of making hasty not too well thought out decisions that impact her heavily. She's half way through college rn at a pretty successful job and she's throwing it all away to move to cali with him (not to mention all the friends and connections and her sorority that she loves as well). I want to support her and see her happy (we all do) but we're concerned for her and her future, especially if things don't work out well for her. Which horribly to say we all don't have much faith in because she never lasts more than a couple months in a relationship, for various reasons. A slightly more concerning part is that she told no one until she actually did it and was there, almost knowing what we'd say.

And the whole time I'm questioning, am I being selfish for not wanting to lose my best friend or is she actually being ridiculous and putting her future on the line? Regardless I'm worried about her.

I guess I should add on I spoke to her briefly about it when she revealed that she moved and she kinda just dismissed it as no big deal.
She's coming back to visit for July 4th for about a week as well, so there's that.

A few minutes later I walked in to our bathroom and found a large amount of blood splatter all over the mirror, wall, floorboards, sink, etc. There was even a couple of drops on the ceiling. I called him in the bathroom freaked out for obvious reasons and he acted as though he has no idea where it came from and had only gone to the bathroom once that day and hadn’t seen it. I was genuinely confused and asking a million questions but he seemed to not be nearly as concerned as me. He let it go pretty easily but I just can’t.

so some context, me and my HS sweetheart broke it off after our senior year of HS in 2017. we just went our separate ways. say a year and a half later after that we chat again but just as friends since she had a new BF at the time. 

Me and her have also known each other since we were about 10. we have texted here and there send some snaps sometimes to each other. hanged out a few times just to eat catch up watch a movie, and about a month ago came over and hanged out with my family ( she was close to my family ). she is currently not seeing anyone atm and i’m single as well. 

Which brings me to my question, would it be wrong of me to ask her if she wanted to strictly hook up for a night? i’m off of work tomorrow and thought what if we hooked up for old times sake ? nothing really would be lost we’re not that super attached to each other anymore and our feelings are gone, so it would simply be a fun hook up.

150,"The brain is one of the smallest parts of the body,  it is considered the central processing unit in the human body, with this blessing the world witnessed several developments in various areas of life, so that we must preserve it and strive to develop it , Hence the importance necessary to strengthen memory, its very important part of the mind, so how we can do this ?

 1) Mental exercises:

  Memory is the same as the rest of the muscles in the body, it has exercises to strengthen it and let these exercises lead to its weakening, and one of the most famous of these exercises is its use, and what is meant here the more you use your memory and dispense with the things that prevent you from using your memory the more your ability and your strength to remember try to use your memory as much  Possible

 2) break the routine:

 Every person has his own routine. For example, you wake up at seven o'clock, prepare breakfast if you wear work clothes, go to work ......... until the end of the day.

 With time, this routine becomes a habit that you have that you can do day after day without even thinking  Prior to it, breaking the routine here means changing these actions in whole or in part, you change the time you wake up from sleep, you change the location of work clothes and others, breaking the routine leads to refreshing your thinking and urging you to use your memory more by remembering what you changed from your routine, so always try to break your routine to further strengthen your memory.

 3) Blogging:
 Blogging is one of the most important things in our life. Most of the old events were written down to ensure that they are not lost and even the events we live in now.

 We also write them down. Blogging is a successful way to remember things and not forget them, and blogging is something that strengthens your memory. By writing, you save and store information in your memory faster than  Just read the information just by looking.

Hry, everyone. I'm an 18 year old girl, and I just miss feeling anything at all. Since I'm a kid, I never cried (except when I was a baby). I never fealt Joy, sadness, excitement, disapointment, nothing. When I go out with friends, they start going away from me, because I'm never enjoying anything and they get tired of me. People around me die, everyone's crying, and I'm there just neutral. I've lost family members, a friend of mine died of cancer, and I couldn't bring myself to, at least, be sorry for her. I tried meeting new friends. Didn't work. If someone tells me something awful, I can't feel empathy for that person.  The only time I felt  something, was with my 1st and only boyfriend, which ended up killing himself in front of me, leaving me even worse than I was before. I was already bad, but anyway, moving on. I've gone to 6 therapists, nothing helps. My grand father died because of a disease, and I decided not to go to his funeral so people don't look at me, just neutral there. I have no motivations in life, I don't know what my Dream for the future is. I tried killing myself before, but my body was able to defend itself, and the pills didn't work because I woke up in the same place laying on the ground just fine. Yay, right? Not for me at least. I'm still here living as a deadbeat. I just want this to be over with. I've lost my hope

152,"Hello - hope you all are well :). Thank you for reading this I apologize as it is long.

I feel I need help responding to a situation I find myself in currently and I don’t know the best course of action right now.

I have a “friend” who was supposed to be helping me plan my baby shower. Coincidentally, she was also supposed to help me plan my wedding to my now husband. To not ramble off too much, my husband and I decided to elope after I found out I was pregnant unexpectedly. Because of this drastic life change for us, we have spent this whole year (I found out I was pregnant in February) buying a house, I am completing a new degree to provide better for our son, and just overall getting ready for this new addition amidst Covid. She was ecstatic to help plan my wedding so naturally, I asked her if she would like to help out with my baby shower and she was thrilled and agreed.

As time went on, we would chat and get ideas together and I would ask her a lot what she thought about decor, etc... I thought things were going smoothly and I was very grateful for help. Another helpful person, has been my mother in law, and has been working her behind off to help plan as well and is doing a great job making it amazing and stress-free. I of course had my friend and mother in law exchange numbers so they could keep in touch with ideas and such and I thought everything was okay and being handled while I could focus on getting our new house situated and completing my college courses. 

Well, unfortunately I just recently found out from my mother in law she has not been able to contact this friend at all about planning. It actually got to the point where she asked me if we were on good terms... I was so confused because I really thought things were going well and believed planning was underway. 

Time is now crunching down and I find myself scrambling to get this together, and I feel terrible that my mother in law has been blown off like this. On top of this debacle, this friend told her mother I would babysit her younger sister when I did not agree to that. 

So here I am feeling hurt and blindsided, as well as feeling like I am being thrown under the bus to drop everything and babysit. I asked this friend what happened and she basically blew up at me and said I quote “I don’t know who shit in your Cheerios”. I did not respond and have been spending time to myself trying not to stress out, as well as just moving on with planning this shower. 

After the “Cheerios” comment she sent me a message with a kind of back-handed apology... “I’m sorry you took what I said the wrong way BUT”...( makes comment about my husband and how it’s his fault she did not have my mother in law’s number?)

So... I am just confused, hurt, and I feel like this was a huge joke to her and I am in turn being used to babysit. I have not spoken to her since this text message and I honestly am at a loss for what to say. We all have a friend group so I feel like it’s even more awkward but I just don’t feel comfortable speaking to her right now until I calm down and gather my thoughts. I am being told conflicting stories such as I’m in the right to not respond even at all, but then I’m being told I need to forgive and forget.

Thank you all in advance for who reply.",29Jun2020,1

157,"Growing up I’ve always been extremely sexually active and have always tried to touch people because I was drawn to it. ( I know I’m disgusting but that’s how I grew up). I would touch anyone in my family ( when I was young ). I grew up with no one guiding me and my ex girlfriends cheating on me / treating me incorrectly. I would get fwb to forget. I was lost on what to do I was going to go to the army after high school until I met the girl of my dreams.

She was super nice to me and treated me with care love and respect. She is beautiful extremely smart and caring. She’s studying to be an aerospace engineer and she puts everyone in front of herself to help people. She helped me pick up my grades and find my self worth, because of her I’m in college studying mechanical engineering ( I’m a second year ) and I want to marry her and have a life with her but I’ve been messing up so bad and I don’t know why. We go to different schools but to me distance never made me want to cheat. We’ve been together for 2 years and 2 months. Everything I’m about to state she already knows. 

I have told her everything I’ve done bad so late. I started telling her all the nasty things I’ve done about 1 month ago.

- I cheated on her when we were two months with a girl she didn’t like me hanging out with. ( she was right on thinking something was up but trusted me because I lied to her ) 
- I would masturbate to every single girl I have met even her close friends. I don’t find them attractive they just come to mind.
- I was texting other girls when we were about 1-2 months.
- I would use my friends account to search up all the girls I was involved with in the passed out or curiosity ( she doesn’t believe that) 
- at my colleges club rush I saw this girl from high school that was known to sleep over. Since I thought she was easy I did think of cheating on my girlfriend with her. I don’t know why I did that... I love her but idk why I would even remotely think that. I didn’t do anything with her nor talk to her it was just a thought. 

I first told my girlfriend ( Ex girlfriend now ) about the cheating about 1 month ago and she was taking time to think it through bevause it was so far back and she was extremely hurt. Then I started remembering more things I did and felt guilty and just started saying every single thing I remembered to be honest with her. I’m doing this now because I don’t want to be that person anymore I want her to know everything and I want to be a better person overall. I’m trash, a man whore, anything you can think of. But I want to be better for her... I just messed up so much and I don’t even know why. Is this normal? Do all men do this? Or am I just complete utter trash? I don’t know if I should keep fighting for her. Seeing the look in her eyes when I told her, her tears broke me.. because I realized then that the small things I did ( not the cheating one, that one is huge ) really do hurt her. I need advice if I should fight for her and if someone has gone through similar experience?

TL;DR I messed up so badly with the girl of my dreams. I don’t know why I am the way I am. I want to change for the better I want to be someone she deserves. But I know I’m late. Do I keep trying or just move on?",29Jun2020,1

In 3 months to the day my rent will be coming to an end at my current apartment. My roommate is moving in with their sister, I will no longer have one and will not be able to afford my place. Seems easy enough to answer doesn't it? Just find somewhere cheaper to live or get a new roommate! Well it's a bit more intricate than that...

I don't have anyone who needs a roommate, I cant afford the month to month once it comes to a close. Job opportunities to get back into my field still aren't there where I live. I currently sell cars for a living, shockingly enough it is steady work and I pay my bills on time. In 3 months I have to make a major life decision. There isn't enough in the business to make more than what I currently make where I am, there aren't any places affordable for where I am(Austin, TX). 

My ex-wife wants to move to be near her family in VA and that cant happen unless I move up there to because we have kids. So either I get lucky and everything just works out for me in the next 3 months, based off the state of the world i'm not seeing that happening or I move to a state I've never been and hope to god everything works out. 

I cant get back into my field in VA or West VA or any state near there, so I'll most likely just get a job at another dealership and hope the work is as steady as it is here.

I’m trying to be a good friend and Ik some of these small fights are a big problem but I don’t like drama or want these small things to accumulate over time and become a big problem. I want to continue being her friend but I want her to understand me as well. A recent thing she’s pointed out about me is that I tend to say things random and out of nowhere? Another friend has agreed with her as well. And I guess she thought I said what I said out of nowhere to come and attack her? And it was sudden? We were talking about what she wants to do, and she said she wanted to be a makeup artist, and i thought we were having a simple convo so I said I wanted to do that before but it was a dream I gave up on, and she asked why and I told her it’s because of what someone said. She said that that was very random? She also told me I do things and don’t even realize I do something wrong. I want to change and become better for my other friends if this is really a problem. But even tho I feel like what I said wasn’t random but I do agree I do say things randomly and out of context but that’s because it’s hard for me to remain focused on one topic at a time. For instance we’ll talk about our day but what we said reminds me of something else and while they are talking I have a whole thought process in my head that no one else hears and I say the one thing that sums up all the thoughts I had in my head so I can tell them what I thought, I get distracted easily and I can’t help it and I didn’t see anything wrong with it cause it’s just simple convos but Ig it’s not right? Or idk. But I can’t help it... I want to tell her this but I don’t want to come off as rude. Like as if I’m unwilling to be a better friend but I can’t help that I get distracted easily and it’s hard for me to focus so that’s just how I talk, and because of it many people find me weird cause I say things out of context.

163,"Nearly every single day since I was a child my dad has drank. Never enough to get drunk (6 beers every night basically). I've never had a great relationship with him and I love him but dear god he is so fucking miserable to be around when he drinks. So, for this story I'll include some background. He's turning 51 in 2 weeks and I'm 15 but a senior, so I've been forced into acting older than I am. We recently had a really dramatic event happen within the family and almost resulted in my parents getting divorced and me moving out of my moms to live with him. After this happening 2-3 times, they grew up and started to actually work things out. Everything was mostly fine for 1-2 weeks, and then my dad started acting really fucking odd. Every other night, he has a fire in our backyard and I usually come outside, on his phone calling my boyfriend (Mines always dead lol.) For some reason, it's only when I'm on the call with him, where he starts acting really weird and tries to be funny. Usually we bicker about literally everything (Not REALLY, just annoying each other.) But whenever I'm on the call, he does weird ass things, usually staring at me for 3-4 minutes at a time NOT MOVING, trying to piss me off. So tonight, amongst many others, he was staring. First time, whatever, hes just trying to be funny, but then I actually got a little mad at him for trying to purposely piss me off. So, he tells me to stop talking and I tell him he can't make me talk less as a joke. In turn, comedian master himself turns around, goes inside, and locks the door. Didn't think much of it since I knew he'd come back out, and I had his phone. So 6-7 minutes later he comes back out with a cake box, and I jokingly said I was talking about taking his phone for a swim, and once again, he's fucking staring. It makes me so uncomfortable and my anxiety triggers real hard when he does it. So, I tried to make him stop, I literally just lifted my leg high enough so my heel landed on the edge of the cake box and it fell maybe a foot to the ground. He gets all pissy and takes everything he had outside, inside. I still have his phone keep in mind. So, I tried to make light of it and not try to piss him off, so I came in a minute later asking if I could burn the rest of my sandwich. He completely ignored me and told me to hang up and give his phone back, which I didn't argue with, it's his. The problem is, he does this shit so often and it genuinely fucks up my mood, not really good for a person with recent suicidal attempts, so I'm very fragile. It's always come and gone in waves but recently he is mad at me for nearly everything, blaming shit on me and my sister, and when I say he reacts like a child, he honestly does. Ignores us all, refuses to talk to us or even watch something with us, just anger. I'll be honest, and he makes me cry probably 1-2 a day. I would love to see your guys' opinions on why he might act like this, or maybe even how I could try and improve it. I just want this shit to either stop or lighten up. I just want him to act normally and not get mad when people don't like his antics.",29Jun2020,1

I'm an upcoming college student with way too much free time on my hands. I can't really leave my home due to COVID-19 quarantine/restrictions so I was wondering if there was a way for me to make money at home/invest my time?",29Jun2020,2
167,"ok so, I'm a 21 y/o female and I'm dating a guy the same age as me, my parents do not live with me and recently, I confessed to my parents to liking this guy but I didn't tell them that we're already dating bc me, being a girl, they will not like that. Idk how to explain it, but if I make a decision without them knowing they freak out.

I like this guy and he has never given me a reason to not trust him, we have the same type of humour, ideals and my friends have known him for about 5 years now(I've known him for 2)

The thing is, when i visited my parents and told them about him, they seemed to be ok with him for the first couple of days, then out of the blue my dad wakes me up at 6am on a sunday to sit me down with my mom to tell me that they do not like him at all, mind you, they do not know him at all. They didn't give me any real reason as to why, and I'm very confused. I texted my boyfriend about this and he seemed to link it to overprotectiveness from my parents, as they worry too much. That makes sense to me, so I took the time to listen to my parents to try and calm their worries. One of the reasons that they gave me was that my dad used to give very expensive gifts to my mom before they even dated officially. I explained I was not comfortable with this as it seems a little manipulative(one of the examples my dad gave was a gold watch that mom doesn't even wear nowadays bc it is too expensive). I explained that I rather spend some quality time somewhere rather than have him spoil me rotten with things that will eventually break down. Besides, it is difficult during quarantine. I do not know how to reason with my parents. And they're making me doubt myself on if I like my boyfriend or not(i do not know how to explain this properly).

168,"To make a long depressing story short. I’m moving out. I can’t take living with my mom anymore. My girlfriend lives with us. We both work. My mom is probably going to hate me for moving out, but that’s a post for another day. 

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

* sorted each different cost, from our phone bills to estimated utility costs
* found an apartment in our price range, got pre approved for said apartment as well. 
* picked up a ton more hours at my job 
* researched getting on my own insurance

171,"Some background: I live on the top floor of a multi-family home, and the owner of the property lives on the first floor. I've been living here for a little over a year and haven't run into any major issues.

Today, the outlet that my A/C and PC were connected to tripped, so I went into the basement to check the breaker panel for my floor. I didn't see any of the breakers tripped, so I flipped each one of them to test and it didn't fix my A/C issue. I noticed on the first floor panel there was a tripped breaker, so I flipped it and it fixed my issue. A minute later, my landlord goes down into the basement and asks me if I was experiencing any electrical issues, because his bathroom lights flickered on and off.

I told him that one of my outlets tripped and I was testing the breakers, and that the breaker that tripped was on his panel for some strange reason. ""Oh that's weird, I was worried there was some electrical problem but I'm glad it's not that,"" was his only response. I was able to put two and two together that our outlet lines were swapped, but it doesn't seem like he fully realized the implications of that.

Out of curiosity, I went over my electric bills and confirmed that I am definitely not paying for half of the electricity I use. My PC and A/C alone pull 1250W leading to about 300kWh/month, but my entire electric bill this month is only for 350kWh.

Morally I feel like I should tell him that he's paying half my electricity but this is his house that he's owned and lived in for 40+ years and I can't believe that I'm the first one that's realized this out of all his previous tenants, or if he's had some electrical work done to the house and this happened without him knowing at all. On one hand I want to just keep my mouth shut and not mention it at all, as I've already told him that one of my outlets goes to his breaker panel. But on the other hand, the guilt is agonizing and this is something I wish I never learned about, as money is really tight for me.",29Jun2020,1

174,"I'm 18F. When I was almost 17, my parents bought me a car. My parents bought it for me one day while I was at school. I had been driving our family truck, almost as old as me, which has a habit of shutting off at stoplights and stop signs when the weather gets too hot or cold. When I saw this new car in the driveway that day, I didn't know what to say. I had been saving up to buy my own but I have been stuck at a job that pays so little it would have taken me too long to afford anything close to that car. I fell in love. And I did everything in it. I didn't have too many friends so I spent hours after school in that car. I would drive it to coffee shops to study for the ACT. Afterward, I would sit in the car and watch the sunset as I read or listened to music. I took it to school where I would sit before class and cram for tests before the bell. I would eat some dinners, scroll through my timelines, write. It took me to the library where I would study for finals and do homework and was there for me to drive it back home.

But a few months ago my parents sold my car to my older sister and now I need help moving on. I can't forget how it felt to be in the car. I miss going to work and seeing my car from out of the window, jumping in it at the end of the night. I miss going to the drive-in theatre, I miss going to *school*. I miss listening to music from those very speakers of the car. I took such good care of it. I kept it clean and always drove the speed limit. I always took the farthest parking spots because I was terrified of it getting any more scratches. At one point a rock hit and cracked the windshield on the freeway and I stopped driving for a couple of weeks because I was overwhelmed with fear that something worse could happen. It was almost unhealthy how much I cared about the car. It was the best gift I had ever been given.

That car represents every good memory I have of high school. And my sister took it from me. 

Now I need help moving on. My parents sold my car to my sister and I can't get over it. I feel dumb and selfish for caring so much about something so mundane when there are so many *real* problems. But I can't get over it. I keep repeating in my head, *I can't believe they sold it*, and *I can't believe SHE bought it.* But I do not blame them. I do not know how to express how much it meant to me that they had given me that car. It helped through panic attacks and breakdowns. It helped me when I got waitlisted for my dream college and denied to my second. It was there for me when my family was not. IT was there when I found out my grandpa died and when I mourned my aunt. 

But I know I need to move on from it. I have made progress. At first, I was so angry that I couldn't even look at the car. There are little things that my sister did that seemed to be manipulative on her part but I do not want to get into it because it is not moving on. I wrote her a letter to help her understand, but she told me she cannot feel empathy for me because she never had the same experience with a car in high school. While she did own a car given by our parents, she totaled it after two weeks of driving.

So, I have turned to be anonymous because no one I know has been able to help. I am embarrassed by my feelings and want it all to stop. I just feel dumb. It is selfish to feel such an attachment to an inanimate object but I cannot help but stay awake at night and think about the songs I played, the roads I took, the coffees I drank, the books I read, while in that car. Now it is as if I am back to being 16 and driving the truck that doesn't stop stopping.

I try to remember the good memories. I try to remember the orange lights on the radio and the feeling of the tires on the road. I try to remember what I once had but can only think about what I have lost.

So–– any advice on how to get over this? Any advice is appreciated.",29Jun2020,1
175,"TL;DR : Neighbors are claiming my small  yard as their own, stealing things, littering, and setting me up to seem as if I stole things from my neighbors. Things are ramping up, what should I do?

The houses in my neighborhood have little space between them.  she has 3 feet of yard off of her house while we have the rest ( about 8-9 feet). She used to always have her dad come over to mow, and he would mow right up to our doorstep, a good 4-5 feet over where he should have been mowing. I always thought, ""okay, he just doesn't know the dimensions of her yard"". It weirdly got under my skin, but I was fine with that. Then she stole my trashcan and replaced it with hers, she also stole some decorative rocks from my yard , and was still okay. After that she was quiet for a while, but then she stole our opposite neighbors trashcan and put her old one on our driveway, making it look like we stole the opposing neighbors trashcan. They came over and we talked about it but I have the feeling they didn't believe me.  So at this point she has ruined a perfectly friendly relationship I had with them.  She recently got a new boyfriend. I was scared of him immediately. I could here him beating her, the sounds of his fists along with his words **SLAM** "" THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDNT FUCKING TALK BACK TO ME"" **SLAM** accompanied with a whole lot of sounds like beating something. Keep in mind she has a small child. I still feel bad for her, but I feel worse for the child. There have been other instances, I have witnessed first hand, of the man being verbally abusive to the girl. I can't imagine what this girl is seeing indoors. 
  This new boyfriend set up a crossbow target in the middle of my yard ( I have three dogs, no fence), they continually host parties In my yard, and they are now throwing garbage in my yard. This all began to escalate once she started dating this new guy. One of my dogs pooped on the edge of my yard and I didn't pick up up because the ground was wet ( I normally do but I was barefoot and it was still raining at the time), the guy came over and was like ""we should t have to worry about poop, we have no dogs"" in wich the response was "" oh,I'm sorry, I'll pick it up. But, you know, your yard only goes this far away from your house."" They guy seemed annoyed, but left. Since then they have stolen even more bricks from our yard, gone even further than just mowing up to our (sideyard) door step / mowing even further into our front yard, throwing their trash and used coal way into our yard, and just completely taking over our side yard for events. There are other things that have happened that i haven't mentioned, but I think this post is long enough..

I don't think going to the cops or the HOA will help, In fact, I think it would ramp things up even further. I'm not sure what to do and I'm so frustrated by the situation . 
  I jokingly told my boyfriend I was going to line all the dogs poos up along the division of the yards.",29Jun2020,4
176," Hello all...

I'm 37F. I'm in a period of my life where I'm experiencing a lot of loss. My dad, who was my best friend, died last year. This past month, my husband left me and filed for divorce. My mom passed several years ago, but I have a stepmother. She is all the nuclear family I have left, but we have always had an extremely strained relationship that is void of any type of real communication. She just tries to dictate every minute detail of my life and is openly critical about how I don't do anything right. If I say something to her about how she treats me, she shushes me to silence or outtalks me. I am 37, but she treats me like I'm 12. She will literally try to tell me how to take out the trash or boil an egg. We obviously don't live together. She is having some health concerns right now, so I just try to help her with anything she needs and take care of her. I do not have any children.

At this point, especially with going through a divorce, I just feel like there's no one left in my family to lose. I noticed that I've cried so much over my husband, when other smaller issues happen, I just don't care anymore. I feel like I'm getting emotionally numb and like there's no more hurt left to happen that hasn't already occurred.

I don't have issues with mental health and I'm not depressed, but I just wonder if it's normal to get to a place of not caring anymore because things are so bad.",29Jun2020,2

178,"I [M25] recently broke things off with my girlfriend[22] of nearly 3 years. We had been friends for nearly 4 years before that, even. Our good times were the best I've ever had. We vibed on such a level I've never experienced before. I fell for her rather early on but kept things to myself for a while to test the waters. I tried to make it a point to avoid using the L-word to describe what I felt for her in those days... But it blossomed and I truly fell in love with this woman.
I admit, I did not make things easy for myself in keeping her trust. I talked to other women, though not in any kind of sexual or romantic way. I had a lot of female friends that were platonic. But because I didn't tell her of them and make sure she was okay with it, she felt a kind of broken trust with it. She sat on information of me talking to my lesbian friend in Delaware(when we were in Georgia) for 2 weeks before she even asked who she was.
I never tried to hide things, but it was the suspicion that got her thinking things, and stewed on it for so long that she got rather intensely jealous. That grew to a point where porn was a problem for her. It was talked about in the beginning of our relationship that porn would be fine between us, and she even watched it with me at times.
But, it was as though she believed I would rather have the kind of women found in what I watched, rather than her. It was a self-image issue, and I did not help it when she asked me to stop watching porn and failed to do so. I realized I had a problem, and would try to sneak porn into my day. I convinced myself I was admiring the female body, but it was like a compulsion to me. No matter how hard she threatened to leave me if I continued, I still did it... 
It caused some bad times. Very bad times. The worst I've ever experienced in a relationship.
She screamed... She threw things at me... She called me horrible names and said she hated me. She had even tried attacking me before. But much like she always seemed to forgive me and stay, I too stayed and forgave.
I wanted it to work between us. I knew we had potential, and I loved [correction... Still love her]her so much. The point where things turned a little sour was when she lost her job 6 months ago, and the last time I was caught with porn. 
Roughly 4 months ago, and I got rid of my smartphone and turned back a flip phone with no internet. Merely unlimited calls and texts. I admit it helped with bills, but I was cut off from those of my friends that I did not have their numbers. I felt isolated, and I didn't have much of a life beyond our home together. She still had moments of rage where she would just catch attitudes and get snappy with me when I hadn't done anything in months.
Where I love anime, and had gotten her turned onto some really great series- she grew to hate anime and called it misogynistic, sexist, and an inappropriate representation of females. Which, I can agree with on a good bit of anime, to a degree. But I also couldn't watch any TV or movies with a nude female for her jealousy would cause issues. 
We had been rewatching Game of Thrones, and she refused to watch it with me anymore for fear of one of the brothel scenes. I couldn't even play certain video games(found that out with Neir:Automata when she flipped out over 2B). And I just went along with it. About 3 months ago, she had just had a bad day of thinking about the past and ""wanted [me] to her like [I] had hurt [her].""  And tore up and destroyed many of my writings and a few of my books.
Since then I've had a bad feeling and haven't been able to get things right between us.
At the beginning of June we took a trip to the mountains to go camping. I had hoped that it would help refresh ourselves to detox from City Life, and she could experience something she had never done before. I loved it. She loved it. It was a beautiful, perfect time... But it was temporary, as vacations always are. 
We had to go back to our lives, and it just brought all those problems back to the surface. I had a rough night of drinking and had a lot of shit on my mind, and she held my hair as I threw up after said drinking. The next day, I had a feeling I knew what I needed to do and it wasn't until I had a talk with her brother[14] that I made my mind up to do it.
After he wanted to watch anime with us, and she exploded about it being the things stated above, she left to go pick someone up from work.
When I told him it was best to drop it, and confronted with his question if why... I told him it was cause if me. That she didn't feel comfortable with it because of me. That was why I had put Neir:Automata on hold, and hadn't watched any new anime in months along with game of thrones.
After unloading that on him, hearing this teenager tell me ""Dude, I know you love my sister and want to do right by her. That's why I really like you and think you're an awesome guy... But that's not right of her to treat you that way.""
It... Broke me. She begged for like half an hour for me to stay and I tried to explain that we are toxic for each other and that my leaving has nothing to do with lack of love for her. Then she proceeded to go inside, smash my TV in with my guitar and attacked me. She scratched my face and gave me a black eye screaming she hated me and never wants to see me again.
I'm still so fucked up about it. I can't get it out of my head. I feel like I lost my best friend... And I don't know if things will calm between us. Her friend says she isn't one to hold a grudge, but her actions with me through our relationship say otherwise.
I don't know what to do... All I feel is this pain in my chest and I see her face every time I close my eyes.  

My sister in California(I'm in Georgia) offered for me to move out there with her. But IDK if that's a good idea. I don't want to feel like I'm running from my problems. It could be good as a fresh start, but I don't know about it...

179,"I'm using a throwaway and praying to God that this friend doesn't see this post, but I'm really in a tough spot right now. The title pretty much says it all, but I'll go into a little more context so hopefully that will help people understand exactly what I'm saying. I also apologize if it seems like I'm constantly jumping from one point to another. I'm not good at writing things down, and I'm also honestly just scramble-brained right now:

My best friend and I have known each other since we were ten years old. I love this guy like a brother, and I do mean it when I say that he is one of the greatest guys I know.  We'll call him ""G."" I have a group of friends, around five of us, but none of them are as close as G and I. 

This afternoon, G and I were hanging with another one of our friends who I'll call ""A."" A is nice guy, but he can also really be a dick at times. I'm not so close with A as much as G is, but I suck it up anyway.  Anyway, we're sitting in A's room playing Halo 3 and listening to music. About an hour passes when A's little sister walks into his room asking us what we're doing. A's sister is thirteen. She's a sixth grader going into seventh grade. She's a fucking kid. Keep this in mind.

A and I ignored A's sister and kept playing Halo while G talked back to her. I don't know exactly what they were talking about since I was more focused in the game, but whatever they were talking about must've been something because it was like every five seconds we would hear G say something followed by A's sister making this weird, stereotypical, child laugh. It's hard to describe, sorta like ""tee-hee-hee,"" if that makes sense? It was annoying to hear once, but it was more annoying to hear over and over.  I didn't really think too much about this, but the more I look back on all of this, the more disturbed I get.

G and I didn't spend too long at A's house. We left maybe two hours later and headed back to my house since we decided to get something to eat but didn't want to hang out with A anymore since, like always, he was being a dick. 

I was driving with G to go pick up some pizza when, out of nowhere, G mentions A's sister. He just said ""I like talking with A's sister. She's cool."" I just replied with ""I guess"" cause I don't know what else to say. I try changing the subject, but he keeps coming back to talk about A's sister. At this point, he's talking about her appearance. Height, facial features, etc. G even made a statement about A's sister's ass. Yeah. Her ass.

I told him that that was gross and he shouldn't say stuff like that even if he's joking. He looked at me with this sincere look straight face and just says ""I'm not joking. I'm deadass going to marry that girl."" He ended up telling me that him and A's sister have been talking a lot recently and G has been visiting A's house more often just to see his sister but A think it's to hang with him. I felt sorta sick when he said that, and I told him that he shouldn't say stuff like that about someone so young. I emphasized the fact that he is 18, a fucking adult, and she is a 13 year old child. He kept trying to defend himself by mentioning how ""five years isn't that bad."" I started to feel really uncomfortable because he kept saying things like ""I love her"" and ""she's mature for her age.""

I seriously can't tell if he's joking anymore, but, even if he is joking, it's still really fucked that he thinks this type of stuff is funny. Regardless, I really don't know what to do. I don't know what I should say anymore, but I'm scared for everyone in this situation. Does anyone have any advice?",29Jun2020,1

The thing is,  she have her laundry basket in her toilet with her dirty clothes and undergarments, and I always have an urge to smell it,  but i have never done it all these years.  I dont know if any other guy are in the same area but I feel disgusted that I even have that urge in the first place, does anyone have any advice on how to curb this or hopefully eliminate it all together?",29Jun2020,2
186,"So I’ll start this off by saying that I’m 17. I’m a 17 year old boy. So this is gonna be a long post which I’m sorry in advance. Sorry also for any grammar mistakes, ELA isn’t exactly my strongest subject. So the main things I’m scared of is my relationship with a girl, my family, moving away, and myself. To give context to those, it’s gonna be a long post. 

So first I’ll start off with my metal state and emotional state since they both play a big part in all of the situation I’m about to describe. From a young age, I’ve had to deal with a difficult family dynamic me and my siblings. We constantly were moving around because of my father. He was abusive, mentally, emotional, and physical to my mom, and us children. This might’ve played a part in why I act the way I do. Growing up I use to be very outgoing, and very expressive. I was the happy little cheerful kid. But it got to intense one night and we had to get away from him. From this we constantly moved from one women’s shelter to another while growing up since he’d end up finding us every time. Finally he stopped, turns out during this time he decided he’d try and better himself. Since well his own family didn’t want to be around him. After all this happened I remember really thinking about how I felt, I became quiet, less expressive, and internalized my anger, sadness, and the pain he caused us. I remember the day I noticed that, I just get empty. Nothing could really fill it up, nothing could. I started lashing out as soon as someone got on me the wrong way. Whether that’d be my own mother or teachers at the school, even other children. I think my mom started to noticed and not just me but also my other siblings but she’s always been a very passive person so she never took action to help me. I internalized my emotions, at times I would act much like a robot. Or auto pilot you could say, I barely remember much of anything besides the abuse and the constant moving. But I remember the pain, I felt. This eventually this lead me, and my little brother to both attempt suicide at the very young age of just 9 and 8. Both of us. We both tried multiple times, I tried more than he did, but it still saddens me that he tried. I hated my life, I hated myself, more than I let on. Even now. We ended up getting my grandma to take two of us while my mother kept my two younger siblings. I went with my grandma with my other brother, and even then I still lashed out. There was even times where my grandma would threaten to put me in foster care. I remember saying, “well why don’t you, if you’ve already thought of it. I think this played a big part in the way I deal with my emotions now. My whole childhood, played a part. Now I’d also like to say that, my mother side of the family has a connection with depression and other related topics that run in it. While my own father, has had to deal with anger problems, and depression. This leads me to now. I feel depressed constantly, I’ve constantly had more suicidal thoughts again. I’m never happy, I constantly feel like I’m alone. I internalize much of emotions. I show just the bare minimum, but if I snap I tend to just let all of them. I’ve also had a problem with hitting things, I use to hit concrete walls till my knuckles bled. Now it leave me now, I don’t feel like I’d ever be able to open up to person, completely. I don’t want to hangout with people. Some days I have no motivation, to even do school while I was in it. I’d skip, more than I’d like. All this adds up into me. I’m depressed, angry, and feeling like I cant ever get rid of this hole inside of me.  

Now onto to the relationship and where it’s going. So she was a girl I dated for 10 months. She’s a wonderful girl, she’s beautiful, smart, kind, and really mature for her age. But this relationship has slowly been feeling like I’m losing it. I don’t want to. So some info on what this relationship was and where I think it’s going. We started to date in our 11t grade year of school, we met each other during the summer leading up to grade 11. During this time I didn’t see her in a romantic light, but she had a huge crush on my for the whole grade 10 year. We hanged out in the summer because of some mutual friends, and during this time we grew close. I’d find myself getting jealous of her talking about other guys, and well those type of things before we started dating. During this time I thought to myself on if I really like and if I had a crush on, eventually I can to the decision I did. So one day I asked her if I’d be able to come over, and we spend the night together. We watched movies, and just talked. I really enjoyed that night, so from that night I ended up asking her out. I was nervous, scared even, I found it I couldn’t stop shaking. Because before this I only dated one other girl, but it was long in the past. A puppy love I’d say since I dated her in elementary. So this was my first real relationship I like to think. So after I asked her out we started dating, during this time while we dated. I was toxic, I’d say things I didn’t mean, I’d try and control her. As I’m looking back on the relationship I tried to isolate her, from friends. I didn’t really like her hangout with other people, or talking to other people. As I look back from now, I know that’s wrong, that’s so wrong, I now view it as me trying to isolate her. Never meant to do that, it was my intention but it just happened. But even while alllllll of the stuff I put her thought, she was always there for me. I was toxic but I wasn’t toxic 24/7, yet it still played a big part in our eventually break up. She was amazing honestly, she was really mature, she always tried to help me whenever I need it. I made time for her, I use to walk a hour every night just so we could sneak me in and spend a night together. We’d watch movies, cuddle, talk, and sleep. She was great, she openly listens to me, and even for my unreasonable demands she’d still try and work around them or accept them and try to work with them. She was sweet, she cares for everyone, she’s has extremely empathy, she always tried to make everyone happy. She was also super mature, she tried helping me with getting job, doing my school work projects and assignments. She just viewed everything from an adult perspective, yet she still had her childish side to her. I always make her super happy whenever we hanged out, whenever she say me, there was even times where she’d cry and get chocked up on hearing my voice from a phone call. This would happen whenever we didn’t get to talk for awhile or she was out of the city. She just adorable, yet I treated her so bad. Now onto where we broke up, it wasn’t meant as a break up though. 

Just a break, so we’d be able to try again, now while on this break I made a really stupid decision of messaging another girl. Nothing came about it but I told her about it, and it broke her heart, I know it did. But even after she still forgave me, and said as long as I try and improve myself to the best I can. We can think about dating again, but first we’d start as friends. We’d be exclusive still, but she’d need to re-open up to me, trust me again, warm up to me. I was fine with this, I was happy, ecstatic that’d she be willing to try again. We were good, we still view each other as the other person. She was mine, and I was hers. But as time has gone, I’ve broken down a few times, and lashed out at her. Said things I regret. Eventually she pretty much out of the blue ignored me which made me even more mad and angry. This scared her, since I started to spam call her, and message her like crazy. I snapped. Since then, she hasn’t been the same. She’s started to talk to me less and less. And when we do talk, it feels as if she’s just talking to me like a friend. After his happened, I started thinking really hard about myself. Really hard. Who I was, where do I want to go, what are my goals, can I fix this? And so on. Now we’ve been talking again, and we’re okay. But I know now that she has lost feelings. But the thing is, as I was think about relationship since sometimes I said or I would imply that i wasn’t happy with relationship. Was I happy with her? Did I love her? I told her this quite a few times in our relationship yet she stayed but now I don’t think she wants to. But I’m finally starting to realize where I have to grow as a person. What I need help with. What I could’ve done better, and now I’m realizing too late that I love her. We said I love you to each other throughout our relationship but sometimes I didn’t mean it. This might’ve played a part but she said she loved me into two weeks of dating and well I didn’t love her then. Yet I said it. Now onto where we are now. She ended up going to a party and well she got some hickies? From a boy because she played truth and dare. I hate so damn much, because I love her romantically so damn much. But I’m too late since she’s lost feelings. She still feels like she loves me but only as a person. As a friend while I don’t want this. I hate it that she got them. I can’t blame her though, since we’re not even dating. 

I can’t blame her because I went and messaged a girl. I cheated first. It was long, just a simple I find her cute but it was enough. Now I’ve thought about all the things she’s done for me, and I realize I love her so damn much. That it hurts to just see me only being seen as only a friend. It hurts to realize that I’m late, that I made mistakes that I can’t take back. But I want her so bad, so very bad. After the found out about the hickies I told her, I’m mad, but I’m sad and upset. I’m not going to try and get mad at her when she has free rein to do what she wants. She’s her own person. She said we can talk tomorrow about how we both feel and everything in between. She said even now she has to warm back up to me for us to date. That I need to focus on myself completely but I can’t help but think that what if she goes and does stuff with another person. I know I’m in wrong but I can’t help it. I want her in my life, I want her as my girlfriend again, I want to marry her, I want her in my life. I honestly feel like she’s the one girl that your gonna regret your whole life and I don’t want to miss. I don’t want to lose her but I’m afraid I already have. So I’m now in this dilemma where if I want to move forward she’s not going to be there. She still wants me in her life but only as friend for now, but that hurts me too much to think about. So like I said I think I’m in this dilemma where I have to let her go, because she want to go. But I’m stuck in my damn feelings, and it stucks because she was my person, and I still view her as my person. I went to her for everything, just like whenever she needed me. I’m afraid that, I’m going to be alone again. And this relationship doesn’t help because if she’s gone quite honestly I don’t know what I’m going to do. Plus I’m moving to another city so I won’t be able to see anymore not for at least a year. 

Family, or my situation with my family and moving is next. I got into a huge fight with my grandma which involves me moving back with mom. Which in itself is a big huddle for me, but she lives far away. Like a good 8-10 hour drive. Another thing is that my father cane back into my life years ago since he got help, but once again his anger got the better of him and well he put his hands on me.  But he’s bigger than me but a lot, so when he did well I guess start hitting me and kicking and just the fight. I decided at that moment that I’m done with him ever being in life again. I’ve also got into a fight with my auntie which is basically now in the same situation we don’t talk. Anymore. While me and my dad don’t talk either. He’s actually put his hands on me before in the last few years but it was till now that i decided. He has stuff he needs to improve on before I can reopen to him.. so now onto moving, I’m moving to a complete different city where I have to get a job, and finish school, and some how find a way to live life. When I barely know anything about renting, taxes, and well adult stuff. I’ll have to make new friends, be in a new environment. And well all that jazz. 

So lately about how I feel right now. Honestly I’ve been scared that I might not want to live, everything feels like they’re against me. I feel alone, I feel like I can’t do anything. I feel hopeless. I’m scared that I’m going to get to sad, too much pain, too much anger that I’ll take the easy way out. Like I tried before. I’ve actually tried to kill myself multiple times even after my first attempt. I find myself having really dark thoughts, and just endings it all. I love my family even if we have our differences, I’m scared that I’ll end my life before I get to see all of my siblings bloom into their adults self. And taht I won’t be around.

That’s basically everything that I possibly need any help with. Or just advice any advice would help. Thank you to whoever is reading. I hope you have a great day

187,"so, the other night i was on my way from my friends house and heading home, i didn’t want to be out too late because my mom would start tripping out. 

so instead of going on the highway like i normally would do, i took the road that would get me home the fastest way possible. as the light was changing from yellow to red i ended sliding and booking the red light slightly, as soon as that happened a cop came right behind me and pulled me over.  

at first i was expecting one officer but as i looked to my passenger there was another officer flashing his flashlight in my car. with my hands up, I ask the officer please turn off his flashlight because i wanted to tell them where my registration was located so i wouldn’t get shot. 

immediately the officer on my driver side told me to put my hands on the steering wheel, and don’t move. i calmly told the officer i knew my rights and that they were there to serve me and not harrass me. as soon as i said that he demanded to step out of the car, and before i could even put the car in park the officer grabbed me out of my vehicle and dragged me to the police car and for no reason. it was so fast to the point my car was still in drive almost went into the building that i initially stopped at.

out of frustration, i did what practically anyone would do and cursed them out. i was upset at the fact of how unprofessional the officer was and didn’t have any care in the world and wanted to look bad ass. 

i ended up going downtown and getting arrested for resisting arrest. and was released a couple of hours later. 

the next morning my car was towed and I had to pay $150 to get it out, just for my car not to start and having to pay a towing company to get in to my house. 

as bad as the situation was to find out my car doesn’t work ever since the night i got pulled over sets me to flames, i have court at the end of the year and plan to sue the officers but i don’t want to put in effort just to be unjustified.

i tried calling the sergeant for the shift to explain to him about it and he basically backed them up and told me bs about how they did their job and i deserved to get arrested. when i tried to defend myself he interrupted and claimed that the officers were being polite and patient with me just to get me heated on the phone before hanging up. 

i honestly don’t know why crooked cops exist but they are truly something i despise and hate. it took the situation to really open my eyes on how stereotypical corrupt the justice system is and how they operate

191,"This was....a while ago. Let me tell you from the start. I met my best friend when I was 2 and she was 1. We fought because we were little. We stopped and never had a fight again. Then we were super close. We started to sleep over together at HER house because my dad is a single parent (WHO WOULDN’T HURT A FLY) but you know how that goes 🤷🏼‍♀️. I was 7 she was 6. I started to catch feelings for her but I didn’t know what it was. It was like this for about 3 years I think. One day we slept over and went to play in the yard. I played lofi and we chilled. Later in her room (and I regret this soooo much) (I was still playing lofi) and....well I asked her if she wanted to kiss. She said no she wanted her first kiss to be in the right place and right time. I said I understood that. Recently during quarantine we were playing a game on call and I asked her who her crush was. She didn’t want to say. She told a friend that told me. I asked her if that was true. She said yes and started to cry. She said she liked me since she was 7 and I said me too. We cried together. But she also said one thing kinda under her breath like “why would you want to be only friends since....you know(when I asked to kiss her)”. I don’t know what that was about because I did want to be more than friends but I also didn’t want to hurt her. She’s so little and innocent. Also I didn’t say but she’s raised as a religious kid but she never liked it. She’s said she’s felt sick and hasn’t felt like talking. Idk if she’s ghosting me,actually sick,or someone convinced her I’m bad(she has a friend who’s a boy in the religion and he might say bad things about me. He has in the past). I miss her so much 😭😭😭I just want to hear her voice.",29Jun2020,1
192,"So this guy and I used to talk and he really really likes me. We didn’t have great communication because it was like the beginning stage at the point where it’s not really time yet to admit to having feelings and stuff so when we had miscommunication, things crumbled pretty quickly and we lost complete contact for a little over a month. Basically what happened is him and I were flirting for a month but we didn’t have anything serious and didn’t plan to hangout on our own or anything yet &amp; it was kind of like we were testing the waters. I think he had also been talking to this other girl, Becca who he met before me and I assume they had been hooking up. But he initiated things with me and eventually told my friend he wanted to take me to his formal. He asked her if I’d really say yes and want to go with him. He also asked her if she really thought I liked him and was like blushing. But I accidentally walked away because my friend needed me and I think that upset him. Because after flirting with me for an hour that night he sent me a picture of a girl in his room. After this him and I argued (but never communicated why either of us were mad) and lost contact.

After winter break I come back and he has a girlfriend. Which I was okay with and I do not like getting in the way of relationships. I assumed he wouldn’t pay attention to me and I moved on. But when I started going out it was the opposite. The first night out my friends said he was staring at me the whole night which ig isn’t the biggest deal. But he also went up to my friend he barley knows while I was talking to her to try to talk. Than the weird part is when he walked up to his girlfriend and pretended to talk to her.. but I could feel him seriously staring at me out of the corner of his eye the whole time. Than after a bit he did a full spin away from her to try to talk to me. I was pretty disturbed by him so I said “mhm” and turned away from him pretty quickly. But I saw him standing their looking depressed and than watched him run off in the other direction. Another time he was weirdly emotional. He was glaring at me from a distance. Than i saw him walk past his gf and brush her off to come up to me. He walked up to his friend while I was talking to him. He than came up to me and started talking to me and being super cold and rude. Than I saw him out again and he stood from a distance and stared at me while smirking. He kept doing this for a while.  I texted him asking him to stop and that seemed to piss him off. I know he’s gonna do it again when the semester starts again and I don’t know what to do. All of his attention makes it hard for me to move on but also shows me really bad traits of him. I just don’t know how to handle it",29Jun2020,1
193,"Hi guys,

To get some information out of the way:

I'm having a really hard time changing my mindset. Ever since I was little, I've always suffered from paranoia, anxiety, serious insecurities and depression. To the point that it's more common for me to be in a negative mood then a positive one. I've tried to be happy but it never stays for long (maybe 2 hours a day tops and it's not uncommon for me not never be happy for an entire day.) Suicide has crossed my mind ever since I was around 10 but being a Christian, I was too afraid of ""going to hell"" to actually do it. (Most of the time I don't believe that but that's good old paranoia kicking in right when the belt is around my neck) other then those emotional problems I also seem to have a general lack of motivation even though I want to change. (My attitude and weight)


Today Im in a different state for a funeral and something dawned on me. I believe that my parents (my mother more then my father) is the reason I'm the way I am. 

My dad and mom divorced when I was little. He didn't disappear but instead was more of a ""I'll give you resources instead of my time"" parent after. So immediately I had ""daddy issues"". My mother went through a depression for a while making her slightly unable but I just took what I could and was happy with that. Then went she finally got out of it...she was different. She started putting things above me and my sisters. (Going out and having fun while my teenage sisters watched us). Again I just was happy when she was there. Then...she started being different to me. 

Again I was a kid when this happened (still in elementary school) and now one told me how to process the divorce (my sister where in Highschool but they were trying to process it themselves too) so I was constantly sad because I was waiting for my dad to come back and be with my mom again. (It never happened). I don't know why but my mom decided to punish me for being sad. Telling me to stop being so sad all the time and when I cried about anything she told me I was ""overreacting"". If I didn't stop or tried  defend myself I would get beat with a belt. Eventually I started to believe i was overreacting and stopped talking to my problems to anyone. It was so bad one I got beat for losing some shoes my mother never bought (that's a whole different story.) 

She also valued her convince over me. 

Right now I'm in horrible pain because I have a cyst on my back that got infected and its spreading like mad but instead of trying me to a hospital. She tried get her aunties to squeeze the infection out because it's free. It was the worse pain of my life and I screamed and fought them off before they were done. They told her to take me to the hospital but instead she extended our stay for two days and pretty tells me to take pain pills and suck it up.

Since I've moved out this is the first time in MONTHS she's treated me like this and it made me realize there might be a connection.

Am I right to feel how I feel?  And not matter if I am or not, I want to change. I want to be happy and I would love to have some tips on how.

Edit: I'm a 19 year old Female if that helps",29Jun2020,1
194,"So I'm newly looking into Christianity. Here's the thing holding me back. I dont believe in the Bible. I think it has some great lessons and ideas, but I don't think its the word of God, at least not all of it is. The Bible is full of sexism and mysogny. To me, God is loving and peaceful and no exceptions. Yet women are depicted as property in the Bible and wives are practically owned by their husbands. So, i do want to be Christian. But not in the way people are today. I believe the current practice of Christianity is perverted and deeply misguided. Anybody who accepts sexism as the word of god is living sin, as it breaks one of the 10 commandments. Do not take the lords name in vain...do not justify hatred by saying its gods will. So sorry if this offensive, I'm genuinely coming from a place of curiosity and I'm open to all advice or responses. I've never heard this talked about and I don't want to subscribe to a religion that is hateful, I just don't think Christianity is hateful. I think it's been distorted and just...nobody talks about it",29Jun2020,1

198,"I've included a summary as well as what advice I'm looking for specifically at the end of the post for those who don't want to read it all. 

Just so you know, I'm 20F. My boyfriend is 23M.

I have a male friend (let's call him G, he's 20M). He is currently engaged as of a few months ago. Because I'm a psych major, G comes to me often to talk about his relationship and his mental health (not saying that I'm qualified enough to help him, it's just what has happened). G and I used to hook up before I started dating my current BF, and my BF is aware of our history. My BF isn't happy with our friendship, but isn't the controlling type so he doesn't care that I'm still friends with G. 

My BF dislikes G very much because, G has hurt a lot of people, including me multiple times over the course of us knowing each other, both platonically and sexually. When I told my BF that I wanted to continue being friends with G even though he doesn't like him, my boyfriend agreed but made it a point to tell me to be careful and make sure that G didn't cross any boundaries.

As I mentioned earlier, G is currently engaged as of earlier this year. Sometime after becoming engaged, he got drunk one night and texted me. He told me that he sometimes fondly remembers our sexual encounters. It made me uncomfortable, but I told him I guess it's okay to fantasize as long as he doesn't act on his fantasies. He then told me that he sometimes wishes he was engaged to me instead of his fiance. I honestly just ignored this part of his confession and we haven't discussed any of this night since then.

I did not tell my boyfriend about the drunken confessions from G because I was worried that my BF would consider that a crossing of boundaries and make me immediately stop being friends with G, which is something I didn't want to do. 

I didn't and still kinda don't want to stop being friends with because I do pity him a lot, and feel some kind of responsibility for his well being. G has told me multiple times how much our friendship means to him, how much I've helped him, and how many times I've prevented him from killing himself. So, again, I almost feel like if I do drop him as a friend, that he might commit suicide and I would 100% feel guilty if that were to happen. I'm one of his only true friends.

Lately his mental health doesn't seem to be doing any better, and on top of that apparently his relationship with his fiance has been suffering because of his suicidal tendencies and extremely low self esteem, among other problems. 

Everytime we talk now, it's either us sending each other memes, me supporting him emotionally, or him asking me psychology related questions. Whenever we talk about psychology, he puts me on this super high pedestal, telling me I'm super smart and understand him so well, how I'm helping him to understand himself and other people, and other exaggerated claims that are admittedly nice to hear but, as I said, are definitely a little extreme considering I will just explain my opinions and perspective on topics. 

My BF and best friend both have had a suspicion that he is in love with me, or at least has feelings for me, and the drunken confession + his high view of me does make me question this. If he does have feelings for me, that would make me really uncomfortable because I'm in a relationship, and I would not be able to continue our friendship under those circumstances. I also don't want things to go further than they already have.

TL;DR: Used to hook up with a guy nearly 2 years ago, moved on and reconnected with him a year later out of pity and started dating my current boyfriend who doesn't like him at all. Same friend told me while he was drunk that he sometimes wishes he was engaged to me instead of his fiance, I ignored it and didn't tell my boyfriend out of fear of having to give up that friendship. Friend might be in love with me, uses me for emotional support, and generally makes me uncomfortable sometimes. I fear that if I stop being friends with him, he will potentially hurt himself or others.

Here are my two questions that I need your help with:
1) Should I drop my friend?
2) Regardless of if I continue my friendship with him or not, should I tell my boyfriend about this whole situation, and tell him about the drunk confession from a couple months ago?
3) Am I crazy for thinking he has feelings for me? Or do you guys think that everyone in my life is correct and he's probably in love/has feelings at least?",29Jun2020,1

200,"Kind of a throwaway(?) Lol, well, I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible...Basically, I've been bullied so much by my friends these past few years (I've had different friends, so it's not like I really stick to them on my own accord or anything...) and I'm so sick of it. Some days I feel insane because I wonder if I'd done anything bad to them to warrant the sort of treatment I received. Honestly, part of it is my fault because I try to help and 'fix' people when that's not my responsibility to begin with, so I guess I shouldn't even be surprised that to begin with. It's honestly affected me, and I kind of hate the person I've become...which is why I'm now working on bettering myself (but that's a different topic). Anyways, I'll be honest - I'm a sensitive person, I'm passionate and I hold my passions close to heart, so if I am willing to reveal these passions of mine to someone, it means that I trust them to a certain extent. In my friend group years back, I would always try to talk about the music I liked, or the stuff I liked talking about...I guess more philosophical stuff (? haha hope I don't sound like r/iamverysmart 😓) anyways...I digress.  But I always got shut down and called a weirdo

Then I moved, and I got super lonely. I'm also quite shy, and I can't initiate conversation on my own, so for a couple months I had literally no friends, so when I finally had someone I latched onto them because I hated being lonely so so much...anyways, this girl would call me a fatso instead of my name, and it hurt, of course...anyways I ended up gaining more 'popularity' in school (GOD I hate preteens) which got her to be nicer to me, but she'd always make snide comments about how I was a spoiled brat, but I didn't really mind because I felt bad that she had an awful mom and not a very good home support system, and we ended up going to the same middle school together. 

Here, I met another girl, and at first she was fine ... I mean there were red flags like how she said 'I love you' too quickly, and other stuff that I won't go into, like tasteless jokes. Anyways, she wasn't ever as directly mean a friend, but she always spoke behind my back. And at some times, she'd speak to my face. She said a lot of stuff about how we didn't click as friends, how I wanted popularity (which I didn't), I can't even really remember now because I try to forgive and forget, but more recently she suddenly ghosted me, and I suppose I did too...I mean, I saw it coming but leading up to it was her making plans with the rest of the friend group without me, and other stuff. I mean...overall she wasn't the worst, we shared some good memories and I'm thankful for that, I guess the way she affected me the most was that she was really insecure, and it sort of made me pay more attention to my looks and stuff...but that's normal teenager stuff. I guess the worst part of it all was her talking behind my back. I helped her get out of a toxic friendship after she'd ditched me to become friends with that girl, and I let her stay alongside me...so I guess that's why it hurt. Most recently though, was this. As I mentioned earlier I've changed a lot because I got bullied (although it wasn't too severe...I guess it's more about the build-up, I became more closed-off, irritable, and well...a lot less emotional. 

Actually, I've been suppressing everything for a long time because I don't wanna burden the people around me with my feelings (haha...but I mean this is r/advice so I hope you don't mind me whining about my life). I became the rock for my friends, who are both rather emotionally unstable, and I try hard to give them advice and listen to them because I want them to live better lives. I genuinely do. Well, I have this one friend who's especially temperamental, (my other friend is a sweet person though, and I care so much for her :) I'm really glad to have her) he's super SUPER emotional, and constantly accuses me of being privileged, which by his logic gives him leeway to be rude to me. But I'm a passionate person, and I don't know...I was in a sort of mood where I felt okay with being more emotionally vulnerable to my friends (something I only ever show my family because I'm not a very trusting person, lol) so I talked about how much I loved art. All he said was 'I miss unemotional (my name)'. That felt like such a slap in the face, especially after how much I put up with regarding his behavior, his constant mood swings, and all the effort I put in in trying to encourage him to become a better person. I'm still bitter over it, but I'm so tired of being the strong friend. I'm tired of pretending I don't have emotions because it helps him sleep better at night knowing he's been a shitty person to me, but maybe that's a strong accusation. Maybe he doesn't realize...ugh sorry for being so disorganized, my mind is kind of all-over-the-place right now. Just because I don't send you guys long texts about how horrible life is when something goes wrong, doesn't mean I have no feelings. There were a couple of times when I tried opening up, only to have my messages completely ignored by him. This is gonna sound so disgustingly self-conceited but I feel like a lot of this happened because people were jealous of me (?) I mentioned him calling me privileged. 

But to be honest, I try as much as I can to hide my private life because of this. I don't go around bragging about anything in my life, and it just sucks that people want to bring me down for things I can't control. Just for context I have a healthy at-home life (which I'm so thankful for, otherwise I think I'd be so much more devastated by all of this), and I get to travel often, I'm a relatively good student with hobbies and interests and stuff so yeah, generally, I'm content with life. But it sucks that people have to take that away from me, I work hard to maintain my happiness, my extracurriculars, my relationships, my grades, etc. I know that these people who have hurt me have a bad home life, so I try not to be petty and I try to be understanding. But really, I'm so tired of it, I'm so tired of having to pretend that I don't care and I'm cold and indifferent, that I'm strong. I've gotten insanely sensitive to people's perceptions of me and I try to hide my private life when I can...it sometimes makes me feel like I'm crazy. I don't post anything on SNS regarding my personal life, and I don't bring it up unless people ask me about it directly, even then I try to be discreet as possible. I feel super bad about holding all of this in because I sometimes take it out on my parents, who are the sweetest people ever and none of it is even their fault, but they're bearing the brunt of it...So, my two main concerns are this:

1) How can I heal from this and become kinder, more patient, and warmer instead of internalizing my hurt?
2) How can I make more valuable friendships and stop my urge to help/'fix' people? 

Wow, okay so sorry about the length of this post, if you read up until here thank YOU so much for having the kindness and patience to care about an internet stranger :) I really hope this wasn't a confusing read, I didn't get to articulate things well because I've blocked out some things and a lot of stuff has happened. Just as a note, I hope you don't worry about me too much since I've limited my contact with all of these people, but nevertheless my past affects me and all I wanna do is become a better person instead of letting my hurt fester and turn me into a bad person (hope this doesn't sound narcissistic...gah, I just don't like the thought of having to depend on people but I'm desperate for advice which is why I'm here). Anyways, thank you once again...I really let it all out here whew !!",29Jun2020,1
201,"Anyone ever get this feeling before? 

I've never felt it before, but at the the last few days I feel so overwhelmed by this sense of impending doom. I just feel like any day now some major shift in my life is going to happen and its going to be very bad. Everything seems to have lost its joy. All I feel is this gloom. 

Any thoughts on how to get out of this funk?",29Jun2020,1
202,"Hey, y'all. Like most people, I don't like it when my parents fight. I cry and stay in my room most of the day when they do argue. Today, my father left the house at around 12:30 am. We don't know where he went or why he left. He has been sober for the past three months. But now, he is going back to his old self and I know that once he returns (whenever that is) my mom will have it out with him. I've thought of packing a school bag with a few clothes and necessities and just running away. But that isn't the best option. What can I do to ignore and to not think about them arguing?",29Jun2020,1
203,"Hello, 
This is going to be long winded and maybe boring but I’m 19F and I tried to kill myself on May 29th and failed. I’ve been on antidepressants and I don’t really feel like they work. I’m depressed every day of my life and I just don’t see my purpose in living. Since last month, I’ve pushed away most of my friends because they treat me differently since they found out and I really don’t feel like talking to anyone about what I’m feeling. Because I don’t really feel anything besides failure and numbness. Everyone has been trying to push and push to find out what I’m feeling but I just can’t describe what I feel into words to them. 
I know they care and love me but that’s not my problem. People have been saying “well if you feel alone and helpless just know you have so many people who love you!” but that just makes me feel shittier. I know people love me. That’s the reason why I’m not currently jumping off a bridge. I feel guilty for wanting to be dead but I can’t think about anything else. The cost of living and the struggles of everyday life and just everything about the amount of work you have to do to live is so beyond my will to live and fight for my life. It’s like I don’t want to die I just want to be dead. I don’t want to exist. 
People always say how terrifying death is and the empty void is horrible but honestly it seems so much better than this. Working in a job you don’t even like and eating food you don’t enjoy and doing workouts you despise just to have a chance to have your perfect life is so fucking exhausting. And I know I don’t need to have this job or have to eat healthy or not work out but then I would be depressed for feeling not enough. 

And it sucks because I know my life is good. I know that my situation is so much better than a vast majority of people. I know I should look at my life and feel good about it because I’m privileged but I just don’t. I wish more than anything in the entire world that I could just give my life to someone who actually wants it. I wish I could give my life source to a person who had a terminal illness or a person who was murdered or a soldier who was killed in action. Anyone. Anyone who wanted to live but died instead. I wish I could transfer my life to them. But I can’t. And I’m stuck feeling like I should be happy and I try so desperately to be happy but I just can’t produce the will to live. 

So either how can I die without hurting my loved ones or how can I make myself want to live? How do I make myself climb out of bed wanting to embrace my life? How do I convince myself the good things outweigh the bad and shitty things in this life? 

I need help to end this numbness and depression.

Please.",29Jun2020,0
204,"Okay so I have this friend and she’s besically the most self centered, attention seeker person ever.......she kinda made my great close friend group fall apart 

Examples of things she does: 
- Talks about her super personal stuff 24/7 with us..... like everything her and her boyfriend does she explains to us .... literally no boundary. And worse than that every time someone else tries to talk about their personal life changes back the Convo to herself and her life ..... also can’t see when someone is more happy than her 
- She got extremely mad when everyone else got better jobs / grad school scores than her.... complained how she also deserves that even tho she never really puts work in (besically made it sound like we were dumb and she was the smart one who deserved it) 
- Never lets anyone speak.... constantly talks about herself and expects everyone to do the same.... like for example last week we were talking how some hot dude hit on my friend on the beach and right away she goes “why does no hot guy hit on me 😞” I’m so sad blah blah blah and didn’t let my friend even finish her story 

My friends realized it and kinda trynna detach from her and I’m doing the same.... but what bugs me is she still texts me expecting me to listen to her midnight antics with her boyfriend or talk about her issues. To add I act nice and try to listen but it’s been super difficult to not feel angry / frustrated at her....


How do I deal with her situation?",29Jun2020,1
205,"Before anybody goes, ""What about Reddit?"" Sure, Reddit is a form of social media, but, I don't think it's as bad as the places that I'm talking about: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Sure it has it's fair share of bad people, but I think the subreddit system filters it enough where I don't run into bad people as much as I do on the other places. I use these three, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, mainly Instagram, and I'm thinking of leaving them for good. 

I still do believe that social media and those three platforms can be good ways to bring people together and to meet new people, I actually do have a couple Instagram friends, people I text on there, so I met them through that, and that shows that it can bring positive things. But at the same time, it feels like they can be more negative. I feel like I see a lot of negativity on there and in a lot of ways it brings me down. One thing I've been seeing a lot recently, as you can imagine, is racism. Especially on Facebook. A company or something will post a Black Lives Matter message, and I obviously support it, and below you'll the Laughing emoji, the Angry emoji, and racist comments. Or on Instagram I'll see a post from a certain actor/artist that I like, a person of color, and there will be racist comments calling them the N word. I won't list anyone specific, but it is hard to see a certain black artist or actor that I like post something positive and you look below and you just see hateful comments. I get that these people are trolls, but they really do affect my mood. I was in a good mood just a bit ago, but a certain black artist that I like posted something on Instagram, and for whatever reason it decided to show some racist comment that someone made, and it just really destroyed my good mood, and that's why I'm thinking of leaving places like that, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. 

Another one that is a little bit on a different topic is about The Last of Us 2. Whether you play it or not you've probably seen that it's getting a lot of hate on social media. Now, of course people have the right to their own opinion, and if anyone reading this doesn't like TLOU2 that's fine, but I've actually been mostly enjoying it, but these comments are affecting it for me. It is hard to be playing it and feel like I'm enjoying it but then remember seeing someone on Facebook or Instagram be all like TLOU2 IS TRASH. I might see a moment that is in the game that I feel like I like, I know I like it, but then that guy that says TLOU2 IS GARBAGE pops into my head and it kinda really affects it for me. It makes me wish when I was a kid and I could just enjoy things. This also relates to the Star Wars sequels. I liked the Star Wars sequels, and again, if anyone reading this doesn't like them, totally fine, but it is hard for me to watch TROS and feel like I'm enjoying it but remember someone saying TROS IS THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER. I miss when I was a kid and I just enjoyed Star Wars on my own, and what someone on the internet says about it wasn't in my mind. 

These are the reasons why I kinda wanna leave. However, the reasons why I'm conflicted are because, for starters, I'm just so used to using those places, I admit I go on Instagram and Facebook a lot, so completely stopping would be a big adjustment for me. I'm afraid that I'd try but within a day I'd be back on. Also, I don't know if by doing this, am I letting the trolls win?  Maybe by leaving I'm letting the bad people win. And you could also say that ""Maybe your too sensitive, maybe you shouldn't let those people bother you."" That is true, but unfortunately I just am a sensitive person.  I am, I always have been and I probably always will be. A lot of what might not bother anyone remotely could bother me a lot. That just is the way I am. 

So again, I feel like I wanna leave social media, but I'm conflicted to how big of an adjustment it would be for me and if by doing that I'm letting the bad people win. Maybe instead of leaving forever I could take a break? What should I do?",29Jun2020,1
206,"Some background: my (F21) boyfriend (M24) has always been a mild drinker (a few times every couple months at parties) and has been a little irresponsible with his drinking in the past- lots of black outs and such whenever he did drink. We’ve been together for 4.5 years and about 2.5 years ago he switched to only drinking beer due to a bad experience with hard liquor at a party. His mother is also an (undiagnosed) alcoholic. Drinks at least 18 beers a day, takes a shot of hard liquor in the morning before she starts her day, and his grandmother is the same way.

Before about 4 months ago, he only drank while out with his friends, maybe a few times a month, and he’d only have one or two pints. As of recently, he’s been buying cases of beer and typically keeps them in his room in his mini fridge and drinks 4-5 at the end of his work day to “wind down” and “de-stress”

I won’t go into too much detail about his job because i’m not sure if he’s on here or not, but he’s currently working a temporary position that was supposed to turn permanent but was delayed due to covid, so now he’s in this limbo where he may lose his temp position or keep it but wait another year to become a permanent employee- so i can definitely see where the stress is coming from. 

I am nervous because he uses the stress from his daily life as an excuse to drink. He typically drinks in his bed and will often leave my house early feeling agitated to go home. He tells me he’s just annoyed or upset, but i’ve caught him on several occasions leaving early from seeing me to go to the liquor store and drive home. I also feel like he’s become increasingly sensitive and irritable lately, he’ll snap at the smallest, most meaningless thing. 

A few weeks ago I brought up my concern and mentioned I’m worried because I know his mom is an alcoholic (he knows how bad she is and acknowledges it constantly and also tells me he’ll never be like her) and that i’ve noticed he’s been drinking a lot more than usual lately and asked him if he’s ok, to which he replied telling me that yes, he’s OK and doesn’t see anything odd about drinking 4-5 beers a night to wind down for bed. He then got upset that I brought it up and didn’t speak to me for a few hours. Whenever someone annoys his mother, she constantly says “and THIS is why I drink” and proceeds to drink 2 beers at the couch. I’ve heard him say the same thing to me when he says something at work is bothering him, and this really concerns me. 

I am so extremely worried. I don’t know how to bring it up to him that i’m worried, because I know he’ll just get defensive again. I don’t want to be accusatory, I want to let him know that i am genuinely worried and that this shift in him hurts me. I don’t want to see him turn out like his mother. 

Please, does anyone have any advice?",29Jun2020,1
207,"i’ve made a second post a couple days ago kinda about what happened. it rooted from my dads girlfriend &amp; her son and the drama that came from them. his girlfriend made racist &amp; homophobic remarks to my cousin and family members. 
fast forward the day after the drama, i tried talking to my dad normally about whatever and he was being short with attitude. so i decided to leave him alone and part my ways from him to wait for him to cool down and talk to me. 
instead i received a bunch of verbally abusive, aggressive texts from him. 
i’ve been abused in the past so it’s nothing new to me. although i hate the way i’m treated, there isn’t really nothing i can do about it. 

anyways, i really have no idea why he is so mad at me. i feel like shit.
i haven’t said a single word to him since thursday and i hate grudges. 
especially since he’s my dad, there is nothing i want to do more than speak to him. 
i’m in the same house as him and his girlfriend. 
my dad doesn’t even want to talk to me. i feel like his girlfriend probably fabricated what happened and turned it to make it seem like i did something fucked up. 
if you’re interested in more details feel free to hit me with a dm. but otherwise i’ll stick to the bare minimum on here. 

if i approach my dad and try to talk to him i know he won’t believe anything that comes out of my mouth. i know he’ll yell and call me more names. i don’t even want to think about if he hits me or pushes me again bc it’s been a few weeks since he’s done it last. 

i feel like the worst of it all is that suicide has been on my mind since i was 13-14 (i’m 20 now). the past week has been nothing but pushing me towards my dark thoughts even more. 
i know i won’t do it but i just feel so fucked with life. i’m on edge about moving out and quitting college. but working a job and saving up for rent and bills will just be more difficult. 
my dad and his girlfriend just recently signed a 3 yr house lease and we’re moving in a couple weeks. 
what if he doesn’t want me to live there? what if he kicks me out?
i also don’t want to talk to his girlfriend anymore since she’s shown she’s incredibly racist &amp; homophobic. but my only concern figuring out how to my dad again and make things clear with him (it will be so hard). 

and the question i’m really asking for is how can i even talk to him again? 
as i stated before, i am afraid to approach him because of his behavior towards me. 
unless i just continue to stay silent and wait for him to come to me, but then it makes me feel like an annoyance because i’m in HIS house, eating HIS food and living there being around him and his gf. 
and he seems fine not having me around talking and this is why me dying is louder in my head and i just feel like a huge inconvenience!!!

208,"I work at a European restaurant and the owner hates anyone that isn’t White. He purposely will give black waiters shitty duties like mopping and cleaning the bathrooms. He is also a lot harsher on black employees while he lets the white employees get away with stuff. He will call you an idiot in Spanish/Russian if you’re black and you make the slightest mistake. He refers to all black people as, (Allah forgive me for uddering this word) niggers.

What really pissed me off is that he fired my very dark friend for accidentally leaving early because he mixed up his hours. While the Whites PURPOSELY leave early and the owner lets them get away with it.

The owner pays half the staff under the table. Most of the under table staff is also collecting unemployment while working there. I can’t really go a legal route since I get paid under the table and the discrimination is hard to prove.

I was thinking of extorting (blackmailing is kinda racist) him for paying people under the table before quitting. I’d threaten to report him unless he pays me $5,000. Then after I collect the money I will shit on the floor and leave.

The Story: I started at this coffee place a bit ago and caught on to everything pretty easily. In the first few weeks one of the staff members said some pretty awful things about me as well as violated several company policies. She was fired after I brought this up to my boss. My boss has kept me at an arms length since then, she does not engage in any small talk whereas she is very talkative with my other coworkers. I have been kind to her and go above and beyond to make sure she’s happy when i’m around...regardless of all of those things she berates me: I get text after text about everything I “do wrong” yet I’m the one who has picked up several duties since the other girl was fired and is one of the only ones capable of packing and roasting the beans(something she doesn’t know how to do) she never had training shifts with me and expects me to learn off of a clipboard, she constantly will stay only one hour of her scheduled shifts (she works literally 4-5) hours a week yet comes at my throat when one tiny thing is out of place (I literally mean like she got mad over a sharpie being on the counter and not in the drawer)

221,"i’m entering college and decided i want to major in social work (double major w env science) because i genuinely want to help other people, but i feel guilty and like a fraud because when i was younger i used to be really cruel to other people... often for no reason

both irl and online i would just be relentlessly mean and make fun of people, making them feel horrible. i’ve even had a friend tell me they stopped talking to me at the time because it was so bad. i eventually grew up a little and even apologized to some of the people i hurt, but i can’t help but feel my desire to help others feels... fake. how am i now empathetic and people oriented, when i was so mean and antisocial only years ago? i just feel guilty because of it. it’s all i can think about when i think about my future or my desire to help other people... it all just feels disingenuous 

so, how do i stop feeling this way? maybe somebody could even give insight why this is happening in the first place? maybe i’m right?

This means that I’ll be away for ~8 months of the year, but home at the end of December and beginning of January. This will be my first time living by myself, without my family. So far, I’m pretty OK with the fact that I’ll be away from my parents and sister - we’re all very close, but they know that this isn’t forever. I am, however, having a very (very, very, very) hard time having to leave my dog. He’s the family’s dog, but I’d say him and I are closest. I can’t help but bawl when I think about having to leave him. I feel like shit. I can’t tell him that I don’t want to leave him, and that this is something that’s INCREDIBLY difficult for me to do. I can’t tell him that I’m coming back. I can’t tell him  how guilty I feel. I can’t explain that this has nothing to do with me not loving him. This, 100%, is going to be one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. I know that. I have no clue how I’m going to navigate this (I’m already doing a shite job of it...

224,"There's this guy in my online group who just constantly talks about his own mental health issues. Nothing grotesque or anything I think would categorize as a ""red flag"" but it's just a lot of...attention-seeking behavior? I think that's the best way to put it. Keep in mind that we all sorta met online and haven't met in person, ever. 

Every time someone else is going through something, he's supportive, and it's great, and he tries to relate, and somehow it ends up being about his anxiety? Or how he's gonna end up forever alone and never get a partner, etc etc. We've tried to be supportive, and some of us straight up told him to go get a therapist because at the end of the day, we are not his therapist, and none of us should try to be.

My personal option in these situations is to straight up ignore him. I know he's been told to go get a therapist if he needs the help, and there's nothing else I, or anyone else in this group, can do for him. And I feel like the more I interact with him when he gets like this, which is 75% of the time we interact online (though it feels more like 95% these days), I start feeling depressed and that is not a state of mind I have any interest in being in.

A week or two ago, he asked us all what we'd do if he killed himself, and some others in the group straight up had enough and told him to go get a therapist (again). I thought he's finally taken the advice, but it seems he's up to the same old shit again and now this group is falling apart.

Now I know I labeled his behavior as attention-seeking, but that's what it seems like to me (unless I'm being particularly insensitive?)

So I guess my first question is should I even confront him about this? And if so, how should I go about it?",29Jun2020,1

Every relationship I've ever had online has never worked out. I've had at least like 10+ relationships online and none of them have even lasted a year. I've tried everything and I'm just starting to think I'm not meant for online dating. 

I've tried to stop dating online completely as I've seen it not work out for me that well, but it always pulls me back in. Someone flirts with me, I get tempted and then start liking them and it's just a loop.

I have never tried dating irl as I don't even have any irl friends. I tried making one in college and she ghosted me after classes stopped because of quarantine which made me sad. I would love to try to make more friends, but it feels hard or next to impossible because of quarantine. I never really have a chance to go out alone without my mom because I don't have a car yet. Even if I did have a car, where the heck would I even go anyways. 

So can anyone give me advice on how to stop online dating and actually get to know some people irl? Advice on the getting to know people would greatly appreciated because of quarantine and all.

That was two weeks ago (also fully recovered yay!!). Anyway, now I weigh 112.

I make a decent living, I have my own place, no major bills to pay, just a go nowhere life.

Im struggling to find a path, I have little interest in anything I do, i dont mix well with people around my age.

I dont drink or smoke because of seeing the long term affects.

I guess I dont know what to do if I am not at work, I just come home and sit here or walk the dog around the block, and thats been my life.

Nothing really makes me happy, I used to do outdoorsy things like bushcraft, camping, hiking, and so on, but its not the same now.

And the same can be said for everything else I had interests in.

I dont even pursue a partner anymore, ive almost completely lost interest in what little love life I had or tried to find.

I let my cleaning fall behind until I have no choice but to clean, I dont mow the lawn until I get a notice, and the funny thing is I did landscaping and hardscaping on the side for almost 7 years.

236,"This is my first post, I have been on reddit for quite a long time but just recently made an account. So excuse my poor grammar and mistakes, thank you. 

When I was about 7 or 8 I think I was sexually abused. I could be overthinking it but I'm not sure. As a child I use to take the bus home from school, there were a group of older boys who would always pick on me and mess with me. I was a chunky girl so they would make fun of me, I use to get bullied alot as a child so this wasn't that out of the ordinary.

One day I remember the biggest guy of the group sat next to me. I was much younger and short at the time so he scared me. He got really close to me and kept using his body to push me against the window of the bus. I kept trying to push him away, and told him to screw off. Then he touched my thigh, and went up. I kept rubbing me and I almost punched him but I didn't. I'm not sure what I was wearing, it could've been a skirt because he was able to actually touch me there. One of the boys told him to stop and that hes going too far. I remember the guy said ""Dude stop, she doesn't like that."" Over and over. He eventually stopped and moved back to seat with his friends. I remember I almost started crying and I didnt make eye contact with any of them. When I got home I told my mom what had happened. She didn't really take me seriously, all I remember her telling me was that next time those boys do something like that just tell them my big brother will kick their ass. Not in those words, but you get the point. My brother is 10 years older than me btw. I think this event confused me because those boys seemed like they hated me, because all they would do is make fun of me. I didnt possibly understand at the time why he did what he did. 

I'm not sure how many times this happened after that but I do remember they kept messing with me. This would explain why I use to get such bad anxiety when riding buses. Also I'm still a virgin and I have a hard time being physical with guys, I get anxious when anyone tries to touch me there. 

I just recently remembered this event, I think I dismissed it because my mom dismissed it when I was a kid, so I thought nothing of it, even though when it happened it shook me up. 

Was this sexual abuse? Or harassment? I'm not sure what to think of it. Sorry this was so long I just wanted to make sure I included everything.

A few years ago I was outed as being a lesbian and my mum was supportive but my dad was extremely upset about it, to the point he threatened to kick me out (this will be relevant later.) Anyway I was in the car with my parents and two of my siblings today and I asked if my dad could turn on the Bluetooth so I could play some music, he agreed and turned it on but since it’s his car and he’s usually the only one using it, it automatically connected to his. Luckily it didn’t actually play the audio from the video (I think he had his data turned off or something) but I saw the title of it and it was something about xhamster gay porn. I obviously freaked out and went to check who’s phone had connected because I was sure it couldn’t be his but yknow...it was. He blamed it on a ‘glitch’ and laughed it off but wouldn’t let me touch the Bluetooth for the rest of the ride and I’m not sure what’s going to happen next. Should I confront him about it?

241,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 20 year old female who still lives with her parents (especially since this time because we all know we're gonna be broke) but my parents are very strict. One big thing is when I make a big decision for myself it reflects badly to my parents.
For example, last year I had a complication at work and asked my friend (21yo male at the time while I was 19) to pick me up because I didn't want to worry my family (and also because I'm not comfortable going with them to any doctors office bc its always looking for attention"". Of course I told my sister and my mum and I talked to my mom the entire time giving her updates etc. She asked when I'd be home and i said maybe like 5am bc i hadn't seen the doctor and it was already midnight. She responded that she was locking the doors. Through the night I gave her updates and at around 4 30am I went home with my friend. The next morning he took me to get the meds I was prescribed and the moment i got home I was kicked out. So I lived alone for 7 months before I no longer could afford it and had to apologize for something I shouldnt have had to apologize for to come back home.
Now, my dream is to work with animals and travel. The only issue is I cant go to school for it this year as I have no volunteer experience and I cant get it because of the virus. So I was planning to travel to australia for a year and work there on a working holiday from canada since a lot of my friends live there. That way I can gain experience with the animals there too and witness a different culture. Traveling is my ultimate dream. My dad has threatened that if I even go there for two weeks I won't have a home to come back to. I would've been fine with that before, but now I have no friends here that could aid me in the situation when I came back from Australia.
Do i save for a trip to australia and do what i want to most or do I go to school for graphic design, which I'm currently enrolled in but have no interest doing?

242,"Let me start this off by saying I’m in a really weird situation. I have parents living in different states (I mainly live with my dad but all my friends I’ve known for years are near my mom) and I had to move to a new state about 10 months ago. I mainly talk to my old friends (which i still consider my main friend group) and I have opportunities to hang out with some of them like once a month or so. However, where I live, I don’t really know anybody. 

When I moved I was like it’ll be cool to meet new people, but when I went to school I hated it there and the past year so far has been more downs than ups and it was a pretty devastating year for me. I mostly stuck to myself and a few friends there but I only really hung out with one or two outside of school. However, things are looking up because we moved to a nice new house instead of an apartment with a family of five and my life is finally beginning to have a sense of normalcy again. 

My problem is, I can’t drive anywhere because I had to do drivers ed again completely because I moved, I can’t get a job because my dad doesn’t want to risk getting anyone sick (we have a few young ones) and basically, I know maybe 10 people or so from my school let’s be honest. I also have been wanting to get a girlfriend, but it’s hard to do when you can’t go out, and I’m also pretty discouraged since my last one dumped me when I moved. 

Social media is a thing I guess but not really a great way because it’s hard to “know” someone when youre texting, even if I do enjoy texting and FaceTimes. Ive gotten more socially awkward as well. I also usually don’t ask anyone for help because it makes me feel weird and I dunno. I also want to have more motivation to do things as well, and I want to enjoy doing more things besides sitting around (I play guitar and I like video games as well, we live on a pond so I go fishing sometimes too).

Well let me tell you what happened to me a week ago. I had a nightmare that I was shot in the back multiple times, then was left there on the side of the road to die. It felt unbelievably real. I felt the blood drain from my body and the wormth of it around me from me being in a big pool of it. I felt the life drift away as I was on the ground staring up into the black foggy sky. It felt like it was going on for hours. Just me, staring at the sky wondering when I was going to die. Laying there saying my last words. Then it happened, I died in my dream... I heard that if you died in your dream that means you died in real life. Honestly it felt like it. I woke up with my heart rate at 150bpm and my back felt like someone took a razer blade to it, it was burning and so sore. I was breathing heavily and sweaty as hell. 

I'm honestly still struggling to wrap my head around how it felt so real. It was fucking scary.

Ever since then I've been struggling to sleep. It's currently 3am and I gotta be up for 8am tomorrow. I can never sleep for more then an hour now without waking up. I've been so sleep deprived and I'm to scared to tell anyone what happened because they will think I'm crazy.

I find the work this summer much more confusing and frustrating and I know I need to find a way to turn things around by the end of summer. Since the presentation, I have found some more work to do under different supervision which is currently causing me lots of frustration figuring out where to start but I need to find a way to get it done. I plan to start spending an extra hour at work each day starting this week.  Being at work an extra hour each day doesnt necessarily mean I will accomplish more but it increases the opportunity. 

I’m just looking for for maybe some general thoughts or advice from other who have maybe experienced something similar at the start of their career and found a way to find success when they were not satisfied with their accomplishments.",29Jun2020,1
254,So I’ve been broken up with my first serious girlfriend of 2 years for about 5 months now. I still have a stuffed animal she gave me that I hold onto. I think I’ve kept it because it reminds me solely of the good times in our relationship and I haven’t been able to let that go. Over the last few days my eyes have been opened that she wasn’t as kind as I remembered. Even realizing she may have been toxic. Ever since COVID I’ve been so lonely and it’s hard to let go of this item as I’ve developed some sort of child like attachment to it. Any advice?,29Jun2020,1
255,"I’ve been playing football since I was 10 years old (16 now) and it has always been my favorite sport to play.  And luckily enough for me, I’m pretty good at it too.  But I tend to ask myself if I’d be happier if I didn’t play football... I struggle with anxiety pretty bad and just this last year it has gotten worse(just started taking SSRI) and the anxiety of playing football makes me just want to quit.  During the season I always feel stressed out even when I’m kicking ass.  I’m going into my junior year right now and I played mostly varsity last year as a sophomore.

256,"So I just got an email from my college saying their plan for class in fall. Basically it could be online again, “flipped classroom” or social distanced classes, or a mix of both. I’m about the be a junior, biology major, with ADD and dyslexia. I need a lot of help and work really hard for my grades, and non-traditional classes just haven’t been working for me. At the same time, I have friends who have tested positive for COVID within the past few weeks and really don’t feel like going do to normal classes in the fall will be good for anyone. 

My original plan was to finish pre-req classes and then apply to nursing school, but now I think I might just need to take a semester off until things get better. So my question is basically if anyone knows something I could do for the semester? Normally a gap semester would be a good time to travel, but I think that’s pretty much out of the question. I don’t know if there’s really much I can do with half a bachelor’s degree in biology without some kind of certification. I’m a bartender but that only takes time at night (and who knows how long bars will be able to remain open). 
I’m feeling really sad and lost right now, so if anyone has any ideas I would really appreciate it.

Usually I'll tell her ""I can't wait to kill myself"" or ""Just wait until I move out. I'm gonna be dead and finally happy."" She usually responds with ""Don't say that."" and ""That's not good."" She seems visibly uncomfortable whenever I say things like that and I feel fucking terrible but I can't stop. It's summer vacation so she's always in the room and whenever I have one of my depressive episodes I end up in my bed and since she's there I just can't help but say these things. This sounds like fucking terrible reasoning but I think I do it because she's fairly young (9) and I feel like she won't really remember any of the things I say. I don't know. Anyways, I've tried going in the shower to deal with my episodes but I usually have them twice a day so it'd seem pretty weird to my parents if I were taking hour long showers twice a day.

262,"I’m a very anxious person, but ever since quarantine it’s been getting worst. Especially since people in my city use illegal fireworks.

Sadly the next morning my uncles, who where picking up my mom to go to a funeral, almost got into a fight with my neighbor. The reason is because one of my uncles saw that neighbor yelling at my brother. He tried to calm down my neighbor but then the got angry. That caused my other uncle to join in and attempt to fight the guy. Luckily he didn’t. My neighbor has been yelling and once said he knew how to get in backyard for a while now.

263,"Hi! First of all thanks for reading, so, Ím 2.5 or 3 years away from graduating even tho Í´ve been in college for 3 years (changed schools so I lost a year). Ím a female, mexican and 21 years old.

I have been an artsy person since i can remember, my first carreer option was architecture but my bf at the time was studying law and convinced me for 3 years to study that. I enden in a college I didn`t like, was there for a year and a half, moved to my first college option (the one i wanted to study architecture in) and continued studying law. I like it but I don’t find the passion in it anymore. 

This quarantine Í have been playing some games I have to make constructions in, design, etc (think stardoll and habbo hahah), while also been kinda involved in the remodeling of my bf´s house. I`ve been looking a lot of house designs on pinterest, honestly I`ve been for years. Inevitably I regained passion for arquitecture and design again. As I said, Í have always been involved with art so I think this career fits me. 

The problem is, I’ve been studying law for a long time and I would hate to leave it incomplete, since I tend to do that with activities except I love them. I am afraid I will want to go back to law school, or that I am not creative enough. Also, that my mom will have lost 3 years worth of money. But most of all, I am afraid of starting again at 21 years old, with people as young as 17 year old. 

Now, this depends on me being confident enough to change majors, but also on my scholarship (if it also applies in the same school if I change majors)

265,"I’ll be attending law school with in person instruction in the fall, and they are going to be requiring masks when in the building. This is totally reasonable considering the global pandemic, but I am someone who struggles with claustrophobia and other generalized anxiety which is made much worse by the masks. I typically am fine wearing one and can keep my anxiety under control if it is just a short trip to the store, but I am going to be at the law school for probably 8 hours each day since I am a commuter and my husband who is also in law school ha different classes than mine and we drive together. 

I reached out to the university to see what my options were and they sent me a form I can fill out to try and get disability accommodations to not wear a mask. I am hesitant to fill this out as I don’t consider myself to have a disability (with medication and therapy my anxiety is typically well managed)

Should I try and tough it out with a mask or fill out the disability form? I know wearing a mask all day will impede my ability to be present while in class or studying, but I don’t want to be the girl who cried wolf and abused the system. What should I do?",29Jun2020,1

270,"This was posted on r/tooafraidtoask aswell

This happened back in early March/end of February and I didn’t really think about it until now. We were teens at the time.

So I had this friend and we’ll call him Ty. So Ty had invited me over because his parents weren’t home and I came over just to hang out cause we were decent friends. 

He had picked me up and then held me like I was a child and forced me to cuddle with him. He also later pinned me down on the ground trying to kiss me (the whole night he kept trying to kiss me) and I kept struggling to get out of his grip but he knew I wasn’t strong enough to push him off.

The only reason he got off was because his parents came back and he ended up pushing me out the side door and I walked home. 

There’s also this second guy who we’ll call Carlos. We were at a friends birthday party and he purposely tried picking me up for the sole purpose of grabbing my ass. Putting his hands there saying that he was “just trying to hold me up” and then later said that it was okay if I punched him for what he did. He also on another occasion grabbed my breast and yelling out “I grabbed a boob!”

272,"Okay guys so I’ve been stuck in this 3 year relationship. On and off. Definitely toxic relationship. Mentally and abusive relationship. My ex had issues of his own that I couldn’t fix no matter how hard I tried. It for some reason was my fault for helping. I literally put up with his shit. Well sometime in our 2nd year almost going to 3rd year we broke up. Oh let me add I had a baby with him in January so this breakup was in like February. 

I wasn’t allowed on social media, but I opened up my FB account again I just wanted to get away from him, but I reconnected with an old friend I met at a festival and talked to him for awhile during my break up catching up. I had this biggest crush on him when I first met him, but never got a chance with him because he was in a relationship at the time but I respected that, so he’s obviously single even to this current day. Well went didn’t get into anything serious. I explained what had been going on and my ex contacted me breaking stuff in his room and making holes on his wall, so let just call this other guy will. And my ex (ex). 

Will tells me my ex with gaslighting me telling me all this stuff through text because he ex did it to him. I ignored it. Went to go calm down my ex. To make him happy I went back to him and told will I couldn’t continue our relationship because I needed to focus on my family. So this went on for our 3rd year together till the following February. Broke it off again. I decided to message will on Facebook. Payed him back about 200 dollars from surprising me with flowers and payed for my phone bill. I told him how sorry I was and explained everything and just asked to be friends but I totally understood if he didn’t want to talk to me ever again, but he wanted to talk to me. He had been looking for me. I just ghosted everyone. So we went on from there we developed a relationship after a month, and honestly I know I love him. It’s crazy. I’ve known him since I was 16. I’m now 23. 

Then came to wanting to move out of state with him. We’re both from different states. I went out of my way to tell my ex I was moving to with our son. But for some reason he didn’t get that email but had messaged me at the same time asking of our son, so I repeated myself. And he was saying I couldn’t just leave with our son. Mind you my ex hasn’t been the most supportive father since our son has been born so to me I didn’t think it was a issue. 

Don’t get me wrong I care for my ex A LOT, but I don’t love him the same is the issue. So I had to choose between my own happiness and my family. So I stayed for my son to have his father around. And I was not even happy in the relationship anymore. I was mad about anything and my ex wasn’t even trying to make me happy knowing there’s certain things that make me happy. So we broke up, and I’m so pissed because I could of been with will who made me happy and i wasted my time giving my ex the time of day. I wish I could explain to will again how much I love him. And that he’s always had my heart from the first day I met him. It’s just hard I don’t even know if he’d understand this time? I guess I’m asking is it best to just let him be and not say a word?",29Jun2020,1

Yeah so I graduate with my BAchelors in Social Work in three weeks. My local CPS just pulled the registry and I am expecting a letter for an interview any day. My friend from high school is with a man who lost custody of his kids due to an opioid addiction. He’s clean now but our state requires parents meet the Mclendon standard to get their kids back so he’s having to jump through a lot of loopholes. Basically, she found out tonight he cheated on her and completely unloaded on me. Told me that even though she told me they did report it to CPS, they didn’t report an incident that the current custodian (an aunt) told her about where the three year old stuck a pen in the six year olds vagina. That this isn’t the first time that something along those lines has happened and that the six year old had said multiple times that the aunts older son hits her (of which she sent me a video). She told me this a couple of weeks ago and I didn’t do anything because she said it was handled... but it wasn’t. Now I get to go tell CPS what I know and basically look like I’m sucking up to them to get a job, AND I have to admit that I knew and didn’t say anything because I trusted my friend to do it. They are already going to be hesitant to hire me because they had an employee kill her self last year and it came out after she died that my stupid father (who I haven’t had much of a relationship with ever and haven’t lived with since I was two years old) was having an affair with the girl (who is my age) so I’m already fighting an uphill battle. 

This is the second time I’ve been put in a situation like this in less than a year. I want to cry. I just want to help kids and now I may never get to do that because no one is going to hire me after this.",29Jun2020,1

Hi you can call me nay, 


Hi! I’m having a family issue especially with my older brother, growing up I was loved my brother I wanted to be like him strong,smart,and funny! I did everything to get him to like me when people talked about him behind his back I would stand up for him getting myself hurt in the process because they were bullies. It also didn’t help that my brother would hurt me too and bully me every day.

My 7 year old self put up with it until I broke down running to my mother crying and telling her what he had been doing. After me calming down she looked at me and said “this is what brother and sister do they push each other around sometimes,you’ll be ok”. That’s when I learned that I can’t rely on her anymore. I continued to put up with the bullying for years. 

By the time I entered middle school my self esteem had been destroyed, By the end of middle school my personality had changed I went from kind and sweet to nasty and mean, I became this from my brother actions I had sadly be came the bully. When my family had noticed I became the “bad guy” because by brother had became “nice and adorable” I was now the mean one in the family.

Now when he come to me I’ll kick him out not share my food and from what my mother says “I’ll be a bitch to everyone” I was a bitch I am afraid of the same bullying happening again I became “cold” and “rude”. Now I feel I’m just the bad one in the family that I need to be what they want in order to make everyone happy and to stop the bullying I tried to be what they wanted now I just don’t care I because I’m out of options i need advice to know what my next step is to be I just wanna know am I the bad guy?

275,"I'm 17M. Ever since the 6th grade my peers around me were starting to throw around the idea of romantic relationships. Now as a 6th grader I think that it is normal to have a crush on somebody, but I simply didn't have one. I thought that it wasn't a big deal and kept on keeping on. Then 7th grade happened, still nothing, then 8th grade, then freshman year, still nothing. At this point almost everyone in my class has been in a relationship, and I started wondering why I haven't been able to find any of the girls at my school attractive, and it's not like they aren't nice or pretty or anything, it's just I've never developed romantic feelings for anyone. So the question of why I was like that started to linger in my head. Than sophomore year happened and I wanted someone to be with, like I was just lonely all the time, but still I couldn't find any romantic feelings inside of me. At this point two girls have confessed that they liked me ( one freshman year and one sophomore year ) and instead of being excited at the possibility of a relationship, I kindly told them that I didn't share their feelings, but it all ended up nice both of them are still some of my closest friends. The reason I said no to them though was because I didn't see myself enjoying a romantic relationship with them. So I was feeling the big sad.

Then one day an idea popped into my mind, I might be gay. This makes me really scared... Ok some context of why. So my family consists of my parents and my older brother. Both of my parents are actively vocal about how they dislike people who are not straight, and my brother is even more vocal, as in he makes fun of people by calling them gay or something like that and he also goes out of his way to make sure people are anti-gay before starting conversations with them. And on top of all of that my school, although has a club for that sort of thing, obviously shares the same opinion as my brother. Now personally I don't really have a problem with consept of it ,but I find it irritating that when people are confident that they are gay they have to shout it from the rooftops and demand special treatment because of it. Like no. I hate that. And small side tangent, not to throw shade or anything but if I look at this scientifically, gay people are kinda a glitch in humans, based purely on how species survive ( I have a feeling that I'm gonna regret saying that but I'm too lazy to delete it so) Now that leads back to me. When I look at myself and imagine myself in a romantic relationship with a girl and a guy. I find myself thinking about the guy and having more comfort, but every fiber of my being wants me to be straight. So yeah I don't know what to do pls help.",29Jun2020,1

279,"So no problems have occurred yet, but I can see it easily happening. Also, I'm really not sure how some of the stuff works when it comes to requesting time off etc.

I'm entering the corporate world. I am lucky and it seems there's a movement at the moment for more queer visibility in my field, so my side shaves, motorbike, and piercings don't really give me problems. 

I also have only JUST gotten my first job in my field, and it was specific they're ""looking for more indigenous staticians"" so it seems my style is fine for the corporate world.

However my partner and I are working on family planning when we graduate (I'm 3rd year, they're 1st) and they're the one who's going to be pregnant. However, I planned to take hormones to breastfeed, as my partner had a double mastectomy.

I'm not sure how ""surprising"" it's going to be to my coworkers to have a pregnant bearded partner while I run off to the bathroom to pump and save my milk. Like, it's not a common situation, I'll give it that. Will I even be allowed bathroom breaks to pump breast milk if I'm not pregnant? Like??? What's the precedence for that one??

I don't know how to break it to coworkers/boss that my partner will be pregnant but I'll need m/paternity leave too.

While it's not for a few years, the planning stages and corporate world have already started to blend. People ask me about my family, future and things like that. It seems OK until they meet my partner and since my partner looks like a man, they end up a bit stunned. They can handle the lesbian statician thing, but the rest seems to make their brain do star jumps to try to work out wtf is going on.

How do I continue my work professionally but also address issues with coworkers and bosses about my lifestyle? How do I tell a boss no I won't be pregnant but I need maternity leave to breastfeed our kids? It seems like a lot of stuff shouldn't be work's business, but when it comes to time off and family planning it kinda becomes works business?

I don't know quite what I'm asking because specific issues haven't come up yet, except for a ton of misgendering, but whatever par for the business course that one. I just don't know what to expect or how to balance these things.

Does anyone have any experience in business with family planning as a trans and queer couple? How did it go for you at work? Did you need to involve HR when someone made a bad comment or was it reasonable to deal with?

I don't want to be the ""UGH JUST GENDER ME CORRECTLY"" coworker, but I'd also like to be respected at work. Advice?",29Jun2020,1
281,"Hi, I admittedly have been eating out an obscene amount, and today I decided I needed to not do that anymore. I opened a drawer in my kitchen to get some measuring cups, and in the back corner of said drawer I see what looks to be a very small baby snake. I poked it with a fork, and it was not only dead, but completely stiff and dried out.

283,"So, almost 2 months ago I matched this girl on a dating app and we started texting. We texted for like 3 days and then I asked for her Instagram and we started texting there. After we started chatting on insta things were going really well, we found lots of common interests and lots of opinions we shared. 

We constantly texted for 1 month with a few interruptions of 1 or 2 days. Also sometimes we both took a bit of time to respond (I guess none of us wanted to seem needy or obsessed but we never discussed the time we took to reply so I think that's chill). Because of the virus situation we couldn't date but in the meantime I asked her if she wanted to when the situation was more controlled and she said ""absolutely yes"". The chemistry seemed so perfect.

We were always asking questions about each other and always laughing, flirting and teasing each other, being sarcastic, etc. It was going so well. She loved my sense of humor, my relaxed way of being and my intelligence (she said it herself), she also said she loved talking to me.

 After that month of constantly texting, her exams started. The virus situation was getting better but since she had to study I thought it would be innapropriate to try to set the date. Since her exams season was getting started and she studies law, I decided not to text her much while she was studying for the exams because I genuinely didn't want to distract her. Her exam season lasted almost 3 weeks and during that time I texted her like 3 times just asking how she was doing and how were her exams going and her answers were always simple and aloof, so I didn't insist on carrying the conversation and I also didn't want to bother her while she studied. I thought it was ok and normal for her to reply like that because she had to study and was busy, and I just wanted to keep things alive between us so thats why I texted her with those basic questions (big mistake I guess)

Her exam season ended 3 days ago and her holidays started, so yesterday I texted her at midnight after 8 days of no contact because she was studying and I didn't want to bother (I was drunk... Why the fuck would I start a conversation at midnight? Another big mistake) and I still have no response after more than 24 hours. I just said ""Hey how are you doing?? Did you manage to finish all your exams without going insane? *laughing emoji*"" She hasn't even read the message and she was online at most part of today, and she also posted an insta story at her place so she was home which means she was not busy which means she doesn't want to answer me for some reason.

I really need some help with this, what should I do? Should I just wait for her to reach out again? Am I just tripping and everything is ok? Where did I fuck up?
I know I never met her but I was really enjoying talking to her, she is awesome and we have much in common and I really don't wanna loose the chance to meet her. Why would she ghost me after so much great conversations, we shared so many things about each other.
 
Also, I know some of the things I wrote may seem ridiculous to some of you, but I'm a 21yo guy who has never had a girlfriend and went on one date for my entire life so I have 0 experience in the dating game. And yes, I'm needy even though I try my best not to show it to her, because I have never experienced human affection and I'm 21 (I know its sad but it is what it is).

I would really appreciate if you guys helped me, any advice is useful!",29Jun2020,1

287,"Title says it all. I've had multiple arguments with my parents who are saying that the requirement to wear masks is a violation of their rights. When I ask what rights they say the right to clean air. When I say more than other human lives, they say I'm communist. 

They did not go to college. They not scientifically minded. They are conspiracy theorists who are also anti vax and say that Bill Gates is the antichrist. They claim all the numbers are false, masks don't reduce spread because of covid because it's ""invisible"" and there's no way to tell, and that it's all some game for control.

Because of that, they can't accept the upfront reality that mask = save lives. I can't argue with them. and I can't stand this anymore.

I'm back home from college. I could fly back and live with a friend, but then I'd be away from my little brother, who I already dont see much because of school, and will probably grow up to be like my parents buying their dangerous theories. My parents weren't anti vax when I was a child, so I'm okay thankfully. 

Is it worth it to leave? I'm 19 so it's not like they can stop me. But leaving my little brother would break my heart. However I can't even stand to look at my parents right now. I currently lock myself in my room and only come out to bring back food when I know they won't see me.",29Jun2020,1
288,"TW: invading privacy, suicidal ideation, depression

I hope this is okay to post. I'm now 19 years old. 
Recently I've blocked my mother. 
One of the reasons was because of her political views. She's a major trump supporter while I'm not. (Kinda irrelevant but we fought on that a bit)
The main reason is because she is still with her husband. 
Basically, in april of 2017 (I was 16 at the time) I found a video of me in the bathroom getting into my shower on her husbands phone. I had found it at 12 in the morning because my mother and said husband were off at a hotel for a mini vacation for their anniversary (he left me the phone for emergencies). I had to wait until the next day to talk to my mother. 
When they returned early that morning, he had immediately taken the phone back so I asked to go on a drive with my mom. I told her what I found, I was sobbing and apologizing as if it's my fault and she turned us around and immediately went to talk to him. He basically admitted to it, said it was revenge on my mother, tried to bribe me by saying he'll buy me a dog if I drop this whole issue, then said he didn't even watch it. 
Basically to sum up the next month, my mother called the police, I got a temporary restraining order,  went to court 4 days after i found the video but couldnt get a yearlong one due to him not being deemed ""unsafe"", he was told to get counseling and he is not allowed to drive a school bus. Not even a month passes by and my mother decides to stay with him. The next few months are essentially torture. 
I was in shock unfortunately and didn't get to properly process what had happened. It was a few months after the court hearing when I realized he had been basically grooming me while I was growing up with him. When I told my mother she essentially blamed me. Said things like ""well why didnt you bring it up in court"" or ""he didnt groom you"". 
This happens for a long time. I became extremely depressed and idolized suicide. I was often left home alone, she would take my brothers to go see him because he lived in my papa's old house. 
I moved out to another state to live with my aunt in summer of 2018. I often got into fights with my mother about this issue. I realized more and more wrong things that he did and I was still blamed in some way. She still insists that he's her soulmate, a match made by god. 
2019 I fought with her a lot. I got in touch with my dad and turns out my mother lied a lot in regards to my father. 
I recently blocked my mother because my depression has gotten horrible for me. It hurts me knowing that my brothers are being raised by her husband. 
I got into a bad fight with her a few weeks before I blocked her. It went from political beliefs to this issue. I stopped responding to her calls. I ignored her texts. I eventually messaged her and called her out for guilting me and denying what i experienced. The conversation ended and I blocked her a few days later. She keeps trying to talk to me. I gamed with my brothers recently and she got on my younger brothers headset and tried to say hi to me and when she didnt hear my response, threatened to ground said younger brother. 
At this point I'm just ranting and I apologize. I really have no idea what to do anymore. I dont want to unblock her but I also don't want this guilt following me everywhere. What should I do? I've fought with her so much I barely have the energy to try and talk to her. I don't even want to talk to her. 
I know it's a long read and I'm sorry. 

I'm also new to reddit so I'm sorry. 

Summing it up: 
Mother stays with husband who violated my privacy, blames me, guilts me; we fight a lot so I blocked her after a big fight.",29Jun2020,1
289,"My mom has had a lot of trauma growing up. She was separated from her mom at 3 and raised by her abusive father who sexually abused her and had her in and out of foster homes. She met my dad when we was 17 and they've been together since. She's very controlling and can be manipulative to get her way, and doesn't like dealing with being confronted with things she does wrong. She'll twist it to make herself seem like the victim and start spiraling, and we've always dropped everything to comfort her, ignoring our own feelings and bottling things up as to not upset her. She's been obese ever since she was pregnant with me 25 years ago, and has been a stay at home mom for the last 26 years. I have three siblings, and three out of the four of us have all moved out, which is when her depression got worse. 

Last year she was diagnosed with breast cancer and decided to get both breasts removed, and she's had a lot of complications with healing which has put off her reconstructive surgery. My Nana (dad's mother, who had taken my mom is when they started dating to help her avoid the foster system) passed away at the end of last year from cancer, and because of my mom's surgery and radiation she wasn't able to be there for her final days nor the funeral. My mom was already depressed because of her weight, us moving out, the cancer, and now my Nana. 

I found out I was pregnant a week after my Nana passed and my mom was beyond thrilled. I am the oldest and this will be her first grandchild. 

Recently my oldest brother stopped talking to my mom because of some personal and political choices she has made, and he has tried to confront her about them and she had shut him down and said that hes attacking her and she is playing the victim. My father doesn't want to talk about it, and I'm trying to keep the peace with my baby about to be born soon, but it's been years of stuff we've bottled up all coming out now. This added onto her list of things making her depressed. 

She told me she's been depressed and suicidal, and I've asked her to please seek therapy to help her learn how to talk about her feelings in a healthy way. She said she doesn't need a therapist, that's why she talks to me and her friend. She told me that the only thing thats keeping her alive is going to be my baby and that makes me feel sick. I want my mother to want to live for herself, and not for my daughter. I also have a 12 year old brother who still lives at home with her, and she said that when the three oldest moved out it felt like she had an empty nest. I don't know how to help my mother. My father won't get her therapy, and if he tried to I'm sure my mom would refuse it. I started seeing a therapist a couple of years ago and when my mom found out she cried and started blaming herself for me needing therapy. She also doesn't trust therapists because she's afraid of being taken to a mental ward.

Any advice on how to handle this with my mom would be greatly appreciated... I haven't told anyone that my mom said she's only living because of my soon to be born child and it's been weighing heavily on me.",29Jun2020,1

291,"Alright Reddit, buckle up. I'm in a position right now where I'm not really sure what to do, and I could use some advice. This post may kind of jump around, so just bear with me. 

To give some background information, my great grandpa passed away when I was younger and left my brother and I both $5,000 each. This money was to be used when we got older on things such as first vehicles, college, rent, big life milestones. However, when I was in high school (I'm now in my senior year of college) my parents asked my brother and I if they could borrow the money to buy a new house. We of course said yes, because we wanted to not live in a trailer snd my parents said they would pay us back in the next few years. Fast forward to now and my parents have announced that they are buying a piece of land out of state and building a house on it. I asked if that meant me and my brother would be paid our money back, since they had enough money to buy land and a new house. They said that no, they couldn't pay either one of us back right now, even a good chunk of it, because they just bought the land. Meanwhile, I am struggling to get into an apartment off campus, and only have a part-time job to keep me afloat. I did not get s stimulus check. I live paycheck to paycheck. I have paid for my college all 3 years including housing, food, tuition, gas, etc. I have worked every semester while going to school and have had two jobs at the same time multiple semesters. My brother just graduated high school and turned 18. He plans to go to the same school as me in the fall, but will get substantially less scholarships than me. He said that he almost has enough money to afford it, but doesn't know if he'll be able to. He works his ass off as he works for my parents 40 hours a week and has his own business on the side. He is one of the hardest workers I've ever known. 

What my parents did today really was a last straw for both of us. My parents have been on an out of state vacation for the past week. My brother, who still lives at home, has had to stay home and do all of the work outside by himself. I won't disclose the nature of my parent's business as I don't wish to be identified, but it does deal with live animals that cannot be left alone for more than a few hours in the heat. So my parents get home from this vacation and tell my brother, ""we can't afford you anymore, so we're cutting your weekly pay to $200 for 40 hours and you'll have to start paying rent and your truck insurance."" Yes you read that right, $5 an hour. This is manual labor outside in the 100 degree heat. This came as a complete shock to my brother. He explained that he hadn't fought with them or gotten in trouble. They just announced out of the blue that they were going to steal his money basically. My brother expects to get kicked out soon, as he said he's since started being a dick to them because he is angry. I told him he needs to leave as soon as he can anyways. I've offered him my place rent free and to help him find a job in the city I live in. I know he could find a job, as he is a great worker and very mechanically inclined. 

I am scared of what they may do to my brother if he stays there. I believe my parents are both ticking time bombs in their own ways. My mom is already very manipulative and can be downright controlling if she wants to be. My dad has a history of losing his cool and becoming violent. 

I am currently trying to move into a new apartment and am also scared for my parents to co-sign an apartment with me because I feel they may rip it away from me randomly. They meet the minimum income requirements, I don't, but I'd still be the one paying for everything. My boyfriend is considering co-signing instead, as he makes enough money and basically lives with me anyways. I told him to not feel pressured to take care of me because my parents are failing to. But I would trust him more with the lease than my parents.",29Jun2020,1

In the middle of our friendship I started developing a crush on him and it got to the point where i was rubbing his abs which he let me do for some reason and asking if we could kiss (once) to prove im not gay, because the kids on big mouth did it to prove one of the characters wasnt gay. We eventually stopped becoming friends (for other reasons, he didnt like how sensitive I was so he stopped being my friend) and after the friendship i was really sad and started dreaming about him alot which resulted in me emailing him, making fake snapchat/instagram accounts to get a hold of him, alot of shit with long paragraphs about how im sorry for the gay shit and sorry for being sensitive and telling him i can change and i wont be sensitive anymore and shit like that. One day we came up with an agreement to only talk to him when i really thought i need to or something like that i dont really remember, and we havent talked for like 26 days now. I also have another friend who has been my friend for probably a longer amount of time than I've been friends with Tyler, I met him at a dave &amp; busters back in 2017. We exchanged phone numbers and started facetiming and eventually started hanging out together. 3 years later and were best friends now. When I met him he was 13 and I was 17 and now he is 16 and I am 20. So my friend who is 16 is kind of a pervert, actually no a HUGE pervert and is super sexual. He used to be gross and weird on facetime whenever we talked (me tyler and him) and he would make some sexual jokes plus he would spam me but now everything is sexual. You know what idk what else to type long story short ive been starting to act sexual towards my friend and even asked if he would kiss me as a joke cause he said nothing i say bothers him and he said no to kissing (obviously) and i slap his butt alot and in return he slaps mine but he dosent care. today though i crossed the line cause i went to the bathroom then came out and sat on his lap (we were at my other friends house upstairs watching him play games and we were really bored) and he started humping as a joke so i twerked a little bit as a joke too and i think he got a boner after (cause i looked down and saw a lump in his pants). Also i saw his dick probably a couple times so far.Once by accident, once because he was flashing me, and another time because i dared him to whip his dick out in the park we were at (nobody was outside though). Also he said (as a joke im sure) that mabye when hes 18 we could date and i said ""bet"". I feel like im becoming a pedophile and honestly this shit scares me and makes me uncomfortable af. I don't wanna hurt my friends or make them feel uncomfortable but i also dont know what to do or how i should fix this shit. i might update this post more or if anyone has anything to say or has any questions about all of this let me know and ill respond. 

TL;DR: I'm 20 and i was attracted to my 15 year old ex best friend at 18/19 and now I'm 20 and attracted to my 16 year old current best friend.",29Jun2020,1
306,"\--Summary is below if needed

**Important info:** Im really interested in animation (3d or 2d), art, video game development, and music careers for the feeling of creative freedom and for my interest of making my own game in the future. 

I want to switch from my private school to online school for my senior year so I can continue learning art and animation considering its a skill that needs to be developed and Im almost an adult, but should I? I have absolutely no interest in attending an Ivy league college so Im thinking about going to Full Sail University if I do decide to go to a college (I am also just fine attending community college if needed).

If I do switch, how can I learn math to learn game development? I couldn't retain the math I learned in private school due to the other 5 overlapping classes (I hope this doesn't sound like a lousy excuse as a reason why I couldn't learn math) and I'm not sure if just a normal online or charter school will be fine for my math needs.

TL;DR---- Really I'm just worried about moving from private school to pursue my dream careers but Im also looking for a school that gives me the flexibility I need to continue art and animation without absolutely overwhelming me and at the same time help me with my interest in math. I hope my situation is understandable and Im very interested in hearing your thoughts and opinions.",29Jun2020,1

309,"Hi everyone,

I am really hoping to get some solid advice here.
Last year I worked at an apartment complex. The people who ran the office are complete racists. They have “loopholes” to try and get around renting to black people, and when they have no choice but to rent, they refer to the black residents as ghetto (behind their backs of course). When requests for maintenance come in, white people are always taken care of before black people. Both managers specifically told me that they would avoid renting to black people all together if they could. These are only a couple of examples of the blatant racism and discrimination demonstrated by this company.
When I tried to reach out to upper management about this, I was stonewalled and eventually fired

Now, I want to write and mail letters to every resident in that complex informing them of exactly what type of people they are renting from.

Is this wrong? Is it illegal?",29Jun2020,1
310,"So I’m going into my freshman year this year, and I signed up for a new sport, a sport which I’ve never played before. I like being athletic, and it would also increase my GPA . I’m all for trying new things, and I’ve been looking forward to being able to play it! But recently I’ve been informed that in order for me to join my school team, I’d have to attend a week long camp over the summer. This wouldn’t usually be a problem, but the camp interferes with my yearly trip to Ohio, during which is the only time I get to see my dads side of the family. This trip is INCREDIBLY important to me. It’s the only time I get to see my grandparents, my cousins (who I am very close to), and the only time I really get to relax. At home I’m like a second mommy, constantly making dinners, looking after my siblings, cleaning up after everyone, walking my dog, etc. At my grandmothers house I’m spoiled like royalty. I get to go shopping, eat great food, and when I’m not spending times with loved ones, I just get to lay around all day. It’s one of the few places on earth I TRULY can be at and not be stressed 24/7. Not only that, but my parents don’t attend the trip, and now with quarantine, it would be my first time away from them in a LONG time, and that’s something I’ve really been looking forward too. If I don’t do this camp though, I won’t be able to do ANY sports through out the entirety of my first year. I need advice, so very much.",29Jun2020,1
311,"I’m going to tell this story in order as much as I can so you can best understand my confusion. 

Context: I live in a family of six, mom, dad, two older sisters, and one younger. I am the only boy my parents had.

Throughout all elementary school I liked girls. I had crushes on girls that I thought looked pretty (I had a type and everything). I always grew up thinking I would marry a girl who was a bit of a tomboy, smart, funny, a little nerdy, and truly loved me. We would have kids and live a long romantic life together. I wasn’t very social and when I was I hung out with girls because I didn’t like sports, and that’s all that the boys ever played. I didn’t know really anything about LGBTQ things except for the fact that they existed.

Middle school came around and that was when my oldest sister finally came out as a lesbian. My parents were livid to say the least(we are religious but only a little). Over time they came to be very accepting and now talk about it pretty casual. They’re still a bit homophobic in ways that are hard to explain but here’s a real (paraphrased) conversation my mom and, slightly more homophobic, nana had
Mom: I wish daughter came home more often but she’s always with that girl
Nana: why don’t you invite them
Mom: I try but I think that girl is keeping daughter from coming. I saw something that said lesbian relationships are crazy since the go through so much when developing their sexuality. Do you think it’s true or am I overthinking.
Nana: that girl might be. I heard that lesbians are very clingy.
Keep in mind that my mom is genuinely ask a question to get a better understanding of my sister, also she just doesn’t like the girl but is fine with her dating girls. This was the first time I knew someone in a relationship like this. I noticed I have never been in a relationship and wondered why. I noticed that whenever I talked to a girl I was interested in I just became friends with them, and soon thought of them as nothing more. Through overhearing other kids I found out what porn was. I soon found out after a quick google search it had no effect on me, but I also found out I thought guys were attractive. I found out I was gay, and to this day no one knows. This was when one of my friends introduced me to his gay friend. He was the first gay guy I met. I wasn’t attracted at all, but I learned a lot more about LGBTQ. This soon lead to me meeting more of my friends friends. One girl from his friend group was bi and asked me out. I went with it not knowing what would happen, would I start to like girls again. No, I wasn’t into her. I just told her I was extremely flattered but I just wanted to be friends.

I got a job soon and next year I was starting high school. My job was working with other kids my age. One day a new girl came in, me being an introvert didn’t say anything. A little later we found out we have a lot in common. I really started to like her. Whenever I saw I shared a shift with her I would get happy to work and play Pokémon go together in our free time. I started to realize I really liked her. I felt like I could be with her. The only issue is I still don’t feel any sexual attraction towards girls. She eventually stopped working with me and moved on. I’m still friends with her on Pokémon go and we send each other gifts but it’s not anything serious like texting or calling. I missed her. When high school started I noticed that almost all my friends went to a different school. I started making new friends slowly and two girls I thought were cute in  elementary school started to be my friends. I also noticed I started liking one of them. These two people were the first girls I liked in 3 years. I was so so so confused. 

I want to come out to my family but I don’t want to give a half answer. I know they’re going to be a bit disappointed that their only son who was raised to be a “real man” has very little chance of marrying a girl, but I also know they will accept me. I know if I tell them now they will subconsciously hang onto the little hope I end up with a girl. I want them to know I’m still the same person and they shouldn’t think I’m different and wonder if I’m going to have a crazy relationship or that my SO isn’t going to be clingy. I want it to be clear what I am. I want to know if this is me trying to be what my parents want. I need to know who I am.

TL;DR
When I was young I liked girls and genuinely thought I’d marry one. When I was in junior high I found out I liked guys and had no sexual attraction towards girls but was still confused on my sexuality. Now I’m high school I found out it was rare but possible I liked girls only in a romantic way. I want to come out but don’t want to confuse my parents like my sister did when she came it.",29Jun2020,1
312," So my brothers and I are all suppose to be in high school but LB(little brother) turned to homeschooling. We moved four years ago and that’s when the hatred started. Now my OB (older brother) and I are way closer than we are with LB. We kind of grew disliking for him after we realized we worked hard but he got more stuff. Now I never fought my LB out of anger but OB has. Multiple times. All the ones I know happened in front of me and it started with them getting annoyed at each other’s existence. 
   Tonight was the last straw of me not knowing what to do and not knowing what they are really feeling. I don’t want to force myself into their problems but don’t want them to despise each other when we grow up and have families.

314,"Okay I know this sounds really stupid but— I've been thinking about this a lot, half of my day consists of me thinking if I'm straight or something else. I'm attracted to both genders but I'm not sure if I'm attractive in _that way towards females. Like if you were to ask me if I could be in a relationship with a girl, I'd say yes. But the only reason I'm even making a post about this is because I'm not sure if I can be in love with a female the same as you would with a man. I'm so confused. You know how girls are already comfortable around each other, they can hug, kiss each other on the cheek, sleep in the same bed, I don't know— share clothes too and everything else, so I'm not sure how to differentiate friendship from an actual attraction towards them. I don't know if I just see them as a friend or something more, I can't put an emotion to how I feel.

315,"I’ve moved past the stage of hookups, meaningless hangouts, and parties. Now I’m 23 and really want to just chill and settle down with a partner. I’ve know this guy for 2 years by texting occasionally and on Facebook. He‘s definitely not the hookup or party type though. I’m used to dating “bad boys”, but he’s the exact opposite. He’s extremely religious, shy, doesn’t smoke, and doesn’t even cuss. He’ll drink wine occasionally. He asked me to go to a concert with him and drink wine, and I said yes. He seems like a sweet guy. I don’t know him *extremely* well, but I know quite a bit about him. He made sure to emphasize ”FRIEND”— that he bets we’ll be great friends. I guess I was expecting...a date? Then, he included his sister in it by asking if she could go with us which I thought was a bit strange? Lol. A couple of months ago, he said that he wasn’t interested in dating someone who smokes, but then he proceeds to heart my text messages, send me messages daily, and tag me in gifts you would give a potential girlfriend on Facebook. It’s a little odd. He’s a shy guy, so I don’t know if that could be it or what. It’s strange because I have other guys who are begging to date me, and I want someone who doesn’t seem to want me that way. Lol. Any advice after reading the info above? Why do you think he’s wanting to “hang out as friends” rather than go on a date? What should I do since I’m looking for a relationship and not just a male friend?

317,"Lord this title makes me sound like such an incel.    

For reference I was born in the USA and am pretty Americanized. My pool of friends has been like 50% Asian and 50% other. I've had ""success"" with girls of which 90% are Asian and 10% Hispanic. I consider myself pretty lucky all things considered. But I've just been on a long dry spell that is exacerbating the situation.  

When I see an Asian female with a white guy I have a cocktail of conflicting feelings. On the one hand it upsets me because I resent that white guys just generally have more success with all races of girls and it doesn't help that they're reducing the pool of already few girls that are willing to date Asians (or she's an Asian girl that doesn't date Asians, yay). On the other hand, I know it's not this fucking guy's fault. Asian girls are hot and I don't blame him for being with her. Or actually I do(?) because I feel this deep unsettling resentment that mixes with self-loathing.  

I'm sure a lot of girls are going to say ,""I would date Asian guys!"" But let's be real it's rough out there for a lot of us poor Asian dudes. I know there are subreddits like /r/AsianMasculinity but I just find it cringey because it's almost like an Alcoholics Anonymous group vibe? Am I really suppose to see being Asian as a handicap? I guess it's harder to argue that it is not. I do work on myself by lifting weights/running and focus on growing my career. I also will grow some balls and just talk to random girls I see in public occasionally. This has resulted in some decent success but I guess COVID has obviously reduced this opportunity. I just don't know how to shake this.  

tl;dr: Pretty much the title. Would appreciate any sort of input.",29Jun2020,1
318,"WARNING!!! Before you read this, this is going to be a really long post. I am going be explaining to you most of my life in several paragraphs.

Hey there. I just turned 21 about a month ago. I realized my life is very boring and I don’t have a lot of friends. Uhh I don’t really know how to say this but I’m kind of scared. Not like I am scared of superstitions or anything but I am scared for my future. It clicked in my mind that i’ve been held back a lot by my family, specifically my dad (very overprotective). Not in like school or anything but just in general. My dad basically just chose things for me, FYI, I’m Asian.

I never really got to live my life in my junior years and my high school years. There were so many things I wanted to do in those years such as play sports (even though I wasn’t the best), hang out with friends, even get a gf. Up till this day, I still don’t have one. 

I had 1 great opportunity my junior year of high school. I wasn’t really popular (even though I tried to hang out with the popular kids, they were rich and played sports and did all fun things, I was probably a little bit under the average middle class) and I happened to fall in love with a girl a year and grade lower than me (shophmore) and she fell in love with me too. Freshman year was when she fell in love with me, for me it was my sophomore year. And I tell you this, she was so popular, everybody knew her. Guys would always try to hit on her, girls always around her, she was a soccer nerd and a cheerleader. Teachers knew her and she was just this girl that anyone would fall in love with. Trust me, 3 of my cousins tried getting at her, I was the only she was interested in (my cousins where somewhat better looking than me too). She was downright gorgeous (20/10). Her personally is out of this world and perfect wife material. Not a single bad bone in her body and is very genuine. She is not like those hot ass girls that have a shitty attitude. She was different and that was why everyone liked her so much. She looks like an Instagram model and still does to this day and the fact that she fell in love with me (an average looking male 6/10) made me lose my mind. But long story short, she moved to Nevada (from California) and at the time it was prom month time. Guys were asking girls left and right to be their prom date. She and I had some setbacks like the beginning of my junior year so we just kinda became distant but we respected each other. I wish at that time I had the balls to break the rules and ask her to be my gf but I was always scared. My dad would always tell me to don’t worry about girls, just focus on school. I’m a nice dude and a good son but I think that the reason why I couldn’t ask her was because I was just too scared of my dad being disappointed in me. I was being held back by my dad’s rules. I would just make up excuses to hide the fact that I was so scared to ask her out. Those excuses being my dad doesn’t want me to date, and my dad would be mad if I started dating. So I just left it at that. 

Fast forward before she left, it was passing period and I always walk past her most of the time and say a warm hello, she would reciprocate too. But something was different, she was crying, multiple girls crying next to her. I asked her what happened but she didn’t say anything. I was confused and just went to my next class (office assistant). I just sat there for 20 mins and thought what could have happened and hoped that it wasn’t too bad like leaving to another state. Then out of nowhere she was walking to the library with her laptop and charger. I asked my teacher if I could leave for a sec, she said yeah and I just ran to her from my class. I met up with her and asked what was wrong. The next words that she said shocked me so much, I was left speechless, I was paralyzed. The thing I dreaded for so long came true. She said she was moving out of state with her family and she just hugged me and said “It was nice knowing you”. I hugged her for about 3 seconds, smelled her hair, idk, it was in my face. Then when I let go, I didn’t know what to say. I just said alright and we left our separate ways. I wish I’ve could have said something way better but I was just so shocked. My heart broke and sat in my last classes not paying attention. My sister’s boyfriend picked me and my sister up in his car (my dad didn’t know my sister was dating). Throughout the ride, I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. I went home quickly and called her. Long story short I messed it up with that phone call and messed up future phone calls so she just stopped talking to me. It sounded like I was desperate, but I mean it was the first time I ever felt that way with someone, especially with someone reciprocating those feelings towards me too. Now she has moved on and followed her dream to be in the Air Force and she did. I’m telling you, chicks in the Air Force are hot. “I” on the other hand am just lost. 

That is one big story of how my dad kinda ruined my high school experience. I was held back by my dad and was scared to break his rules because he knew what was best for me. Fast forward a couple years, I go to college, get a useless degree, decided to work at Popeyes and take a break from college. My dad told me to get a full time job if I wasn’t going to school anymore. He had a friend in a shipping company where they just fix boxes (for like wine bottles or soda cans). 12 hour shifts and I was working at Popeyes for 6-7 hours, 5 days a week. Literally work from 4-11 at Popeyes, come home, shower and eat, sleep for a couple of hours and go to the box company at 4am and work my ass off till 3:30pm and race myself home to get dressed and not be late for work at Popeyes, 4-11. Did this for 3 more days and I just couldn’t take it anymore. Legs were tired from standing for about 15-20 hours a day, boring job at the box company and just quit. While working in the box company, I told myself, “Is this what I want to do for the rest of my life?” And then I just decided that I want to go back to college. So I quit and go back to working at Popeyes part time, then enroll for Spring 2020 and pass my classes and now this Fall 2020 semester, I could probably finish and get my business degree. 

Now here is where I am stuck. I have about 20k-30k saved up but I am scared to leave my home. 3 of my sisters have left and only 1 is struggling financially. The others are secure with their husbands making at least 50k a year. The other husband is in the army but is a recruiter. 
I’ve been with my family for 21 years and have been held back by them and that story above is 1 example of how I was held back. I asked my dad that I may leave Jan 2021 but he says things that make me doubt myself. “How are you going to make it out there? You can’t just work at Popeyes for years. If you are going to live on your own, it is going to cost $2000+ including expenses like food, clothes, accidents, rent, etc. You only make $1200 each month. You need to find a better job.” As my dad said making me doubt myself. About my dad, at a young age (6-10), he had to live with his great grandma during the retreat of the mass slaughtering in Laos. We were helping the US in a war and lost. I think it was the Vietnam war or something, I forget sometimes. My grandpa was a general and was busy with helping the US and wasn’t there too often with my dad and his mother, (my grandma). Long story short, my dad learned the hard way in life with out my grandpa being there with him. He had to stay with his friends and his cousins when immigrating to the US at a young age. He met my mom and have been together since. Had a kid when they were in their early 20’s. Bought a house for themselves in their early 20’s. Life has it’s ups and downs and life has been somewhat nice. In total, our family has 6 kids including me as being the 4th oldest. 3 moved out, even my younger sister moved out for school for about a year but had to came back due to the coronavirus outbreak. 

I am just scared to leave. I don’t even know where to begin. I don’t have many friends, don’t have a car, I just use my parent’s car, I am like the errand boy of the family with buying things and paying the bills while both of my parents work almost every day (6 days a week). I am kinda dependent on my dad and mom and I don’t have a single hobby because I have been told what to do by my dad 95% of my years living. My hobby is just chilling at home, surfing YouTube, and playing games. Mainly my dad doesn’t even know I play games because he just doesn’t like games. I honestly don’t even know what my dream is anymore.  Like I said, I saved up a decent amount of money (20k-30k) but I am just too scared of living in reality. Even though I want to go out and live on my own and experience many things, I fear these challenges up ahead and I am too scared to face them. I really need advice on what to do because at this point, I am really just stuck. I really don’t have any friends to help me out, don’t even know what I want to do and just feeling miserably everyday. I don’t live want to live with my family much anymore because I feel like I am an adult already. But I am scared to leave and I really need help. I don’t even know what to do even if I just move out. I’m really scared.  😞😓

325,"When I was a child I was VERY sexual. I would touch my privates constantly and in front of people.

I drew sexual pictures, at least one that depicted sexual abuse. I was too little to know why it upset people for me to do this. I made a family friend upset by handing her a picture i drew of a child being touched sexually by an adult while the child cried. But maybe I was just drawing something I saw on TV? She did tell my dad and I think he just didn't beleive her. 

I also remember my girl part and butt both used to have a lot of pain. I remember the pain was so bad that it would keep me up at night. It only hurt at night while I was trying to sleep.

And I remember bleeding from my privates once, and showing a teachers aid. The teachers aid didn't know what to do. They panicked at first and then said it was fine. 

I knew how sex worked as a little kid, but then i forgot around the secound grade. I didn't relearn until I was almost an adult

When I first started having actual sex I would disassociate. I would think about other things, count down from 100 to 0 over and over, or sometimes I would just disapear completely, only to come to after it was over. 

I recently found out that a relative of mine (ill call him mark) had touched several other relatives privates when they were young. I was hanging out around Mark when I was around the same age as those girls. 

I remember him coming to say hi to me. I remember pretending to be happy to see him, but being terrified. I remember I would refuse to roll the window down or to get out of the car. Instead I would talk to him through the window inside of the car. I remember feeling sick to my stomach when I saw him coming near the car. 

At the same time, my family was pretty obsessed with rape as a topic. And I watched a lot of crime shows that I was way to young to watch that also feature rape pretty often. 

What do i do? Could I have repressed memories? Does it even matter? If I were to find out that something happened I guess it would be validating. It would explain why the idea of pedophilia can send me into a anxiety and depression spiral that lasts days or weeks, why I would shut down and dissassociate during sex, why I am so afraid of everything and jumpy, why my self esteem has always been so low, ect..

But its not like it would change anything. And I dont know if ""repressed memories"" are even a real thing. 

Thanks for any advice!",29Jun2020,1
326,"So there’s this guy that I was really close with in middle school. It was a super small middle school but the two of us got on especially well and had a fun banter-y thing going on. I thought he was cute for sure but at that time I was crushing hard on a straight girl (I’m a bi girl for reference) so I wouldn’t say I really had a crush on him, and I thought he was into one of my friends anyway, but looking back he might have had a crush on me. The summer after middle school we talked some but we stopped eventually. I’ve seen him a couple times briefly since then and we’ve been able to pick up where we left off so easily, talking and teasing each other. We just graduated high school and I haven’t seen him for over a year. I think about him often though and quarantine loneliness has been making me really want to reach out to him. We follow each other on Instagram but neither of us post so I don’t really know anything about what he’s up to or where he’s going to university next year. I also don’t know if he has a girlfriend or if anything romantic would’ve happened between us. We could be very different people now but I remember all the time I spent with him really fondly and I mostly just want my friend back. Anyway, I’ve been considering reaching out to him but I am so nervous and worried that he doesn’t want anything to do with me (no good reason for this, just scared of rejection). So... should I reach out to him and if so, what should I say?",29Jun2020,1
327,"for context, my mom really is encouraging me to do this for my mental health, and my older sister will support me if I decide to do so, although she won’t cut him out yet. 

Short and sweet version: my relationship with my dad has been dramatically deteriorating for the past year, but has been a slow decline for about five years. It’s now to the point where when I see him call me, I feel immediately filled with dread. I haven’t told him about my boyfriend of six months cause I’m trying to keep him at arms length. 

I’m 23 years old now, and feeling like I maybe need to move on from this fantasy that my dad will suddenly wake up and being the loving father I’ve desperately wanted. It took me until adulthood to see the things in my childhood that deeply bothered me about the way he handled being a dad. 

I just don’t know how to suddenly stop communicating, or maybe really slowly decrease. My most recent event with him was a lack of sympathy when I lost my job due to COVID. I don’t know if that could be a good enough excuse. 

Thanks in advanced.",29Jun2020,1

She has a favorite spot— underneath my desk. I let her out of her cage as I do every day, but today I set it up with a t shirt on the floor, her favorite stuffed animal, and some food.. even though she won’t eat it. I’m going to let her stay there tonight because I know how much she loves it. I made it nice and dark so she could feel safe. 

What do I do? I can’t go to sleep I just can’t. I’m so worried she’s not comfortable. I can’t take her to the vet because it’s so late at night. I noticed the symptoms last night but they didn’t get bad until today.. a Sunday. When the vet isn’t available.

332,"How do I tell my friend, B, of 5 years that I dont want to live together in the fall?

Bit long. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm a bit frazzled.

So I became friends with B in college and we were good friends. Now that we are graduated, we were going to move in together to save on money.. she asked if her friend could live with us which is no prob except said friend doesnt like me. Whatever.

She wants. 3bd 2 bath under 500$ (literally impossible in our city and I've been tasked with apt hunting smh)

I noticed that B started posting constantly about being at the bars now they are reopened. About 6 nights a week and always posts slurred videos of her challenging randos at the bar to drink offs. She works full time so I really dont know how she swings it. She also drunk drives constantly and got kicked out of her house cuz of it. 

Also I've been social distancing since the start and she gets mad because I refuse to bar hop with her right now.

On top of this she has EXTREAMLY different political views than me. Think.. she wears a red cap and is very vocal about it. I told her when we first met that I wouldnt discuss politics with her because it would end our friendship. She has become way more vocal about her political choices and has started tagging me in political memes that are against BLM and trans rights. I flat out told her if she continues I will never speak to her again. We had a fight but she backed down. 

There are more minor things too but I worry that if I tell her I do not want to move in and she asks why I'm left with two big reasons that are friendship ending. Is there a way I can delicately tell her I'll be finding a studio alone without ending a 5 year friendship? 

I know this was very long and kind of ranty... I just truly dont want to lose this friend but... should I? I'm lost and confused.

335,"so theres a lot that has been getting on my nerves for years now but something that flipped a giant switch was i realize just how much personal information she shares with me about her other friends and friend group. i never ask for this information but i let her talk and “rant” (at some point it becomes straight up gossip). now i don’t have many other friends to even talk shit about, but i would never say what she does (not anymore, i was a teenage girl at one point) let alone share their personal info! i guess i never really realized it since we have been friends for so long, but it is 100% something i look out for in future friendships: the words they choose when talking about others

i’ve attempted many times to fade, block, and even full on “break up” with her but each time she gets her gang of friends to text me and she calls me crying how its not fair because she hasnt changed. which is kinda the point! get out of that highschool mindset! i feel like i’m in a toxic relationship with a boyfriend, but she’s just a friend so theres no real way out. how do i fricken do this?? she causes me stress every single day and the days which i had her blocked were the best damn days of my life. but her crying does make me sad but she never changes. i tell her i dont care to hear about this stuff but its just her natural way of conversing. so i stopped sharing personal information and then she called me out on that saying “its not fair” that i don’t open up anymore.

TLDR: my friend is nothing but drama and overshares other people’s personal info, how do i get out of this friendship? with the least drama and hurt feelings as possible, i do care about her, just really need to work on myself right now and shes holding back my progress significantly.",29Jun2020,1
336,"Sorry about the block of text and any errors, I'm on mobile and fairly frustrated. This is also my first reddit post so I am unsure to how things work here.

There was this one girl on my sports team. I was very young when I was asked to come play for them, she was 3 years my senior, I had met her at the age of 12. She was not generally too talkative with others on the team, they pretty much ignored her. She took me under her wing and we had become friends. We were always doing things for her but at this point I feel pretty used when I look back upon it. 

Time passed and new girls came to the team after the older ones had gone. We originally didn't get along with one of the newer girls who had a horrible disrespectful attitude but after a while she grew on us and she was incorporated into the group after I had spent a season with her on another team. We were a trio who were constantly doing things together. When I had come out as bi to them, those times were quickly fading away. 

More excuses to avoid me and just cut me off coming from the older girl. The newer girl and I still got along when the other wasn't there but it was a little tense at times. I confront the older girl to ask why she had cut me off from the group but I get not definite answers like ""it's just the little things"" and ""you should know you were there"". I eventually get told that I grew up too different from them but I felt as if that was a bs answer. My contact with the newer girl grew frigid after this discussion. 

A few weeks ago, I was at the birthday party of a girl on the team and I get the full story. Apparently the older girl had gone around telling people that I had hit on her and she shut me down, avoiding me not to be awkward. I had done no such thing and there was absolutely no chance that I would ever do such a thing. This is her absolute last year on the team due to age restrictions but I honestly don't think I can continue.

A few girls on the team still speak with me but they are in their own cliques and my own was taken from me. Showing up to practice makes me hate myself but I know quiting would just let her win. This has been my friend group for 5 years and I have anxiety making new ones so another team is out of the question despite my abilities. I just don't really know what to do and any advice would be helpful. 

Things to keep in mind that I wasn't able to clearly incorporate into the rant:
She has very clearly made it known she was straight
She is an adult and I am very much not an adult
Frequent assholeish behavior from her directed towards me
After she ages out she plans on becoming a coach but I doubt this claim's validity
Her parent is a manager, the new girl's parent is a coach and my parents are the scorekeeper and the person who runs the finances on the team. 
The new girl and the older one quite frequently hang out and drive to practice together

Feel free to ask for more clarification because I am unsure as to what else would be required to give proper advice on this subject",29Jun2020,1
337,"I am a 26 y/o Male, and I live with my parents. I have 4 other siblings. My psychopathic older sibling is a 28 F. We live in our parent's home and I have not talked to her for 5 years. I cut her out of my life because she is a toxic person. She lies and talks bad about me to parents, hit my mom a few times, physically abused my baby brother when he was 1-5 years old (he is now 6), tried to start problems for no reason, uses and manipulates others, called me names whenever she did not get her way and many more behaviours that led to me not speaking to her.

Three months ago, I took my brother to school, and on my way back to the car, she saw me crossing the street and stepped on the gas while I was in the middle of it. I stepped back and was inches from being hit. She saw me, I saw her look, and still she almost hit me with her car. She has hit a biker before, but not sure if that is important. I went to my car, called my parents, and they were calling me crazy as if it was my fault. I asked them if they even believed me and all they said was yes. I wanted to call the police but they yelled at me not to. They talked to her and she said it did not happen then changed to it did and lied even more.

They did not check on me for a whole week. I had nightmares and wanted to go to the police. A week later, I did go, but they said I could not do anything since there was no harm done to me. My parents have acted as if nothing happened and during this whole pandemic being in this house with them has not been great.

I am leaving in one month and plan on leaving without telling anyone anything. Just leave in the middle of the night. Just wondering what you all would do in my situation? Please help, thanks.

This man doesn’t have intentions of coming out because of his job. A job where many aspects of the public eye see him and doing such can and more than likely will shadow him from his career. Hard to explain with the consideration of anonymity.

351,"So recently I went back to church and decided to change the way I was completely, I’m still in the process of doing that btw. But there was a time a couple weeks ago where I had gotten into a big fight with my dad about the people living at his house. 

A little backstory on his house. It’s a 5 bedroom house located on a plot of land out by the farming areas. Now these people don’t pay rent except one of my cousins who lives there with his girlfriend and two kids. The other people who stay there is one female cousin 18 yo and a male cousin 22 yo. They both don’t pay rent except my cousin with two kids. 

Well I had resentment towards the people living there because I felt like they where taking advantage of my dad since he wasn’t living there at the moment and the house stated getting messed up. And I felt that it was everyone’s home but mines and my siblings his own kids.

Now I’m trying to be a better person specially since I realized that after months of trying to preach Gods word , I dwindled off. I didn’t notice it but I became a different version of myself where I became distant , meaner and overall not the friendly and outgoing weird cousin I was known for. I had felt a disconnection with everyone of my family members and didn’t know how to talk to them without feeling a bad vibe. Now I learned that it was me who put it in my head to somehow push everything away that isn’t with Jesus and that’s the total opposite of what I’m sure god wants for me. 

The thing is I believe I’ve already set a bad name for myself in my family. Like I’m the black sheep that ignores everyone or the one who doesn’t bother talking to anyone. 

Recently i have started coming more and more to my dads house and at one point whenever college starts I’ll be moving in to take my dad to work since he’s an immigrant. 

I want to be able to talk to everyone here and make them feel welcome into being my friends but I don’t know where to start since I’m on totally different pages. I’m going to university and trying to be a good person who is with god while everyone around me is having a typical young adult life and hanging out with our cousins who also live in a trailer next to us.

I on the other hand paid to live in a different city in an appartment for 3 years during nursing school so I know how expenses work.
Unfortunately I feel like I give him tons of chances, we talk about moving in together but when it actually comes down to it he doesn’t want it.
I have a really toxic home life I need out of and I’m not comfortable living for free at his parents.
I am ready to make the move. I’ve had the talk about it and it constantly turns into an argument. 
I don’t know what to do, please give me some advice.

356,"19M 
It's been a year and I'm still not completely over her.

She was the first person I fell in love with. She was funny and kind and understanding. We just worked well togheter. I thought she could've actually been the one.

I've dated another person a few months ago but it didn't last long and was too casual.

I've been talking with someone for months now but neither of us have made a move and the pandemic is preventing us from meeting up for the first time. At this point I'm not sure it would work out.

Take all of this combined with the fact that I'm trapped at home with nothing but time to think and I still feel like we just broke up.

I miss feeling appreciated. I miss hearing the words ""I love you"". I miss feeling like things are finally okay for once.

What do I do? I feel broken. I feel like this will never change.",29Jun2020,1
357,This is more of a explain like I am 5 post but its like a cycle. Every night I'll go to bed at midnight and yet itll be in the morning and I still havrnt slept. It's like my mind cant stop looking at my phone until I'm exhausted and I want to know why. Is it because I'm addicted to my phone? Or is it the stimulation whether its chatting on discord or playing chess on my phone? Why is it so hard to just put it down when I know I need to sleep so I'm not tired for work. I wake up just fine but obviously 3 hours of sleep every night by the time its friday is exhausting on my body. Or is this a matter of discipline and will power.,29Jun2020,1
358,"This guy was my best man and we were roommates for a year at one point years before that. I had lived overseas for a few years but we still kept in touch regularly- about a month before I returned to the US this mutual friend of ours (who was a childhood friend of his, albeit one with whom he had had something of a falling out a few years before) died suddenly. In spite of their strained relationship, my friend was devastated, as well as dealing with feelings of guilt. When I moved back he seemed relatively okay at first, but it wasn't long before he became more and more withdrawn. We've hung out maybe half a dozen times in the past two years even though we live two miles away. He seemed to only want to hang out in groups- I have to wait until a concert, Super Bowl or festival to see him again, we never hang out for its own sake. He also developed  a bad habit of starting conversations via text and suddenly going silent. He even did this at New Year, agreeing to make plans and then sending an apologetic text around 1 AM saying ""Sorry, dinner was later than expected"". 

I suspect this is related to potential substance abuse, because he drinks and/or smokes (hint: not tobacco) at every single event we attend- that we will either go somewhere within walking distance or take a rideshare is a foregone conclusion. Two and a half years after our mutual friend's sudden death, his profile picture is still the two of them together. (Even getting engaged to his long-time girlfriend didn't see that profile picture being changed). 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to ask him if he’s okay, tell him I’m worried about his drinking and that I’m really hurt that he’s basically not part of my life anymore, but this feels like it carries a high risk of being too painful for him to discuss at all and could easily backfire. What should I do? ",29Jun2020,1

So, I’ve got a new job and there works a girl I have only talked to twice for work but i really want to know here more. When i’m walking around the store or when i’m just at the other side of the store i’ve always seen her looking at me. When i walk past her she’s always smiling at me. I only know here name and don’t know anything else of her. I haven’t really talked to a girl I didn’t knew before. Always to girls in my school or just close friends. The last time i had a gf was 5 years ago and it went well until she accused me of stuff I didn’t do/knew and basically f.cked up the last 5 years from my live.

361,"I've developed a really bad habit of distracting myself to the point of disfunction. I think it's a stress response, but I can't seem to control myself. I'm on the verge of losing my job and keep putting off work because I keep procrastinating and making a mountain out of a molehill. The work builds up until it becomes this huge problem and I lose sleep from stress or spend all nighters trying desperately to catch up before getting into more trouble. All of this for online distractions or television. If its not reddit, then it's other social media or podcasts or a tv show or movie. I get really anxious everytime I think about catching up or having to come up with excuses and my various distractions be it media or little chores or errands relieves this feeling. I know simply staying on top of it would fix the problem and it's totally artificial. The anxiety and bad habit and short attention span has only been happening gradually over the last year and a half and is wierd for me. In the past I've been a hard worker and tried to perform well. I'm not sure how to change my behaviour pattern at this point and sometimes this all results in me feeling physically ill from sleep deprivation and too much caffiene and cigarettes. Idk if this was clear enough but if anyone has any advice I will take what I can get. I'm basically driving myself crazy and effecting others at work. I am being selfish and making myself feel guilty and worn out over absolutely nothing and I don't actually want to.

My situation is I live with my gf, her toddler aged daughter, and 5 other people, one of whom is very ill and due to die anytime but isn't a relative of mine so not devestating for me but still sad and uncomfortable to see this person deteriorate. I have a decent job but not very enjoyable. My relationship is good, and the fact I'm employed during the pandemic is a blessing in itself. There isn't a direct reason that I can think of that is causing me to act this way but I could be missing something here.",29Jun2020,1
362,"Last summer I had a really close friend where we would basically have lots of conversations on text and call eachother to play games for hours almost every night.  When we came back to school we would talk alot and sit at the same table during lunches with my friend group and still play for hours almost every weekend.  It was like this for most of the year but soon one day he just started going to a different group (This happened about 6 weeks before the world shut down).  He started going there like once in a while and I would still talk together on the weekends.  But soon when quarantine started, everything began to go downhill.  Within 1 week of the quarantine, we stopped calling and playing together.  However, right before quarantine started, we still played on the weekends.  We still play the same game but we just don't join.  I contact and try to start conversations and play with him but it just seems that  he doesn't want to talk to me that much anymore.  Throughout the entire month, I probably only played with him for about 2 or 3 hours and it didn't feel the same for some reason.  I also invite him to just call and chill but it starts to get kind of awkward after 15 minutes.  For the past few days I have been trying to find a way to tell him how I feel but cant find a way to put this without making it seem extremely awkward.  We were once like best friends and did everything together but now we are so distant. I have been playing with my other friend group but I wasn't that close to them and isn't as fun.  I really need some advice on what to do or do any of you have any ideas on what I can tell him?

363,"On mobile. Sorry for formatting issues or spelling and grammar mistakes.

So to start with I’m female. Well gender fluid but primarily female. Anyway I’ve had a lot of hair on my upper lip for years now and normally pluck the darker hairs or shaved the sides where it’s bad with the same types of razors I use for my legs when I shower but during lockdown it’s gotten worse. My husband doesn’t exactly have any facial hair so on his multi head razor kit the facial beard trimmer has never been used. I used it today as I’m sick of the hair. It makes me feel wrong having the hair. I knew how to use the razor after watching my father shaved for years.

But now I’ve used it my face hurts and feels so wrong. I’ve used his after shave lotion that is very rarely been used and that’s helped but it still tingles and feels wrong. Does anyone have any advice for helping with that? My husband is at work and will be for hours still and I don’t want to disturb him at work for this.",29Jun2020,1
364,"I’m new to reddit, so sorry for any confusion. I apologize if this is an inappropriate sub for this post. For context I’m 18F and this has taken place while I’ve been in high school and living at home. 

While we have been very close, one of my moms has always been difficult to live with. She struggles with mental health and addiction, is financially irresponsible, and has recently taken a turn for the radical politically.

Over the past few years we’ve grown apart. While I don’t judge her solely on her political stance her subtle homophobia is especially upsetting since she raised me with another woman. I haven’t come out to her myself.

About six months ago she met a guy. A month after telling me she had a boyfriend and a week after I met him she told me they were getting married. I told her that I was upset about this (as a kid living at home) so she married him secretly, lied about it, and my other mom and I found out when a bank transfer from her had a different last name. A few weeks after that she moved out of state to be with him. Now I live with my other mom who supports me and acts like an actual parent, and the mom in question just visits when she feels like it. 

Anyways, when she told me that that she didn’t care what I thought about her getting married her main point was that she has the right to do whatever she want, since she is a free person and she deserves to make her choices to be happy. I agree with this. But, as I clearly explained for her when this first happened; just because she is free to make the choice doesn’t mean she is free of the consequences. I told her in no uncertain terms that by making this choice she was making the choice to permanently damage our relationship. This is fine and a choice she is welcome to make if she is at peace with the consequences. 

As mentioned she went ahead with getting married and moving away after I made my point clear. As was expected, our relationship was damaged. I am angry, hurt, and don’t enjoy spending time with her very much anymore. I have been polite, civil, and try to spend time with her; but she doesn’t seem much like a parent anymore and it shows. We still do things and talk, but her absence is blatantly obvious. 

But, she still doesn’t seem to understand how consequences work. She is largely absent and consistently acts jealous that the mom who stayed with me seems like my only parent. She doesn’t seem upset that she doesn’t act like a parent, but instead that I don’t treat her like one. She’s upset that I’ve grown distant. The other day her husband (who I’ve spoken to twice) sent me an email telling me about how terrible it is to be mean to one’s mother. “You can’t treat your mother any old way thinking it doesn’t matter...you may not see it but your harshness makes her cry...don’t treat the person who loves you the most the worst...” This could have been in reference to a picture of me with my mom who stayed and our dogs that looked like a real family. I don’t know. It made me feel terrible since I don’t want to be cruel, I just want to protect myself and love the family I have left. 

I am feeling a lot of pain, and I do not want to be cruel to her. I feel abandoned and I do not want to see her, but I don’t want to be unreasonable. Maybe I am being too nosy since she is an adult and can make her own choices. I made the consequences clear but it still seems like I am being mean. I’m feeling a lot of hurt and I just don’t know what to do. 

All of the advice I get from people I know is very biased so here I am on reddit. Thank you for your time.",29Jun2020,1
365,"Hey  everyone  so a little  backstory to my situation. So I have been working  at this athletics internship since my freshman year of college. I have been in college for the past 6 six years due to just being in a new environment and personal and family issues that have made college really challenging for me. So for now I have been at the organization for 5 season. My situation is that I want to turn this into a full time job I've gotten to know everyone there, they are like a a group of mentors and family to me. So i feel like when I go to ask about a job they will hold how I've been in school against me. Like one of my co-interns  got a job at the end of the Spring once she graduated with the company so I'm always hoping that would happen to me. But i also have self esteem issues where I compare myself to people bc her relatives are in the industry and she comes from that background where as though i don't and im the first one  in my family to go this far in terms of distance for school. 

I guess  what I'm  asking is how do I turn this internship into something long term? I've put in the work and sacrificed a lot to work with this organization and I just want it to turn into something. Like I just don't want to was the time I've spent with them. I'm not opposed to going elsewhere I just want to stay where I've already established myself. I've watched this organization grow from a low point to a high point  so its a part of me at this point. I've  expressed interest in working with them but I have to wait till I graduate.

367,"I'm sorry if this is long, I am trying to keep it to essential info! I was living in a 3 bed for uni with two friends a year ahead of me, when they moved out I got two guys to take their place. One of them was in the same year as me (same course) but I didn't know him as he kept to himself - I'll call him A.

After a couple of months I heard from other people on the course that my flatmate A had dropped out, but he hadn't told me and was still going to uni every day and telling me about his day. I didn't want him to know people were talking about him so I just waited until he told me he was taking a year out and I was sympathetic and supportive and he seemed to have a good plan in place of keeping up with revision, placement, and getting a job. He never told me the reason he had to take a year out, but I was later told that he had failed too many placements and uni asked him to.

So he was living in the house, everything was fine, then one weekend he went home. No big deal, he didn't tell me or my other flatmate so we didn't have any info but we weren't bothered. Then he never came back.

We had an agreement at the start that all bills would be split evenly, except gas and electricity (as they are on PAYG) which would be split between whoever is living in the house at the time (so if you go home for a month you don't have to pay), but if no one is in the house (e.g. christmas, then we all split it).

Since he left the house (and he left all his belongings in the house including food, his iPad, uni work etc.) we haven't been able to contact him. Not once. He left probably 7-8 MONTHS ago. Our tenancy has ended since then and apparently he did come to collect his stuff, but he didn't tell us he was doing that and still won't respond to any messages.

I have been covering his bills since he left because they're in my name and I didn't want to have outstanding bills and have my credit affected. We use splitwise (this was A's idea) so every single bill is documented and how much he owes. I really cannot afford to let this go but I really don't know what to do!

I can see from his GFs insta that they have been going out and doing fun things so he isn't in hospital or so ill that he couldn't possibly reply to a message. I really want to be sympathetic but I really need that money back. If he had said that he was leaving and would never be back we would have worked something out with the bills but he never told us.

So does anyone have any advice in how to contact him and get my money back?? I don't know his girlfriend but I could try to message her on fb/insta? I have his home (parents) address so I could write a letter asking him to pay? Is that too formal/too much? Any advice much appreciated!

tl;dr: my flatmate vanished and left me paying his bills (£260) and I can't contact him to get him to pay them.",29Jun2020,1

370,"I'm realizing as I grow up that I dislike my parents more and more. I'm close with them but I think I also suppress my dislike for them since I still live at home. I want to move out, but just don't know if I'm financially okay to do so yet.

I try to be open with them about things. My relationships (romantic or not), my goals, my plans, etc. Overall I'd say they're supportive, and I recognize they've done a lot for me. 

But I also dislike the way they are and act. My dad makes it constantly known how much he does for us (gets all the groceries, cooks dinner, helps us financially, etc) and that he's SO busy taking care of everyone else but himself. He acts like we (My mom, brother and I) are children and can't do anything ourselves. We constantly tell him to go do things he enjoys and he just won't, and instead continues to complain he has no time to do the things he wants to do. He constantly makes excuses, typically that he needs to be available for everyone else. 

My parents are also just... frustrating. About 6 years ago I confronted my mom about my parents fighting and she admitted that my dad filed for divorce. He tried to take everything from her (Our house, vacation house and no spousal support) but obviously my mom had a sense and a lawyer. My dad was also having an affair. I asked my dad only about the divorce and he straight up lied to me, then came back and tried to say brush over it as nothing was final. Five years passed and nothing happened. 

Since it's been five years my parents would have to refile, but I highly doubt they'll do that. It seems like my dad has again started (or continued) his affair, and my mom knows and hasn't done anything and likely won't. (Side rant: This is frustrating because she then accuses me of not having any backbone in my own relationships.) My dad makes so many side comments about my mom, and talks down to her a lot. And he talks about all these hopes and dreams he's given up on but refuses to talk about.

My parents are unhappy and miserable and it really makes it hard to be around them sometimes. They're apparently content living this way and I think my dad has too much pride to do something that would make him look like the ""bad guy."" It also seems like they don't want to do anything when my brother and I still live at home. Again, I know they've done a lot to support me financially but it is just feels almost toxic sometimes, even before covid but especially now.

What can I do? I feel like I can't confront them without it blowing up at me, and I can't do anything about how they treat each other or their marriage.

Tldr; Parents should get a divorce but won't, and their misery makes it hard to be around them sometimes, both before and after covid. I appreciate all they've done for me but sometimes it's hard to be around them.",29Jun2020,1
371,"So I am friends with two people (Male and Female, not disclosing ages to make the verdict impartial) who have recently gotten into a relationship. We will call the girl Laura and the guy Jake. Over the course of the relationship, Laura has been wanting to keep the relationship quiet, which I totally understand at first. It's been about a week and since I am close with Jake, he has told me that she gets uncomfortable talking about the relationship even with him because it makes her uncomfortable to talk about it.

What I wanted to immediately do was to tell him that this is a red flag because of her lack of communication, but I asked another one of my friends what he would do, and he responded by saying that I should tell Jake. Looking deeper, we realized that mentioning it might possibly ruin the relationships between me, Laura, and Jake. So now I'm here, making a post.

373,"I am an 18 year old male. I’m not sure where to begin. I can start by saying this is the first time I’ve sought any sort of guidance on this issue as I’m scared of what might happen if I were to even research it. 

That being said, I will not say the term, but I have a soul crushing, unfortunate attraction that is, and rightfully so, frowned upon by all of society and carries an extreme stigma. This may be a bit long, but I’ll try to get to the point. Also- I have never acted upon this, and am willing to do anything to ensure such for the rest of my life.

When I first hit puberty it slowly began going downhill for me. As the years passed from 12 and up I began picking up more and more fetishes, finding less satisfaction in regular sexual tendencies. I believe the term for this is “Paraphillia”, or something of the sort, where someone begins picking up every fetish and becomes less satisfied by the previous, more tame one. I began falling down this path, besides things like BDSM and degrading n such. I soon came to realize that I had a very weird attraction, and I did not like it. As a clueless 14 year old, I decided to pass it off as “my attraction not catching up to me as I grow”, and that when I got older it would simply fade away.

It did not fade away. Though the attraction only applies to a few years below me, it is still enough years to be considered an issue. Usually, when I’m distracted with something in life, whether it be other trauma or blissful moments like relationships, I can forget, and don’t even think on it. But it’s the happiest times, when I seem to have solved all of my other issues, that it creeps back into my life.

This is a curse. Every time I feel I could be happy, like I’m on the path to success and fulfillment, I remember the plague inside of me, and it crushes me. Over the years it’s become near impossible to ever feel at peace as I know that no matter how hard I try, no matter how good I am at suppressing, I will always have this problem. Regardless of how strong willed I am I can never overcome the self hatred and anxiety that is rooted within this. I am disgusted in myself, and in my issue.

This is where it gets worse- And where I begin having questions. A few years ago, I found on my sibling’s (won’t say gender due to anonymity purposes) phone disgusting, animated images portraying what I am referencing. As it turns out- My sibling somehow, by some insane coincidence, has this exact same issue. How is it possible that two siblings from the same parents are born with the same rare and horrible issue? Either it is a genetic disorder, or we both suffered some sort of childhood trauma that led to its formation inside of both of us.

I never confronted him about this. He is a few years older than me, and I always wonder if maybe he could have some answers. I don’t know whether this disorder is Nature or Nurture. If it’s a nature situation, we have an unfortunate set of genes. If it’s nurture, however, then we were both subjected to something horrible that I don’t remember.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to stop this, I don’t know why I’m like this, and I am too scared to ask anyone for help. I want to understand how this works in the hopes of fixing myself. How can I fix this, and how can I go about researching this?",29Jun2020,1

A Lil Backstory: (to help understand my situation)

I used to have a rough relationship with my parents, since I blamed them for my social awkwardness as I used to move to different countries a lot because of my fathers work, This was over 4 years ago, Ive cleared up things with my parents and am living a happy life I now finally have the relationship and understanding with them that I wished for throughout my entire childhood. At the same time I have a lot of good friends that I can lean on now and have almost completely dissolved that sad and awkward state I was in previously

 What I need advice on:

My parents will be moving to Sicily this year, the original plan was for me to live with them during the first 2 years of college. However my father is retiring soon and he needed the money, so I had no say in it anyway. I'm left with 2 choices, move with my parents to Sicily, or move in with my friends for college. I love my parents and want to spend more time with them because of what I missed out on during my childhood, but doing so would cause me to leave my friends behind. If I were to move I miss out on the American college experience. If I were to stay I would sacrifice I may never be able to experience the same relationship I currently have with my parents.

Basically at the last few months it felt like she's not interested anymore and didn't act like a gf at all. After talking about it over and over she finally came out fully that she doesn't feel anything towards me and just keeping the relationship for our solo DnD campaigns that i DM.

I mean, truthfully i was pissed but i guess i did understand a bit of it. And this girl is also a good friend that i wanna keep the friendship with. So i ended the relationship. Yay me and all.

I'd just like for this feeling to disappear as fast as possible so i can just be friends with her properly. You know, without the jealousy if she's talking about some other guys, without shutting down when i think about her dating other guys, without the dreams, the whole thing. 

Now how the hell can i move on fast? 

I really don't wanna cut ties with the girl. I really need a friend and she's one. And if i detach myself, i won't be able to go back to being friends again. I'm that mess of a guy.",29Jun2020,1

383,"I have had a “fat fetish” for almost 5 years but I’ve been attracted and drawn to fat people for as long as I can remember.  

For the most part, my fetish is a complete secret, although I’m sure I’m not very subtle. I love fat people. A lot. I love how sexy they are, I love how there is more cushion for the pushin. However, there is a very bad thing that my brain finds irresistible. Feeding and belly play. For reasons unknown to me, that is the hottest thing in the world. 

It is taking over my life. I have a secret Instagram account for pictures of fat people, I get noticeably turned on whenever I see a person who is fat. It’s all I think about. All day. I know this doesn’t sound like much but god, this fucking fetish controls my thoughts.
I have a girlfriend. My girlfriend has no idea about my fetish. She is also a bigger woman. And fuck she is hot. Unfortunately, she is very self conscious about her appearance because of her weight. She has depression because of it. It breaks my heart to see her sad. I wish she could see how beautiful she is.  
She struggles with her body everyday and it brings her so much pain. 
Yet my selfish ass wants her to be bigger, I want her to be fat and I want her to let me obsess over her belly. When I cook, I’ll give her bigger portions or I will bring home fast food to encourage weight gain. I am such a horrible person. 

It absolutely disgusts me that I am attracted to her biggest insecurity. I have tried so fucking hard to stop my fetish but no matter what I do, I can’t. Telling her how I feel is 100% out of the question. She has told me in the past that she thinks fat fetishes are awful and wrong. And I do too. But I can’t stop the way I am feeling. If she knew, she would leave me. And I don’t blame her. 

Someone please for the love of god help me stop this fetish. I love my girlfriend and I don’t want to lose her.",29Jun2020,1

I'm feeling really tired and burnt out even though I haven't been working. 

I live with both divorced parents, and I'm taking some extra time at moms. I help her work, and I've spent this current week dealing with her trashy relationship. 

I don't have a room or my own space at moms, I sleep on a couch and its making me crazy, all I have is a cubby and a basket and thats it because her house is rlly small. 

I dont have anywhere to escape and cant seem to find alone time unless I'm in the shower and even that is short lived as my siblings rely on me for things, and constantly bother me.

I have a history of self harm and ADHD which obviously comes with anxiety and depression, and I don't want to go back to that.  

The days are running so long now yet I cant remember them well, and everything either makes me irrationally mad, or I feel nothing about it at all and I don't want to go back to self harm.

My wife has been working throughout this pandemic (in California) at a job (retail/pharmacy) without any sort of hazard pay. A few days ago someone at her work tested positive for coronavirus. That person is now quarantining obviously, but they have done literally nothing different at her work, her manager hasn't even told the staff, just the shift leads.. of which my wife is included. My wife wants to take time off away from work to quarantine (we can afford for her to not make for two weeks).. i have been Googling (drunkenly googling) laws over the last hour or so, and I can't find any law that allows an employee to self quarantine due to fear of covid, without losing their job. We can't afford for her to lose her job.. but I also don't want her to be at risk of contracting covid and possibly getting both of us sick ..

Any advice would be helpful, and if there is a more appropriate place for this post, let me know!! Thank you all in advance",29Jun2020,1

387,"
TL;DR: My (15F) best friend (15M) has been taking a bit too many interest into my personal life and sometimes poking his nose into my business and find out who I was talking to/stop me from talking to certain people. I would love advice on how to deal with it and/or to know his intentions. 


So as the topic suggests, my (15F) best friend (15M) has been trying to find out more about me in a sense, I suppose. 


So as we go to the same school (our quarantine has ended) and sit quite close, we talk a lot. And by a lot I mean, really a lot, like we wouldn’t shut up until we have to leave the school. 


Back then we mainly engage in group conversation with other friends sitting near us. Around half of the time we would talk to each other in an 1 on 1 basis, but we would be happy to include our friends in the conversation if they would like to join. But lately, I feel that something’s changed. If I were to initiate a conversation with one of my friends, he’d join in the conversation and somehow we end up talking 1 on 1 again. He rarely initiates conversation with the others now, and if one of our friends try to talk to him when we are talking, he’d shoot them a dirty look and mutter something like “Okay whatever, anyway back to what I was saying”. I really enjoy talking with my friends but most of the time I do that, either he will be kinda mean to them, or find something to talk about and make it seem rude if I don’t talk to him. I don’t want to hurt his feelings or something, so I’d always talk to him in those cases, but it seems like it strained my relationship with others. 



Also earlier, a friend of mine joked about me hugging my schoolbag (I liked to do it, it’s comfortable) and said that it was dirty. My best friend snapped at him and my friend probably felt angry given the look on his face. I did not want to trigger a fight so I didn’t say anything, but my friend was pissed and didn’t talk to us for a while. This concerned me because I value their friendship and I didn’t want anyone to get mad. 


Also, I’m in a Discord Server in which he is the owner. I have another friend in the discord whom I am close to, and recently we have started to voice chat in said server. There are multiple voice channels in the server, just to mention this because this is related. 


My friend is very shy, and prefers a 1-on-1 call as he is not very familiar with the other people in the Discord. We’ve had two calls in the server; both of them in which my best friend was also in a call in the same server, just in the different voice channel. We were having fun, but halfway through my friend got kicked out of the voice chat. My best friend, and a mutual friend of ours joined instead, and asked me who my friend (which is the guy who was kicked out) was. (I know that some people may be confused. My best friend was not the only owner of the server and my friend who’s in my call had joined very early, used a fake name and was inactive. This is probably why they asked.) I replied to them and the mutual friend rejoined the voice channel he was originally in, leaving me and my best friend in the call. He told me that I’m free to invite my friend in the call again and that I can pull my friend into the private voice channel, and rejoined the voice channel he was in. 


So I invited my friend back into the call and we chatted for another 20 minutes or so. It is to be noted that in my best friend’s voice channel, there were originally around 4 people but only 2 are left around that time, which was him and the mutual friend from before. The mutual friend left their call, my friend was kicked again from the voice channel, and my best friend joined instead to talk with me a bit about a game that he invited me to play. At that time I was confused, but I didn’t know that my friend was kicked. I only discovered later when my friend told me that he had been kicked again. Nevertheless I did talk with him like nothing special happened for around half an hour before I went to sleep. 


The next day me and my friend chose to voice chat in the server again because I had talked to the mutual friend earlier about the situation and I’m certain that he would tell my best friend. My best friend was calling his friend in another voice channel then. We talked for an hour, and suddenly my best friend and the friend he was calling joined our voice chat. Of course they were welcome, but as I mentioned, my friend was very shy and therefore stopped talking, while the newcomers started talking about their stuff shortly after asking what we were doing/asking me what I was playing (As I said that I was going to switch games). Therefore the whole situation got more awkward, and me and my friend had to leave because we really had no idea what was going on. He left the call within minutes after we left. 



I had messaged my best friend then just so you know, he said that it was normal and that “There may seem to be a lot of people in some calls but really they are just a lot of small groups talking about their topics respectively”, and I don’t think that he understood what I was trying to say. 



So that was all that happened, and I would love your advice. Do you have any idea why he may be acting this way, and/or do you have any advice on how to deal with it?",29Jun2020,1

390," So my best friend(18F) and I (19F) have been friends for about five years now. She lives less than half a mile from me, so we used to always walk over to meet up with each other.

I'll be honest. She isn't a good person. She lies and cheats on her boyfriends and manipulates everyone around her. She is known for being a wealthy snob. The real reason why I've been friends with her for so long is that she is the only person who has always had my back. We shared with each other our deepest secrets and our goals in life. As dumb as this sounds, I really thought that we were going to be friends for life.

She is the kind of person to always have a boyfriend, and I have known almost all of them. Her most serious and longest relationship was with this guy (20M) let's call him, Adam. They had a pretty toxic relationship in my opinion and it when on and off for about 3 years.

When my friend went to college (prestigious and preppy) she started dating this new guy, let's call him Owen. To be honest, Owen is the nicest and most genuine boyfriend my friend has ever had, and they had a pretty good relationship too. Even I became friends with him.

Owen came to live with my friend and her family to work for an internship. Like I said before since I live so close, I come over almost everyday to hang out. In the last few months, my friend had told me that her ex Adam was transitioning into a female, but she needed me to make sure that Owen does not know that she is in touch with her ex. This happened a while ago.

Yesterday, my friend threw a bit of a tantrum. She told Owen that she was bothered that I was coming over so often (even though she constantly calls and asks me to come over) and she told me that she was bothered that Owen kept hugging and showing affection to her (even though she is always asking Owen to hug and show affection to her. Owen and I decided just to go to her backyard and chill for a bit just to give my friend some space. He asked me why I was in contact with Adam and thought that was weird. But I had forgotten that my friend had told her boyfriend that I was in contact with Adam, so he didn't know that she was talking to her ex. I had completely forgotten my friend's secret and accidentally let it slip that I was not in contact with Adam. I begged Owen to not tell her that I let it slip and he said he wouldn't say anything.

Later that day, my friend told me that she felt uncomfortable that Owen and I were swimming together and hanging out without her. (she doesn't like to go swimming because of some scars and she didn't want to go outside even though we asked.)

An hour ago, my friend texted me asking why I told Owen about Adam. I explained to her what happened. And I also added that I did not tell her immediately because she was upset with me and her boyfriend and I wanted to give her space. I seriously was going to tell her tomorrow though.

She is very mad with me. We have never had an argument before. I really feel like even though I betrayed her trust, It had been hard for me to keep up with the lies she tells her boyfriend and it is exhausting to always have to lie for her.

I don't know what to do.

I am a 16yo male and for about 15-20 hours of my day, I play video games or watch videos on my phone. I don’t really feel hungry or feel the need to go outside since I’m always being entertained on my phone. I have friends and hang out periodically, but the rest of my life is spent chained to my chair in my room, playing video games. I generally play league or monster hunter world, and time seems to fly bye before I know it.

I don’t really notice me being sad until I’m truly disconnected and laying in my bed. I enjoy my time playing video games, but sometimes when I’m alone I sometimes imagine my life being so much more adventurous if I just got out and did something. And other times I just want to get back on to my games and spend another day playing. I understand that at some point I need to become mature enough and say enough is enough, and finally walk away. I just don’t know if now is it. 

I just kinda would like you guys to look at my situation from afar and say what you would do.

395,"Since my childhood my parents have taught me that people are worst.  Society is bad. I was taught to constantly fear society.

so i have a very high maintenance cousin who is getting married. We dont get on too well and shes really two-faced. At her engagement party she got mad at me for wearing a dress that had tiny white flowers on it (i know you dont wear white to a wedding, but this was an engagement party and the dress wasnt even white!). So shes known her fiancee for a year and a half and has told me that i am not allowed to bring my boyfriend of three years to the wedding. Hes my other half and it would be really nice to go with him, but at the end of the day its her wedding. 

Weve always had our differences but i feel like this wedding has created so much drama between us, even though i wasnt trying to create any drama at all. 

I guess my question is that will it be a bad idea to not go to the wedding? I really dont support any of her views (shes very very religious) and i always feel like im being judged by her.

After a while I think some sexual tension developed and we were walking around an museum. Anyway we kinda stopped and look each other, he put his arms around me which I enjoyed. It was nice to walk around holding each other.

Anyway eventually we found somewhere to sit and we chatted and after a while looked at each other and it happened. We kissed a few times, nothing fancy, no tongue or anything just some vanilla kissing. This was my first time so I wasn't really sure what I was doing tbh. But idk as much as this guy was really awesome in basically every way? I just didn't enjoy it. Like at all. I didn't dislike it either, but it was just like *nothing.* He drove me home, which was very kind of him, and I felt it would be polite to give him a kiss goodbye, which I did. But I didn't look forward to it and it felt the same as the others.

I don't really understand what to make of this? I've been questioning if maybe I don't find him as attractive as I thought and that I was just desperate to go on a date? or if maybe im asexual? but I've had crushes on guys so am I really asexual? It's been bothering me a lot because he wants to go on another date and is clearly into me but at the same time i'm so uncertain, he was really kind and considerate letting me do things at my own pace since he was more experienced. Idk the whole thing has been confused.

**TLDR: I (18M) had my first date and kiss with (19M) guy and I think I liked him but the kiss felt very nothing to me, not looking forward to kissing him again if we meet.**",29Jun2020,1
417,"I am 17 and autistic. I have been trying to read a lot more in the lockdown and I hope to do a literature degree in the coming years. My family have unfortunately been playing loud music all day from like 9am until 1am which causes me so much stress and stops me from concentrating on work or books or even my own thoughts. I have attempted to discuss this with them over the course of years but they just say I'm being overdramatic and continue to make loud noise all day.

Recently I've been waking up at 5am every day to give myself some quiet time, but my family have also started to wake up earlier and earlier whoch means I can't read or do work at all. I also won't be able to sustain this when school starts again next week. 

All the advice I've seen online says I have to create a quiet space, and this is exactly what I want to do, but how is this possible when I live with three other people who don't want to cooperate? Every room in my house is full of loud music, my school has no quiet rooms because of an 'open plan' design, and the local library (!) also has loud music on all the time. I tried discussing this with my teachers but they aren't empathetic.

The only other option would be to use earphones, but I have a physical issue with my ears which causes air pressure to build up and cause intense pain. This is made worse when the ear is blocked with an earphone. It's like I don't have the ability to work or read or achieve anything - there's no escape from the constant noise and nobody wants to understand. I worry especially about university because I can only afford student accommodation and this is even noisier!

420,"I'm 24F and my mom officially dropped the ""either you leave, or I leave"" bomb and is lawyering up.  It's been a long, long, long time coming, but my parents are finally separating.  I know there's no right or wrong way to feel, but I kind of wish I had gone through this about 10 years ago.  I'd appreciate any advice from people whose parents had nasty divorces or divorced late in life - they waited until all their kids were moved out of the house and relatively self-sufficient.

I've had major issues with my dad most of my life.  He's a long-time alcoholic and has major anger-management problems.  He's chased pretty much everyone else out of his life, so I feel awful abandoning him further.  For some reason, even though he's cheated on my mom/been the worst kind of person, he's shocked that this time she's actually leaving (she's left/come back on 2 other occasions, whole other issue).  So, there's not really a ""not picking a side"" because I'd definitely pick my mom - but that doesn't mean I'm not sad for him.  And, if this had happened 10 years ago, I'd *have* to visit him because of custody, so at least the choice to have him less in my life would feel like a separate issue.

I'm not really sure how to process this - I feel pretty overwhelmed thinking of all the things that have to be done - especially the cleaning up and selling the house I lived in for 20 years.  How much do I support them?  Is it worth putting my relationship with my dad aside just so he has someone to talk to and doesn't drown himself in a bottle of booze?

My girlfriend of 6 months now has wrong memories of what happened all the time and at this point I don't know what to do.

If it was about what happened weeks or months ago I wouldn't even think about it but I am talking about what happened in the morning or even minutes ago.

For example she would ask me why did I put these shorts to wash when I used different pair in the morning, which I obviously didn't.. And she won't just accept she might be wrong, in her mind I was wearing something different and I put clean shorts to wash. Even when I present it this way to her she still thinks I am lying to her.

Or she would be holding my arm with both her arms while lying together and a minute later she would deny that ever happened and call me crazy. Not only that but the way her attitude changes is kinda scary

That's without even mentioning the ""you never said that"" or ""you said something else"" argument we have every day about small things..

434,"TW: mentions of suicide.
I have a very close online friend who I’ve known for a few years now, and have met with in person twice. Over the years, their mental health has gone downhill. I’ve been there for them through it all, but it’s getting difficult, and affecting my own mental health too. I do everything I can to help them and tell them how much they mean to me, but they don’t believe me, tell me to stop talking about it, or just turn down all my attempts in general. Yet they keep coming back to me, like an addiction or an obsession. I should mention they’ve had a crush on me for a while now but I don’t feel the same, and I think that’s what started this whole downward spiral, or part of it at least. I’ve made it clear I don’t like them back, and they know that. They don’t try to push it or anything, but it’s become a real problem for them, especially now that I have a partner while their feelings for me are still just as strong. This is one of the causes of their depression, and has had an effect on my relationship with my partner as well.
They’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, and have self harmed and contemplated taking their life. I try my best to talk them out of it, give them advice and reasons to live, and convince them to get help. It barely works.
On the other hand, they’re becoming increasingly aggressive towards me, lashing out, swearing and calling me names, and just having a generally cold and bitter attitude towards me. It’s almost like they want to hate me, or have some suppressed hatred and anger deep down that they’re denying and hiding. They get angry at me for every little thing I do wrong, so often that it’s almost a daily thing (despite the times when they stop talking to me for days). They haven’t been very forgiving either. I know they can’t help how they feel because they aren’t doing well and they need to let out those pent up emotions, but sometimes it just makes me feel used like a punching bag. I don’t have the guts to argue with them because it seems like every argument we have sends them into another depressed suicidal episode, so I just agree with anything they come at me with.
I did tell them how I feel about them lashing out and being meaner than usual, and their solution was just to apologize and disappear for a week. We didn’t work anything out, and they only got worse. When we started talking again, nothing had changed.
Needless to say, we’ve become a lot less close than we used to be. They’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had and it’s really hard to see them and our friendship take such a turn for the worse.
I don’t feel happy being around them anymore. Whenever I get a message from them I just feel dread. They come back to me time and time again because I’m the only support they have, the only thing that (sometimes) makes them happy. They expect me to help them. It seems like my attempts are all for nothing. But they get mad when I don’t try to help. It’s so stressful being expected to fix something that’s out of my control. But I’m afraid that if I leave, my friend won’t be able to live without me, literally. They say I’m the only reason they haven’t killed themself.
I can’t lose them, but I don’t know how much longer I can be there for them before I just break. I’ve had so many anxiety attacks, and have self harmed just from stress and anger. They’ve told me I’m toxic, I’m an asshole, I make them want to die. I know I’ve made mistakes in the past, but I always apologize and do everything I can to make up for it and not let it happen again, but that never seems to be enough for them. I just want what’s best for them, all I want is for them to be happy and healthy, but I don’t think I can stay in this friendship. I don’t know how to tell them, or if I should tell them at all. Maybe I should just keep playing along. What should I do?",29Jun2020,1
435,"Sorry if this seems too long, but I wish to give the most context possible. Atleast it's a good tea. 

I just got the news that my mother is marrying a semi-rich Arab in about a month time. This has caused an immense conflict with me in an important decision. 

If you want to know what's the deal before reading the specifics: 

I either have to choose between staying in Mexico with the girl I absolutely want to marry (she does too) or moving to Dubai and leave my whole live behind forever. 

Now the specifics. I'm 22 years old (23 in a month) I live in Mexico City (a considered 3rd world country anyways). Right now I'm a college dropout, however, I was about to start a new career this September, something I actually want to study. Videogame development.  After my career goals, my absolute biggest goal in life is to have a super solid loving family with the best quality of life possible, something I never had when I grew up. I was loved, but in a discfuntional family, so yeah, kinda a psychological desire. 

Me GF, 22, is about to finish college in the same month or two time. (She is studying Tourism) One of her immediate goals is to work at a Disney park or resort. 

We've been in a relationship for over 4 years now. So far we've have talked in a very very serious manner about our life goals, individually and as a couple. We know for a fact we absolutely want to get married and eventually have 2 children together. However, we both know it's not the right time to do any of that, we both want to have financial security and start building a household. Having such a serious and defined goals at a (relative) early age, just absolutely confirms my desire to marry her, besides that we are such a perfect fit for each other anyways, kinda implicit by now. We just know we are meant for each other, we know it's now a question of ""IF"" but ""When"". We are absolutely sure of our desires as a couple. 

On the other side of the coin, I just found out yesterday that my mother is about to marry an Arab in no more than 2 months from today.  2 weeks after the wedding, she is going to migrate to Dubai to get everything sorted out and settle in the new house. Her plan is, once everything is sorted out and in order, take me, my sister and my grandmother with her to Dubai, selling all out possession here (house included) and never turn back. 

Note: She has 2 masters degree, so if something were to happen to the marriage or whatever, we know for a fact she can keep going on her own with her curriculum over there. So we know this migration is absolutely permanent. 

Now, the choice I've been given now is:

A) Staying In Mexico, moving-in with my father, start my degree and most importantly, staying with my future wife.++

B) Leaving my whole life behind forever, migrating to Dubai, uncertain of what I will do career wise and loosing the love of my life. 

Now, before you guys say: ""Well, if she is the love of your life, you wouldn't even consider moving out"" 

Hear me out: Thanks to the president we have, our economy is doomed. We know for a fact that the whole country is going to have a really nasty future. The 2008 recession won't even compare on how things will come for Mexico. (Thanks Covid) 

Adding to the paragraph above and ++: I've already talked with my GF about this. 2 important things came out.  One plan I was hopping to do, is once settled in Dubai, I shall bring here with me and start both together, however... she says she can't and will never do it for 2 reasons. 1: Her whole family is in America and Spain, she can't simply leave behind her family  2: The difference in culture is too much for her, she can't wrap her head around living there considering her personality, so it's almost a solid hard pass for her. She could consider Spain, but not the UAE (Note, our family already went in vacation the past December, so we know it's actually a mix of cultures, but still, Islam is the main one, so she kinda has a solid reason anyway). 
And number 2: That even if it will leave her heartbroken forever, she will also fully understand since it's such a huge opportunity to flee this country.  She would even encourage me taking it, since she could also be in the exact same troubling decistion. 
So yeah, she coming with me it's out of the question 200%, said by her own mouth and will. 

Now, If I were to stay here, eventually marrying her, we still have a similar plan anyways. Once I finally finish college, our plan is to move out to USA anyways. I'll be searching for a big game studio and she can pretty much work at any tourist destination. (This will most likely will land us in California anyways) However, despite how optimist we can be, something can happen that could ground us in Mexico, probably never having the ability to flee anymore. 

So yeah, again, that's the dilemma for me.

A) Staying in Mexico with my (hopefully) future wife, finding a way to migrate to USA with her, while having an uncertainty for the next 4 years (while I finish college). Staying with my dad (which I didn't had any relationship with for the past 12-15 years, I Just got In touch for the past 2 years) 

B) Leave my whole life behind, Including the love of my life but migrate to a first world country, kinda securing our well-being. Moving to a completely different culture and the absolute dream for a city. Also absolutely blindly, since I don't know what will happen to me regarding school/career wise. 

I really hope I made the choice difficult, as it's supposed to be. It's literally the most important decision of my life so far. This will define my future forever. 

Also, I know you might be biased depending on your past and current relationship experience, so I ask you to atleast read the whole post to understand my situation. 

I really really appreciate it. Thank you for reading and taking time to advice me. Thanks again.",29Jun2020,1
437,"I [22F] just moved into a new room in house in a pretty safe college town and did the entire looking-for-housing process online due to the virus. Seems like my room is one of two rooms in a renovated attic - it’s hot, there’s no lighting (they gave me a lamp), the entrance door doesn’t lock, and there’s a fire-escape door with a deadbolt lock on one wall. Long story short, it’s not an ideal situation and I don’t feel super safe/comfortable. It was relatively inexpensive, furnished, and in a great location which is why I got it in the first place :/ 

My parents are extremely upset about my housing situation. They want me to find new housing asap because they are worried for my safety due to it being hot and the fact that there’s a fire escape door and a non-locking entrance door. And that it’s mixed gender housing. They didn’t hold back with their complaints but I get it cause they’re just worried. But tbh their complaints only made me feel even more anxious.  

It’s honestly my fault for not being thorough in my search but I just feel dumb. Can’t sleep due to how anxious I am. Now I’m in a situation where I’m living here for 1 month, secretly looking for a new place to live, and trying to find a new person for my room. All while starting at my new workplace in a couple of days.

439,"Hi everyone.

Some context. I come from a family of 4 boys, two 17 year olds and two 20 year olds (yes, two sets of twins, all boys). My dad's worked in finance for the past 30 years, my mom's been a housewife during that time raising us. Dad and brothers are very conservative people, patriarchal, misogynistic, racist, constantly complaining about how 'soft' people are now, that all these groups of people want social services when they should just 'pick themselves up by their bootstraps', you know the type. I realized I was gay at around 6th or 7th grade and started to reject all of that awful dialogue that was being rewarded at home, so have felt like I was on the 'outside looking in' since then. 

Recently I started therapy and realized that my home situation wasn't normal. I talked to my mom about it, asking her why she never fought back when my family made fun of her to her face or why she condoned my brothers' dangerously harmful behavior. She said that if she started to fight back, she wouldn't know why she was even sticking around, and that she'd been considering leaving my dad for a long time but that her mom had just told her that it was normal and that she should keep her head down. Now she's leaning on me for emotional validation and advice. 

My family doesn't divorce - the few women that have divorced their husbands have been excommunicated, aren't invited to the family events anymore and are talked about as crazy and spiteful. When my mom said that she'd been considering divorce, it didn't feel real. I love her and want her to be happy, but it would destroy my dad and brothers and I would feel responsible for driving a wedge in between our family. It just, it doesn't feel real, divorce has always felt like something for other people, not my family. 

Any advice you guys have for where to head from here, what to tell my mom, how to wrap my head around the idea of breaking up my home, would be appreciated :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Mom said that she'd been considering divorce for a long time, considering how arrogant and misogynistic my dad has been and raised my brothers to be. I can't even fathom the thought of divorce, it doesn't seem real. She's leaning on me for advice and I don't know what to tell her.",29Jun2020,1

443,"So long story short, my parents were never emotionally available, which resulted into me never getting the emotional support I needed growing up. And I have ADHD witch doesnt help the on the emotional regulation front.

I study social work, this is a study where you have to be emotional vunerable during presentations a lot. Which is something I am unable to do, seeing even the smallest amount of vulnerability during an assessment is enough to have me crying my eyes out. Now as you might asume, this sucks. Not only do I get major head aches after crying, the logical part of my brian doesnt even think what I'm sharing is a big deal! but the emotional part of me feels the need to start crying when I have to explain how a class helped me in my development as a social worker. It feels like my body is stealing my voice.

Most of it only happens during assessments, when I'm talking about the same stuff to friends or classmates or even the same teacher that is suppose to be grading me in a normal setting I might get a little shaky but I can at least manage.

How do I change or at least grow up from this part of me?  

I've tried therapy twice (not specfilicaly for this problem but similar issues) and up until now it hasnt worked for me. I have great difficulty opening up to therapist because to me it often feels like they are just doing their job instead of actually being interested in me. What doesnt help is that because of my study I often recognise the methods they are using and then instantly tune out.

Does anyone please have some advice for me on how to deal with this part of me?

444,"So, long story short I hate fruit. The smell, the taste, the texture, everything about them makes me squeamish and disgusted. I have never wanted to try them, my mother told me when I was a baby she tried to offer me some and I always refused, spat them out and just hated them. She took me to doctors couple of times and was told that my body doesnt require them and that one day i will start eating them. Well, I'm nearly 30 years old and I still feel exactly the same. I was also like that with vegetables,  I'd only eat potatoes, however when I was 26 years old and got pregnant I tried a handful and now I eat them and love them, but only about 7 of them. When my daughter was born I was giving her all kinds of veg and fruit and I literally wouldn't touch them, I would use knife and fork or spoons but never touch them with my hands, the smell alone makes me sick. Shes 3 years old now and I can touch some of them, but the smell still is unbearable. I cannot imagine putting them near my mouth, I have tried to force it but it's just not happening. 
Obviously I think it's just all in my head, like a psychological block that I cant figure out. I have tried googling about it but i havent found anything relevant.  I also asked my family have i ever choked on something to make me hate them but the answer was no, because I never even put them in my mouth. 
Also, I'm a very picky eater, I dont eat a lot of foods. If I dont like the look or smell of it I wont eat it. If I see or know theres fruit or a vegetable in there that I dont eat I will not eat it. My mother said she tried to fool me a couple of times as a kid and hid them but I always found them and picked them out or refused to eat it altogether.

446,"I’m really upset rn

Ok so, I’ve never actually talked about this before but I really hate my family, my dad is awful, and I hardly ever talk to him because my mum divorced him 2 years ago. My mother and brother suck, but just in a different way, I’ve always been stuck in my brothers shadow, and all of my accomplishments are compared to him, and whenever I act out of line, it’s always just ‘why can’t you be more like your brother!’ Over and over again. He can be nice sometimes but he’s usually just cold, as in he doesn’t care about me at all. I have similar interests as him and he just assumes I’m trying to copy everything he does! Which I’m not! My mum thinks that she has the worst problems in the world, and won’t let anyone criticise her at all, and always expects me to be perfect. She’s the main reason I’ve always been compared to my brother, and has literally told me ‘youre not bi, you’re just trying to imitate your brother again.’ And she apparently thinks that the only stages a person can go through is either being a literal infant, or a full grown adult, like, yeah, no shit I’m not as mature as my brother, he’s almost a decade older than me! And I’m sick of it. Whenever I have a problem and actually have the confidence to tell her about it, she always compares it to how her problems are so much worse, and calls me a brat! Oh yeah, I’m so sorry that you have someone at your job who acts like Angela from the office, that’s definitely worse than my myriad of problems! And now she gets angry that I never tell her if I’m stressed or upset. She wasn’t always this bad, except she was, she never paid attention to me as a kid, always just going off to do her own things instead. And the one time that I actually got therapy (she didn’t get it for me though, it was just because of my dad she had to get one for all of us) she listened in when it was supposed to be private! The worst part is, she denies any of it, and just gets angry at me and calls me a bitch any time anyone criticises her, she would probably lose her voice if she read what I just wrote, even when I just say she got angry, she just gets even angrier! I finally let it slip that I’ve been counting down the days to when I can legally move out, and she just told me to move now, if I could find somewhere to go, do it. I don’t even know what to do anymore.",29Jun2020,1
447,"I was at a bar with a group of friends, and there was a guy I hadn’t talked to, but he came up and talked to me, and turns out he was interested in me. I hadn’t felt the same but I was single so I agreed to spend the night with him, and with no pressure on myself I was just confident and doing my own thing with him.

Then I caught feelings... we went on a date but I thought that there was no way he liked me or that I could be with him... and then we had drinks and I got emotional and told him how I assumed he wouldn’t want to go on another and felt like I had to savour the night we had. Safe to say I think I turned him off and blew my shot...

Thing is, I still think about him a lot, and I know I’m far too emotionally attached to someone I’ve only known for a week or two...

We’re going out again this week, I think it’s because he told me he would while we were out on that date, and not because he’s into me anymore... but I want to return to my natural confident self and show him that side - just to see if I can still have a shot at being with him... but with the amount I’m emotionally attached and the amount I care about how he perceives me, this isn’t going to come naturally, and I think I’ve fully blown it with him...

452,"There’s just so much regret I (M17) have. So much I can’t fix and so much I can’t change that I hate. Things I’ve done to myself and things I’ve done to others. 

It gets to the point where I punish myself because I think I deserve it. I don’t self harm really I mean I guess I do in a sense but not your typical cutting or hurting myself. It’s just if I notice a pain of issue with my body I ignore it because I think I deserve it. 

I mean for so long I’ve had this pain in my testicles. It’s not really a pain more of a discomfort but that stuff is serious. It can be life threatening. And it scares me and I want it to go away but for months I’ve just left it because 1)It only comes now and then and it’s not too bad and 2) I think it’s the worlds way of punishing me for shit I’ve done and mistakes I’ve made. 

I told my mum last night about it because it got worse last night. She’s been trying to call a doctor all day and they aren’t picking up, leading me to believe I deserve it even more. And I’ve read a lot that leaving something like this for too long can lead to either death or loss of a testicle which idc for the second that’s not a big deal for me but I can’t die. As much as I think I deserve pain if I die that will only cause more pain for people in my life. 

I hate myself for ignoring it. Sometimes I can’t tell where the pain is from, it’s like it’s from my abdomen and stomach, then my chest hurts then my testicle but all while I feel it I can’t pinpoint he exact place of pain. I’ve read a lot about the pain being in those areas could mean it’s cancer and has spread but that’s extremely unlikely unless it’s left ignored for too long. Which I have ignored it for too long. 

I’m terrified of seeing a doctor because I know I’m going to face the consequences of ignoring this and I feel so guilty for my mum. Because I ignored this if I find out I’m dying that’s my fault. And my mum has to deal with that. I forced this on her because I was so afraid and hated myself so much. 

I need help. I can’t keep living like this but I’m also too afraid to be happy because I think that if I’m too happy the universe will find a way to take it from me and punish me more than I have been punishing myself. Deep down I know it’s stupid. I know the universe isn’t out to get me I just I think I deserve it and it’s easier to blame the universe for my pain than myself. But I can’t keep doing this shit. I have too many people who care for me in my life. They can’t lose me.",29Jun2020,1
453,"I put natural in quotes because I’m not completely sure how it all works when you quit caffeine. I used to drink at least 2 cups a day religiously. I was told by a doctor that caffeine along with my almost daily headaches could be hand in hand.

I honestly want to continue with this habit of herbal teas and only have caffeine in moderation. 

But my dilemma is that is have NO energy/motivation and every day is a huge struggle. I have a relatively healthy diet, and I used to be in shape when gyms were a regular routine (the rona isn’t helping this unfortunately) but I’ve been enjoying the break.

456,"Throwaway acct. Sorry this is long but I really need opinions....

**TLDR; Am I being a selfish, conceited asshole and/or is my boyfriend not the right guy for me because I feel romantically neglected in our relationship?**

My (23F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together for 4 years.  Last year we hit a really rough patch and it pretty much looked like we were going to break up... the reasons behind this break up were that I went through a really stressful period where I had horrific anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and when I tried to tell him about this (hoping his response would be somewhere along the lines of ""how can I help?"" or at the very least ""everything will be ok""), I instead got several jokes in a row about it that made me instantly regret telling him and made me feel like he wasn't taking my mental health &amp; emotions seriously at all. Progressively after that, I felt like he cared about me &amp; my wellbeing less &amp; less. We had talked about marriage (that's still a loooong way down the track) but I couldn't see myself being in a long-term relationship with someone who didn't seem to care about my wellbeing. Hence, the rough patch and the almost-break-up. Since then, we've dramatically improved &amp; I feel really lucky &amp; grateful that he takes my concerns seriously these days and we have a more ""us vs. the problem"" approach instead of ""me vs. him"" approach, which is great. 

His 25th birthday is coming up, and along with physical gifts (approx. $600, but these are gifts he has said he genuinely wants), I've also bought us tickets for a drive-in movie ($65 + I am buying dinner for us for that night) and am planning a birthday dinner with him, myself and a large number of his friends. Along with the restaurant's cakeage fee of $50 (I'm making 2x cakes for him &amp; the guests) I'm also paying for my dinner (ofc) and his (as it's his birthday) - which is $60pp.,and I'm buying him flowers too. Normally, I wouldn't be bringing money into this... but considering I'm spending close to $1000 on this one person for their birthday... it's making me realise that he's never really done the same for me.

In our first year of dating (while I was very much in the puppy/honeymoon phase) I spent $600 on his birthday. He's never really gone full out for my birthday, or planned a dinner, or planned anything with my friends (yeah I know, my friends could plan something too, &amp; also I know how selfish this all sounds). For my 21st he bought me some lovely gifts, but that was the big birthday and that's pretty much it. He's never really been a romantic or ""all out"" display of love kind of guy. His idea of a date is going out to dinner when he feels hungry. Now, this wouldn't normally bother me, but throughout the relationship I've sat him down &amp; talked about how I like the whole ""dating"" aspect of, well, dating. I like going to see a movie, or going to the park, or watching the sunrise/sunset, all that mushy stuff. He knows I'm a sappy romantic. I've asked him \*multiple\* times if we could go on holiday together, and after what felt like weeks of asking he finally gave in and we went on a short trip to a city 3 hours away from ours. It was nice but ultimately.... boring? It just felt like we were living together &amp; doing normal day-to-day activities rather than actually exploring and having fun? Plus we've literally never gone out of the country together (there was an opportunity for us to do it together with a small group of friends... but he told me he wasn't going, so I didn't go, and then last minute he decided to go &amp; left me...) and have barely been out of our own state (we went once but it was with friends). It's hard when I see our friends who have barely been dating for a year go on trips to Japan etc. with their new boyfriend/girlfriend (this was pre-Covid) and we've never even left the country together (my bf has been on overseas trips multiple times with his own family, so I don't think cost/fear of flying/etc. are an issue?).

Am I being an asshole about all of this? I just feel like he could do so much more in the relationship, and I feel like there are only so many times you can sit someone down and be clear about what you would like from a relationship before it feels like you're nagging?? I guess I'm just feeling kind of one-sided about the fact that I always spend so much $$ on his birthday, try to take us away on holiday &amp; do fun things together, but he never reciprocates? I don't know if I'm holding him to an impossible and/or unfair standard?

460,"My friends are getting a house for a weekend about two hours away from our city. They said they are all getting tested for covid and are planning on wearing masks throughout the entire weekend. All meals will be cooked at the house so we don’t have to visit restaurants. 

I haven’t been out since the pandemic started besides grocery shopping and going to my job at a grocery store. I have been on leave for about a month, so I haven’t been around people much except my family. I live with my parents who are both in their mid 60’s. 

I’m torn between going away for the weekend and staying home. When I had first spoken to my parents about it, my mom was not happy at all and asked if I was trying to kill them because they’re high risk because of their age. I asked about a week later and both my parents said they are fine with me going if it’s going to lighten my mood up since I haven’t been in the greatest moods lately. I’m guessing it’s because I haven’t been outside much &amp; my eating habits haven’t been the greatest. 

I’ve asked them both if they’re truly okay with me going and they’ve both answered that I’m (25f) old enough to know what I’m doing.

461," Posting this on an anonymous account because I have huge anxiety issues. I tried posting this on r/Sydney but it got automatically removed

This is a sort of last resort, a plea for any advice I suppose. Does anyone know of how I can get a job in Sydney with zero work experience at 29 years old? I know this is extremely late and unusual and I am constantly embarrassed about it. I’ve had problems all my life growing up especially when it comes to social interactions and social norms. I’m not diagnosed with anything and no stranger who talks to me would be able to tell but I’ve literally just lived in fear at home for over a decade. I guess it goes without saying that I probably have some anxiety disorder but thats the problem with anxiety disorders, opening up to a doctor is too difficult to imagine doing. (I have been to a therapist for over 4 years and I found it very unhelpful but went anyway due to my parents insistence) It’s a long story but I know I can’t go on like this anymore.

Due to covid our family has run into tough financial times, my parents have been supportive my whole life, well, except my dad. He’s not an abusive man but he’s constantly angry at how useless my adulthood has turned out to be. Again, Im embarrassed but I just don’t know where to start.

I’ve applied online through seek.com for years and out of the hundreds of applications I’ve sent, with my poor resume I’ve only ever had one job interview offer (which I bailed out of due to nerves). Im not saying I tried hard though, I definitely could be hitting the grind harder but being financially supported and in this easy if not pointless lifestyle has been easy to fall back on. I know if I did get a job interview I would find it almost impossible to show up to though. Would I be able to find work anywhere without an interview?

I’m also terrible with phone calls. I haven’t spoken on the phone in years. What I do have in terms of adult skills is a license. I was a good driver in my teens and early twenties but as my paranoia got worse I avoid it as much as possible now.

It often feels like normal adulthood life wasn’t meant for me and Im constantly worried my rather boring existence would become even more difficult if I had a very mundane job that I had to do. But everything I ever hear tells me I need to start, and that somehow life gets better working a 9-5.

467,"In short, this year I started drawing a graphic novel rather on a whim. I then proceeded to burn out, and can't manage to go back to it due to a number of issues.

First: I knew from the start it would be long, but I later realized that it would take me years to complete.

Related to that, and second: it's never been my dream to become a comic artist or create a graphic novel. I've never really read comics. But I've dabbled in drawing throughout my life, for fun. Graphics novels though are pretty hard work.

Third: My actual dream for quite a long time has been to make a videogame. That's also not a piece of cake, and I'm afraid with being distracted by the graphic novel I'm never going to achieve my actual dream.

Now counterpoints: I'm actually really invested in this story, and a few people seem to like it, and I'd be letting them down by not continuing it, as well as it becoming just another unfinished project in my life.

I've entertained the notion of taking the middle ground and making a visual novel, as a videogame that's almost a graphic novel. But I don't read (or play?) visual novels, and my idea clearly doesn't fit what visual novels are, as far as genre or art style.

I've had incidents where my bother is taking a shower, and I run in there to grab a brush lol that's normal, but this oh no, this was all sorts of wrong. It was like a gut feeling. 

My father and stepmother left and told me a repairman was coming over, so be on the lookout for anyone who knocks. I stayed in my room with the door open, and all of a sudden, I hear my stepbro comes in. I didn't say anything bc we're only close as just acknowledge each other when we small talk every two months same with the sister. Anywho I knew my stepsis was in the house. Stepbro just came in about ten minutes later I remember about the door knocking and go to tell my bro about it only as a heads up to hear for a knock bc I tend to nap I go to his room. It's empty, and I realized he was taking a shower, again I thought nothing of it, and I’d wait till he's done to let him know we're having a random repairman over.

472,"I [M25] recently broke things off with my girlfriend[22] of nearly 3 years. We had been friends for nearly 4 years before that, even. Our good times were the best I've ever had. We vibed on such a level I've never experienced before. I fell for her rather early on but kept things to myself for a while to test the waters. I tried to make it a point to avoid using the L-word to describe what I felt for her in those days... But it blossomed and I truly fell in love with this woman.
I admit, I did not make things easy for myself in keeping her trust. I talked to other women, though not in any kind of sexual or romantic way. I had a lot of female friends that were platonic. But because I didn't tell her of them and make sure she was okay with it, she felt a kind of broken trust with it. She sat on information of me talking to my lesbian friend in Delaware(when we were in Georgia) for 2 weeks before she even asked who she was.
I never tried to hide things, but it was the suspicion that got her thinking things, and stewed on it for so long that she got rather intensely jealous. That grew to a point where porn was a problem for her. It was talked about in the beginning of our relationship that porn would be fine between us, and she even watched it with me at times.
But, it was as though she believed I would rather have the kind of women found in what I watched, rather than her. It was a self-image issue, and I did not help it when she asked me to stop watching porn and failed to do so. I realized I had a problem, and would try to sneak porn into my day. I convinced myself I was admiring the female body, but it was like a compulsion to me. No matter how hard she threatened to leave me if I continued, I still did it... 
It caused some bad times. Very bad times. The worst I've ever experienced in a relationship.
She screamed... She threw things at me... She called me horrible names and said she hated me. She had even tried attacking me before. But much like she always seemed to forgive me and stay, I too stayed and forgave.
I wanted it to work between us. I knew we had potential, and I loved [correction... Still love her]her so much. The point where things turned a little sour was when she lost her job 6 months ago, and the last time I was caught with porn. 
Roughly 4 months ago, and I got rid of my smartphone and turned back a flip phone with no internet. Merely unlimited calls and texts. I admit it helped with bills, but I was cut off from those of my friends that I did not have their numbers. I felt isolated, and I didn't have much of a life beyond our home together. She still had moments of rage where she would just catch attitudes and get snappy with me when I hadn't done anything in months.
Where I love anime, and had gotten her turned onto some really great series- she grew to hate anime and called it misogynistic, sexist, and an inappropriate representation of females. Which, I can agree with on a good bit of anime, to a degree. But I also couldn't watch any TV or movies with a nude female for her jealousy would cause issues. 
We had been rewatching Game of Thrones, and she refused to watch it with me anymore for fear of one of the brothel scenes. I couldn't even play certain video games(found that out with Neir:Automata when she flipped out over 2B). And I just went along with it. About 3 months ago, she had just had a bad day of thinking about the past and ""wanted [me] to her like [I] had hurt [her].""  And tore up and destroyed many of my writings and a few of my books.
Since then I've had a bad feeling and haven't been able to get things right between us.
At the beginning of June we took a trip to the mountains to go camping. I had hoped that it would help refresh ourselves to detox from City Life, and she could experience something she had never done before. I loved it. She loved it. It was a beautiful, perfect time... But it was temporary, as vacations always are. 
We had to go back to our lives, and it just brought all those problems back to the surface. I had a rough night of drinking and had a lot of shit on my mind, and she held my hair as I threw up after said drinking. The next day, I had a feeling I knew what I needed to do and it wasn't until I had a talk with her brother[14] that I made my mind up to do it.
After he wanted to watch anime with us, and she exploded about it being the things stated above, she left to go pick someone up from work.
When I told him it was best to drop it, and confronted with his question if why... I told him it was cause if me. That she didn't feel comfortable with it because of me. That was why I had put Neir:Automata on hold, and hadn't watched any new anime in months along with game of thrones.
After unloading that on him, hearing this teenager tell me ""Dude, I know you love my sister and want to do right by her. That's why I really like you and think you're an awesome guy... But that's not right of her to treat you that way.""
It... Broke me. She begged for like half an hour for me to stay and I tried to explain that we are toxic for each other and that my leaving has nothing to do with lack of love for her. Then she proceeded to go inside, smash my TV in with my guitar and attacked me. She scratched my face and gave me a black eye screaming she hated me and never wants to see me again.
I'm still so fucked up about it. I can't get it out of my head. I feel like I lost my best friend... And I don't know if things will calm between us. Her friend says she isn't one to hold a grudge, but her actions with me through our relationship say otherwise.
I don't know what to do... All I feel is this pain in my chest and I see her face every time I close my eyes.  

My sister in California(I'm in Georgia) offered for me to move out there with her. But IDK if that's a good idea. I don't want to feel like I'm running from my problems. It could be good as a fresh start, but I don't know about it...

I told him I'd try to be quieter but I also feel like that's part of living with someone else.

Well, so where do I(18/ Male) start? My relationship with my father is absolutely nonexistent even though we live on the same roof and my relationship with my mother is bipolar. Despite getting along with her I have my share of complaints, such as:

- She doesn't allow me to leave the house except to meet friends (She doesn't allow me to go out alone, she always tags along without permission.)
- She throws tantrums for just about anything
- She thinks my friends are also hers (So I avoid bringing them to my house beacuse she'll get in the middle of our convos)
- She consistently brings up her marital or family problems to me, sometimes speaking for over two hours (And believes she's entitled to marriage counseling from me, even though I'm not a marriage counselor)
- She is EXCESSIVELY involved in my things (By excessively I mean REALLY excessively)
- She thoroughly disapproves my life choices (This includes basics)
- She used to snoop through my personal things (She doesn't do it anymore but I've enforced very strict safety measures for that)

Right.... And I do reckon I may exaggerate in the criticism. Anywho, when I turned 18 I went to college, in a place relatively far away from my house (Although I still go there every weekend), where my mom owned a small apartment and things were going quite well until COVID came and I returned home. Things are really taking a turn for the worse with my mother and I honestly dont know what to do. I can't move out because I'm not made of money (Yet) and neither of them wants me to get a job, and even if I was I don't know where I'd go.

486,"I'm unable to say a bunch of things. One of them is ""no"". I was beaten and shouted at as a child many times and I did everything to please my parents and try to make them explode less often. As a result of this, I am unable to decline people. I've been sexually harassed and had things taken from me on many occasions because I let everyone do to me whatever they want, to make sure I don't come off as unreasonable or provoke anyone's anger. I don't agree with a lot of things people use me for, but this is where my life is at.

I was 19 years old, when someone 14 years old fell in love with me. She was very confrontational, and even if I was uncomfortable with the age gap, she wanted to have sex with me and be in a relationship with me. I was dumb enough not to decline, and said relationship happened. She wanted me to call her ""Master"" at all times, drugged my drinks every now and then and took nudes of me without my consent. I'm into BDSM myself, so at the time i thought this was supposed to be part of that. I was dumb again.
She broke up with me when I turned mentally unstable and resorted to SH, after some dysfunctional family things happened which made me unable to see some of my family ever again, or know where they are. At this point, I had nobody who cared about me or loved me, so I became even dumber and begged her to keep talking to me. She broke off all contact.

One year later, I've tried to build up a social network of people in hopes of being healthier. But then she ""exposes"" me on social media, calling me a pedophile and a groomer, and saying that i raped her and forced her into weird fetishes. She also posted screenshots online of me talking about SH, and said I did that only to manipulate her, which i found a little bit selfish of her to assume, since I have been cutting actively since age 9, long before i knew her. Everyone believed her, I got a couple of death threats and people telling me I should cut vital areas on my body, etc, etc. I once again have no friends, no one. But not only that, I'm also walking around with a tremendous feeling of guilt. Because, what if what she says is true? What if i am a pedophile? And a groomer? People say everyone deserves a second chance, but people who did things that terrible should be locked up for a long time. Do i fall into this category? Should i turn myself in?",29Jun2020,1

491,"I posted here before about the pest control issue that is caused by my front door's lack of any weather stripping on the bottom of the frame.

I have spoken to them about this several times now, and a work order was supposedly placed on 5/26 but nothing came of it, and another placed 6/26. Nothing is going to come of that either. They just keep wanting to send pest control without fixing the issue that's bringing them in. There are also cracks in the window frames letting them in there. 

For the time being all I have is tape and plastic bags, so I've taped all along the edges of the window frames where cracks are, multiple layers. The door frame I've used a butter knife to tightly shove plastic bags all in the worst of the weak points. But I shouldn't have to live with this. These cock roaches especially.

493,"So, a while back I was scrolling through my YouTube recommendations and found one of those comparison-type videos, where they scroll through a list of things from a subject from least to most. I’m not a big fan of those types of videos, because they’re obviously just a quick way to earn cash from a quick google search, but I was bored, so I clicked on it anyway. It was about the most attractive traits of a person, from least to most common. I then looked through the comments, and decided to look through the “newest first” since you’re more likely to people who might’ve gotten offended by the list. I then found a certain comment thread that surprised me.

——————————————————————
C1 : I’m so smexy ;)) I have blonde hair, freckles, and green eyes

C2: How are you gonna be attractive to most people if you don’t even have a gender?
——————————————————————

I checked the C1’s “about” page, and sure enough, they were Non-Binary. Now, I’ve always been a supporter of LGBTQ and Non-Binary people, and have always been surprised when they were surprised that they met someone who supported them, because I always thought that the majority of people supported them. Since I was kind of mad at C2 for casually saying that, I decided to respond to them.

——————————————————————
Me: Just because they’re non-binary doesn’t mean they don’t look nice or have pleasant characteristics
——————————————————————

I went on with my day, and completely forgotten about the whole thing until a couple days later when I decided to go check on it, and was very shocked to two other responses to my own response.

——————————————————————
C3: @(My Username) no such thing as non-binary, if you have a penis, your a male, a vagina, your a woman. Get it straight

C4: Everybody on the planet earth is either male or female, don’t be silly lad grow up.
——————————————————————

I was very upset, but mostly confused. To add insult to injury, C3’s comment actually had more likes than mine, and to this day, if I hadn’t liked my reply, we would be tied in likes. I had many questions. “Do most people agree with that statement?”, “Do I not understand what Non-Binary people are?”, “Is he right?”. At the time, I was in bed, and after seeing that, my body started to twitch frequently, and I had a hard time falling asleep. So, to be able to rest, I decided to ask Reddit for answers. I posted it onto two subreddits, but since I was tired, I guess I wasn’t very clear on what I asked for, so everybody who answered was confused. The only advice I got was to not respond to C3 or C4 (Which I will follow), but it was not what I was mainly asking for, so I deleted both posts, and decided that I just needed to forget about it, but I guess my mind refused to do that. I would always get reminded about it throughout the day, but always let it go saying that there’s no where else I could go to get my answer, until I remembered this subreddit. So this is the final option for getting my answer so I can stop worrying about it. I want to know the answers to these questions.

——————————————————————
“Do most people agree with C3 and C4’s statement?”
“Are I, or C3 and C4 right?”
“I’m I a bad person for trying this hard to get justification?”
“What other advice do you have for my situation?”

I have a long life story but the situation I am in is the following:
I am at home, on the autistic spectrum with lots of sensory issues so basicly I don't have a lot of energy and am on a special diet to help me mentally. I have improved a lot and am now able to focus on small tasks but big ones like finding a job are intensive to me although I try MY BEST!
I was a freelancer for a while teaching a language but I couldn't keep up with the work, applying for a job is very confusing because I have tried hard an am still at home for more than 5 years now.
I use my talents to make people happy and that works, like music and poetry but being not very well known it is not bringing me income, but that is okay bc that is from my heart.

Now, I have discovered that I habe a few cavities, need some supplies and I want to sustain mom and pay for coaching in the autism and special diet practitioner, untill now I have done everything myself but I need some help and that costs some.

I am batteling with myself because I could try to make erotic videos online because I have a fetish that is handy and I am very creative, I figured that I could earn money by making that kind of content.
In a sitiation like this that would be handy but I am actually not a supporter of porn because I am a former addict and the recovery feels so free. I wish a pornography addiction upon no one now.

But here is the thing, there are people who are not addicted to erotic material and watch it, me making it would not be a problem then, but my mental battle lays in the fact that there are people easily hooked on it and I don't want to be responsible for it.

Do you all have some advice?

499,"I have struggled with this for years and it has prevented me from having a strong relationship with the other members of my family. 

I am really bad at talking to them and sometimes get really awful anxiety over doing so. I also get very self-conscious about how I act around them. At dinner time, I’m silent unless I am spoken to, and I only give short replies and show hardly any emotion at all.

I’m often stuck in my room all day as I withdraw from my family and purposefully avoid being seen. If I have to go downstairs for food or water it takes immense courage to work up to it, often hours of it before I finally am able to go down for a minute and then return. 

If I’m doing something in my room I often hide what I’m doing when a family member walks in. It isn’t even something ‘questionable’, it could just be a video game or something else that I’m reading on my computer. 

As a result of this social anxiety, I’m unable to feed myself so I am very skinny. I rely on dinner and other snacks I am provided with, only being able to provide for myself when I can either sneak down when no one else is there, or somehow work up the courage to go down when I know there is only one person there. But no matter what, when I go downstairs I’m always super self-conscious. 

It’s a pretty large foster family so that definitely makes it worse I would say. It’s a very social environment at times and it’s very upsetting hearing everyone talk and laugh together and I’m just sitting there in silence. It has been that way for years.

I wish I knew what to do. It’s all very overwhelming. I hope you can support me or help me out a bit. Thanks for reading.",29Jun2020,1

But first, let me tell a stories of how great a friend they are. For the first guy, let's call him Kevin. Kevin's is a guy I look up to. He better than me at everything and is the monitor of the college class. I was so happy to become his assistance because I get to learn from him, Yay!! I do what ever I can to help him manage the class. We have a small fight last year, because he looking down and me and I can't take it anymore. I didn't talk to him for a week, and we apologize to each other and on the good term afterward. Surprisingly, he the one to apologize first and I blame the whole fight for my bad temper.  


Second friend, Owen. He is kinda reserve and won't talk to you but I manage to open up with him by sharing meme. Yay! I liked him, and I really want to help him in anyway I want too. If there is something he don't understand in class, I will help. I want to see us together in our graduation photo, I wish him great thing will fall upon him, sincerly.  


Now, the detail of the fight is not important, typical opinion different fight. But now the problem are coming, they ignore and block my message. Everynow and then, our lecturer send something like link for class for us in a whatsapp group. I was not in the group because my phone broke. Prior to our fight, they 2 will send link and file for me great. But after the fight, they block and ignore everything about me, keeping information and the class link for themselves. They also purposefully kept the drive link send by lecturer that we use to upload our assignment to themselves. I could failed my study if I didn't upload my assignment you know.  


I can't believe they will treat me like this. Last time we fight, I still do my job without being told. Yes, we're not in good term, but I will still held responsible for my action and do my job. As the treasurer and secretary of the class, I still do my job perfectly without my emotion affecting me. Plus I make sure I will not harm them academically.  but their action are unreasonable and will cost me my academic result.  


I still love them tho (as friend, no homo), but what they do is unreasonable. I didn't need people to tell me to move my ass to start doing my job. But they are passive guy, not making a move until being told or last minute.  But this time, they have gone to far as I may failed my semester.

503,"I [21F] have recently been thinking about something that happened in high school and have been feeling bad about it.

I was in a friend group of 4 girls. We all liked each other, but one of the girls wasn’t quite as close to us so sometimes we would hang out without her. We never intentionally excluded her, it was always coincidental (for example, the three of us would be talking at school and make plans on a whim and not think to invite our other friend). 

The other girl never said anything to us about it, but at one point I found out through a mutual friend that she definitely felt like we were excluding her and was really hurt by it. I should have said something to the other girl and made an effort to change, but I didn’t.

I used the whole “We didn’t mean to” excuse and figured that since I never intentionally hurt her, I wasn’t in the wrong so I never did anything about it. We’re now in college and I’m still friends with the other girl on social media, but we don’t talk. 

I’m not sure what made me start thinking about it after all these years, but I feel bad about it. At the time, I thought that it wasn’t my fault because I never intentionally excluded her, but now I know that just because I didn’t mean to hurt her doesn’t mean I wasn’t in the wrong.

My question is, should I reach out to her via text or social media and apologize? It would be kind of out of the blue since we no longer talk regularly. I know it would help clear my conscience, but I’m not sure if it would be too weird or open up old wounds for her.",29Jun2020,1

F19, with a pretty traumatic background. Mostly sexual abuse

I feel pretty uncomfortable explaining exactly about my intrusive thoughts but when around people it’ll usually be highly sexual intrusive thoughts with VERY inappropriate people which is usually extremely disturbing because of the people these thoughts happen around. These will happen typically around children and family... 

Or around animals and children I get very graphic, gory intrusive thoughts which make me so sick I have to leave or put my face in my hands


These thoughts have been causing me so much discomfort recently, idk what to do, I never hear people talking about this struggle and it’s making most of my normally pleasant interactions horribly uncomfortable. I have no intention of carrying out these thoughts, they make me feel awful

511,This is the worst thing i've ever done and i feel terrible for it even 5 years later (i'm 18). So at 13 me and this girl knew each other from school. At the time i guess i was going through that time when i was discovering things. I have no idea what started it off but she just randomly kissed me and then told me not to tell anyone and i felt scared at first but overtime we kind of just started experimenting i guess you could say. There would be times i would kiss her on the cheek and other things (nothing ever more than kissing) and if she would ever feel uncomfortable i would stop whenever i saw. But here's the problem that's making my anxiety go crazy thinking about it. We never consented to each other. There would be other times where we kissed each other. And times where she would do the same stuff to me without asking me where i also felt uncomfortable and she stopped. These past few days i can't stop thinking about it i feel terrible for it and i don't know what to do. I'm terrified of the thought that she could make up some lie about everything that happened and i'm not even sure if she remembers i genuinely don't know and it's making me really paranoid.

515,"I moved across the country several years ago only to have my heart broken (100% should have seen it coming), and since then I’m much more pessimistic against people as a whole. 

I expect selfishness and ulterior motives from most people, my estimation of average intelligence has dropped significantly, I’m more judgmental of appearances, it’s hard for me to say something without a “But...” at the end, things like that. 

How can I become more like the person I used to be? I had one family member say that their favorite thing about me was specifically that I wasn’t jaded. I was often complimented about my face always looking like I could smile at any moment. I didn’t say hurtful things trying to be “correct” so often. 

I used to be pretty devoutly Protestant before the breakup. But during the breakdown of the relationship and dealing with the hurt afterward, it felt like God wasn’t there for me like he said he would be, so now I guess you could say I’m agnostic. Pretty sure he’s there, but I don’t care much anymore because what’s the point?

518,"Okay, so I’ve been in a relationship for 7 years with the girl I really thought was the one. She was just changing more and more the last months of our relationship and never said a word about why. 

When she broke up, she told me she didn’t feel like this relationship could bring her something more, and that she would still love me all her life (I guess as a great friend, not as a lover). 

I was so angry, and I was extremely sad the following days and weeks (and months). I tried to get her back but she didn’t want to see me. 

It’s been 6 months now and I’m still really depressed. I have the wrong feeling that she could come back, but I know she moved on. So that’s making it even worse. 

I can’t even hear about her because it makes me feel like shit. I unfollowed her on every social 

Also, our common friends never ever asked me how I felt, and I see that they are making all kind of things together without even asking me out also. 

I needed to write this, and I have to say it feels good to say it. I still feel like shit every day and I really want to move on. I try, really hard. But I don’t really have the opportunity to meet someone. I’m usually with close friends and can’t really meet new people.

I’m HORRIFIED to say the least. 

My dad just died unexpectedly about 6 months ago and the loss has affected me deeply. I cannot fathom how someone could do this to someone, especially while they are having such a tough time in their life. I would have rather been left in the dust to grieve my father, than have my boyfriend stick around and just cheat on me and then come home and “comfort” me. I feel sick.

We live together and we were planning on having babies soon, something I have wanted so badly, especially after losing my dad. But not now, not with this piece of flaming ape shit. I’m so sad it truly feels like another death in my life.

I guess my next plan of action is to go get tested for STDs and hope to god I’m clean and then figure out if I want to stay in this apartment haunted by memories of him or just get out of here and start fresh.

523,"For the past few months I (20F) have been living at home after having to leave my college campus due to COVID. Typically during the year I live about two hours away from my parents house, and my plan was to get an apartment near campus for the Summer, but as I had to leave campus abruptly I wasn’t able to line one up fast enough. 
Now a little backstory is necessary: My stepfather is an alcoholic and has significantly taken a toll on my mental health for years. My mother openly acknowledges this and also has verbally expressed her exhaustion with how he acts when drunk and apologizes for the way he speaks to me when drunk. Once I learned I had to move back home and had no other options the fear I felt caused me to have a small breakdown and I was hospitalized for a night. My mother was very distraught over this and attempted to help in anyway she could- but later told me I had to reason to feel the way I did and that my life was perfect. 
Because of the aforementioned reasons, I knew that living at home would be detrimental to my mental health and quickly worked to get an apartment so I could move out. However, when I found one I could afford without help from my parents, I needed a co-signer because I am under the age of 21. My mother refused. Therefore I was stuck living in her house for the time being while I worked out other options. 
As I had seen coming, living at home caused a lot of conflict. My stepfather is verbally abusive and anytime I leave my room when he is home leads to hours of being belittled and spoken down to as well as gaslighted. 
After leaving the hospital I sought therapy, and began to unpack the impact the verbal abuse I experience at home has on my mental health. My therapist urged me to avoid conflict as much as possible, but to also defend myself rather than allow the abuse to dampen my self perception. This is where the problems began. 
I would rarely leave my room when I knew my stepfather was home to avoid arguments- however I was seeking work and doing my best to keep the house tidy and offered to make dinner frequently. My mother expressed how she wished I would spend more time with her as the only time she is home from work is when he is as well- but to see her I am forced to deal with him. So I began to come downstairs a little more to spend time with her. Thus began the typical condescending arguments and attempts to make me feel stupid, to which I would attempt to brush off or ignore. My mother is rather old-fashioned and believes ignoring him is a sign of disrespect however when I defended myself with facts, evidence, or support behind my statements she also felt this was disrespectful. 
One day, my car began to experience problems. I took it to a shop myself to figure out the problem and got the needed parts and learned how to replace them myself through online tutorials. I was really proud of myself and thought it was a good way to work on my independence and problem solving by being responsible for the car. My mother was amazing and bought me this car when I was 16, and I’ve done my best to take care of it since. I pay for my own insurance and when repairs are needed I pay for them myself. However, after this incident more problems began to arise with the car and I asked my mom if she thought I should take it to get it looked at again. She insisted I should ask my stepfather to fix it, despite him not having experience with the particular issue my car was having. I decided to ask anyway to make her happy, and he did. He admitted he didn’t know what was wrong and how to fix it and suggested I go to a repair shop but stated that he made a minor tweak to my car that might have solved part of the issue. I thanked him for trying and made an appointment for later that week. My mother learned that I made the appointment and was really upset. She felt that by making the appointment I was implying my stepfather was stupid and didn’t know what he was doing and thereby being unappreciative. I apologized to her and my stepfather for making them feel that way.
She spent the next few days ignoring me and when I asked her if there was something wrong she’d very sarcastically say “no of course not sweetie.” I know that she was being childish and I didn’t have the mental capacity to cater to that so I apologized again but told her when she was ready to talk I would be there. The following day she sent me a long winded email telling me that I was unappreciative, disrespectful and need to change if I want to keep getting the support I have. She noted how I was on her phone plan, insurance and how they bought me my car. And if I wanted those luxuries I needed to be more respectful and appreciative of my stepfather because he is the man of the house. 
I responded by saying I think we should speak in person but that she was clearly upset and I felt I should give her time to work through that before we spoke. So I went to stay with a friend. She has not
tried to speak to me since and it has been nearly two weeks. I am afraid because I can not afford to pay for my own insurance and don’t know what I’d do if she took the car away. I don’t know if I should just apologize again or cut my loss and remove her from my life despite the costs. 
Thank you in advance, and I’m sorry for the length!",29Jun2020,1

528,"So weve been together for 2 years. In march he just opened tinder while we were talking (he streamed the whole thing) and he started swiping. He didnt really look at the profiles and we laughed at weird profiles. Then i asked him if hes using it for the intended purpose (finding love or sex). He said why would he use it for that. I believed him and still believe hes not using it to find someone else. Because why would he outright show me and start swiping with me there and hes not the type to lie. He knows i can be quite jealous and always clarifies if i dont need to worry about a close female friend. I always ask and he clarifies afterwards.

But hes been using it since then too. He still opens it while im there and swipes a bit but now he has matches. I dont know how much he talked to them but theres messages. I hope hes just trolling them which is still not a nice thing to do but i can let that slide. Hes been the type to do this kinda thing. Before he pretended to be a girl one time and talked with guys for fun. One guy even liked his online persona. One girl he showed he only messaged that her hometown name is weird.

532,"To sum up a long story short. I have a very small group of friends that have been in touch since our college years 10+ years ago. One of of my buddies “M” as long as I’ve known him lied about everything. Small or large it didn’t really matter he would find a way to lie about it. And for the longest it didn’t really bother us as we just assumed he did it to have something to brag about to the boys later.

But a decade later and the same shitty habit hasn’t really ever left. Lied about details regarding his military discharge, how his wife was about to land this 6 figure job only to find her working at Panda Express, how he was about to build his own home but he is struggling to pay rent. 

Honestly we just stopped believing anything he says and it kinda sucks but he hasn’t left us much choice. We will still play games online together or hang out occasionally because we enjoy his company but we just hate how often he lies over very inconsequential shit. 

We’ve called him out on his bs on multiple occasions only to have him either act offended or just flat out disappear for a while and return like nothing ever happened.

I would love for him to straighten out his act but honestly I’m just as equally ready to cut ties as I’m approaching 30 I’m really starting to value the quality of friends I have rather then the quantity. 

Are there any resources or help for someone like this? Guy is married and has 3  young kids and I would hate for him to be the same way he is now when they get older and can see through his bs.",29Jun2020,1
533,"Hey guys, first of all whoever commented on the first post thank you so much. You gave me some really good advice and I tried to take it and break things off. Unfortunately... a few factors played in a role in this though. I should add, I told him about the first post before I posted it but he doesn’t know about this one. 

So the few things that backfired in my face:

He did whatever was going through his mind. I don’t even think a normal teenager would do this, but he immediately decided to make a “pros and cons” list right off the bat. He put absolutely no thought into it- his “pro” list was rather about passing his toys down to a child rather than raising a healthy and happy being who accomplishes things. 

I told him he went about making the kid decision the wrong way, and that he should just make it when he knows and when he’s ready. I didn’t at all want him to feel forced to make his mind up- that’s why I tried to break up with him, and so that I wouldn’t find out otherwise.

Now, here’s a big key role in this.

He threatened his life. He started to say things like “I hate my life, I want to end it all,” and he asked me if he should and that he was going to do it. I can’t handle when people do this to me. Obviously I don’t want to end up being the cause of someone’s death, but sometimes I have that fear. 

And he knows this and he knows why, I almost couldn’t get someone to stay alive when I was 14. A 15 year old girl was about to kill herself, and I was lucky that I knew her older brother and had him on social media. Anyways back to this.

I’m normally very aware when someone is making an attempt to manipulate me (due to multiple people showing me consistent signs) and I realize it. But I can’t get past people threatening their life. He has a hatchet in his room and his at home relationships are... not the best.

I’m trying to look into his friend group in hopes that they’ll understand where I’m coming from- but I mean they’re teenage boys they think my feelings are stupid. I’m just trying to find all n all people that would check up on him after but I am having no luck.

I want to break up with him because I think if he’s going to go about making a decision like this with a “pro’s and con’s” list, I don’t want to collaborate on decisions with him in the future(I saw the list and it was really poorly thought out). But basically, I don’t have the shiny spine that will allow me to get out.",29Jun2020,1
534,"(Copy and pasted from r/aita because it got taken down and I’m at work so I’ll correct when I can) 

Alright so I have two sisters, one is sixteen with a baby so she is out of the question, my youngest sister however. She is a total rebel kid. Talks back, drinks, steals my cigarettes (Wich I put a stop to...thoes things are $7 A PACK I ain’t havin them waisted). mamma and deddy have been cracking down on her about chores and manners. She came home to mamma yelling at me for not taking out the scrap bowl to the hunting dogs. She came to me and said. “How?” I ask how what? “How do you just keep a stone face like that? Dosent it hurt your feelings when they yell at you?” I just tell her simply they raised me a whole lot differently than her and now they will start doing the same to her as they did me. She asked me to criticize her as if deddy would have done me. I straight up told her no, she’s to delicate for that. Now I was six years old when they tightened down and gave me punishment chores so I’m kind of numb to it now I guess. “Shut up I can handle it bubba, try me what’s something they would say to you”. Smug look and all, I pull up her private Snapchat where she rants about everything and read to her “”life is just meaningless and I want to know what the point is”, is this how you feel?” She slowly shook her head yes. I told her I feel the same but men don’t show emotion, men need to be strong and put others above our own self worth. Work from sun up to sun down with no complaints and be able to support a family by your self. “She looked at me and asked if I wanted to kill myself. I told her that if I ever put that gun to my head I wasn’t worth the bullet in the chamber and walked away.

536,"Hello! I (F22) have quite dry skin on my hands, especially around my nails which also look and feel very dry. I often have those bits of skin poking up from the sides of my nails and I find it incredibly difficult to leave them be, and so I would like to fix my dry skin problem. 

I'm wondering if anyone could recommend some nice lotions or products that could work for someone with dry (and lightly sensitive) skin. 

I have tried some of the generic ones that can be bought from any general food store, but I haven't noticed any kind of improvement even after applying lotion for a few days in a row.

Note that I am allergic to seaweed and can NOT have it touch my skin or it turns red and feels as though it's on fire. Thus, please do not recommend any products containing seaweed.

537,"In the introduction, shipping industry is mentioned. In the problem  statement, shipping industry is mentioned. 

RQs are more than ROs, and they do not directly match. 

Hypothesis  is : How does education service disruption and recovery effect in its market and customer post recovery satisfaction in service industries? Did they cover it up successfully.

In methodology,  it shows some results already and why the results were in that manner. I understand pilot tests, but is this the way to go with quantitative studies ?

Ihave explained that the paper is very wrong, but I do more of qualitative than quantitative papers. 

Mubcritics were that the topic is way too broad. The industries are way too broad. RQ and RO do not match ( 3 Rqs and 1 RO ). In the problem statement mentioned shipping meaning it focuses more in shipping industry.
Hypothesis focuses on education, which isnt in the problem statement.

538,"I've been thinking a lot about this recently and decided to ask after someone told me I could try asking for help here. 

&amp;#x200B;

*\[Disclaimer: Mention of depression and self-harm. Please message me if this violates any rules I am not aware of before you plan to remove this post, I will change the parts that are against the rules\]* 

  
So let's start. My friend and I are both between 14 and 18 (I don't know if they have reddit so I won't go into that much detail.). We both suffer since nearly a year from depression. 

We only recently discovered that the other is going through something similar because we only rarely meet. About one or two months ago I told my parents about it and decided to get professional help. 

My friend is in the process of graduating and didn't want their parents/sibling to know. They have a problem with self-harm for about half a year now, but recently their parents found out and they promised to stop. 

*(By the way, if you are suffering from depression as well and are thinking about suicide and/or hurting yourself, don't do it. You are worth it, you don't deserve to suffer and you're a good person. Believe me, hurting yourself won't help and if you need someone to talk to you have friends and if someone messages me I'll try my best to answer and help them.)* 

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes the part where I don't know what to do anymore. We've known each other for about five years now and they are very important to me, but due to reasons, which I'll explain in a second, we only see each other once or twice a year. Now I've started noticing patterns in our conversations like it's only ever me that starts conversations and they are mostly me asking questions and them answering. They never ask anything and sometimes don't respond at all and if they do, it's normally only one or two words. If they ever write more it's nearly all the time because they think I did something wrong and nearly all the time I end up apologizing (what partially may also be caused by my enormous social anxiety). It feels like they only ever contact me if they need/want something and then say they want to talk, but in the next minute “something urgent” comes up and they can't, then they tell me they will call me the next day and go silent for three days. They suggest meeting (We live about a 2 hour car ride away from each other) and then they cancel 12 times.

 When I offer them help and am there for them they always say that they are there for me too, but when I am not feeling well and need someone to talk to, they rarely have time. 

I also started noticing that talking to when we chat I don't get that happy feeling I have when I talk to my other friends, that feeling of not having to think about depression and stuff and can just relax. Instead our topics are mostly focused exactly on that and I often feel worse after talking to them. 

Now in the last time I reduced the times I try to start a conversation with them and so we nearly stopped talking completely.   

I really care about them and want to help them in any way I can, but it feels like they don't really want that. 

What do you suggest I should do and am I being a bad friend?

546,"I (23 half white/half Mexican F) live in an apartment facing a small side street and another apartment building across that street. Lately, two African American women have started walking their small, very loud and shrill (one literally barks with every step it takes) dogs every night anywhere between 10:00 to as late at 12:30. It wakes me up every single time as any noises are amplified as the two apartment buildings facing each other create a terrible echo chamber. 

I know I’m a grandma who sometimes goes to bed at 10 p.m. so I’m not expecting everyone to be all tucked in and cozy by 10. But it’s often 11 or later and I just feel like there should be a cutoff. I have to be up pretty early for my job and the lack of sleep is starting to wear on my mental/physical health.

I definitely understand how to bring an issue up politely and respectfully to someone, so that’s not the problem- it’s a few of other things. 1. I’ll literally be calling down at them from my second story balcony, which is definitely intimidating. 2. I’m not sure if it’s even my place to ask someone to do that as I live in a pretty large apartment complex and disturbances are kind of what you sign up for. 

So... I guess I’m asking— is there a time that is a generally accepted cutoff for being loud outside? Is it even my place to ask them to walk the dogs a little earlier or should I just accept it or try to move somewhere more secluded? Should I get ear plugs- does anyone have any good recommendations for those? Any other advice on specific phrasing or otherwise is totally welcome.

Twitch, YouTube, discord, Reddit, etc.All my favourite videos, subscriptions, my music playlists, all gone. Apparently I left my phone unlocked when I went out with my friends. He was also the only person left home at that time, so it's actually pretty obvious that it was him. I tried asking him about this, but apparently he thinks that I'm a fucking asshole for even assuming that it was him. And it's like that every time. No matter when or how many times I ask why he does this, it's always the same response. Obviously I gave up and just created new accounts, not really bothering about that incident. But, lo and behold, some time later, all of my accounts received hate mail/toxicity for no apparent reason. And from a newly created account too. Apparently, the same thing happened to all of my online friends, as they have told me. I tried responding to those messages, trying to find out who that is, (that's in fact my brother, because I know him personally, and that person's speech pattern/favourite phrases were suspiciously similar to him, but, I decided to play along). Well, the person behind those weird accounts just kept saying that I am an idiot and a dumbass and that he knows I want to become a transgender person (no idea where that's coming from, actually). Well, I... Just stopped blocked all those accounts and told all my friends to do the same. Unfortunately, it didn't stop. A week later, another account hate spammed me and all of friends with the same shit PLUS some new fancy roasts. And apparently there's no point in trying to block him, cause he'll easily create a new account in a few minutes anyway. I then tried talking to my brother again, (in real life this time) and uh, same response. 'Hey, are you okay? Why would you EVER think that it's me? But, on a side note, you should probably contact the admins of the related site if you want to get some actual help on trying to stop that guy. That's all I can really say, bro.' 
And now, he's also trying to hijack and delete my accounts. I now he'll never achieve this, because I'm super careful with my phone/passwords now.

Now I’m considering not even talking to them anymore  (except the one who is coming). Obviously if they don’t even want to come to my wedding we were never really friends in the first place. I feel kind of used and embarrassed to even have been wasting my time on them now.

I also understand there’s a pandemic right now, but it’s a small wedding and we’re doing social distancing and taking lots of measures to make sure others don’t get sick. It’s really unlikely anybody would get COVID.  

Anyways, am I overreacting? I’m really really hurt and feel disgusted with myself for ever thinking we were friends.",29Jun2020,1
562,"Soooo, last week I learned that my grandfather is dying, just a matter of time before he passes away.

Due to that, I fucked up handing in my documents for my internship to school and the company.

I think I also need to hand over a form to grade me to my Internal counselor, but I'm afraid I get negative feedback due to asking for a grading late and almost near the end of my internship (Friday this week).

I also am feeling nervous about the teacher that I got assigned by my school, I was supposed to send in documents last Friday but again due to the situation with my grandfather, I totally forgot it was the due date.  
Both my teacher and the employee that is supposed to grade me know of the situation, but I really feel like I fucked it all up.

571,"Hello everyone,

I have a brother who is about to do the HSC (really important entrance exams for university) in October, but has to deal with a toxic parent who constantly pressures and degrades him and has been doing so ever since he was a kid.

They are always picking on how lazy he is and **repeatedly shout at him and call him a failure.** He is partly to blame for this because he does procrastinate a lot instead of studying, but this seems more and more likely to be a way of escape from all the pressure. He's also developed some **'attachment' issues** (not sure what the correct term is) and may be slightly depressed. The 'attachment' refers to him taking things this parent says way too seriously--&gt; he knows most of it is trash but he can't help feeling mocked, hurt and frustrated.Basically, even when he worked harder to up his marks in exams from previous years, this parent would always bring him down by comparing him to others and say that his mark would be worth nothing in other schools. Unfortunately, he would take it to heart and think 'why did I even bother to prove them wrong' and consequently drop back down again. Also, every once in while, **a huge argument will erupt** and the whole family gets entangled in. This parent has their own issues too.

As for the HSC, his **first choice of uni requires a mark of 93**. His lowest choice requires a mark of 88. Right now, his **predicted mark is 72**. His school trial exams will be worth about 50%. The final HSC exams will be worth the remaining 50%. What can I do to:

1. help him deal with this parent and GET THAT 93
2. get the parent to shut up/reduce the amount of trashtalking they do

\-------------------------------------------

Below are some characteristics of both people:

**Brother**

\-procrastinator

\-goes tutoring--&gt; his tutors have already told him to ignore everything and everyone and just focus on his studies

\-low self-confidence

\-sometimes in denial and is prone to feeling sorry for himself

**Parent**

\-talks a lot + is super loud

\-really enjoys being correct and likes sound of own voice

\-arguing with this person is like talking to a literal wall because they think they're right--&gt; takes long time to wear down

\-prone to being in denial

\-runs a small shop, so gets home at about 9pm",29Jun2020,1

573,"so roughly a year ago my friend ( ill call them x) joined stan twitter and convinced me to join. while i only had around 45 followers and 1 person i talked to regularly x had almost 1000 followers and loads of mutuals. all of them seemed nice and really cool so dont worry. x grew addicted to twitter. x would spend everyday talking with people on twitter and making new friends. even when our friend group would hang out x wouldnt stop being on twitter and rarely put their phone away. we told x to put away their phone and talk with their friends at home instead. it somewhat worked but after x found a particular person whomst they actually started to have a relationship with, they would pull all nighters ( due to time difference). they were together for almost 2 months but after a misunderstanding they broke up. shortly after x found a new interest and left stan twitter. that was maybe 6 months ago. i still stayed on twitter but i was active about 3 hours a week and didnt talk to anyone. but recently x grew interested in their old interests and downloaded twitter again. they tweeted ” hello. mutuals pls.”. i honestly dont want the cycle to repeat and i dont want x to get addicted again. but i also feel like x has matured tremedously and that they can take care of themselves. im just worried but i dont want to intervene and its also kind of not my business. should i tell x that they shouldnt go back on twitter or atleast talk to anyone??",29Jun2020,1
574,"  Hello, I need some help from you guys.

My Boyfriend is 22 years of age and he has been at Uni for about 2 years but did not commit to it because he worked very hard to become better at what he was already doing. 

He started programming when he was 11 and has developed a deep understanding of low-level concepts and functionality. JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, bootstrap, Gatsby, meteor, WebSocket, MongoDB are only a few of the languages and tools he uses today. He is very inquisitive and tries to learn something new every day.

He has a small job that barely covers the Study fees. Over the years we had a lot of conversations about him having a Job that actually makes him happy and makes him an even better developer. All that bring us to this day where he is finally ready to drop out of Uni and get a good Job. He is still very scared that it is a bad thing to do, because he thinks he will not get a good or even any Job at all. 

With all that said I want to ask you guys, his community. What are your opinions and experiences on working without a CS degree? 

I have no idea about anything programming so I apologize if I use terms incorrectly. This is my point of view. If you need any more information to build an opinion on this, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Thank you very much for your time and I will be waiting for your answers.",29Jun2020,1
575,"I have been with this girl I met(through Xbox) for 7 months. I am from England and she is from USA. We have discussed many times that we intend to meet and the distance wouldn’t be a problem. After 7 months of constant talking, playing together, FaceTiming and watching things together she decided that as she’s very busy she needed more space. I didn’t take it too serious and started to miss her a lot. Then she went on a small vacation with her friends about a week ago. I understood and she called me the first night which was sweet as she was super busy and still making time for me. Then I got completely ghosted for about 5 days and was overthinking the whole time, just asking for re assurance. Then Sunday morning at 12 am for her and 5am for me I woke up to a text saying she doesn’t feel the same, she doesn’t know what she feels right now, and told me to delete everything of her and she’s sorry she ever met me. As you expect this broke my heart and I didn’t know how to react, then I found out she blocked me on EVERY form of social media. She then unblocked me on regular text messages and proceeded to be very emotional and apologetic. I comforted her and called her trying to calm her down. This was very tough for me considering all I want is for her to be happy. I love her more than I can explain. I asked her to talk when she comes back from vacation which is tomorrow for me and I want to fight for our relationship. For the past 2 days I haven’t texted her, giving her the complete space she wanted but I miss her a lot and just want to talk with her.  I’ve tried occupying myself and doing things to distract myself but I can’t stop thinking of the situation and how it is going to play out when she’s back. We have never spent this much time apart so I’m already not used to missing her this much. She is my main source of happiness and without her I don’t know what I would do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
PS. She is a very sweet girl who is so loving and caring and would do anything to not hurt me. Which is why I am so worried this is bad because it’s not like her at all. I couldn’t have ever imagined her doing something like that.",29Jun2020,1

577,"Hi everyone – 

Sort of a weird situation I’m in and would love anyone’s thoughts. Here are the basics. I was dating this girl for a couple of years, it ended almost two years ago. She was mentally abusive, an alcoholic with major anger issues that caused her to completely mistreat me and things really ended horribly. 

I got out of it and it was the best thing that happened to me. I’m really in a good place emotionally now, but it took a while to shake that off me. Here’s where it gets tricky. My best friend’s wife (who I’ve become extremely close with over the years) has been friends with my ex for just about 20 years. So it’s always a tad weird when I hear her name or see her on social media with her, but I accept it and don’t overthink it too much. 

Well this past weekend a bunch of the girls had a girls night (not only including my ex but also my brother’s current girlfriend, who is basically a sister to me). It was really tough to see everyone hanging out, for some reason it bothered me this time more than others, but again, out of my control. I wasn’t expecting anyone to disassociate with her or anything but everyone knew how awful she was to me, so it’s weird to see them all buddy/buddy I guess?  

Anyways, the 4th is coming up this weekend, my best friend and his wife said they were going to have people over a few days ago, sort of a mini cookout. Flash forward to last night and my other friends invite me over to their house for a cookout on Saturday. I’m like I thought we were going over so and so’s house. They said oh no they’re coming here, I say that’s weird but ok cool. Then they say oh btw (your ex girlfriend) is going to be here too.

Umm what? So I text my best friend and his wife and basically said what’s the deal I thought we were going over your place? And she’s like oh well they really wanted to do something for the 4th so we’ll just have people over on Sunday instead. So this pissed me off, my best friends wife basically blew off plans with me to go somewhere else where my ex girlfriend would be. And then they invite me knowing full well there’s no fucking way I’m gonna go and be around her.

Why would anyone ask me to be anywhere near her if I can avoid it? It’s really not cool of everyone to even put me in the position where I have to say no. I don’t want to be around her, I’m not comfortable or myself around her, the few times ive seen her since we’ve broken up were just awkward and it was hard for me to be myself. 

I guess this is more of a rant than asking for advice, but how would you all handle this situation if you were me?",29Jun2020,1
578,"Hi all. 
I want to start out by saying that I am 20 years old right now, and I started self harming at the age of 12-13, right after my mom died. It was super sudden and unexpected and I was the one who found her. It really traumatized me and with that and also me starting 8th grade that year, I went through an extreme depressive period and I never really got help. My dad put me and him in group therapy for the loss of my mom/his wife, and I also saw several other therapists over the years. But I never told my therapists or anyone about my self harming. I’m a junior in college now and I have a loving boyfriend who knows about my past and loves me anyways. 

I have always had trouble with my scars. I cut my thighs and wrists although the scars on my arm are not as bad as my thighs. Both of my thighs are absolutely covered in scars. They’re very noticeable. I know everyone sees them. I think people think i’m a freak or crazy and honestly I sometimes think that too. I can’t wrap my head around why I did it to this extent, and I honestly can’t remember those couple years very well. I feel like that period of my life is a blur. It is SO hard for me to wear shorts or a swimsuit around people. And I cry about it often. Thinking about the fact that one day I will have to explain it to my kids gives me major anxiety. I wish i could just get brand new legs. I’m struggling so hard right now. Does anyone have advice or remedies to make them less visible? Any help would be appreciated.

579,"So I (19f)live In Saudi Arabia and they have this established fund system to encourage citizens to take their studies beyond elementary and continue to college long ago, the system is still here tho it might be canceled bc of the recent economic issues with the pandemic, This incident happened at the start of my first year of college- I’m gonna start my second year after a few months- we have free education and on top of that the college gives us money and the amount depends on which you’re majoring, I would be given 290 dollars for 4 months in the term .

my mom (40f)told me to have 26 and give her the rest, we had talked before about what would happen to the money when I go to college and she opposed anyone who said they would take the money as a joke and said it’s gonna be saved for me to do whatever I want with it,I thought she would save it  like she said,skip to the last month everyone is asking me repeatedly what I’m doing with the money I said I saved them  and start asking how much is and I don’t know bc my mom has it.

one my aunts got angry at me saying I should be independent and I shouldn’t need my mom to save them for me, I started agreeing with bc I want to be independent and decided to ask my mom if I could save the money, my mom divorced my dad for personal reasons- I can say  the reason but it’s gonna be long messy- and remarried again to someone who I don’t like and don’t approve of him. 

when I asked about the money she didn’t answer at first but then she awkwardly told me that she spent it, I was surprised and appalled at the thought bc I wanted to save it to buy a car, when I calmly asked why she started to yell at me to shut up and to don’t ask anything although nobody is in the room and everyone was asleep.

I’m angry and tired of her toxic behavior and this crossed the line , I would’ve gave her the money if she just  told and I would’ve gave it to her gladly bc I value honesty and truth,The second term I didn’t have the fund bc of the system and I might have it next term before my college cuts it from us, I don’t want to give it to my mom until she tells me the reason why she took the money before.

581,"I'll try to keep it short. My friend (let's call him Ken) recently had a fight with his partner (let's call her Barbie). I am friends with both of them but I am in a dilemma since I found out Barbie is a toxic person.

2 days ago, Barbie blocked us (me and my friend group, including Ken) on instagram and didn't reply for many hours. It's not the first time this is happening. Once in 3 months, or less, every time she has a problem she'll block us all and later unblock us and go on like nothing happened. But this time she called me a while later and she was crying so much she couldn't breathe. She said she had a fight with her boyfriend and that he doesn't care about her, that her other friends were avoiding her and that she had been tossed away by everyone and that she was alone in the world. She was crying so much I had trouble communicating. I calmed her down and after talking for about an hour we ended the call. After that, she uploaded some instagram stories with song lyrics and song titles that were obviously directed to her boyfriend. 

The next morning (it was Ken's birthday that day) she called me again and said he was really really cold to her happy birthday message and that he had told her he needed some space. She claimed she was accepting and she didn't know what she was doing wrong and he was treating her that way. I suggested she asked him and talk to him, she said she had done it already but he was cold as hell and uninterested. She also mentioned and asked me multiple times not to tell him a thing about what we had talked about and not to mention that she was crying her eyes out or that she was a mess.

But since I am friends with both, I wanted to see if Ken was doing okay. I called him and asked him but told him ""she told me you had a fight but I know no details."" He was out with his friends for his birthday and said he'd text me later, which he did. He sent me screenshots of the conversation the two had the past 2 days and let me judge by myself. One thing I have to say is that the things Barbie had told me weren't halfway correct about what had happened. She had misinformed me and made the situation seem as if she were the victim.

What I saw was that she didn't let Ken breathe for 2 days, she had ranted and soammed him wih messages, the guy asked for space and she said ""oh, you're breaking up with me"", Ken said their relationship was moving too fast and she wasn't respectful at all, she sweared at him and overreacted over the smallest detail, stuff like that.

Now my dilemma is, Ken and Barbie don't know I have talked to both. Ken thinks I have only talked to him and Barbie thinks I have only talked to her. There are chances they'll get back together and I really don't know if I should talk to Ken about Barbie's whole attitude, misinforming me so she appeared the victim. My only hesitation is that Ken is already angry with her, if they are to break up once and for all while I have talked to him about her, it would be as if I gave him a reason more to break up. I don't want to interfere in their relationship, I care about them both but Barbie is at huge fault here.

582,"Context: last year I bought a purple Chinese Tang Dynasty style satin jacket from a Chinese-owned small store in Chinatown. The owner begged me to buy it because she said I looked nice, so I did.

However, there was always the question of cultural appropriation in the back of my mind. I always justified it saying I would never wear it as a costume and I bought it from a Chinese owned business, but I’m still afraid of getting called out or attacked because of it, as I am white. 

Keep in mind I have not worn it in a while, simply because I felt like in an age where Chinese people are getting attacked and insulted, I figured a white guy wearing it would come across as tasteless. 

I do think it’s beautiful and I love wearing it but I think it would probably be better to give it away. That said, I don’t want to give it to a thrift store because I remember the story of that girl who found a cheongsam at a thrift store and got called out for it.

Can you guys help me please? Whether it be determining whether it’s cultural appropriation and if it is, what to do with it?

With me and needles it’s one of those fears where you know nothing bad can happen and that’s it’s completely irrational but it still scares you.

My older brother is constantly stalking me online. I don't know why he started doing this, but a couple months ago, I was surprised to see that all of my accounts at the time were deleted/disabled. Twitch, YouTube, discord, Reddit, etc.All my favourite videos, subscriptions, my music playlists, all gone. Apparently I left my phone unlocked when I went out with my friends. He was also the only person left home at that time, so it's actually pretty obvious that it was him. I tried asking him about this, but apparently he thinks that I'm a fucking asshole for even assuming that it was him. 

And it's like that every time. No matter when or how many times I ask why he does this, it's always the same response. Obviously I gave up and just created new accounts, not really bothering about that incident. But, lo and behold, some time later, all of my accounts received hate mail/toxicity for no apparent reason.

 And from a newly created account too. Apparently, the same thing happened to all of my online friends, as they have told me. I tried responding to those messages, trying to find out who that is, (that's in fact my brother, because I know him personally, and that person's speech pattern/favourite phrases were suspiciously similar to him, but, I decided to play along). Well, the person behind those weird accounts just kept saying that I am an idiot and a dumbass and that he knows I want to become a transgender person (no idea where that's coming from, actually).

 Well, I... Just stopped blocked all those accounts and told all my friends to do the same. Unfortunately, it didn't stop. A week later, another account hate spammed me and all of friends with the same shit PLUS some new fancy roasts. And apparently there's no point in trying to block him, cause he'll easily create a new account in a few minutes anyway. I then tried talking to my brother again, (in real life this time) and uh, same response. 'Hey, are you okay? Why would you EVER think that it's me? But, on a side note, you should probably contact the admins of the related site if you want to get some actual help on trying to stop that guy. That's all I can really say, bro.' 


And now, he's also trying to hijack and delete my accounts. I now he'll never achieve this, because I'm super careful with my phone/passwords now. But still, occasionally the hate mail comes back, and now he's been saying some pretty graphic things to my friends, apart from trying to impersonate me and talk shit under my username on Reddit/discord/etc.

585,"I ordered an iPhone case from Best Buy online recently and something really bizarre happened. On the scheduled delivery day, I got a box containing a refurbished iPhone that said ""Verizon"" and ""Asurion"" on it (Verizon is not my provider). It had my name and address on it, though, so AFAICT from reading online, I have no legal responsibility to return it. My plan is to sell it and donate the money, since it's worth a few hundred dollars.

First of all (irrelevant to my question, feel free to skip this part) I later realized that the tracking number on the package (which didn't say ""Best Buy"" anywhere) was the same tracking number I'd been given for the case, so obviously Best Buy screwed up. The weird part is three days later I got my case in the mail in another package from the same carrier with the same tracking number on it. WTF?

My question is this though: I know the phone is mine to do what I want with, but I also know that Best Buy doesn't. The phone has GPS, and I have friends who've unknowingly bought stolen electronics and then been arrested for possession of mislaid goods, since the manufacturer is able to track the location of the device.

I want to sell this device on eBay or something and I don't want myself or the buyer to get screwed like that, so it seems like I need to contact Best Buy (or Asurion?) and inform them that (even though I never ordered a phone from them) I received it, the phone was addressed to me and correctly delivered (not misdelivered to my address, which would be a different legal scenario), and they do not have a right to attempt to recover the item by any means, especially not by tracking its location or contacting law enforcement about it, which I assume would be their normal course of action.

My question is: am I making a mistake here? Might Best Buy try to pursue action anyways in the hopes that I return the device rather than trying to fight them in small claims court? The whole situation just seems really weird and I want to make sure my logic stands up to scrutiny before I go outing myself to Best Buy.

EDIT: I live in Georgia in the United States, and the device was shipped to me from a warehouse in Kentucky, if any of that is relevant.",29Jun2020,2

It's just going round and round in my head, I've told 2 of my friends about my feeling but we don't talk about it (I was high at the time, I think they think I was joking), I do know I'm never going to be happy the way I am going now, I don't know if I should tell my family first or try transitioning in private?, I don't know how to go about this.",29Jun2020,1

589,"Hey Reddit,

So I am a 27 yr old female. I have been 100% on my own since I was 18. I was in foster care and put myself through college. My undergrad is a BA in English literature. I ended up working for a college for the past 3 years in Admissions / Financial Aid. I realized after growing into a new person and experiencing love, pain, beauty, work, loss, traveling, values, accomplishment... *Life ,* that I couldn't stand to work in an office for the rest of my life. As grateful as I was for the experience, stability and the paycheck; it made me miserable and i couldn't fathom doing something so unfulfilling until retirement. I decided i wanted to become a Clinical Mental Health Therapist and help people with depression and anxiety, find their happiness and strength and go on to also lead happy fulfilling lives.

Now that you know the back story, I was wondering if some people can help me out on this next choice. I am almost always a very reasonable logical person. I am extremely open minded as well and i am not afraid to work very hard to achieve what i want / need. I am at a cross roads..

I have come up with a plan about a year ago to quit my office job and become a server again (i have served in restaurants since i was 16, and at one point served while working my office job as well for extra cash to travel) so i am fully aware of how serving works, in fact i love it, and i like it so much more than an office job. But anyway, my plan is to serve at a busy restaurant bc of the flexibly and quick cash, and then go to graduate school full time and get my degree done in 3 years, then move out of New England to somewhere out west, and be a therapist and help people and live my best life in a beautiful state that i love and have traveled to often, but actually own a property and live there. Sounds great right?

So heres my dilemma, I got an interview at a great restaurant and they hired me on the spot, i resigned from my office job and have started my training. This week i also received a call for an interview (that i now already completed) and the interview went really well. This job is state benefits and like 13K more annually than what i made before. I worked at a non-profit and my salary was so low, so this new office job is so tempting bc its responsible, stable, and guaranteed money, however the job is the same office job ive had, and i know that i do not want to do this for the rest of my life.  If i take this job this will postpone my plan to finish grad school by several years. I am the type of person that believes wholeheartedly that you should do what makes you happy and follow your dreams and work your ass off to make your life what you want. I start classes this fall and I like the job of serving itself... i kind of dread saying yes to this office job if they offer me the job (which i kinda feel like they will tbh) bc i dont like the day to day actual job description... but the pay and benefits are so so good that i feel conflicted turning this down to do a job that may make me live paycheck to paycheck. I know ill make enough money serving to pay my bills, but i may not have enough for anything left over, i.e. savings/ traveling. Plus again, it gives me the flexibility i need to do grad school classes full time, so for example: if i have a class on Tuesday at 12:00 then Wednesdays at 3:30.. it doesn't matter bc i can just serve Tuesday night and the weekends to make my money, its not like its a hassle for a work schedule.  

So if anyone can help me with this internal moral dilemma i would greatly appreciate it. Am I stupid to turn down this office job with state benefits and pay, esp during a pandemic? Or would i be stupid to throw away my plan and do something that makes me actually happy while i go to school for something that is fulfilling? I just know what I want in the long run, im so sure of that... and thats why im a little impatient and want to start this now instead of wait...  I honestly wish i just had a mom that was there to support me and had the comfort that even if i fucked up i still had one person that would love me anyway lol but such is life i guess...

Any advice is much appreciated, thanks reddit.",29Jun2020,1

595,"Basically we moved in about a year ago and a super friendly man that lives down the street came to introduce himself. He promptly gave us a phone list of everyone’s names and numbers on our block. I thought “oh how nice” and he must be well-liked. Anyway, fast forward and we notice he just walks through our yard to come talk to us most of the time (okay, no big deal I guess). Then we would start hearing our dogs freaking out at night, I’d look outside and he would just be standing in our front yard with a flash light pointed at our house. That has happened a few times too. My husband told me every time he talks to this man his breath is very strong with alcohol and he usually repeats the same conversations over and over again as if he doesn’t remember having them. Last night was where things got really weird. My husband was cleaning out my car with our daughters while I soaked in the tub. I heard our dogs going nuts downstairs but I figured it was just because they saw neighbors walking their dogs or something. I also heard our side door open and shut slowly but assumed it was my husband or one of the kids. When they all came back inside about 20 minutes later, my husband asked me what I was talking to the neighbor about. I was confused and said I was in the bath the whole time I never spoke with our neighbor or knew he was around. Turns out my husband looked at our porch just in time to see our neighbor walking off our side porch, and I can only assume he is who opened our door! We spoke with our friends across the street and they said he does similar stuff to them (constant doorbell ringing at night and trying to talk to them through their mail slot). My husband is really mad and I’m just so creeped out!! He wants to confront him and tell him that he needs to stay away from our house but I’m nervous.

I don't have a car, but I've thought about trying to finance for a car.

606,"(USA) My boyfriend has been working at one place for a month, and he’s finally given up on the terrible environment. He’s had another job at his fingertips the whole time – his previous job, before everyone was laid off due to COVID - and is deciding to take it back. We have a three-month-old baby to provide for, and lately, this job hasn’t been cutting it. But he may have rushed into the transition.

He set up an interview with his old job (less than an hour away; we’re heading there now). This morning (Monday), around 6 AM, he called in his 24 hour notice. His shift would begin on Tuesday, at 6 PM. He was texted and notified that if he doesn’t come in to work tomorrow, his 24 hour notice will not stand. We’re young and learning life, but neither of us has ever heard of that. And logic says it doesn’t make sense. Anyway, when setting up his interview with his old job, they asked if he could be ready to work by the next day – tomorrow, Tuesday. If he worked both shifts (three, really), he’d work from 7AM-4PM, then 6PM-4:30PM, and another 7AM-4PM.

He missed a few days for being tested for COVID two weeks ago. Turns out they pay you for each day you miss when tested for it. Since we have a baby, this was amazing news – but though it was given an entire week, the COVID still hasn’t processed. He was meant to be paid last week and then only got paid for a day’s work. The money I had saved up from a scholarship refund for emergencies is quickly disappearing. This week’s paycheck should include three days’ pay for the COVID testing and then another full week, which could last us to the first paycheck of BF’s old/new job. But if his current job is just trying to find a way to cut his paycheck by saying he needs to work his next shift (which would be pretty much impossible for both of us), his check will go from $1,000 to $200. We can sustain ourselves with the money I have left (being a stay-at-home mom and all), but barely. And I’d really like to save what I can.

Overall, my question is: If my boyfriend called in his 24 hour notice with 12 extra hours, is it true that he would have to work his next shift in order for the notice to stand? Or do I just not understand 24 hour notices?",29Jun2020,1

Continuing throughout January - March my ex would constantly say rude things about me online, and mock me at school. Me being not smart realized that this is wrong, and I decided to ignore this person to the best of my ability. About a month ago in May, things started getting considerably worse. All of my ex’s friends became this cult following to my ex, and they would believe and do anything my ex said. My ex would constantly spread absolute lies and just degrade me on social media accounts. My ex would spread these false rumors about me to 60+ people in which they might believe it too be true. I blocked all my ex’s accounts and reported it multiple times to Instagram but they only view posts for bullying and harassment, ( my ex put these on their story ) so they denied all my reports. A week goes by after this and I figure out my ex is using her friends account to view mine, and continue to bully me on social media. Just now today my ex put a story on social media, in which she said, to bombard my posts where I go fishing with quote, “It would be greatly appreciated if you spam my ex’s posts with ""racists can’t fish"" in all their posts about fishing, thanks ❤️ JAVEHAKAHA I came up with that one on the spot and it’s true ✨✨”

I won't list all of it because we'd be here all day.  But, she basically would lie a lot, tell me and my coworker to do something, and then yell at us later on saying we are doing it wrong.

614,"Bit of backstory, I (26m) work in a call centre for a Telecommunications company, have been here for around 2 and a half years now and I work in inbound sales. 

The job is horrendous, or seems it to me now, the targets are so high that bonus for me is basically non-existant and I literally feel depressed whenever I'm at work. It can get really overbearing especially as I'm now working from home.

I used to be in a really good position within the business, was leading teams and progressing myself up the corporate ladder so to speak. I excelled whilst in these positions and even won awards and had my work recognised by the business during Annual Recognition ceremonies and the like however around a year ago despite all of this I was 'placed on the back shelf' as I like to call it. Since then I've had no chances to develop and am right back at stage 1 and have felt miserable ever since.

All the progression that I had made I now feel has vanished and been for nothing, I despise the job and honestly feel so awful every time I have to put my headset on.

The issue is the job itself is relatively well paid (despite the lack of bonus) and there are certain perks and benefits that I know for a fact I would miss if I left. Due to this I now feel trapped in what feels like a dead end job and desperately want a way out but I'm also not massively qualified and to get the same kind of pay in another job or field is very unlikely.

I know the obvious answer to this is simply to 'just look for another job' and that I should feel lucky to even have employment with everything that's going on but I'm finding things so difficult right now its unbelievable, I don't think I've ever been this demotivated in my entire life.

Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest and rant a little but any advice would also be massively appreciated, coping mechanisms, pretty much anything to stop me absolutely hating my life for 11hrs a day.

When I'm not at work I'm the happiest guy around, I am very reluctant to self diagnose myself with 'Depression' as I only feel this way at work and not at all otherwise.

615,"Had a really awkward rs with my ex, we already had big drama (got insulted and blocked ) but every time we found ourself speak to each other 
So once again I'm blocked from everywhere and I really want it to be the last time, I won a lot on confidence lately, like everything is going quite well and I feel like I can meet new friends, maybe date, chat all day ( which wouldn't have been possible the last 2/3 years )
The thing is I'm in a small village in France, I don't have a summer job and I can't have one 
I don't have any reason to go outside except once a week when going to party
I've tried r4r, tinder ( for the date aspect ) isn't an option, and I feel like if I don't met new people ima run down in the toxic rs again",29Jun2020,2
616,"I've(19F) been staying with my boyfriend(24M) and his family (parents and brother(28M)) for a few months during quarantine. And let me say their house is FILTHY. After a long convo with my bf the other day about this he gave in and decided we should at least clean the bathroom. So we went out and bought like 80$ worth of cleaning supplies and spent literally like 5-6 hours cleaning the whole thing as best we can (not perfect but we got it overall clean). And also let me say that while they all passed us by cleaning for hours, none of them offered to help, and only his mom said thank you. Afterwards we told them we really need to keep this up and keep it clean as we just spent so long at this, so it better not get back to being a disgusting mess like it was before.. I dont remember them giving us a solid response..

Skip to today, I just went to the bathroom to pee and lo and behold theres hair all in the tub/toilet seat and dried piss below the toilet.. I'm INFURIATED. 

So let me give some background info first before you give advice.

The older brother is very tall (maybe 6'5?) and obese, he struggles to crouch over or get up but overall he can do things well

The father is even taller, also obese, but he has other problems, cant move around well, practically impossible to do a real cleaning, maybe just things at level (sink, mirror, counter etc.) 

The mom is in good shape, average height, much able to clean and get around.

My boyfriend is also like the mom, in good shape, about 6'2

I pretty much expect all of them except the father to pitch in a good amount of cleaning throughout the week. But how do we reinforce this? My boyfriend's told me that in the past he was never able to make his family clean and has given up because it's so hard.. I believe we can if we really try, but it just really needs to happen. And the bathrooms are just a small step to the entire house. The entire house in filled in like a decade worth of filth and dust as they just never clean. It's a bad health hazard and honestly I just can't stand to come over here anymore until something has changed. 

About the hair and piss I woke up to, I am about 99% positive they're both from the brother. I'm pretty sure he took a shower earlier and my bf told me he's known to piss on the floor and never clean it up even after many times of telling him to clean up after himself. I just told my bf this and he was also really upset like me. The brother is working online right now so I'm not gonna bother him currently, but when he's done what do we say?? I dont wanna show how mad I am and turn him away but I also wanna be stern on how he needs to clean up his shit EVERY TIME. 

It's tough because technically I don't live here (though I've stayed here for a few months now) and I'm not family by blood, but I've been with my bf over a year now and they all pretty much see me as family. So I dont wanna come off as disrespectful, but also they really need to get out of these bad habits and make a change. My bf has been really unhappy with the situation here, and he agrees something needs to change, so it's not just me. Sadly we're not in a place to be able to move out right now, possible in a year or 2 however. But right now it really needs to happen for the better for everybody living here. 

I would really appreciate some advice on how we can go about this, thank you!",29Jun2020,0
617,"Background: I accepted a full time job at a very large company in August after interning for them last summer. The full time job started after my graduation and is planned for this August. After I accepted the offer, I received a misdemeanor  for obstructing official business. (Details really not that important) I’m worried if I tell the company, I will have my offer rescinded but I’m not sure it will show up on a background check. If it doesn’t show up and I tell them about it, I assume it will go on a record and will hamper my career in the future. What would be the best way to go about this?

618,"Long story short, we met in college, became roommates for awhile, haven’t seen each other for six months now, yadda yadda. I’m a gay man, and he’s trans. That matters, because on my other Reddit account I actively comment on a sub that views gay issues as something different than trans issues. 

Liking the same sex is very different than wanting to be trans. I could go on forever about this, but I won’t; essentially, the gay rights movement started as a very independent thing, and then through the years more and more got added onto it, like being non-binary, something I can’t relate to just because I’m gay.

LGBdroptheT is a sub that agrees with me, gay issues are different than trans issues. People have tried to claim that Alan Turing, a hero of WW2, was trans. This is the furthest thing from the truth: he was punished for being gay. Things like that anger me, so I post in the sub.

This morning I woke up to a text from my trans friend letting me know he’s been reading my posts since one of them ended up on the front page of Reddit. He saw my posts in LGBdroptheT and now is very upset. He says that it appears I hate trans people. He claims that because I’m going to be a teacher he hopes I never have a trans student. He took my posts very personally when I wrote that gay issues are different than trans issues.

Personally, I’m pretty upset. He shouldn’t be reading my post history. That’s just invasive. Secondly, I don’t hate trans people just because I see it as something different from being gay. He says people like me are terrifying, saying they support trans rights in public but saying they don’t in private. (Although I never said I didn’t anywhere.) But just because I see being gay as something else does not mean I hate trans people.

Now I don’t know what to do. It’s been a couple of hours since he texted me and I’m still in bed. It’s ridiculous that he has been going through every post of mine, reading every word. If he truly did, he would see that I literally say I support trans rights and have been downvoted in the past on that sub. Something tells me that he won’t listen to whatever I say. 

He hasn’t wrote to me in months, so if he truly was a friend he would’ve wrote sooner. I’m just upset he assumes all these things just because of some Reddit posts. I have been writing more because there’s a pandemic going on and I don’t want to go out. I’ve written some very personal things on that account, and now he’s actively reading them. It really angers me. On top of this, all of my college friends are friends with him, and I have no doubt they’d just cut me off without hearing what I have to say.

What should I do? Ignore this? Reply? I’m so annoyed and frustrated.",29Jun2020,1
620,"I am (28M) at lost. I don't enjoy my current job anymore but I don't know what should I pick if I decide to look for something else, which is quite likely, after the pandemic is over.

I graduated from English literature so I decided to apply as a translator at a local consulting company and I've been working at the company since May 2017.

People often says do what you enjoy, but what I enjoy (building model kits, playing games and guitar) does not provide stable income, as far as I can tell due to my poor skills.

In addition, I am most likely depressed and still trying to forgive my self of past mistakes and letting it go.

I don't have many friends, don't have any savings, don't have girlfriend and don't even know what I want to do with my life anymore.

624,"So I've (18) been depressed since i was a kid - like therapy since elementary school wise. I've moved from therapist to therapist because they move or something, but my current one I had since freshman year of high school. 

I always had this problem that I don't really know what it is, but its been impacting my life since forever. It's like I can't get my brain to concentrate on things important to me.

There's a range of how it's effecting me. The least of which is that  I cannot watch movies or binge watch a show - like if i got to the movie theaters I just leave my seat a lot cause I get jittery. I go to the bathroom, pace the front lobby, get a refill or just about anything to calm down. When I'm watching a show on Netflix I pause and get up and pace cause again I get jittery. This leads me to never finishing an episode. This has been happening since I could remember and while annoying I could live with it. 

The most its effecting me now are deadlines for colleges. I can't meet them, not because i don't want to or its beyond my ability but because I just \~can't\~. I can't explain it, but it stresses me the hell out. Its like I want to meet them, but I can't force my brain to concentrate on it. 

I guess because I got A's and B's no one really cared how I was handling work (usually work on the day of the deadline). however quarantine happen - online classes happen and I failed (exaggeration cause I don't know what I got cause \~ you know \~). Maybe because I had no structure or whatever, but I can't impose structure myself. Like I wanted to but I just couldn't and I was stress to death about it. Again it's like the college thing, I couldn't get my brain to concentrate.

I tried bring this up to my therapist, but she kinda push it aside. She says she was like that in high school too, and I understand it could be a universal thing but its causing me serious problems and I want to deal with it. maybe its because I can't describe it well, maybe it's because the issue could be that I'm just lazy or something, but I need her to understand I can't go to college without facing this issue. So how can I effectively do that?",29Jun2020,2
626,"Posting for a friend. 

He got into both law school and med school. Tomorrow is the cutoff date for law school confirmation. If he chooses law, his path is already set. He will inherit a family law firm in NYC. If he chooses med school, then he makes a name for himself on his own. The upside of med school for him is that it’s honest and he’ll help people. He also acknowledges that he can help people if he earns a lot from law and gives back to those in need. I know, he’s an overachiever but he’s quite humble. It might help to add that he is good at everything but is not passionate about anything.

627,"Just as the title suggest. I'm living at my parents house, for the first time in 6 years, working a job I hate, and looking to just start over. I sucked at high school. I have no real passion or drive and I'm stuck in the worst small town in my state with nothing to do (if you love working in a call center - this is the town for you). I'd love to get into arts or music or anything - but the nearest city that has any kind of scene like that is an hour drive away and my car is out of commission. My last relationship went to shit and I was cheated on. I'm just a complete loser by all accounts.

As a teen I was full of energy, rebellious, and hated confirming to societies standards. Thought ditching was cool and slept in class. I'm 25 now and honestly I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm so close to finding my true passion but everything I think I want to do I end up just hating.

630,"I’m 20 years old and yesterday it finally hit me and I broke down. I mean really crying and screaming and it felt like my inner child was coming out of me and expressing their anger and frustration. It came out of nowhere and it seems like I finally got to express my frustration towards the situation.

My mother was a heroin addict for most of my child hood. I have vivid memories of her just not being there for me. I would always see her bringing random people to the house to get high with while my dad was at work. I remember me being hungry so I went to the living room to ask her to cook me something and I seen her on the floor passed out. I was trying to wake her up but she wouldn’t and I remember my older sister telling me “she’s not gonna wake up, i’ll make you something. I remember mostly everyday after school my classmates and I would sit down after the bell to wait for our parents, and me always being the last one to be picked up; wishing that my mom cared enough to pick me up on time like everyone else. I remember my mom going in and out of jail. I remember when my mom was home wishing she’d hang out with me for more than an hour without locking her bedroom door to get high. I just wanted her to be my mom. I remember us being homeless and moving from motel to motel. I remember my father doing the beat he could to hold us down while my mother went out all the time to get high.

She’s now been 6 years clean and she’s now a great woman with a job and a new life and I’m very proud of her. But it seems like when she got clean, our family has never really sat down and talked about what happened in the past. I realized that I never actually got the chance to be upset and angry about the situation. It seems like I held it in the back of my mind for all of these years and yesterday was the day that it just hit me. Do I have the right to be angry and upset now ??? How should I go about this ?? Even though she’s an amazing woman now, I feel like I let her off too easy just because I’m the younger sibling of 3.

632,"Throwaway since friends know about my main account. Sorry if it’s a wall of text &lt;3

I [20M] have been considering dropping out of college. I’m majoring in construction management, and just finished my sophomore year in May. I originally went to college for an engineering degree but switched after the first year when I decided engineering wasn’t for me.

As long as I can remember I’ve always had this notion that to succeed in life I have to go to college and earn a degree, which has strongly been enforced by my mom [~60] and dad [~70]. They even started college funds for my twin sister and I when we were young so we didn’t have to worry about finances while attending. 

Last summer, I was fortunate enough to land an internship as a field engineer (not actually engineering related) with a commercial construction company. That summer I got to do a lot of hands-on work such as demo, carpentry, and other work like that while occasionally doing work in the office or on the computer related to the management side of the field. 

This summer, I was able to return to work with the same company, but I’m now rarely doing hands-on work and spend most of my day in front of the computer on a job site working on submittals, RFIs, and other management related tasks. Though I’m thankful that I can have this experience, I’m not happy. I’d much rather be doing the actual construction.

I’ve also always struggled with school, and I still have trouble focusing and sometime have no motivation to work on homework. I do have a learning disability, but other posts I’ve seen on reddit for people with similar issues lead me to think that I actually have a form of ADHD that was misdiagnosed. I do want to get professionally tested for this. 

When quarantine started, my three roommates all went back to stay with their families while I stayed at the apartment. All my classes went online and I was able to finish my semester strongly. But I didn’t enjoy what I was working on, and often thought about just dropping out and doing something else while also thinking that it would never be a possibility due to my parents. 

Because of these reasons, I’ve started to consider dropping out and going to a trade school either as a carpenter or as an electrician. If I go into either field, I’d be making money working as an apprentice while learning about the trade for 3-4 years. I’ve also thought about potentially getting a commercial drivers license as I’ve always liked working with large equipment.

I’ve only told my sister and her girlfriend about this. They both are supportive and my sister said she would even be there when I would tell my parents about it.

However, I think my parents would be less than receptive to this and wouldn’t be happy that I’d be wasting two years of school and tuition just to drop out. They’ve always pushed that college is the key to success, but my dad never even finished college and went on to become a successful business man, while my mom is in a career that doesn’t relate to her original degrees. 

I have also wanted to discuss this with my best friend/roommate [20F] and later the rest of my friend group,  but don’t know how they would react as all but 1 are in traditional college. Of my friends, I’m also the only one whose college education is 100% being funded by their parents so I don’t know if they’d react negatively to this thinking I’m throwing away an opportunity that was handed to me. 

I guess after all that, I’m mostly looking for advice on how to tell my parents I want to drop out and pursue a career in a construction trade since they might be disappointed in me for this decision. I would also like some advice on I could discuss this with my best friend, but it’s not as important since I think she and other friends would be mostly supportive.",29Jun2020,1

Heres my story,

I met my girlfriend on internet while playing video games, she 27yo and lives in Portugal, Shes everthing that i ever dreamed of and im deeply inlove with her. 

We met the first time here and in France, and later on, went to see her for the 2nd time in Portugal 2 month later, i get to met her parents, her city and their culture, and i totaly love everything about Portugal.

Since then ive been living in her parents for about 2 and a half year and im starting worry about our future.

Here is my issue.

I have schizophrenia, and im clinically not able to work, the government been sending an income for me to get better. but the contract is about to end in December.  What im scared that ill probably never find a job in Portugal, their economy is crashing, i dont speak portuguese, i dont have any degree, and i dont know if i should leave everything and come back to France. I wanted to work from home, i started video editing for Fiver , but i dont know how and where to get experience or even to get reconize. I kinda gave up on the idea cause i feel like i reached an impasse. I'm getting anxious just to think about what going to be the future of me and my girlfriend. Im finaly mentaly stable, and i really dont want to come back to France or to my abusive familly, If only i can find a job to get lunch money ,that would be enough for me to be relieved.

Should i learn an internet skill, or should seriously i start learning Portuguese?

643,"Using a backup account since I feel a bit ""ashamed"" about this post.

The title is pretty clear but I'd like to give you more informations so you can understand my problem perfectly. 

Years ago, I abandonned school and basically lost all my friends in the process since they had their own life and I was no longer a part of it ; it was very hard back then but I have now made my peace about it. Sadly, because of that, I found myself losing any ""communication skills"" I had to find new people to hang with in time. I ended not even trying anymore. I have some friends on internet, some of them that I even saw in real life but sadly, as they live ""far away"" from me, I can't see them every time like I could see a friend who lives in the same town as me.

Which leads us to the second problem. I won't reveal my town's name as I don't feel comfortable about it, but it's basically a pretty small town of around 15 000 people with nothing to do excepted going to the restaurant, to shop or to the sea. Which leads us again to another problem : money. I won't say I'm poor since I live under a roof, have a phone/tablet/computer ect.. but I don't have the money to go out and met new people at random locations like a concert or an event ect. That kind of thing rarely happen in my town anyways, but still. Point is that I don't have the opportunity to meet people with the same hobbies as me, neither I have the social skills needed in order to go to a stranger and start a conversation.

I'm 21 years old and I feel like I am missing on some of the best years of my life because of these problems. I like spending my time alone at my house to read, play ect.. but I'd love to have someone to go to, to talk with about random things ect.. and which who I can actually interact with (in contrary of an internet friend). Thing is, I really don't know how to find this person.

I'm usually a normal person regarding speaking. I talk properly, I have an average vocabulary, I don't yell, I'm not too quiet, I'm not inaudible. I guess I do have a generally deeper and softer voice for my age (16M). For the last week, I swear, people just wouldn't respond to my questions, answer when I call for them or listen to what I have to say. I thought it was a fluke at first, maybe I was speaking over someone else. Then I waited for those pauses between convos and said something. The moment I did it people would just continue talking about something else over me. Again, I regarded it as a fluke and did it again and again, just to be completely ignored. I tried raising my voice just to be told by a close friend that I was too loud. I tried speaking more clearly but then the same friend asked me why I'm talking so weirdly. It can't be because I did something bad that people judge me for because this is happening within multiple groups of unrelated people (friends and family). Do I have a judging expression on my face? Am I actually judgemental? This happening on texts too. Am I needy? I mean, this hasn't happened before and I am not sure what to think of it.

648,"Apologies if this doesn't belong to this sub but it is really bothering me and I just want to let it out of my system. 

I have been battling depression for the past five years. I was, what people call, an overachiever as a child. Things were going just the way I wanted to. Things changed when I turned 17 and my life hasn't been the same since. I have achieved nothing over the past few years. I haven't read a single book. I haven't discovered anything that truly makes me passionate. I have no physical or creative skills. I am ashamed to look back and see how I've wasted my prime years away being depressed. All this time, all I did was blame myself for letting my younger self down and sabotage my relationships with everyone and myself further.

Recently I've come to accept the fact that I may not be able to change my past but I can work for my future self. I have been attempting to learn creative skills that will help me feel better about myself. Initially I tried doing everything I could that the internet told me to but that didn't work out well. So I made a list of simple, achievable yet impressive skills I can learn at home. One of them was to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube. I heard people telling it is quite simple can easily be learned from YouTube. So I bought one and started practicing. But I just cannot seem to learn it. It is frustrating and I cannot believe how much it is causing me emotional turmoil. I have yet again started blaming myself for being an absolute failure. Everyone else seems to have no problem learning it. But I feel like I have failed yet again and it is impossible to break this cycle of blaming myself. 

I understand how foolish this may appear but it has been troubling me a lot today. I even had a full on breakdown because of it. Now I think there is no way to pick up new skills or habits because I cannot even seem to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube. I don't know what advice I am looking for but it would be nice to feel like someone heard me.",29Jun2020,1

650,"TL;DR: I want to be financially and emotionally/socially independent from my parents. I don't know where to begin. I'm still a university student and can't get a full-time job yet. 

I'm F22 and moved out from my parents in my late teens. I've been studying at university since I was 19 and haven't officially lived at home since then, but I stay with my parents every break, and summer break is almost 3 months so that's 3 months a year I don't need to pay for anything (I had rent-free uni ackommodation in the summer months before, not anymore though). I've had a few summer jobs but during the last few years I just saved what I could from my student loans (I'm pretty good at managing money) and lived off that during the summers. My parents buy me stuff all the time, like if I need new shoes or a new phone or furniture they pay for it (I never ask for it, they still offer to pay). I realize that this makes me kinda spoiled. But I also feel like I depend way to much on my parents. I feel like it's time to kick myself out of the nest, but I'm not exactly sure where to begin.

I want to depend less on my parents' money, but also more ""emotionally independent"". I feel like my parents have their ideas about the world and also about who *I* am and I don't necessarily agree. I don't like the person I am around my parents. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a sitcom with my family, where the characters always act the same way and never develop. I want to decide who I am on my own. 

I guess one first step would be to spend less time around my family and not go home every break (at least not the entirety of them). My mom always expects me to come home and stay there all summer and acts like that's the only option. They live in the countryside and I live in my uni city, to my mom it's unthinkable that I would want to spend a single summer day in a *CITY*. I didn't question that before, because it seemed reasonable and I usually don't really know what I want. I've made half-assed attempts to get summer jobs but I never had the guts or the discipline to subject myself to the *discomfort* of seeking out jobs. I feel embarrassed to admit this, but I guess that's a good sign. 

SO, Reddit, how do I go about becoming more independent? How can I deny myself the comfort of relying on my parents and be consistent about it? Mainly financially, I find it hard to not take advantage of the fact that my parents' wallets are open (especially when my siblings aren't any more independent than I). I want to be an adult. For real. I'm still a student though so I can't get a full-time job yet. 

Thank you in advance, sorry if I come across as spoiled and ungrateful.",29Jun2020,1
652,"To preface, my two sisters (18F and 15F) and I have lived with only my mom for the majority of our life after my dad moved out and remarried; he’s not totally estranged with biweekly “how are you guys” texts, but not much more than that. My mom, on the other hand, has been an alcoholic and emotionally abusive, and borderline physically abusive, towards me and my siblings for at least the last 10 years, once my dad moved out. For the 5 years before that, my parents would scream at each other (or more like my mom would scream at my dad) almost every single night, with some physical confrontations thrown into the mix. So essentially, we all grew up in a very toxic environment, especially my youngest sister.

Flash forward to more recent times. I currently go away for college but COVID forced me home with my family. I consider my sisters and I to be very close, but I try to avoid being home for more than 3 days at a time because my mom and I have a (clearly) bad relationship. But since being home, I’ve noticed that my (15F) sister has been acting very rude to everyone lately, especially my other sister. She would flat out ignore any and questions asked and not respond, and/ or not do anything asked of her; she would just sit on her phone and not say anything. This doesn’t happen all the time—it’s usually a period of a couple weeks when this happens, and then something changes and she’s “normal” (for lack of a better word) again for another couple weeks before it all starts again. I’ve resorted to quite literally not speaking to her when she is like this, out of frustration, but mainly out of anxiety that there is yet another problem going on in my family that I don’t know how to fix. It’s just frustrating that literally yesterday, she sent us a Snapchat of how she cut her hair and we all talked for an hour about it and then today, all of a sudden she’s in this mood again. Since we don’t have a relationship with our mom, we grew to be close so that we have each other and it makes me extremely anxious to feel like I’m losing her and even more anxious to feel like she’s losing us and going to feel even more alone. I guess part of my “tactic” of ignoring her was also to get her to realize that if she pushes us away, she’s not going to have anyone, but I don’t think that’s healthy for either of us. Her and my mom have also been going at it a lot more than ever before and I’m genuinely concerned one of them is going to end up hurt after a brawl once my other sister leaves for college in August.

So I guess what I’m asking is, is this her just being a teenager and we should give her space and ignore it, or is this something worse? My 18F sister seems to be getting very fed up with her actions lately and has said that she feels like she wants to just take her phone away to stop her from being so rude, so we’re all getting really frustrated. Is this something I should be concerned about, and bring up to her, since my mom doesn’t exactly do a great job as playing the parent in any of our lives? How do I talk to someone who won’t listen and probably will just ignore me anyway?

If you got this far, thank you. I appreciate any and all advice.",29Jun2020,1

I talked to one of them and said what’s going on and to invite me next time. He made up what sounded like an excuse saying that they don’t want to take me away from my girlfriend which makes no sense and I said to invite us next time.

657,"This is a long post but I’m trying to present a fair story so I can get some actual advice and putting tl;dr’s for clarity.

**Some family backstory**: I am a child of two second marriages. I have no full siblings, only half. My mother’s kids (brother and sister) have lived with me my whole life and we consider each other full blood. Their father, who I never met, died in 2003. My brother and sister have an estranged relationship with that side of the family, as the divorce was nasty. We all have a sort of half-close relationship with my mom’s side of the family, as she no longer talks to her brother and her sister and her have an on and off relationship. My father is an only child. We have no living grandparents.

**Tl;dr: our immediate family is kind of the only family we have.**

My sister is ten years old than me. She lived through a divorce (at around age 5) and the death of her father (at 18). She has a lot of problems. She constantly complains about her being the child of divorce. She complains about not making enough money (she’s a teacher). She complains about how our mother treats us, how she never got therapy to deal with her dad’s death, how she had to look after our brother when they were kids, how she will never get married or have children (she’s been in a few long relationships that have always ended poorly). She constantly weasels into me and my boyfriends life and my brother and his wife’s life. She tries to be best friends with our SO’s. We can never do anything fun without including her because she feels left out and ruins fun for everyone. She can’t take any criticism or she cries. She makes me feel guilty for saying I’m the child of a “working marriage.” She is always talking about her weight, losing weight, and how “Fat” she is when I’ve asked her not to because it makes me uncomfortable. She blows up our family group chat with irrelevant details about her life, updating us on every single thing she does and expecting huge congratulations for small accomplishments. She even made us celebrate her 35th birthday during corona because it was “a big birthday” when I allowed my 25th birthday and my doctoral graduation to slide by because I didn’t want people to feel uncomfortable. 

**Tl;dr: my sister is annoying as fuck.**

I have had a lot of trauma in my life as well (family shit that we share but also depression, suicidal ideation as a teen, sexual trauma, and I’m dealing with BPD currently) . So had my brother (family shit and alcoholism).  We've both gotten our shit together. I’ve gone to therapy. I’m constantly doing work on myself. I’m tired of being held to this family member who is a constant downer, never does anything to help herself, says grand plans about getting a new job or fixing her life but never follows through, won’t go see a therapist, never asks me about my problems but expects me to be at every beck and call, guilt me and my brother for having romantic lives and friends outside of our family, and is overall annoying. I’ve tried to give her advice. I’ve tried to be kind. I’m so tired of her negativity and her emotional immaturity. ***How do I tackle our relationship without just straight abandoning her?***

Ever since we've been best friends, we've been extremely close with each other. When we first started hanging out, I never really thought too much about him, but then I realized how much he actually looked up to me and thought I was funny and cool. I had never had someone look up to me before. 

After that I went through alot of personality changes because of him and became way more confident and outgoing. Before social distancing we would hang out with each other at least three times a week, and the only reason we didn't hang out more was because of how far we live from each other. After social distancing we've started hanging out over zoom or playing videogames everyday (although it's not nearly the same as hanging out in person). I love hanging out with him and he loves hanging out with me. 

To this day we've never gotten into a fight or been mad at each other for more than a few minutes. We both can't imagine life without each other, and our friendship has stopped each other from doing stupid stuff. 

I pretty sure I'm in love with him, and I'm almost positive he feels the same. But this is where the situation gets stupidly tough, we are both part of a religion that we both also love, and in our situation we wouldn't be able to be part of the religion and be together. I do believe in this religion and so does both our families and our friends. 

I've been thinking alot about life while being stuck at home during this covid thing. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think it might be worth it leaving everything behind in my life just to be with him.

662,"Context, I've been collecting all the loose hair I've had into this one huge hairball. My goal is to see it be a super-packed, dense hairball with as few rough spots as possible.

My current problem now is that whenever I add new hair- which I collected into mini-balls- they do not mesh well.

663,"Ok, so. We’re a group of four and we met in a online game years ago and have remained close ever since. Then a couple of months ago, friend A’s mom passed away but because we’re literally from different countries all we could do was console through messaging and calls. 

Then friend A took a step back from the game and we still talk but not as much. Which is fine and the other 3 of us continue to bond. After two months we haven’t been including her in our conversations, because we didn’t want to bring her down even more with our problems, which admittedly we should have let her decide that. 

Then one day we wanted to include her in something in the game and she snapped,  got angry and hurt and felt like we didn’t care about her because we didnt include her in our discussions. Which I understand and I’ve apologised and tried to explain and apologised again. And I told her that I’ll be waiting if she wants to continue the friendship and she snapped at me and asked why aren’t I fighting for the friendship. It’s not that I’m not but I’m not the kind of person who pushes people to be in relationships they may not want, which till then I thought she didn’t want anything to do with us anymore. So I was giving her the reigns. 

Now since then she’s been guilt tripping me and my other friends for hurting her, after us apologising again she’ll reply stuff like “no one cares about me, I bought this thing because it reminded me of our friendship but I guess it didn’t matter to you. I guess you and B are closer friends and I don’t matter. You included friend C but not me? How could you”. 

This is the first time I’ve seen her being passive aggressive. Friend B and C are exhausted and don’t know what to say to her anymore and so have I. They’ve also apologised time and time again and will try to do better but she just keeps guilt tripping us. And I’ve also snapped because while I understand she’s doing this because she’s hurting, she’s twisting words around saying we didn’t apologise or trying to do better. So from what I understand she doesn’t actually want apologies(even though she said she wants them), she just wants to keep hurting us for hurting her for now. And I’m not sure how long I should take this. 

And I don’t know what to do anymore other than to stop talking to her. Ask me for more info if you need to clarify anything. Any advice is appreciated.",29Jun2020,1

665,"I had a friend reach out to me 2 days ago asking to talk. They (non-binary) told me how feelings were coming up from an encounter that happened 6 months ago and they needed somebody to talk to. 

Their side of the story is as follows:

“I was at a friends house (Colby) with him and one other boy (Sam). Sam and I had been friends for years. Colby was trying to encourage me and Sam hooking up, but we both stated how we were not interested in each other and even laughed at the idea of us ever having sex. The last thing I remember is Colby bringing us a condom, and then next thing I know I woke up in the morning completely naked, and I knew I had sex. I was so sad because that’s the last thing I wanted. I don’t want to call Sam a rapist, but I feel violated because I know I would have never tried to have sex with him”

Apparently they haven’t spoken to Colby since that night. 

So I come in, try talking them down, share my own experience, etc... eventually they tell me that Sam had blocked them on everything after they tried reaching out to figure out what happened. I find out that meant my friend was apologizing profusely over text, DM, etc... and was eventually blocked. At this point I didn’t read much into them apologizing, as victims of assault tend to blame themselves. 

At this point my friend told me Sams name (not actually Sam) so I looked him up on social media. I find out that my friend must have seen a twitter thread he posted before reaching out to me, likely why these feelings were brought up. 

I just read the thread and I honestly think my friend is the rapist. Sam decided to share his side of the story, to which he explained in detail how my friend was feeding him drinks, wouldn’t let him leave, took off his clothes, called Colby for a condom, and proceeded to rape him. Sam went on to say how he had a recording of himself that night saying what happened because he was afraid he would forget. He also had walked 5 miles home that night and was eventually picked up by a cop asking why he was out so late and so upset. He lied to the cop (didn’t disclose what happened) and was given a ride home. 

I literally just finished reading this thread, and my friend is texting me asking what to do. 

I know the rules against asking for legal advice, but both my friend and Sam have said in their texts/tweets how they didn’t want to get law enforcement involved. 

So what do I do now as a friend?? I wasn’t there, I want to believe them, but after reading that twitter thread there are too many problems in my friends story that aren’t adding up. I simply don’t believe them anymore. How do I say that? Or am I a shitty friend for believing a twitter thread of some boy I’ve never met over a friend I’ve had for 3 years?",29Jun2020,1

Now, I'm not depressed or anything, but I do find myself talking myself down a lot, so much in fact that it's become a part of my subconscious. I've always had issues like this before, and I've been starting to become really confused with how to think and exactly how to act. I used to be really gregarious, used to talk to everyone and make friends with a majority of people I met. Now, I can't trust anybody. Don't get me wrong, nothing bad has happened to me, it's just that every real friend I've made has either left me, ignored me, or took advantage of me. I cry too much and I'm very well aware that I complain too much (hence this Reddit post), so I don't really feel comfortable talking about these kinds of things to people irl. I like the anonymity of the internet.

I don't think I'm really on good terms with my parents. I'm always caught saying the wrong things to them, and then I automatically have to put the blame on someone. They tell me to read books about improving my life (Ex: The Happiness Advantage which I do encourage anyone to read, it's really good). I also just got into a fight with my dad which did result in him taking away my phone. I don't really mind it though, I don't need a phone anyway. Every time we get into a fight, we talk afterwards about what I should do to improve myself, and every time they tell me to listen to motivational music, set a goal, read books by Tony Robbins. For a short while, I do them and I seem happy, but then something small (like constantly getting something wrong on Khan Academy while I study, or losing in a competitive video game like LoL) makes my confidence and everything I built up to come crashing down. I'm not saying I'm a victim, I'm very well aware that I'm probably a really bad person for just giving up like that, but I do want to change.

After a while, my parents started to get angry with every talk we have, since the lessons they're trying to teach me isn't getting through my head. I don't know if I'm just being an idiot, but it's hard for me to remember everything and apply it to everything. I get so confused on what exactly to do with my parents or other people, so I just don't really talk to them about my problems anymore.

So he comes with a hanger(the thing u use to hold clothes in the wardrobe) and breaks it by hitting really hard wherever he could reach. I was so angry(Not a tear from my eye yet)... He told me to get outta the house nakey(btw I'm a guy).
So I say straight no to his face(I'm really really angry at the moment). He now brings the old mop(made of metal and starts whipping. He breaks tht too. And he is hitting me with the broken metal rod which now makes me really really angry and I like shout on him bad and take the fucking rod and throw it away. Then I drop to the floor and start crying(I'm the type of person who can't handle his anger and starts crying after I lose it). He tries coming at me again with the rod. I'm so full of rage at I hit him and kick him in the abdomen. I thought my mom would support me(my mom usually takes my side when I get hit bad). I was surprised when she took Dads side and started scolding me(note that I only hit dad in self-defence). I was traumatized. So just ignored them for some time and ended up sleeping.

When I woke the scene in my house was legit dull. Now all I can think is ways to kill myself and feelings of guilt. Pls tell me what I should do. I even I asked my best friend but he was of no help. I can't stand my parents treating me like this for the next three years(I turn 18 in 3 years) I need some advice. I'm sorry if this post was too long to read.",29Jun2020,1

683,"Hello, everyone,

I have the following question: 

My first move out is imminent and I've already signed the lease. A few days ago I told the landlord that I would like to paint the radiators. Today he called me and said that they could not be painted because there is a special paint on them and he would rather have new ones installed. However, he wants to add a new clause to the contract in which I sign that I waive my right to terminate the contract for two years. Otherwise the investment would not be worthwhile for him.

I find the whole thing a bit strange and so I wanted to ask what you think about it?

685,"I have a BA in English, I worked in the legal field as a legal assistant/paralegal for 4 years. I'll be honest, I never really liked the job. The pay was low &amp; my interest was non-existent but it paid the rent/bills and put food on my table. I moved into the tech field and worked as a CSC technical consultant for about a year (It was basically a call center job that assisted with technical troubleshooting). I really disliked that job, primarily because of the back to back calls &amp; dealing with angry customers. 

I took a year off from working &amp; lived on my savings. My goal was to find a job that would make me happy. But as time went on, my mind kept running in circles. What would bring me most profit? What would make me happy to go into work every day? What's not going to send me into depression? 

I thought perhaps, nursing? So I signed up for classes to take my pre-requisites. But the more I thought about it, the less appealing it became to me. I researched the career from front to back. I asked a lot of nurses of their day to day life in the field and their happiness. Let's just say, it takes a certain personality to be a nurse and that's just not me. So I cancelled the classes and now I'm back at square one. 

I'm 28 years old. I feel as if I have nothing to show for it at this point. I still haven't found a career I'm happy about. And when I mean happy, I mean I'm not feeling like I'm wasting 40 hours of my life doing a job that I care nothing for. I just want to find a job where I feel like I'm working towards something, something that gives my life purpose and meaning. 

I realized this is the case for many people. Like who wants to work? I've done so many career tests &amp; personality tests to figure it out. I've even considered e-commerce, setting up my own store &amp; being my own boss. I'm actually still researching that so I can't say for certain it may not be for me at this point. I'm in the process of looking for another 9-5 office job, something just to do as I figure this out. Since taking time off did nothing for me, might as well just work while I'm searching.

I felt like this a few years ago when I started cutting myself and having suicidal thoughts for approx 2 years. Because of school and after two years I decided to leave my friend group and find a new one. This caused me to be happier and I felt a lot better but because of quarantine everything's went to shit again except for with my family this time.

Everytime I speak I get interrupted or talked over or ignored, I'm a smart child I know my stuff you need something fixed I can help you need help with anything that's usually a job for me but during quarantine whenever I try and help I'm told the same thing ""I don't need help from a 15 year old""
E.g my mother she has a gambling addiction because of the happiness it brings her, yet when she says she has no money and I mention her gambling or the fact that she buys lots of takeaways she says the same thing to me or when I tell her that somethings wrong with her laptop or phone and I can fix it I get told the same thing.

My suicidal thought are coming back and I'm feeling more and more depressed. One of the main causes of this is my older sister (I have 4 siblings) she constantly belittles me calling me fat because I've out on a lot of weight during lockdown or called me sad or a loner etc. 

I just really need to know what to do I don't want to relapse and start cutting and I really need to start doing exercise to lose weight but you can't do that when I'm being out down all the time.
Like today I mentioned an invention I had for a foldable for my window where I could push it down when not needed and it would push the support brackets down with it as I thought I could put springs there and when I pushed it up the springs would go up and support the shelf.
But before you even finished my mam interrupted sayings it's stupid and that I can't drill into the windows plastic because its council property. Like if she had left me finish she would have know that I wasnt going to actually do it.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes and grammar.

Edit: I also have to repress my feelings cause of this causing me to seem sociopathic to my friends at school or people that see me. I always look sad and I'm snappy most of the time and angry because when I do get to spoke I've most likely had to shout over someone. I used to and still kind of have a quiet voice and quite footsteps and it caused people to not hear me and I would hear the things they say about me.

689,"Hi, 

So I had a break in January, the main losses were my laptop, my camera (an x50 kiss Canon , loved that thing!)  and an Icon motorcycle helmet, I called the police and all that, checked the cameras and saw 3 guys leaving with my stuff, the case is still open but the cops say there's nothing to do there. 

Anyway, I found the camera and the helmet on marketplace, contacted the seller but the camera was already sold, he still has the helmet. 

I talked to the police and they told me they can recover the helmet if I set him up, but my roomie is scared to death about it, she says that even if they capture 1 guy the other 2 might come back for vengeance, and who knows if they're part of a bigger organization, we live in a gated community and the police told us that usually in this situations they have help from a guard or maid. 

I think she's right, but that's my helmet! It's so frustrating to see somebody selling my stuff! The stuff I worked for and enjoyed having! I try to think it's just stuff and safety is way more important than a helmet, but it's the principle, I'm seeing my property and I can get it back.

What should I do? Let them keep my things and swallow the loss? Set the guy up and try to further the police investigation?

696,"Hey guys,

We are often told that we should do what we love to do. I have a few interests here and there, it's okay, but my biggest passion is one where I experience moral conflict. It's provoking perople, it's about saire, maybe even cynicism. That's also where I naturally success

I will tell you why:

Encounter #1) I was about 13 or 14. I discovered an online comunnity that consisted of trolls who were acting real. We were pretending to be Christians in a very extreme manner, it was satire. People didn't know that was satire, so they came to our forums and discussed heavily with us. This was super funny to me, I was super passionate about it. I even created videos and got to the position of an administrator on the website. But: people were seriously worried and scared, because our content was extreme (hating women, gay people... self-harming for God and so on). We were exaggerating what was wrong with the church to an extreme. In my country that community was very known for some time though and even in the news a couple of times, I believe.

Encounter #2) I was about 21 or 22. I created a character (that also was a part of me) who was extremely dramatic, mentally ill, unstable and just crazy. It was an online thing again. I was posting stuff about ""my life"" which also was partly true and it was just super exaggerated. People loved and hated it so much. I got so many reactions and my character got pretty popular in the online community. I got big. Sadly I revealed everything after a year or so, because I felt bad. People tried to help me a lot and I wasted their time. My character also often got very angry and stubborn and people just went complete nuts. They HATED it that my character didn't want their help and felt impossible to change.

Then I just have small encounters who follow the same pattern, but things didn't get really big. Exaggerating something I believe to be wrong a lot to the point that it drives people crazy.

Reactions. Reactions are extremely fun for me.

So yea, I just have a passion for stuff like that, but also a huge moral conflict regarding that, because ultimately I play with people and their emotions. What do you think? My therapist who is a old guy suggested me drawing satirical caricatures in newspapers, lol. That's highly unlikely to get into though and not really my style. And it would go it's own way anyways, but my moral conflict is holding me back. It's a passion, so it runs on being intuitive, impulsive, creativity, in the moment. It's annoying to think about crossing lines or anything like that, although I certainly did that sometimes.",29Jun2020,1
697,"Ok, my (33F) partner (36M) has been tracking all of the latest COVID upticks and we've been discussing the goings on pretty regularly. 

A month or so ago, my mom put together plans to go to Florida--back before the exponential rise, but of course in the midst of everything. Everyone in her household has continued working through the pandemic either remotely or is considered essential. Everyone has sent in their vacation requests, approvals have gone through, deposits made etc etc.

Then of course last week happened with FL (9k cases in one day), then we find out one of our pets is immune compromised.

I, of course, want to go, but am obviously paying attention to how horrendously infectious this virus is and how it is spreading. My cousin who will meet us there, is also paying attention to everything (lives in FL) and is ardently sanitizing and avoid large gatherings like me and my partner. Cousin and myself will be hardcore enforcers of sanitizing and avoidance. We are both introverts anyway, so social distancing is not a problem in the slightest. We have a preference for isolated state parks rather than big boardwalks--basically day-camping.

My partner (who will not be going anyway because he doesn't like the beach to begin with and also doesn't get along with my family) has recently threatened that should I partake in this family trip, should I get sick and should I expose our pet, he will leave. He considers it incredibly selfish to partake in risky behavior in a known hotspot for the sake of being on the beach.

I could back out. I could.

As a family we obviously haven't spent much time together for a while and I would like to see them again. Outside, in the sun seems like the safer option... generally when we do beach trips we aren't huge about going to restaurants or bars anyway. We prefer to cook our own food and stick to ourselves. Combined with mine and my cousin's propensity for cleanliness, I know for sure that we can keep things safe for all of us.

My mom is watching for beach closures, but otherwise this is full steam ahead for their household.

705,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, this is complicated and fucked up and just happened over the last few days so bear with me.

My (F24) 30 year old sister lives with her husband and 2 children (3 y.o. and baby) in a very expensive major city in the PNW. About a year ago my parents moved from the midwest to be closer to them and the grandkids, as my brother and I graduated college and also moved away from the midwest. My dad runs a 501C3 that helps adults with special needs, my mom is a school teacher with like 38 years of experience and just got laid off with all the corona downsizing. Growing up our family always seemed perfect; we were very active in the community, athlete, good grades etc etc, but when I went to college I realized a lot of things I thought were normal about our family dynamic are really weird and toxic (to an extent that is normal, right? Realizing your parents fucked up even though they were trying their best?) My dad, in particular, has a LOT of toxic behavior: 0 boundaries, pushed his own insecurities on to us, taught us that ""love"" means ""I need you"" aka if we set boundaries it means we don't love him, I now recognize that we had to be his parent most of the time. He can be very frustrating, and in the past few years isn't very good at socializing without offending people simply because he isn't around people a lot? I think I've done an ok job of recognizing these traits and not being angry or blaming him, I know he's a flawed human but he always went over the top to love and support us.

A few nights ago my sister texted me and said that she was going to have a ""big boundaries talk"" with my dad but wouldn't give me any other information, and asked that I call him afterwards to ""make sure he got home ok"", then call her afterward and tell her what he said. She apologized for putting me in the middle of it and repeatedly made sure I was still okay with calling him (I would rather not but it was obviously important) and sometimes when you tell my Dad something he cherrypicks information so I understood where she was coming from. Last night my sister sat down with my dad and told him that when she was in high school (15 years ago) she got on his computer and there was an unopened email that showed explicit child porn and was like ""subscribe here!!"" She panicked and immediately deleted it, but her thought process is 'Spam emails do not contain explicit child porn, you have to go looking for it to receive content like that'. Because of this, in order to see her or the grandkids my dad has to go see a psychiatrist that she will pay for and then he can only see them when she is there to supervise, and in the event my parents need a place to stay while their new house is being built he is not welcome to stay there. While on the phone for about 2 hours, my dad switched between shock, anger, disbelief, more shock, crying.

I immediately called my sister after hanging up from my dad and she confirmed everything he had said. I said, ""Do you think that Dad is a child predator?"" and there was a pause and she said, ""I don't think that email was sent to him on accident."" and I said, ""that's not an answer,"" and there was a pause and she started crying and said, ""I don't know, but I have kids now and I can't take that risk."" I made it clear that yes, my initial emotions are anger with her and that I need to think everything through, but also that I don't blame her because if there is any doubt in her mind then of course she is doing the right thing. This is all very complicated to navigate as: it is humiliating and horrible to feel defensive of my dad (who I do not believe could EVER hurt a child and for all his faults is a deeply compassionate, philanthropic man) against something like this, but I also want to support my sister, who is intelligent and compassionate and is protecting her kids. 

About a month ago my sister sat down with my mom and told her all of this, hoping she and my mom could sit down with my dad and have this conversation with him but my mom basically ghosted her, pretended nothing happened, then told my dad vaguely ""You need to respect their boundaries!"" She  was confronted with the information that her husband might be a child predator and her reaction (as a mother, grandmother and educator) was to say nothing, which leads to either a. she agrees, and therefore what the hell is wrong with you to have been a passive person this whole time? b. she doesn't agree, and chose not to say anything in defense of him. She literally did not help my sister OR my dad, she was given all this information and just... forgot about it. I am angry about this. 

I don't think my sister had planned to tell me any of this in order to protect me emotionally, as now I feel I'm the only person between my dad and suicide because without me he is completely alone. I suspect that if she had known any other way to ensure my dad got home safely, I would have only been told about all of this if I one day have my own kids (which I have made clear I don't see in my future). 

In conclusion, this is all beyond horrifying and humiliating and I'm still working through all the emotions or how to navigate any of it. I love my dad and the idea that he is a predator is ludicrous, but at the same time I know that predators are manipulative and sometimes hide in plain sight?? It also doesn't really matter what EYE think here. My questions here are:

\- Do I have a right to know everything that is going on, or is it okay that I only know minimum?

\- I am doing my best to support my sister but also my dad, but I don't know what the truth is?

\- Am I allowed to be furious with my mom?

My parents don’t listen to me, I say to my parents “why do you never listen to how I’m feeling, I think it’s important you listen”. All they say is “you’re fine okay, we don’t want to be in this situation sorry”. They leave me crying on my own.

I find someone who’s there for me, I trust him for 2 years, he leaves me and I break down. I can’t explain how much that hurt me. Then a week later someone in my family dies. I bet she wants to be with me right now but she can’t, she’s gone forever. I’m crying writing this. All she wanted was to see me happy, and I’m letting her down. I’m trying but I feel like I’m done. I got professional help but It didn’t help me. Now I feel like it’s time I do the world a favour and just go. No one would care if I died anyway. I come here to see if I could get any advice from anyone who might of experienced the same but now I feel like I’m waisting people’s time. I’m sorry, I’m literally right on the edge right now",29Jun2020,1
713,"(On mobile, plus my thoughts might be jumbled and a tad frantic. Please bare with me)

I'm going through some difficult situations and I am unsure how to come clean to my family about them.

I (F 23) am approximately 32 weeks pregnant. Right now, I'm going through the steps to get my unborn child up to adoption and I am already clearly set in that idea. I want the best for them and I know that, despite the outpour of love I can offer them, they will be better off in a more stable, two parent household. 

Despite all of that and the decision I am making, I am slowly reaching the point where I am beginning to appear physically pregnant. Most people who know me just think I am getting fat which I am fine with but I am nervous about actually telling those who know me and not my close circle of online and internet friends. 

My pregnancy was unplanned and I am still on good terms with the father (M 21) but he is young and unmotivated, not to mention our relationship itself was mostly toxic on both of our parts.(He was more selfish and I was emotionally unavailable.)

I was on birth control until the point of conception until I reached a depressive state(due to one reason in particular) and eventually got sick with an upper respiratory infection. I had since stopped taking my birth control and began heavily drinking myself, leading to a few poor decisions on the father and I's part. 

I am not unhappy about the pregnancy. I love this child and I want to do right by them as much as I can in my state- though I'm also at a point where if I don't tell someone, it might cause a huge rift. I come from a heavily Christian household which influences my light fear though I know their dissapointment would be justified. They are supportive, regardless.

My main fear would be them trying to convince me to get back with the father, which is something I am heavily against. As much as I respect the father, he is in a poor state mentally and couldn't support a child the way they deserve to be supported. Single motherhood isn't unheard of as one of my aunts has three children though I am opposed to that route as well. 

I want my baby to have the best possible outcome in life- two parents that adore them as well as a bright, beaming future with plenty of love. I am already in contact with the Bethany Christian Services to ensure such for them. 

(Another key factor in my stubbornness for adoption is that infertility has played a rather heavy factor in my life. My sister has PCOS, so I feel for couples who are unable to have children despite desperately wanting them.) 

I suppose I am asking, how do I tell my mother that I am nearly 32 weeks pregnant so far? And that I am firm in my idea of giving them up for adoption? It's barely something I have admitted to myself, struggling through my own acceptance of what is going on. How do I answer their questions without being a nervous wreck myself? 

I've tried being level headed as I can through all of this, and I just want to do right by my family and my unborn child.",29Jun2020,2
714,"Posting this on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I feel like such a **terrible** person. My close friends and family members have recently hit some milestones (eg., bought a house, new job, etc.) and I can't help but feel jealous.

**The kicker is** \- I'm younger (28 years old) than they are, I also own a house with my partner (a house worth almost double/triple than our friends' homes), I have a good career, I make $150,000 on my own and my partner makes the same, etc. And yet, I can't help but feel a bit jealous (maybe not the right word?) when they hit these milestones as well.

**Thoughts in my head kind of go like this:**

\- Friend buys house for $400,000 in small town; we paid $1,000,000 for an amazing house in a massive city (our dream) and very popular market, etc.; I am jealous and wonder if we got ripped off, or if they're better off, or if we made a mistake making our purchase?

\- Other friend gets a new job making less than half of what I make. My thoughts - I'm jealous. Did they choose a better career? Am I just working away my life?

715,"My (21) little sister (13) loves to talk. A LOT. I’ve never met a single other person who can talk as much as this girl. She will override every conversation with her imprudent rambling (usually about something she’s seen off of Tik Tok or social media). She will interrupt whoever I’m talking with and pester me constantly in social settings. I don’t even have to say a word when we talk because it’s a completely one sided conversation. I feel like a bad sister because I know she just looks up to me and gets excited when I’m around but it’s really uncomfortable. I don’t know how to handle it without just saying “dude chill”, but I know that’s not “constructive”.  Neither is what I’m currently doing by just nodding along quietly while her words trail into meaningless rambles. It’s to the point where I dread hanging out with my family when she’s around (I live close by so it’s not like she never sees me). I know I sound like a terrible sister, but I love her so much, I just don’t know how to address this without hurting her feelings. I want to be her role model and I think it’s unacceptable to just tell a child to be quiet. Any advice is welcome, even if it’s to say I need to suck it up and be a good sister.",29Jun2020,2
716,"Losing my best friend

Me (21) and my best friend (20) have been friends since the 8th grade when he moved into my town and came into my gym class so we’ve been friends for a long while, he joined the military a couple years ago and got stationed in Alaska and married a girl and had a child with her. We played Xbox pretty much daily at this point and he said he was coming home in December (2019) and we had some plans. Without going into too much detail his mom and dad are very very religious and I’m assuming so is his wife my friend isn’t, he’s told me several wild things about his marriage and how he is unhappy etc but the thing was is he wanted to do acid with me and another friend and his wife did not want him too but to get to the point we ended up doing the acid in a friends house and my friend ended up doing twice the amount we did and his wife started calling him to check on him and he couldn’t form a sentence so she knew what was up. Then his mom starts calling and everybody is freaking out so I basically get on his phone and text them a location they can come get him and they eventually picked him up but that was December 20th of 2019 and I haven’t heard from him since I know he is okay due to several things but he has no social media and he hasn’t responded to any of my texts calls or Xbox messages. I even have another friend stationed where he is and he won’t respond to him either. I wish I would of denied doing acid now it wasn’t worth losing my best friend. I truly don’t know what to do at this point anymore. 6 months since I last had any contact. What do I do? Leave it alone and hope he contacts me one day?",29Jun2020,1

718,"Hi, I (f16) am dating a guy (m17) who comes from a rich family, first generation rich to be exact. Now, I come from a moderately middle-class family, and that's enough to live a comfortable life here in our country, as do most countries. 

I'm on mobile so please forgive me if there are formatting errors or issues. Anyways, we've been dating for at least 10 months already, I haven't met his family yet officially, and he hasn't met mine. His immediate family lives in another city, and he's in my city for studies. Our religion also differs, but leaving out the specifics here. His family knows about me, but mine doesn't, so we're dating in secret on my side (although some of members of my family knows about him).

Now, here's the problem. They're rich, and I'm incredibly insecure. I feel as though I won't be able to connect with their lifestyle if the time comes that I would meet them. I have briefly met his mother and some of his cousins, but we haven't really taken the time to sit down and get to know each other. There were times that his mother would come visit them in the city and they'd have lunch together, he'd invite me of course, but the mere thought of eating with his mother was dreadful. 

It feels like I could just throw up in the mere thought of it. He doesn't get why I feel so anxious about meeting his family, but thankfully won't push me about it. A part of me believes that its the fear of being rejected by his mother that makes me want to projectile vomit my guts out. Looking at his family, they have everything mine doesn't. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't even jealous, because I am. Their family ties are so strong, I can't even believe that its real. His parents are supportive as hell, every member of their family -extended as well- are unbelievably talented, smart, confident and are all extremely pretty and handsome. And they have good fashion tastes too (my weakness).

Comparing that to mine, I feel impossibly small. And to add to that, I have an extremely toxic sister who torments my brother and I at every single opportunity. Growing up with her has made me believe that all sisters act the same as her, or at least think the way she does, cue my fear of meeting his two sisters. 

I have voiced my insecurities to him about not being good enough for his family, and he consistently reassures me that his family is quite nice and accepting. I've been coming to terms with that slowly, and I'm half-way there.

But I still can't help but feel jealous whenever I see his family be themselves on social media. I'd often compare my mom to mine and I know that it's not healthy and it's taking a toll on me.

Any advice on how I can take this situation better?",29Jun2020,0
719,"Last year, the semester before I graduated college, I met my now boyfriend. I never thought we’d be anything serious because I was soon moving after graduation far away from where he lives. 

So I kinda just thought it would end up being a little fling. 

But, we ended up falling in love, and I feel like he’s so perfect for me in every way, except, he doesn’t have drive in him to be successful.

I met him at a small little music festival, where he was performing. He is an amazing musician and a great dude. 

So anyways, when I met him all he did was sell pot for money, and play music here and there. 

About 3 months into dating he told me he wanted to be serious and that he would find a way to follow me after I graduated and he promised me he would go to college so we could have a good life together. He knew all that was important to me. Keep in mind he’s 30 years old and I’m 23. 

So he got a job working at Pizza Hut, quit selling weed, and moved in with his mom because she happened to be working in the same city i got a job in. He’s been begging to move in with me, and I’ve told him that first he has to show me he’s going to get a career, atleast find a good job and enroll in some classes. So, after months and months of him telling me he will, he finally decided to try and got accepted into a community college. Just accepted. So I let him come move in with me because I thought he was actually doing it. 

3 months have gone by since his acceptance and he hasn’t scheduled to take the placement test, enrolled in classes, done his taxes so he can apply for financial aid, anything. He’s been telling me for months too that he will make a resume and apply at UPS and other places that offer insurance and good pay, but he just hasn’t applied or even made a resume. He says he’s too tired after the work week and he just doesn’t have time. I get being tired. I worked two jobs throughout college and barely got any sleep. He saw me struggling and having to stay up until 3 AM to get my shit done and then waking up at 6 AM to make sure I made it class. So I know it’s hard. 

I’ve tried so many approaches from not saying anything, to trying to help, etc. but he always has an excuse on why he couldn’t get it done. He’ll cry and tell me I’m putting too much pressure on him, or say that there’s so many hoops to jump through, or that I need to help him with his resume or with the college stuff. I have tried to help him but he just gives up so easily.


He even went to this expensive music school before I met him, but won’t apply for any sound music jobs. 

I believe in his music so much and would even be okay with him pursuing that dream and helping him along the way, but he doesn’t even try with that. He needs more equipment he says but blows all of his money on weed every month. He won’t record his music.. He won’t put himself out there or try network. Or like I said even use his music education to get in as a sound guy somewhere. 


He tells me I’m being shallow and that he would love me if I was poor and that his family had less money than we do when he growing up and they were just fine.  

I don’t want to be shallow and only think about money and success but I also want to be able to start a family one day soon and have a little financial security. 



I do care about him a lot but I can’t get past this.

What should I do? Am I being shallow?

My grandfather (60's) has been dealing with a humming noise in his head. I thought it was tinnitus but I am not starting to think it is a nervous breakdown.

My mother had a nervous breakdown before she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and so did my uncle.

My grandfather has been dealing with stress,feeling overworked etc. I try to help me but he gets frustrated as he has been used to doing a lot and so he keeps wanting to do the same things that he was able to do when he was younger.

She complains a lot about how he has to do everything but when I try and take any of the way of him he gets frustrated with me. For the past 2 years he has suffered a heart attack he started losing a lot of weight and he has been having a humming sensation in his forehead.

Because of everything that is going on we haven't been able to see you any of our doctors about our physical health never mind our mental health.

I suffer from anxiety and depression and have four for 7 years now since I was 15. I have hide two breakdowns in total one of them being when I came to the realisation that my mum had passed on and another time because a lot of things were overwhelming me and I felt like I was losing control of my life.

I live with my grandparents and because of me being so young I should be able to do all of the things that I'm supposed to do and I know that my grandfather can only do so much before all of the burdens get put on to me.

I grandfather is heading for a nervous breakdown and I don't know what to do and I know when he does instead of my grandmother cutting down the responsibilities she is going to make somebody else in with them I have tried to talk to my grandfather about this to let him know that we need to cut down the responsibilities but my grandfather doesn't want to listen to me because he gets very overwhelmed and it has been a vicious cycle ever since.

I know I will be left with all the responsibilities and I can't do it. I know that I can't do it all. But I know my uncles and aunt will expect me to do everything as well as my brother. But my grandmother is someone that is picky and so everything has to be done a certain way and when its not she causes fights. She has been stressing everyone else out and I just feel so helpless. She won't let any carers in the house as she doesn't want to end up in a nursing home and how you take care of your family when they add but I am 22 and I want to live my life and I feel so selfish because I don't want to help.

I already do a lot such as sort out tablets,iron beds,wash floors,clean bedrooms,make teas for tablets,go shopping etc but last year I was doing all of the responsibilities that she makes my grandfather do and then boasted about how she when she is in charge the house gets done 'right' when it was me doing everything and her doing nothing.

So I have a small circle of friends, three in the circle to be exact, I see occasionally (maybe one or twice a fortnight) and over the time I've known them I can't recall many times at all they have asked me about me. I like getting to know people especially people I consider friends so over the time I've asked and talked about many of things about them, like family, goals, plans, past life, and just trivial stuff from their week like work and other this and that's. I really don't think if they were quizzed on me they would have much to say at all. I think I've only been asked about music (In the context of what should we play in that moment) and thoughts on something do to with a mutual friend or recent experience they've had. 

I don't know if it's me not sharing enough or they just lack interest in me. I just don't like to talk about myself un-prompted. Other people I hang around will ask then I'm more then happy to share because if they ask then they want to hear sort if thing.

727,"I(22F) Moved to a new city with my boyfriend(22M) of 3 years, months later we end up breaking up for a lot of reasons but decided to stay good friends. I move out and end up making a couple new friends, my new best friend being a bisexual (25M) Let’s call him ‘C’. C is very promiscuous (nothing wrong with that) but he enjoys taking ecstasy and he gets lovey and hooks up with friends frequently, C and i have never hooked up before but a good amount of our other friends (gay and straight males) have hooked up with him multiple times before. 

My ex has always had a really hard time making friends and has always been on the super introverted side but likes to hang out with others sometimes, so i always tried to make him feel included in whatever i was doing with my friends, up until this point he’s never been close with any of my friends and only hung out with them once or twice with me. 

I end up going to visit my hometown for a couple days and my ex was staying at my house to watch my dog. my ex invited C over to my apartment and they both went out to a bar and had (5?) drinks each. my ex asked C if he had any molly or ecstasy that they can take and C did have a ton. C warned ex about him being really lovey and sexual when he takes molly and ex said, that’s cool i don’t care let’s take it. 

They end up taking molly all night and C stops around 3 because he had work in the morning. ex continues to take molly all night till around 8am. C is laying in my bed and asks to kiss ex, ex says no. C then says hey well i can’t sleep do you mind if i suck your dick? it doesn’t make you gay at all, i will just be able to sleep better if i cum. ex says okay and climbs on his chest and let’s C suck him (completely soft) and C cums and they go to bed for an hour or so. ex then gets up to walk my dog and i call him when he’s outside, and i can clearly see how fucked up he is. I ask him how his night was with C because it’s not normal for him to want to spend one on one time with anyone let alone my friends and i was excited for him.. he says it was good ‘C and i hooked up’ and i questioned him because he’s a very straight male, he said no C just needed to cum to go to sleep no big deal. he reassured me multiple times. 

ex proceeded to finish the walk, go home, make breakfast for him and C and then beg C to wake up and go hiking and spend the day with him. C left to go to work. 

I stopped talking to either of them for a few days because this was my ex and my best friend that decided to hook up in my bed and that was strange for me. I felt really disrespected by both of them. not to mention confused because my (previously straight) ex mutually hooked up with my best friend in my bed. 

 when i got home I was asking my ex if he was sure it was mutual and if C pressured him at all i wanted to know. he was repeatedly telling me it was totally fine and he just did it to get C off and it was no big deal. after days of him apologizing and telling me it was totally fine and mutual i said fine and forgave them both. 

3 days later my ex came over to my house very upset saying that he thinks he was assaulted and that he feels violated and that he doesn’t know what to do (in tears) 
I stopped talking to C to help my ex through this tough time, but The more time goes on the more the entire situation doesn’t make much sense to me. 

5 months later C is still begging me to have a conversation with him and just let him explain his side. (i tell my ex in advance and out of respect that i’m planning on talking to C and seeing what his perspective is.) 2 weeks later i meet up with C and i have a long conversation about everything. C is completely sober, going to therapy regularly and is understanding about how his actions made someone else feel.  even though he is so confused as well because my ex and c had a discussion about the experience and my ex told him everything is okay. 

I decide to forgive C and get rid of grudges that i have had, because anger is so much for me to carry around. my ex is very upset and wants nothing to do with me. i’m just not sure how to handle this situation. any advice appreciated, or tell me if i have done something wrong?",29Jun2020,2

Let me start by saying I don’t want to. They’re my children, and I would do anything for them. Even rehome them, if I have to. I was in a discord for... I’m not sure how many years. 3-4? And I thought these people were my friends. 

April of 2019, a cat I accidentally acquired (a semi-feral female that chose me) had 6 kittens. Legally at the time, she wasn’t mine so I couldn’t have her spayed. I got ownership of her and kept two kittens, rehomed the others at 3 and a half months. All three are indoor only (except for short walks in the yard on a leash), have their spays and shots lined up for the 9th of this year. I wanted to do it a lot sooner, but things kept exploding. 

Around thanksgiving, a dumped cat showed up in my front yard. Dirty, massively underweight lady. I ended up bringing her in after a week of feeding her and trying to find a no-Kill to take her to. Mostly because she went into heat and I could not deal with another litter of kittens. I’m in Alabama currently, so that was a challenge. None in my county. I looked for months and eventually ended up taking her a county over and dropping her off at a no-Kill. But before I did, she gave my cats (and dog) the gift of fleas, and taught them several bad behaviors. The amount of fleas was insane. Have you ever spent 500 dollars in 3 months trying to deal with fleas? I can now say that I have. With that many fleas of course came tapeworms. I combated both, though it was often a losing war. 

I ended up giving my dog (long haired chi) a funky haircut (shaved neck and booty) to try to help alleviate her most flea-bitten spots while I continued doing my best to get the crisis under control. During all of this, I was posting pictures of my animals in the discord and telling what I thought were my friends about the situation. They would offer advice and suggest new products and things to try, which I eagerly noted. 

When I posted a picture of my dog with her new haircut, some people offered advice and it turned into a large topic about fleas. The owner of the server (someone I respected and trusted) came in and said next time we talk about fleas it should be in the trigger warning channel, as should my animals because they are, in her exact words, “not in the best condition”. I messaged her privately and asked her to elaborate and she was vague and offensive and I told her as much and said I would like an actual answer. She said “Franky I find your animal care offensive.🤷‍♀️” and told me that I’m selfish and I should rehome my animals and I’m effecting people’s mental health by posting them and a lot more incredibly hurtful things that really cut deep coming from someone I’d known for years and respected. I ended up leaving the server, but I haven’t been able to move on from what she said. It still haunts me.

I mostly have the flea situation under control, and I’m moving in late July so hopefully once I do the flea problem will chill. Currently I’m only finding a few per month, only seen 3 this entire month, and I’m watching for tapeworms (they’ve made returns a few times) and treating as I see them. I’ve asked several people I know if I’m being neglectful and if I should rehome my cats, every single person has said no. I just need to hear it from random, unbiased internet people. Or the cold hard truth. I love them so much, I just want what’s best for them. So reddit. Should I rehome my cats? Feel free to ask for more information if you need it.",29Jun2020,2

That degree is crap currently and I worry that I wouldn't find good job or something I like.

Well this girl has wanted to join in the tickle fights and I thought nothing of it, she's still a kid in my eyes and her dad never had any problem with it. I know im not a pedo and would never do anything so I never saw how it might look. Lately she has been extra clingy, trying to sit on me, taking my hat and running away to hide it only giving it back if I tell her she's my favorite, etc. Its made me a little uncomfortable because we aren't related and it seemed like a bit much. I wasn't sure if she had a crush on me or what the deal was, maybe it was all in good fun idk. Well yesterday her grandparents came over and she was sitting on me while I was trying to get her off, her grandma got kind of irked and told her to get off of me. Later when she was leaving she told me to behave. At that point it made me second guess if what I was doing was ok, I never ever want to be thought of as a creeper.

747,"Hopefully this is the right reddit~

So long story short about 2 years ago I (20F) moved out of state to get a job with one of my Grandmothers accounting clients as they needed someone to run general upkeep in the office and do daily bookkeeping, which would also help my Grandmother with doing their books as well. 

I still had to do a interview of course, and I did. During the interview I let them know that I hadn't been able to graduate due to untreated severe stress, depression and anxiety and that it still burdened me but I wasn't violently Ill anymore and ultimately wanted to take a year or two off to recoup, get healthy and then return to school. To this day, I am untreated. I do not have suitable medical coverage for me to be able to get the help I need. I work part time on state insurance and have already used my once a year doctor visit on a potential COVID case in January so I cannot reschedule to see my doctor and get a referral to see a therapist and frankly, it isnt covered unless deemed medically necessary and I am terrified that it won't. Of course on top of that, I'm young and stupid and just trying to figure out how I work, how the works works  etc. I use supplements to try to help balance myself, take vitamins, and am constantly trying to just do /better/.

What I also didn't include, is that I am a LGBTQ+ person and (although I dislike tying political labels on myself) my beliefs are more Democratic Left/Liberal leaning or whatever on earth it's called. My boss has since learned this, and has made what I believe was a homophobic comment and told me my beliefs are why the worlds going to shit. So, this I am also pretty sure plays a major part of this behavior. I dont think he ever had such a tone with me before discovering these sides of me. I am not public about them in the work place, and I only have 1 co-worker on my (mostly dead) Twitter that sometimes expressed my alignments but that's it. And frankly I dont think that co-worker gives a rat's ass about it, so I'm not worried about him.

I started off as a really great employee, and I will admit, since then my work hasn't been as equal to my starting drive as it was. I know it's a issue, and I know in many ways I have faults. I am trying, very very hard. My boss clearly does not see it that way and holds me to the same standard as his 40 hour a week, mentally stable, CAN afford to see a doctor employees. I don't feel all his complaints are unjust by any means, as I said I KNOW I can do better and over the past year I have continued to try to do better constantly. I do find myself doing better in a LOT of ways, but my boss doesn't seem to even notice. 

Lately whenever my boss comes in, I am reprimanded. I cannot think of a time in the past year where my boss has been kind and frankly I am just... so tired of it. Today, I was 10-15 minutes late because my alarm didnt wake me and I woke up the time I normally leave for work. Not a common mistake by any means, however I should note that the week prior, I had been 10-15 minutes late all week as I had to get a ride with my Grandma due to my truck being broken down. I told my boss this on Monday and he didn't seem to have a issue with it. I scrambled to get dressed and out the door, didn't even get breakfast and I will admit I sped a little on the way to work to get in as soon as I could. My boss accused me of coming and going as I please (I do not), not knowing who I work for (I do know), not caring (I do, very much, all I care about is being the best version of me I can be and that includes being an employee), and overall just making wild accusations that dont apply to me. 

Then he got on me for a invoice that was in the wrong file, which DOESN'T normally happen by ANY means. Theres 2 customers who have 2 different numbers in our system for job numbers. This time, it was a simple misplacement of the job in the wrong job number for a customer with 2 options. Again, RARE for me to EVER do anything like that. He then accused me of being incompetent, basically, saying ""Now I have to wonder how many others you put in the wrong file?"" Which. Sure, okay, you see a mistake and you wonder, sure I understand. But... c'mon now, we BOTH know this isn't a common mistake by any means and to carry a tone that accuses me of being a idiot? I felt like that was just a excuse to ream me further.

I couldn't handle it today, I broke down. I started crying right in the office and turned away. I just kept working on the invoices, he turned back towards his computer with a snarky ""I'm not trying to be a hardass but I just dint have time for this"" and I have now been crying for... mmm about 40/45 minutes at my desk. He has left since then, to go to a jobsite, so I've been crying alone thank god. Frankly I am not even sure what he means by not having time either because most my work gets done on time or early, solemn do I EVER get anything done late at all and usually it's when someone gives it to me last minute already.

The past few times hes reprimanded me I havent been allowed to say anything beyond ""I understand, I'm sorry""... and, y'know, I do understand and I am sorry. But I dont want him to just think I'm some stupid kid not giving a fuck. I DO give a fuck, I'm just struggling. Really bad, and I really only have myself for suitable help. It's not that the people around me dont care or arent willing, it's just that they haven't dealt with my degree of anxiety and depression and stress before and often times I find myself more disgruntled by their attempts at aid than it actually helps. 

I'm just really uncomfortable here anymore. I do try, I do know I am not a top notch employee, and I do work to fix my mistakes, but... I just feel so beaten down and the reprimanding only gets worse despite me KNOWING I am doing more/better than I did even just a week or two ago. Everyone else is kind to me, but it doesn't outweigh the constant reprimanding.

I feel my boss has just got it in his head that I'm some stupid young girl who won't amount to anything and I dont think anything I can do or say will change that at this point. My future boss, who is my current boss's son, is great. He seems to actually like... at the least treat me more than just a moron... he thanks me and asks nicely, and if there is a issue with him I haven't heard him take such a mean tone with anyone like his dad/my boss does. I'm sure he has issues with me, like I said, I know I'm not Grade A employee here. But, he also seems to understand that letting me work on doing better is more productive for us both than yelling at me. He is meant to take over this winter but... I just dont think I can continue to handle the way my boss talks to me. I've been wanting to quit for ages now, and I just feel like I'm coming to the end of my straw. I don't even really like this job anyway, it was just meant to be a temp thing for me.

Now heres where I am looking for advice.

Firstly, is this normal? I mean, I understand at one point or another I'm going to get reprimanded and sometimes it may seem to happen often, but this is truly a constant thing and seems extremely excessive. Especially the way he speaks to me about it, it doesn't seem professional at all it just seems like hes taking the heat out on me. I'm just not sure if this is me experiencing ""real life"" for the first time or if I truly just have a boss being mean to me.

Second of all, would it be inappropriate to leave for this reason? I am more concerned about how it could look to potential employers if they were ask or learn why I left this job.

Third, should I leave? I do have a plan set in place with my parents that when I enroll in school and start going to college to hopefully become a Psychologist, so they will help me with Bill's so I can quit and focus on my job. I have money in savings that would get me by for a little while, but realistically speaking not all that long. I also have a boyfriend (22M) who just started a full time job and expressed support of me leaving my job when needed. My plan would be to simply start a semester earlier than I planned on, and of course that's already been discussed with my mom and she is fine with me starting in the fall. I also used to run my own little art business and know I can pull in supplemental money to get by. I guess I just... need help pulling the trigger. Being told this is the thing to do, I guess. I've never been good at making choices on my own.

Lastly, how do I leave? Frankly I just wanna stand up and dip bc I truly dont think they'd care other than being without a bookkeeper for a couple weeks BUT I am also fine with being my GRANDMOTHERS assistant and helping her tie up loose ends for that company, as her assistant, not theirs. I also know they had a well qualified woman come in a few weeks ago looking for a bookkeeping job so I'm sure I'm easily replaceable. 2 week notice I know is the more ""professional"" way to leave but at the same time I am beyond wanting to even stick around for another day.

And if you have any additional advice to whatevers tossed in here, feel free to toss it in. Even if its @me, I can handle a bit of criticism. 

Thank you for reading.

TDLR; My boss reprimands me virtually on-sight despite my constant efforts at doing better at my job and at this point I think he just dislikes me and theres no changing his mind about me. I don't think the degree of reprimanding is normal and I want to quit (and have a plan in place for this) but I dont know how to properly go about it.",29Jun2020,1

My dad just called me freaking out saying I should postpone. So, my question for you:

Is it worth getting the risk of getting the tonsillectomy right now? Or should I spend another year in potential pain/on antibiotics so that I can wait until this coronavirus stuff passes.

Some other info: I also have an autoimmune disease which makes me a bit more concerned about having surgery right now. The surgery would take place in Austin, TX. My Dr says it’s nothing to worry about because obviously they are doing everything they can to minimize risk.

751,"I don't know where to ask this but I need some advice and insight—something “woke” people can answer. 

So my two friends and I (the three of us are college students) recently thought about launching a start-up t-shirt company. For privacy purposes, I will be changing the name, but the idea is somewhat like “The Sick Trial” (again, not the actual name but pretty close to it. The real one sounds better.) To explain, we got “trial” for the name because that's what this whole venture is—a trial. We've never started our own business before and we thought it would be something fun to do during quarantine. Secondly, we got the name “sick” because we founded this idea during a pandemic.

So basically our business is the result of three bored college students wanting to try new things while the country is in quarantine during a pandemic. Thus... The Sick Trial.

My question here is if this is problematic? I kind of thought that it seems wrong because it's as if we are capitalizing off of the pandemic. I am all for progressive thinking, being very left and liberal myself, and in no way would like to be insensitive towards a group of people. Should we change our name? While I'd prefer not to (we've grown very fond of the name) we would like to do what is best.",29Jun2020,0
752,"When I was about 6 years old, my parents got a divorce. It wasn't a huge deal, they just fell out of love and are still polite towards each other, which I'm incredibly grateful for. A few months after their divorce, I was introduced to someone who would become my new stepmom.

Right off the bat, I could tell she was incredibly different from my parents. She was much more strict, and dare I say judgemental than my mom and dad. I started worrying about making mistakes in front of her when I was pretty young, because I was worried about being treated like an idiot for not cracking an egg right, or not cleaning dishes the way she wanted to. I'm not saying the way I did things were right, but the way she tried to 'teach me' always had me feeling incredibly overwhelmed afterwards because her tone made it incredibly clear she was irritated and frustrated with me for not understanding things right away.

As I grew older, these things became worse. I also started suffering from anxiety, depression, and insomnia as time went by. Some background on my step mom is that she used to work with kids who came from abusive families, and has a degree in psychology. She often uses that fact to prove that she knows what shes talking about and that she's never wrong. 

Once I got to middle school, I started growing a lot of resentment for her and my dad (the resentment towards my dad was mainly because he was a smoker.) I started hating going over to my dads house and she was at the center of that. One night, I got so incredibly frustrated with her I wrote a letter to her that blamed her for why I was depressed and suicidal. I showed it to her and she started crying because she had done so much for me behind the scenes, like encouraged my dad to take me to therapy, and push him to get me a sleep study for my insomnia.It was an incredibly childish thing to do, and to this day I feel awful about it. After that night, I told myself I was too sensitive and needed to just take it because she was clearly right.

The next few years I just sorta took it. I got scared of asking where things where in our new house because I didn't want her to say,""Seriously? How long have you lived here?"" I stopped cleaning my room, I stopped taking care of myself, because I didn't want to try and do it only for her to act like I didn't put in any effort. Once I was a freshman, her and my dad started noticing and decided to take me back to therapy. I started feeling better in most aspects of my life except when it involved her. I didn't talk to my therapist about her because I thought any negative feelings I had towards her must've been my fault. 

Then I noticed my brother getting more and more tired of her behavior. Hes much more outspoken then me, so he started calling her out on things and complaining about her to me. It made me realize that maybe I wasn't just too sensitive. I started standing up for myself too and becoming less quiet, and talked about her to my therapist and how she frustrated me. This started creating a gap in our relationship because I got tired of dealing with her behavior.

Now let's go to last night. I had a meetup with some of my friends that involved a roleplay murder mystery. I didn't tell my stepmom about it because I didn't want her to give me a judgmental look or say ""Okay"" in a sarcastic and mocking tone, so I told her we were just hanging out. I later told my brother about what we were actually doing when he drove me over there, and when he got back my stepmom asked him if I was lying about 'just hanging out.' He explained our plans and told her that I kept it a secret because I didn't need her making fun of me for it.

When I got home, I took a shower and went to my room only to find a six page letter from her on my bed. Needless to say, it was pretty upsetting to read. She told me about how she was upset at the gap that was getting between us, and how she wasnt judgemental whatsoever and that all of her friends would agree with her. She said she could 'understand' how I could take some things she says as criticism, like her telling me to take my pills or brush my teeth, which made it so incredibly clear that she was entirely missing the point. She said that she felt like she had to walk on eggshells around me because she didn't want to offend me, and that she is my biggest supporter and loves me like I'm her own son. She described how much shes cried and worried about me. She told me that when my brother explained I was afraid of her criticizing me, she burst into tears and cried for at least an hour. She told me that shes always been there for me behind the scenes, and that I just didn't understand how much she cared about me. She told me how she gushes to her friends about how proud she is of her trans stepson, and Hope's that one of her biological kids will end up being LGBTQ+ because she'd be such a great mom for them to talk to about that stuff. She told me about how she wished she was closer to my brother, but always felt happy that atleast I liked her, and was upset at the gap I was creating between us.

Reading that letter made me have one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. The fact that she thinks I take basic instructions as 'criticism' had me so frustrated. When I say criticism, I'm talking about how you can't even sit through a movie my brother and I love and call it stupid while being angry at us when we say Footloose is just ok. I'm talking about telling me I need to 'learn how to live in this family' when I get in an argument with my stepsister. I'm talking about how you tell me to 'put on my big girl panties' when I'm having a panic attack over chemistry. I'm talking about when I put on an outfit I like and you say,""That's what you're wearing? Okay . . ."" She also describes herself as a 'great listener', even though I've told her a number of times that making fun of me, forcing me to talk, and telling me to 'just calm down' while I'm having a panic attack doesn't work, and she continuously does it. I'm not saying I can't be shitty to her, or that I've never taken it too far when arguing with her, but her 6 page letter feels as though it was written by a child, especially considering I did the same thing when I was twelve.

I don't know if I'm being overdramatic. I love her, I really do, but I don't really like her. I know that's awful, but i just feel incredibly frustrated that she wrote a six page letter instead of sitting down and talking to me like an adult. Am i being childish for not just accepting it? Am I too sensitive?",29Jun2020,0

Hey guys. So I need some advice. About how to let a guy down via text. Before you jump to conclusions, please let me explain! (TL;DR below)

We matched on Bumble before the lockdown and the weekend we organised to meet up, we were told to only leave for essential travel etc. Now, I am high risk and didn’t want to meet up for obvious reasons, not least because the government told us to. 

We have been talking most days since via text, some video calls/ few voice calls and it had been going okay. He’s a sweet guy and has a good, stable job. 

Here’s the bit that throws me. He is 33 and I am 22. Not a big deal (I try to tell myself) and some friends who I’ve asked for advice from tell me that the age gap is fine and they’ve had successful relationships of the same age gap, whereas others think I’m crazy for considering it. There has been the odd occasion where he has made (concerning???) jokes about the age gap including: “good job we didn’t meet a few years ago, I would have been arrested!”  

He has openly said that within 5 years, he wants to be married, have kids and move to the Mediterranean. 
I half played along because who doesn’t dream of a perfect family on an exotic coast, but realistically my goals look very different. I want to publish my first book and move back to Sweden after finishing my university teaching course (which will be in 5 years time) and then once I hit 30 I can think about settling down and that’s when I’d LOVE the idea of moving to the Mediterranean with my family after reaching my goals. 

This is something that I’ve become more certain about after taking a lot of time to consider it. (Moving to Sweden that is). 

How do I let him down gently via text? I know it’s not the nicest way, but we haven’t actually ever met in person and I am certain that for the time being, I want to pursue my writing career and moving back to Sweden before settling down. After all, he has 11years more life experience than me and has already done what he wanted and is moving into the “settle down” stage. 

I do like the guy tho which is why I’ve sat on it for so long. 

TL;DR he’s 33 I’m 22, we matched on bumble, haven’t met and He wants a family within 5 years. How do I let him down gently?",29Jun2020,2

772,"So idk if I can call her a friend since I haven’t been in contact with her for a while.

So, when I was in middle school, my family moved to a different country, and I did most of my middle school there and went back to the US in high school. I think like for most ppl, middle school was some of worst years of my academic life, but I lop back at it now as a bittersweet moment. 

I don’t really have a social media presence, but a few years ago, I got instagram. Didn’t use for a while, and then started searching up ppl I knew from middle school one day. Idk why but i don’t like the idea of completely cutting off contact with ppl I once knew. I didn’t have a phone in middle school or social media so yeah. 

But anyways I found some of the ppl I used to hang out with on instagram, but now, I’m too scared to message her. Tbh, I wasn’t the greatest person in middle school. Like looking back now, I was a pretty shitty person then as in what I did and thought...those are things that I wouldn’t do today, and I still feel ashamed of them. I cared so much about how others viewed me that I became someone who I wasn’t. But that phase( Ig you can call it a phase idk) didn’t last for long and I changed back to myself in high school. 

Because of this, I’m scared of taking the first step to contact my once friend. I know I was a shitty person in middle school, but i don’t want her to think I’m still that same person. I scared of having that expectation that she’ll be glad to see that I contacted her and then be let down by it. I know I should do it since it’s going to be in my mind forever if I don’t but I’m just scared. 

And one more thing...I had this friend I was pretty close with since we went to school together and everything in middle school. But then we both moved after middle school. My mom knows her moms contact info, but I just am a bit scared to reach out yk. Like we don’t live in the same country and we haven’t talked for years. It’s not like I can meet up with her and catch up or something.

It might just be something like

Me:hey,remember me
Her:yeah
Me and her: ok bye

She has been dealing with depression all her life. I didn’t know it was a problem until about a year ago. During this time she has been sad of course. She has also gained a lot of weight. 

My wife just found out she is peri menopausal. Her therapist prescribed Zoloft for the depression. This has changed just about all normalcies in our relationship. We used to have sex 5 to 7 times per week sometimes multiple times per day. Our sex life has dwindled down to about 3 times per month. I have done just about everything possible to comfort her to make her know I’m there for her.

She works from our bed on her laptop and pretty much stays there all day and watches Netflix and Hulu. I’ve asked to go on walks etc and she typically declines. The quarantine hasn’t helped much either. 

I’ve been feeling lonely and very horny for the past couple months. I don’t pressure her for sex. I don’t want to beg for anything. I understand when it comes to sex you have to go as slow as the slowest person. When we do have sex I can tell she’s not into it. She doesn’t want me to work to give her an orgasm. She knows what to do to get me to orgasm. She does that much earlier in our sex so I can finish. That feels horrible so I just avoid anything sex related. 

I don’t want to leave her or cheat on her. I’m also not feeling this.

781,"So I introduced my friend K(f22) my old roommate S(m19) and it was pretty good for a bit. Then K ended up braking up with her BF and since then it just seems like they’ve been flirting every time we hang out and I am left being pushed aside even though I was the one who initiated the activity and the one driving. I thought it was all in my head or a bit of friendship jealousy, but we had another friend come join us a few times and he talked about the same thing I was feeling without me bringing anything up. 

I brought it up to them and they said they aren’t interested in each other and that they weren’t flirting, said it was just how Greeks are around each other, but it’s been two weeks since that discussion and it hasn’t gotten any better. Now I don’t care if my friends dating each other, but I can’t hang out with them together without me being pushed aside for whatever they seem to want to talk about. Plus the more they seem to get closer the less, as it seems to me, they care to hang out with me. I mean K hardly talks to me and S only messages when he needs a ride or if he wants to hang out the three of us.

I recently took some time for myself and hung out with another friend and it was a world of difference in how it felt, I felt much better and it was far more engaging. He also helped me realize that I was the one engaging every single hangouts.

Right now I am currently at a bit of a crossroads I want to either take time away from both and not contact them for a day and figure this stuff out, y’all to them about what’s going on and that it’s gotten worse since last time we talked, or just ride the wave of a possible rebound relationship. Now if I take the day for myself I risk damaging whatever relationship I may have with the both of them, if I talk to them again they may be likely to brush it off again, and if I ride the wave I may need up losing one if not both friends. There may be another avenue I don’t know, but I would just like to hear some peoples thoughts on this if at all possible

My absences got frequent and I became depressive but never got to ask for professional help (or properly diagnosed) because its uncommon. Since then, my grades and my work ethic has been affected negatively but I managed to get to college.

Where I'm from, people just usually depend on their peers and friends for support but I didn't really had friends in highschool. 

It wasn't a surprise that I didn't have any friends in college too, I have been a loner for two years in fact. I also barely go to my classes, making it harder for me to make friends. It was so depressing and lonely, but I got used to it. Although, I had plans on how to make friends and also consulted in r/relationships, but then quarantine happened.

Now, I'm just back at home doing nothing. But recently, I'm having really dark thoughts about hurting myself, and also made worse by my constant nightmares. I was aware that I have bad thoughts before but the severity now has gotten worse.

I'm no longer functioning well and I'm scared because my classes will start very soon and my parents will notice that I'm not doing well in school.

Throaway because some people know my regular account.

I'm planning on buying a necklace for my SO. The chain is going to be made out of 18ct white gold, it's more versatile than yellow gold IMO and more people seem to like it so I want to play it safe. Ideally the necklace would be ideal for dressed up occasions (dinner, dates, weddings, ...) but could also be worn in casual circumstances. A bit of versatility would be great so that it doesn't need to stay in a jewelry box most of the year.

When it comes to the gemstone, I wanted to avoid the overly classic and cliché saphire heart and similar. So I was thinking that a diamond could look nice, but I'm worried that it might be a bit too tacky.

Does anyone have any opinion on the kind of gemstone that would be suitable for this?

Quick info: married for a while, a few kids, sex life is great and we have it often, I'm a very average looking woman.

I don't believe he is masturbating while looking at these photos, he just enjoys looking at naked chicks. He doesn't know that I know, but this has been going on for years now. I wouldn't normally care but he is in his home office ""working"" (after work hours) while I manage the entire house myself, and really he's looking at pictures of naked women half of the time.

804,"I'm just going to say quickly that I'm a teen, if that's gonna be of any use. 

I've always known that my family dynamic wasn't the best, but honestly today was the day it really hit me. My mother is the only person in my family who is genuinely so loving and caring and supportive, and I really do love her and feel so bad that she's in a horrible marriage. Because of dumbass Punjabi family customs that I guess they never dropped after immigrating, we live with my dad's parents. My father is an jobless alcoholic (used to be a taxi driver, he planned on getting back to work but then corona happened) who is so horribly verbally abusive to my mother at times (calling her a whore... what a hypocrite). My grandmother just idly watches this all happen and just wants everyone to forgive and forget, but how can someone forget such a horrible person? On top of that, my mom asked me yesterday if anyone has tried to hug/touch me without my consent, which thankfully has never happened. Today, she told me my grandfather is something of a pervert and insinuated he was the reason she asked me that yesterday. My grandfather has never done anything to make me think that he was like that, but I know for sure my mom isn't lying. All in all, I really don't know what to do. I never cry when I'm in bad situations like these, but right now I just feel so hopeless and alone. Other than my mom and siblings (one is the same age as me and the other is a kid) and like 1 friend I really have no one to talk to about this, so obviously I'm using Reddit like the fucking loser I am :'). I don't feel unsafe (grandparents are stuck in India as of right now because of corona) but I just want to know: what should I do now and moving foward? How can I comfort my mother?

Sorry if this was all over the place. Please don't upvote this post (I don't know if anyone I know uses Reddit and I don't want to take any chances).",29Jun2020,1

807,"I'm 21 and for most of my life I've been oblivious to anything different that I do compared to most other people, when i met my girlfriend a few years ago she mentioned to me that she finds it strange that I don't have any friends and found it even more strange that I haven't really had any desire to find friends or really have any form of social life and I'm extremely akward and useless in any social situations.

I'm also just finding out how bad I am with emotions and the fact that I really don't know how to empathise with anyone or provide any real emotional connections. 

I've been researching and from what i'm reading it's quite likely that I have Asperger's Syndrome as many of the issues that are associated with it are things I struggle with.

I feel that my inability to be emotional or offer emotional connection and support is driving a wedge inbetween me and my girlfriend and despite the fact that i can't really help it it's still not fair on her to never get any emotional support.

810,"I have a brother who is bi but I think he's gay. Yesterday, he tried to escape from our house. I panicked, of course. I caught him escaping because I heard my dog was barking. I saw my mom's phone and his account on messenger. I tried to look his last conversation before he left. I used his account to chat his friend (it's a girl) to look after him. I called him, her friend called him but he did not answer! I saw in the conversation that he's going to meet some guy to have sex with him. I tried to wait for him, I can't follow him because it's already curfew and the quarantine is still ongoing. My parents are already sleeping, but I don't want to disturb them. He's only 17 yrs old! He came back at 2am I guess? I ask him where did he go? Did something happened? He was rude to me! He's always like that! He just told me to go to sleep. I got pissed off. I talked to him, AGAIN. I'm asking a lot of details. While I'm talking and giving him a sermon. He's just using his phone and laughing. So I tried to get his phone so that he would listen to me. But no, he punched me in the face! I cried of course and said to me what do you care. I'm his older sister and I think he's not treating me like a sibling. I screenshot the conversation where he told his friend that something happened to him and that ""guy"". You will need a lot of patience when talking to my brother. You'll get pissed off but at the same time, you pity him. You're sad for him 'cause he doesn't know that his doings are wrong. It looks like he's still an innocent.

So it's already morning and I told my parents. My parents were disappointed and sad. 'Cause we always give him an advice and yet, he's doesn't even care. All he want is to do what he wants! He thinks that's he's right. He thinks that having sex is already an act of love! But it's not. He's so immature! We always did our part. But he's not trying to help himself. My mom talked to him but my brother is really mad! He just said that he's trying to sleep and doesn't want to talk to my mom. Or at least listen! He did not think that he can get AIDS by having sex with that guy. He only met that guy on some app or somethin'. He doesn't respects us. Especially my mom and dad. My mom is strong so I'm proud! But my Dad... Whenever he gets sad he always drinks alcohol and other vices. 'Cause he's blaming himself why my brother doesn't respect my father. My parents are caring and loving. But my brother doesn't see that way. SHAME ON HIM! 

I'm asking for an advice what am I going to do in our situation. I really need your help, I want to help my parents. I don't know what to do. My parents and I were hurt 'cause he had sex on that ""guy"". He's being so irrational. We're scared that it might happen again. I'm suggesting my mom to take him to a psychologist and see what's really happening to him. Thank you for the time and sorry for the grammatical errors :-((",29Jun2020,1
811," TL:DR at the bottom 

I’m (27M) usually the kind of person that bottles up my feelings and hopes shit works itself out. I feel like I’ve lived my life flying by the seat of my pants. Things have always sort of worked themselves out and I’ve never really had to really make a decision about what I want to do for the rest of my life (until now). 

I spent some time in the military after high school, didn’t really want to go to college yet, but left after one enlistment. Went to college, got a degree in finance and then my MBA (graduate in August) all on the GI Bill so I have no debt. 

I’ve been working at an investment banking firm as an intern for about a year, and it’s time for me to start deciding what I want to do after college. I have no idea. My passions are all over the place. Some days I want to buy a van and travel the states with no ties. Other times, I want to move to a beach and just chill the fuck out. My father is adamant about me getting a job at some bank. I understand the importance of making money, it’s not like I want to live like a pauper, but I have no idea what I should do. I guess I’m scared about finally getting a real job or making the wrong decision. I have ties here, a wonderful girlfriend, but no friends really.

I would love some advice on how to approach the rest of my life.

812,"I'm the youngest of my dad's 7 kids(his and my mom's from other relationships). He's always been kinda weird and I never thought much of it but he's been acting like a dick recently. He's called me this nickname, ""Lyssidoll"", my entire life. He said he got it from the movie Matilda. I begged him not to call me that in public, along with begging him to not call me ""babygirl"" in public, which is something he's been doing for three years. Both names make me really uncomfortable but he tells me off every time I ask him to stop.
Along with that, he made a very odd comment yesterday. We were driving home from church with my grandma and he started talking about me and me getting married. He said, ""Nobody could ever love you like your daddy does."" This comment made me really uncomfortable, and two of my friends said that it sounds kinda pedophilic. I have no idea what to do but I'm terrified of being alone with him. Any advice on what to do with this situation?",29Jun2020,1
813,"Okay so a little backstory, 

My ( 21F ) real dad was a real mean person and wasnt There for me and my sister. I am talking about physical and mental abuse ( my mom and him devorced before i was 1 years old ). When i was 11 he send me a letter when i was with my mom that he doesnt see me as his own daughter and did not want me to come near his house anymore. It hurted but i forgive him.

I started dating around 16, i was always more interested in guys over 18.
And since i became 19 i was always more interested in guys age 25.
Now I am 21 and my previous ex was 34M ( 1 year relationship ) and i am currently dating ( 4 months now ) a 32M. There is no money situation or anything sugardaddy-ish going between me and my current or ex. I am also not interested in any of that. I just think adult men are more mature and i want a stable relationship.

My mom dropped the bomb on me today that i have daddy issues and should go in therapy, but i just feel like it should matter that much as long as it feels right?

Is it really that weird and should i see a therapist?

814,"I (17F) have been journaling for about 5 years, just to vent or write about life, ideas, and I things I have done and want to do, and I also have some others for Bible study and poetry. I never share these things with my family as I have a rough relationship with them (comprised of my mom, stepdad, and stepbrother who is my age). Everything I do or like is wrong to them, so I don't want them reading my stuff. 
Now a little while ago (maybe a year or so) they were seeing a family friend who is also a therapist, as they have a stormy marriage, but stopped for some reason or another. I also talked to her a few times and she helped with some of the stuff I deal with, and told me if I had questions or needed advice I could always call her. About 6 months ago I was talking to her, when out of the blue she told me I needed to hide my journals. I asked if anyone in my family had been reading them (I kept them all in my desk drawer at the time) but she wasn't allowed to say, since everything you tell to a therapist is supposed to be confidential.
 I am suspecting my stepdad of trying to read my stuff as he's broken locks I kept on some pockets of my backpack, but I want to hide them from both parents just in case (and my mom is ex military and law enforcement, trained SWAT teams, done a whole bunch of undercover work, all that badass stuff which would enable her to search my room very easily). My brother and I know for a fact that one of them has searched his room as well (broken locks on things). I have a small safe stuffed with journals, but I can't lock all of them up, and I would like to hide the safe as well since they may try to break that too, but I'm running out of ideas on where to hide the rest (everything is currently in a chest that doesn't lock, but they don't know what's in there I don't think).

817,"As the title says, my roommate, who has been a good friend of mine and my other roommate's for years constantly drives under the influence. He 100% is an alcoholic because he depends on alcohol to function, meaning he drinks pretty heavily every single day. We have tried just about everything to get him help– having an intervention twice, recommending him to therapists and even booking him appointments, even going to his parents. Nothing seems to work. He still drinks and drives almost every day. At this point, we don't know what else to do, but if he accidentally killed someone from his reckless behavior, I would feel so guilty for not doing more. His license is currently suspended, too. So, he drives drunk on a suspended license. I really need some advice here. Should we go to the police? Is there an organization like Mothers Against Drunk Driving that could help us? I just want him to get help, and I want to prevent him from hurting someone else or himself. I just feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place (I think that's the phrase?) because while I don't want my friend to get into trouble because I report him, I really don't see any other way around this.

Also sorry for the formatting I am on mobile.

So here is this situation: This last school year of 2019-20 I was a highschool junior. Due to a not great home situation I decided that I would like to graduate early so I could move out around September when I turned 18. 
The thing is when Covid came around and everything went online I really struggled and left a lot of my work until about the last month. Even with this large work load I finally got my shit together and for each class I calculated what I would need to do to pass through talking to my teachers and some of my own math and just knowing what was weighted heavier in my classes. About a week or two out from the ending of school I was passing all of my classes except one which I needed the credits from. 
The thing about this class is that I had more work done for it and I had emailed my teacher multiple times. For my other classes it took about two emails to get a hold of them which I understand they can miss emails and are busy and what not but this one just wasn't responding. Some of my other teachers who I did email made me think I didn't have reason to worry as this other teacher was just probably busy at the moment and there was a lot of time to get those grades in. So I stopped worrying about. 
A bit of time passed and I was locked out of my school account because the school year ended and the district blocked my email to my counselor for some reason and I was just now able to call my principle about the matter and email him to see if I could get my diploma. In his email he said he didn't know if I passed all of my classes but that he'll check tomorrow...

Basically I am getting a tattoo of my grandmother and her dog, both deceased and both meant so much to me. It’s one of those photo outline tattoos, here’s a [sketch](https://imgur.com/gallery/AbEla2l).

My question is, I’m getting it right on my forearm/below my elbow crease. When I first drew it, I imagined being able to raise my arm and look right at her, I loved her very much and remembering her brings me peace. However this means that her head would be toward my wrist and to everyone except me she would be upside down. I’ve seen lots of tattoos like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=forearm+family+photo+outline+tattoo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjZlsmm1KfqAhUuhuAKHQDdBuIQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=forearm+family+photo+outline+tattoo&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzIFCAAQzQI6BwgjELACECc6BAghEApQzdwBWIfmAWCW6AFoAHAAeACAAZ4BiAGFBpIBAzAuNpgBAKABAQ&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=iDP6XtmyEa6MggeAupuQDg&amp;bih=622&amp;biw=414&amp;client=safari&amp;prmd=isnv&amp;hl=en-us#imgrc=mhLPUxPB-la91M) and they look so cute but if I’m looking down at my own arm it’s upside down...

Honestly its probably dumb because it’s just a tattoo and not really her obviously but I really want to be able to see her looking back at me when I see it. I want to know, will it look ridiculous upside down? Would you guys judge someone’s tattoo if you saw it like that on a stranger? Any thoughts that might possibly help? Comments welcome!

827,"Edit: I am 18F and from Canada.

I having been working at a sporting goods retailer for the past couple of years (it was my first job). Right from the start, I didn't like it very much because the customers are downright awful and it's emotionally exhausting. Sometimes I come home from a shift and don't even want to talk for the rest of the night. Many times my managers have said that I am really fast and efficient at my job, even having me train newcomers. However, I still make min. wage. 

Last year, my former manager hired a new employee we will call Tyler. Tyler was 29 and I was 18 (just barely). Anyway, we dated for a month (big mistake, I know) but I caught him sending perverted messages to other chicks. After we broke up, I told the assistant manager and my former manager that I wanted to quit. They were in the process of promoting Tyler to manager, and I didn't want to work for an ethical and dishonest person who takes advantage of younger people. My former manager compromised by separating our shifts and telling Tyler not to enter the store while I was working, even for lessons. 

Tyler did not listen and still entered the store while I was working, even trying to start a conversation with me once. He then made a new account and messaged me (I blocked him on everything) and then I blocked the new account. He was talking to my other coworkers about our breakup, saying that he didn't cheat and that I would not have SEX with him. My former manager had told him not to keep talking about me but Tyler did not listen. 

Recently, he was trying to get my underaged coworker to hang out with him (he is 30 now). He also touches my coworkers inappropriately, grabbing them by the waist from behind, for example. Even the guys feel uncomfortable around him. He's loud, likes to touch others, and frequently makes inappropriate comments to them (like, ""Those Asian chicks are so hot""). I complained to my assistant manager and she said she will talk to HR and the regional manager. Me and two other girls wrote a written report to the HR manager. However, I feel like nothing come out of that. I don't want to work for a place that doesn't care about their employees. I could work anywhere else and still make min. wage. I hate my job and its values and the overall environment. I want to quit and never look back, but I'm afraid future employers will question me about this job.

830,"Hey reddit, this is my second post ever but have enjoyed reading through your post through the years. 

So anyways I (30m) found out I was cheated on (31f)after being in a ten year relationship. For the past two years I was working on getting my nursing degree to be able to do something I enjoy in helping others and to be able to afford all of our dreams of building or future. We would talk about buying a home together spending hours showing each other places and so on. A few years into the relationship she wanted to have another child (she had her first child at 16 in a previous relationship). I agreed but wanted to wait until I was able to finish my career. That may have been when she may have started to hold resentment in also being that I had not gotten her a ring. She later said she no longer wanted to have kids because she was older now. I wanted kids but was also fine with no kids it would give us time to travel the world and as long as she was by me it wouldn’t matter. In my mind I have not felt like a real man due to not being able to afford a place of my own living at my parents and living off financial aid and scholarships to get through school. I could not see my self saying that I am engaged but Still living at my parents and she lives at hers. She had reluctantly agreed but would still bring it up every now and then. 

So going through school I somewhat avoided making real connections with other wanting to focus on the girl I loved who I felt was the only girl to be worth anything in this world. She was my motivation to push through school during on of the semesters when I had to repeat because I failed. Then as I am in my final semester she tells me she is feeling depressed. I tried to help asking her how I could help or to know what she was going though but all she would say is that she didn’t know just knew something wasn’t the same. She then said she needed some time away to think of what she wanted out of our relationship after an argument. I was already feeling her being emotionally distant from me and she had gone out to meet an old guy friend from work, who I did not like and questioned if they had anything going on. She assured me they didn’t. I believed her and thought I would give her time away from to self reflect. Me being in the most stressful semester wanted to have her around just to hold and help me through the stress but agreed to give her time as it would help me focus on school and we could talk when when she had the chance to reflect. We didn’t see each other close to two months and talked almost every day but more of checking in with each other. I told her time away didn’t mean we were broken up and I was afraid of her cheating and she assured that she just wanted time to reflect and I had nothing to worry about and should be focusing on school because that’s important. 

So I finished the semester and we get the time to talk she said she figured she we had some argument because I was upset she was gone when I need her. We talked it over and decided we will work things out and had a great day. I missed her a lot got back to feeling no worry in the world with her in my arms. She even showed me some text as we were cuddling on her phone to assure me wasn’t talking to guys outside of friends. She left my house and we had plans to hang out the following day to go out on a couples date with friends. 
She forgot her Iwatch, me thinking of being nice thought id charge it for her and saw she had a message. It was a spam message but me being curious looked through old text. I found text between her and another guy (not the friend from work) with her saying how she missed him and his touch. Some where from like 3am texting him she got home safe from his house and she enjoyed time with him. They were calling each other mami and papi and all kinds of bullshit and how they missing each other. I didn’t scroll and read through all text just scrolled around to see it went back two months or more I didn’t keep scrolling because it would take a sec to load old messages. I was so mad and and started to put all her belongs at my house in trash bags because It was over. I was going to go back and keep reading the text but the thought seemed to painful and still being mad I smashed it with a brick to prevent me from going back and seeing all the details. I went over to her house and threw all her stuff on her yard when she came out asking what I was doing. I asked if she had anything to tell me and she just said kept saying about what and why was a making a scene and that I was disrespecting her family and the neighbors because they could see. I calmed down enough to hear her out while sitting in my car. She didn’t admit it until I mentioned his name and  that I had seen the text. She came clean and told me that during her feeling depressed this old friend came around and would compliment her all the time and she felt good about it they where hanging out they kissed and  one day ended up having sex once(supposedly) and after they did she felt bad but they kept talking until he told her that he loved her. She said she didn’t love him and broke it off because she was only really in love with me. I was committed to her but being honest I did go on a dating site one time to get some confidence in knowing I still could get other girls but I could never bring myself to physically meet someone and deleted all of it because I couldn’t hurt her like that and I never told her about it. 

I applied and got approved for an engagement ring that I wanted to give her as I graduated. She was the only gradation present I wanted and was ready to start our life. Luckily just found out Zales has a 60 day return policy that I never expected to use. Now I can no longer see her the same and have no intentions of getting back.

832,"I hate not knowing where I stand with the love of my life. He said he is hesitant about starting over, then the texts got a little spicy last night. Today nothing.

833,"This might get long.  But I’ll do my best to keep it short. 

My parents are on a trip of a lifetime and I was to take care of their property and farm aside from two calves that had to be bottlefed. That was my brothers responsibility since they are his calves. Both my brother and I are grown adults with families of our own, and we live close by my parents so chipping in is not a problem, at least not for my family. 

Due to miscommunication, my brother went on vacation the week my parents left, leaving me to take care of the two calves. This posed a problem because I had surgery 10 days ago (3 days post-op at the time my brother left) and have over two dozen stitches holding my back together. (I had a sizable skin cancer removed) Per my doctor I am not to bend or twist my back, or pick up anything heavier than 15lbs. But to not kill my parents dream my husband and I offered to feed them. As of today I still have my stitches, although by doing my brother the favor I have stretched them. 

My brother and his family were supposed to return from their vacation late yesterday evening. After the last feeding of the day I informed them via text that the supplies needed for the calves was left in a designated space and is ready for them to pick up.  They sent back a response that indicated they would be taking over in the AM. 

Per my usual I went down this morning to feed the pets and water plants and the supplies were still there. Told myself they must be sleeping in. Checked again at 11am. Still there. After lunch, at 1pm I check again, and nothing has been picked up. Those poor calves were over there starving. So my DH and I got everything ready, go to the barn and feed the calves. I am LIVID. They were so hungry it was pitiful. 

Communication is not my brothers strong suit, and thanks to his wife we do not have a relationship anymore. Not getting into that now, but this also brings up the point that this is not the only situation I have been in like this with him. There has been zero communication today. And just now, 3pm, I see them go down the road to look for the supplies. I didn’t leave them out again for pick up, as I had intended to just assume the responsibility until my parents return. My husband says that the calves are my brothers (they are) and now that they have returned it’s not our responsibility to continue to feed them. I understand that he doesn’t want to continue because it is taking time away from him getting his work done for his job. 

I guess I’m asking for advice on what to say to my brother. I’m more disappointed in him than I have ever been. If he had simply called or texted me last night or this morning that something came up or that they were really tired and asked me to feed them again, I would have been 100% understandable and not the least bit angry. We are the lifeline for those calves, and for them to miss their feedings is just wrong on so many levels. What would you do/say?",29Jun2020,1
835,"I’m 22 and still live with my parents. I have a door to the outside and a door to the rest of the house. I keep to myself and work my two jobs. My parents insist that I don’t pay rent and not to move out until I’m ready to buy a house. Well even though I lock my doors before I leave the house my parents have keys just Incase. 

Here’s the thing. My aunt and uncle came to visit town and my mom decided to show them my room while I was at work. Why In hell my aunt and uncle wanted to see my room is insane to me, why my parents thought it was ok to get the key and show them is insane to me and honestly makes me mad. Who knows what could’ve been out that I didn’t want them to see? 

Granted My room was just a tad messy, nothing scary was out except a couple beer cans. Am i out of bounds to be offended here? Even though it’s their house my parents and I have a good relationship and they want me to have my own space but I feel like this was a breach. If I wanted my aunt and uncle to see my room I would’ve showed them myself. But what is so exciting about a 22 year old guys room? 

Also this isn’t the first time. My mom had friend from work over and gave them a tour of our house, including my room, and my girlfriend at the time was getting the bong ready to smoke and my mom just barged in with her and her friends from work. Again this occurrence happened while I was at work. 

My mom has a friend couple coming to town and i plan on letting her know how I feel about this. 

Another time I just remembered. When they first bought the house I was 18 years old. I remember being “asleep” it’s like 8/9 am in the morning and in come my mother and father and a guy my father works with and they come in to take a tour of my room and I’m laying in bed pretending to be asleep for sake of awkwardness. What if I was masturbating or had condoms out or something scare that these people don’t need to see? 

It makes me beyond uncomfortable that they just are out of touch in that way that maybe it’s not weird to them but it’s weird to myself and I’m sure to my parents friends.",29Jun2020,1

Well actually, its I have to get up early everyday otherwise I can't finish my homework. My mom got mad at me for doing my homework instead of helping around the house. I don't know what's wrong with me. I literally can't get up early. I have like 5 different alarms, and when I put it across the room, I get up, turn it off and go back to sleep. Sometimes I flat out don't hear it. I share a room with my sister, and it's annoying her. I don't know what to do. If I don't get up early, I literally can't do my homework for the rest of the day. The little pockets of time I waste because I'm stupid. I know I should do my work, but I don't. Then when its bedtime, either I'm lazy or pull an all-nighter to complete it. Why can everyone else get up early besides me? What's wrong with me? Am I lazy, or is something fundamentally broken about me? I usually fall asleep at midnight but get up at 9 am. when I try to sleep early, either I can't sleep, or I sleep for 12 hours.

839,"So three years ago, I was really bad when it came to being social, I didn't know how to act at all, and I was someone who always said yes. Anyways, during that year, I was practicing kickboxing and during a session, I got paired up with a weirdo who kept telling me about how he had sex with a girl and stuff like that (I live in a muslim country and premarital sex is a sin). So we kept practicing until he asked me to give him the facebook account of a cute girl in my class, a kept telling him no for a while, and I guess after he kept pressuring me, I accidentally told him the name of one of my classmates, and I think I told him not to go talk to her or something like that, but I didn't think much about it. 

A few months ago, I met him again, and this memory popped up in my head, and now that I know how to be social and what should be done and not done, I felt like absolute crap, and I hate the fact that I did something so stupid, to top it off I became friends with one of her close friends, so it hurts me to think that I may have hurt one of my friend's dear friends, and I'm scared to talk about it, because I don't know if anything happened, and if something happened I don't think I would be able to live with it.

842,"
hello everyone.

I moved to the UK 2 years ago for University and left my family and friends behind. 3 months into living in the UK, I met my boyfriend who I have a very happy relationship with. He is a UK resident, has lived in Croatia for 3 years and in Paris for 10 years and also has a Croatian ID (I believe). 

I love the UK. I love the people and I love the city I live in. But the virus has messed up most of our plans. We are in financial struggles due to us being on furlough leave and only receiving 80% of our part time payment. We are now behind in rent. Basically, everything sucks. 

My mom is financially supporting us and so is my boyfriend’s dad who lives in the UK as well. My boyfriend is finishing college next month
and then would like to start a 3 year education in University. Everything is prepared to apply for him. I finish Uni next year. 

We made a plan to move to Amsterdam after education as the UK is very expensive and also we don’t want to start a potential family there. Also, my boyfriend is more drawn to living within the EU and living closer to our families as mine is in Austria and his mom and siblings are in France. 

Whenever I talk to my mom, she urges us to move to Austria for a bit and then move to Amsterdam, she says England is going
down quickly now since Brexit and now the virus. I agree.

Now to the mushy bit where I talk about what’s on my heart: I am so scared I might never see my mom again. I’m scared I will never be able to go to my homecountry again. I have made other plans in life now but I am worried that the situation might never be better again and I am now missing my one opportunity to see her. She has the same fear and said it might take a looooong time until I see her again. Last I’ve seen her was July 2019. I’ve visited her for 10 days. Now it’s almost been a year. I miss her but I can’t leave without my boyfriend. 

I need advice. What should I do? Any thoughts are appreciated.",29Jun2020,1

Even with insurance, my visits to a specialist for these cysts are $150-300 depending on what they are doing/checking that day.  I feel at a loss.  I don't know what to do at all.  I was told that I cannot bear children because the cysts are in the worst areas of my uterus.  I cry often, and I'm not sure what to do.

848,"I [18M] have fallen in love with my best friend [18F]. Growing up for me was not literal hell but it was not pretty either. I have denied my depression for years and only recently have I accepted the fact that I may need help. I am a person that feels the need to know everything because as a child I was neglected and found my own intelligence to be my best friend. I became extremely apathetic and two-faced in social situations and admittedly had a superiority complex but I can attribute that to my developing narcissistic tendencies. I have little to no relation with my family. Most days I stay in my room all day and can go literally weeks without speaking to my siblings or mother. About 3 years ago now I met my current best friend (We will call her N). At first I treated her like I treated everyone else, below me and incapable of understanding. She did not give up when she ran into one of my walls. N is persistent, loving, compassionate, and all around a generally good person. I let my walls down and let her in and she taught me that just because I can be right about things does not mean there isn’t another way to tackle life. She has taught me what Love is and I am thankful she has been apart of my life. 

Recently we have graduated high school and are going to go out into the real world. She is taking over a small business her mother gave to her, and I will be joining the army in hopes of having the military pay for my college and later med school dreams. I have been an apathetic person for the better half of my formative years but after meeting N I realized the power that one person can have in your life. In life I would like to help people and make a difference in the lives of others. I want to start with N.

As I have said before I am in love with her, I know her flaws and we have had ups and downs but at the end of the day I choose to love her and I am happy with my choice. N on the other hand has refused a relationship stating that, “I just don’t see you like that”. If that were true I would have no problem being her friend and keeping things platonic. Yet she has been facing some family trauma with her parents going through a divorce and I think she is experiencing a major depression for the first time in her life. She has been acting out of character by hooking up with guys off tinder and desperately trying to fill her life with temporary pleasures (For context she lost her virginity on tinder at 18 and has been waiting for the right guy since she was 14, later telling me I was she needed). When this depression becomes too much for her she would come to me and at first it was just her taking a nap with me, then we would talk and she would sleep over, and then things got sexual and she confessed that she loved me (in the moment). The next morning she tries to act like nothing happened. This has occurred multiple times but after each time she distances herself further from me. Inevitably we reconnect and she is always the one that cannot keep to herself. This as you can imagine is extremely emotionally taxing for me. She would call me while she is drunk at a party and cry saying she hates life at the moment, talking about wanting to die sometimes, and how she regrets sleeping with other guys and not choosing me. Yet as soon as she is sober the next day she tries to play it off and keep her face saying we are only ever going to be friends. Then in a few days she will come over distraught and expect me to comfort her. I do not want to abandon her in her time of need because if I leave now she will continue ignoring her mental health and develop unhealthy coping mechanisms and I fear live a sad unfulfilled life. 

I can’t force her to love me, currently she has been ignoring me for the past 3 days. I love this girl but I know I am the rock in her life that she stands on to keep her head above the water. I give her everything every time she needs it but In return I never get the satisfaction of having my needs met. At this point she treats me worse then she does her friends (which is what I am supposedly in her eyes) and only comes to me when she cannot deal anymore. She refuses to listen to reason, she downplays her emotions, and she ignores me. I feel I have no other choice but to rip myself from under her and let her see for herself what everyone else has to go through. She is not appreciative of me and I think it is simply the fact that I support her so gives her the ability to downplay everything. I just don’t have the strength to do that to her and watch. I don’t know if she can drag herself out, she has had it easy and now she has a business to run and a life to start I just feel like now is not the time to teach her a lesson. At the same time I too have a life to start and needs as a person that are not being met. She doesn’t say but I know she will be lost without me I will feel guilty for doing so but it has to be done. I have joked to her about me joining the military and she would joke back, “you cant leave me what would I do without you”. I have already signed up for active duty and leave in a few months, I didn’t have the privilege of having a business handed to me so I am signing away years of my life to receive and education I have dreamed of and accomplish my discovered love of helping others. 

This is advice and I know my writing is dramatic but if you see another way to go about this please let me know I would love to be there for her but at this point I no longer want anything significant.

I was afraid to use those same shoes, so I found some of my since boots from my other job. It was working at a crab processing plant, and every time we walked in the buildings we had to step on a mat with a couple inches of water with some kind if sanitizing solution on it. I'm afraid that the sanatize is still on the outside after 2 years, and I'm going to contaminate the environment, when I go clean up the hot water heater, so I tried to clean them with apple cider vinegar,  but just found out that that's not good for the environment either.

859,"Hi, to start I'll give the whole run down. 
I'm a 22 year old new mom, and had my baby boy in February 2020 before Covid-19 got bad. He spent 6 weeks in NICU, and by the time we left our town was pretty much shut down. I stayed home with him and took precautions when going to the store (left him with grandparents, I wore a mask, etc.).

I went back to work the beginning of June, and I work for an essential business. We are required to wear masks at work, but customers dont have to. We practice social distancing, so with all this I felt okay with coming back to work even though worried for my baby, and my family who watches him.

Well, the assistant manager at my store does not wear a mask if our manager isnt working. I hate it. I feel like if he ends up getting covid because he's not wearing a mask at work all day then everybody I work with will get it too, and so my family. My baby was born with gastroschisis, premature, and had NEC in the NICU. My step mom is almost in stage 4 kidney failure, not to mention that there are older people that help watch my son. I would be devastated if any of them got sick because of me working. 

I've considered talking to the AM myself, but we dont get along well at all for many reasons. Everytime I try to mention to him that he is doing something the wrong way, or that something needs to be done soon, he says he doesnt care and has snarky remarks. I feel like if I tell him that I want him to follow policy and wear his mask even if our manager isnt there he'll just get mad and not do anything at all.

I know I can tell the manager, but have told him something before about the AM (not this situation) and nothing happened from it. They are close friends. 

The only thing I can think of doing if I dont talk to them is go to the district manager or HR.

Though now I'm starting to have second thoughts about moving, I thought moving out and into a larger city would be an adventure.

We're living in the outskirts of London and we've been looking at houses where we'd be getting a pretty small mortgage and the people selling them to us are in their 40s and 50s and are proper adults with kids and stuff. It's ridiculous. We've done nothing to earn this money, so if we buy a house now and lose it all in the crash I kind of think I'd rather be part of the group that suffers in the crash rather than one of the wealthy ones that profits from people losing their jobs,...but I digress. My grandparents were probably upper middle class, as were fiance's, but they were mostly just part of that war time generation who saved every penny. I went shopping with my granny and she had a very strict budget, had absolutely no idea at all how much they'd built up over the years. His grandparents had about the same amount in the bank as mine but always went on bus holidays.

Anyway - I'm seriously struggling with my mental health at the moment, lockdown/ not having seen friends or family other than fiancé in person for months/ living next to a main road without a garden isn't helping, it's also seriously affecting my work. Today, and several times a week at the moment, I've been feeling suicidal. I won't act on it, it's just thoughts and feelings, but I seriously seriously seriously need help. I've been dealing with OCD since I was 12 and it comes in waves and I'm currently in a bad one. I'm having Skype therapy weekly. As soon as lockdown eases enough I'll convert that to in-person therapy.

Anyway I'm starting to think maybe we should actually just get a lovely cottage in the peak district, spend a lot of time in nature, get a dog which we can't do in a rented flat with no garden (dog + nature would be good for my mental health), I'll find a job which is lower pressure (I'm currently in M&amp;A finance, stressful and high pressure, and my particular team are amazing compared to the industry norm but the hours are mental - I can say mental as an actual mental person right?). And with no mortgage we'll have less pressure and be able to enjoy life. Fiancé works in the public sector in a job which can be done all over the UK, but is more interesting and has more options in London (I think he might be being a little bit snobby about it personally) - so hence we have to stay close to London, any of the commutable countryside would require being shackled to a significant mortgage = pressure for me to stay in a stressful job, so can't have decent countryside and please us both.

So I'm wondering what you think we should do. For the sake of my mental health - I really think being able to spend more time in nature and take some pressure off will help - do you think it's reasonable to use this mad lucky position we're in and ask fiancé to seriously consider moving? He'll say/ has said ""if it will help you stop feeling like you're going to kill yourself I'd obviously do anything,  but there are way more opportunities to specialise/ get experience in London""....I'm at my wit's end and totally fed up with feeling shit all the time, and I know it's no magic pill or anything, but I think having no rent/mortgage, and being able to walk up mountains every day would help both of us feel better and potentially be a good use of my grandparent's hard saved money - they would have definitely wanted me to get a house with it rather than invest it. And if we can, why shouldn't we?

Tl;dr: seriously deteriorating mental health, we are in a position to move to an aonb and have low outgoings, less stress, although fiance feels he'd lose some of his options work-wise if we did.",29Jun2020,1
872,"Hi, this is my first ever post on reddit, I found myself looking for advice on how to do things like fix my PS4 from links to reddit on google so I think asking for some direct advice could be useful as well.

As the title would suggest I’ve always found school very difficult, I found it very hard to learn anything and struggled to keep up with everything. It was very upsetting because my friend group were all very smart and continued to get smarter, whereas I felt that I was ok for the first 2 years in terms of keeping up but everything after that got worse and worse.

Eventually I finished school with poor results and all of my friends have moved on and went to college, I couldn’t figure out what to do with my life so I decided to take a year off and continue working in my job I’ve had from almost the minute I turned 18.

But the past year of my life has been one of the worst, I had no idea how alone I would become as I watched my friends have fun and make new friends and leave me behind after knowing them all for so long. 

I hate my job, everyone around me thinks I’m an idiot, I find it really hard to talk to anyone there and I have a bunch of other issues with it but I don’t want to complain. 

So I decided to take a risk and pursue something I genuinely love which is film in a further education college which will hopefully lead me to more film education courses.

The main purpose of this post is to ask whether or not people think I should quit my job and focus 100% on my course because of how hard I find it to study but then not have any money anymore.

Or if people think I should keep my job even though I hate it to keep a steady flow of money just in case this film thing doesn’t work out. If people think I should look for a different job that doesn’t need you to work a lot of hours so I can focus more on my college work I would really appreciate some suggestions.

I’m 20 btw and I live in Ireland.

Thank you very much for taking time out of your days to read my post : )",29Jun2020,1

874,"I’ve (25 f) been with my boyfriend for three years (24 m). I feel like sex has always been a bit of an issue for us. I have an extremely high sex drive and he does not. I encourage porn and am extremely open about trying new things.  
When we do have sex it’s AMAZING. 
I know patterns change. Things change. 
Lately I feel like he is not attracted to me anymore. 
He will lose his boner 5 minutes into sex. He almost never initiates it. He always tells me to be direct and tell him when I want to have sex. I hate doing that because I feel like it might ruin things but he insists. 
Yesterday I laid ontop of him and kissed him and tried being sexy and I told him I wanted him and I was horny for him. He then in kind words he said that he feels pressure when I tell him I want sex and he can’t get it up. I continued to lay on him but didn’t pursue sex since I didn’t want him to feel that way. I can’t win. Later that night he, I guess, felt bad and went down on me and took his time and got me off. I felt like it was really sexy and he was into it but he never got a boner. 
This is just one example. I felt shitty about myself and I’ve always been confident with my sexuality and now I feel insecure and very timid about it. He’s made me feel rejected and I’m not going to lie I am frustrated and a bit depressed. I’ve talked to him about how I  feel multiple times and he always says it’s him and there is nothing wrong with me. If that’s the case then I need to know what is going on. I’m done feeling like this and not having a deeper conversation about this. Now that I feel unwanted and unattractive sex is literally all I can think about, it’s driving me crazy.

878,"Hey everyone. I’m 16 and I’m going into my junior year this upcoming school year. 

I’ve been considering early graduation for a while but my mom told me some things that makes it seem a bit more enticing but I really don’t know what to do. 

Why I would:
As of the end of sophomore year, I only need 3 more classes to meet graduation requirements (us history, English, and econ/gov) and so far i planned on taking 2 this year. but I just feel like it’s a little dumb to be in school senior year for 1 class when I’d have to be at school for the whole 7 period day. 

Also, my mom said her and my dad are only together for me because she wants him to come to my graduation (never said I wanted him there) but like, earlier graduation means dad goes away sooner so yay to that. 


Why I wouldn’t: 
Friends friends and friends. I’d miss my friends so freaking much.
College. I have no money to pay for college, my parents aren’t helping or anything, I don’t have a job, all that. And crazy enough, we usually never qualify for financial aid (at least, my older sisters don’t) 
And if I stayed senior year, I could dual enroll to get free college credits which is good. 

But like I’m also counting down the days until I leave home/get my dad out of my life, because I really don’t like either of those things. 

So what should I do?",29Jun2020,1

882,"Hi! I'm 17f and i haven't lived with my dad since i was young due to him mentally abusing my mum, him leaving twice and mum getting full rights to me after i was scared of being r*ped at the age of 10.
Now he's tried to get me to go inside his house for years and tried to make me see him more, understandable as we had a good relationship from the few memories i have, but me being scared like that at so young there must of been something my heads blocked off.

Not too long ago i had a nightmare he killed himself in front of me and was telling me it was all my fault, almost the same day i went to get coffee with him and he told me he was going to therapy because of me not talking to him anymore or seeing him etc.

Ever since i can't stop thinking about how he never got to see me grow up and i am not talking to him enough and i don't he will kill himself and it will be my fault.

I feel an immense  amount of guilt but my mate told me he's manipulating me to come back again. I'm gullible, i believe almost anything and I'm sure he knows that, he's sending me baby photos and photos of me when i was in his custody looking happy.

887,"**Trigger warning: sexual harrasment**

Recently, there has been a rise of cases and victims speaking up about their experiences of sexual harassment with teachers. This started with an alumni of a certain school in my country sharing a thread of her experience with a pedophile teacher. Ever since then, a lot more people—students from different schools mostly—have been sharing their stories on Twitter. I read through a couple of the stories and, besides being incredibely pained and angry and frustrated about what I was reading and the fact that almost all the abusers got away with what they did or only got a slap on the wrist, I remembered something terrifying. 

I don't know how to describe what I felt? It's like being hit by a sudden memory you forgot existed when you see or hear something nostalgic like a place or a song or a movie. And then it became very vivid, almost like how you see in a dream. But I don't just remember what I saw. I also remembered the *feeling* of his hand on my thighs when he thought I was asleep. I remember being frozen and not knowing what to do. I remember pretending to still be asleep and his hand slowly creeping up, obviously making sure his movements didn't wake me up. I don't remember the exact year but I must have been no older than 10 when it happened. I remember the next day waking up and forcing myself to believe it was just a dream and that it was nothing and that he would never do that to me. I recently learned that the brain has a defense mechanism that makes it possible to repress something traumatic so much that you forget about it. Or once you do remember it you constantly doubt it even happened and it isn't just made up. But I *know* it was real.

I don't know if I should bring it up with my older siblings? I have a really good relationship with them but I'm afraid that something might go wrong. I don't know what but yeah. I'm really really sorry if this is too much for someone.

893,"Honestly I don’t really know where to go with something like this. This is a complicated situation because the three of us all work together. 

My “friend” has repeatedly made inappropriate comments and sexual remarks to a girl I work with that is 17 years old. He is 20. In the past he has done things like picking her up “always jokingly to him” and taking her into our back break room and closing the door so they could be alone. I don’t know what he does when this happens but she is very clearly not happy about it. I’ve heard her literally yell “STOP, *insert persons name*” when things get really out of hand. He’s aware that she isn’t comfortable with these things. She’s said that he likes to block doors so that she can’t leave rooms, and that he only laughs and plays it off as a joke when she tries to tell him that she is NOT okay with him doing these things. 

 These remarks escalated over this past weekend while I was out of town, seems to me he waited for the opportunity to do something physical to her while I was away because I’d call him out on it, but that’s besides the point.
He has a habit of taking people’s car keys “as a joke” so that they can’t leave and have to stay to talk and hang out. After their shift ended, he took her keys and waited for all the other employees to leave. They are now alone late at night in a parking lot on the outskirts of town with no lights and no one to call him out on his behavior. 

He had somehow got it in his head that this girl enjoys choking. He proceeded to make a joke about something, and PUT HIS HANDS AROUND HER THROAT. It isn’t my place to talk about it very much but this girl has had a history of people taking advantage of her at a young age. She obviously reacted extremely negatively, she cried, tried to get away, tried to get her car keys back so that she could go home etc. She was able to get away from him and went across the parking lot I assume to contact someone about what was happening. I don’t know the events between this and what happened next but she was able to get her car keys and get to the drivers side of the vehicle, he then made some more inappropriate remarks and PUT HIS HANDS AROUND HER THROAT AGAIN. This time with his other hand he held her arm behind her back so that she couldn’t move. He then pressed her back up against her car. 

She came to me about this extremely upset, blaming herself for being in that situation, trying to think of ways she could have prevented what happened. She tried to make it clear to me that she has it handled and that everything is okay. But what happened is not okay. Not at all. 

I’m at a loss of what to do here. I’ve contacted him and made plans to meet up and “talk about stuff”. But further than that I don’t know what actions to take to help this situation. Or if it’s even my place to help. That being said though she did come straight to me to tell me what happened because I’m someone she trusts.

There's also this big deal: I'm lesbian, and I've been hiding it for like 10 years (he's homophobe). The thing is maybe he would say ""ok, I don't mind"" because that's what he says in front of my uncles and so on, but I hear his comments at home and I don't think he would really accept it. I only go out on fridays and he always asks me who I'm going out with, sometimes he asks me about boys... I feel really bad for lying to him, but there's this fear he'll try to change it all or he'll make a hell out of my life.

I got several scolarships and still haven't seen a single cent.

Even telling him my friends are going to have dinner on monday or whatever makes me anxious. 

I spend the summer at the beach with my uncles, and it's a break from all this stress, and I could go live with them somehow... but doing that is ""split the family in two"" as they say. All they have to say is ""wait, have patience"", but it kinda feels as if I'm wasting my life.

He's the kind of person that needs to understimate other people, not reasonable at all, very stubborn, problematic, he believes himself to be the ""head of the family"" and he enjoys playing the victim role: everybody's against him.

898,"Telling you right away, I want actual advice, and not the typical stuff that you can find in the first results in google on the topic. Though anything is welcome. Also telling you that I'm gonna write a long essay to help you understand the situation better.

I have turned 17 years old recently, (male), and I really want to be mentally able to not stop going to the workouts I tell myself I'll complete, to get more fit for, in descending priority: A)My self esteem B)the girlsC)the P.E. final that's in about 9 months, so I have time.

A little(a lot) of info about me, again, to help you understand why I can't just keep doing to my scheduled workouts:

I'm 17, and a male, just reminding.

I'm addicted to videogames(if someone has actual advice on how to stop this, this is welcome too, because it's my summer vacation and I don't want to waste it again, and don't wanna waste a ton of time, but I can't quit)

I'm a master procrastinator regarding work(So far, after just finishing 11th grade, every project I have done on the due day, sometimes skipped not caring about the F grade because I'm lazy, and never studying to tests until recently, when finals started, that kinda forced me to) (I'd say I'm much smarter than average though, objectively speaking. You may or may not believe me, up to you).

I'm lazy as hell, I actually enjoy spending day after day playing videogames and/or watching YouTube or movies when there's no school, while deep down understanding that it's a terrible way of using free time. Since that quarantine and extra 2  months free of school, this only intensified(the understanding that it's not alright to waste time like this), that's why I am posting this.

However, my body is truly a gift of nature - on paper, at least.
I'm 1.95 meters tall, and weigh 85kg, for Americans it's 6'6"" tall and 170 pounds(I think).
I look, well, tall ( to those who are shorter XD), have a bit broad shoulders, but not wide in general, have some stomach fat, and if you squeeze any point in my body, especially the arms and upper body there will be some excessive fat, but I don't look fat almost at all. 

The only time I have worked out in my life(for real) was with my only friend(male) in the park(with mechanisms for a workout), my will lasted for about a month(three times a week, and that's only because of his moral support, usually when I get a burst of motivation I work out once and stop)(it was a 20 minute walk for me each direction(there and back home), while for him only 2, so that was also crippling my motivation). (Told you I'm lazy). By the way, during that short time I became significantly stronger and more durable, so I also know that if I go and actually do something, the results will be higher than average. But this doesn't motivate me at all for some reason. And again, I really need and want the better fit body over what I have now.

You can ignore this paragraph, but again, any response is welcome - I just need to get this off my chest for my brain - Also, some problem, though not as serious, and if I get the motivation to work out again, I'm almost certain that I'll bypass this as well, but still, this is haunting me, and I feel like this has to stop - in a public place, when someone is looking at me when I work out, I just stop until they stop staring. I just can't work out and show them how physically not in shape I am right now, even if I don't know them, I'm too embarrassed to continue and finish the exercise, while achieving a bad result(best I can do is 6 pushups while expending all of my power, in this out of shape state that I'm in, because of my super untrained biceps and shoulders).


Foreseeing the advice that MIGHT come up, distracting myself - I love drawing anime, but I suck at it. I love reading, especially what I already read, like Harry Potter.


I know all the generic stuff, the basic stuff that immediately comes to mind as a response to such a post, I'm looking for something actually new and that can cause an actual change in a procrastinator's pattern of behavior, my habits, mindset, etc.",29Jun2020,2

Along with this there is also a great deal of guilt.

One thing to note is that in previous jobs, I was judged and let go due to my anxiety and panic disorder which is why I am probably scared to find a new job. As I am scared that it will happen again.

Please, someone help me figure out what to do. I need advice.

Hi, I posted one time before on this and it helped. Now I need some more advice, and I’m hoping that someone can help.

One thing to know about me is that I have anxiety, and it was even confirmed by a doctor. Now I have been seeing a psychotherapist just to help me manage my anxiety. Now due to the recent events I can no longer afford to see a psychotherapist because of COVID-19. I can not longer afford it because I got laid off as what I do is considered a “non-essential business”. 

Now I have always had anxiety  it was always apart of my life for as long as I can remember, and I don’t think it will ever go away. At one point it got hard for me to manage which is why I was seeing a psychotherapist. Now I have been recently talking to a guy online, and our conversation moved to talking over the phone. Now I have been able to manage my anxiety up until this point. Now that we are talking over the phone it seems like that my anxiety is starting to sneak it’s way back, and it’s a little challenging for me to deal with. I just want to know, is what I am going through normal? Like, I have talk to him over the phone once before, and now we are going to talk over the phone again today, and I can feel my anxiety rise. I don’t know if this is normal, I thought I got all that anxiety, nervousness, etc. out when we talked over the phone last. Like I said, I will be talking to him again over the phone today and my anxiety is starting to rise. If someone can please give me some kind of advice that would be great.",29Jun2020,1
901,"Hello, today I missed my first hair appointment with a lady that I am close with, and I consider it a highlight to go to her salon to get my haircut. She is very busy, so missing an appointment I think would be of an annoyance. To make matters worse, I even asked her a few days before when the haircut was. We typically have ours on a Wednesday, but this time it was scheduled on a Monday. I completely missed it and texted her about 30 minutes after when I realized saying that I was so sorry, and if there was a time we could reschedule. We did reschedule. Even after this was all taken care of, I feel a horrible amount of guilt and disgust. My heart feels sunk and I feel like a complete screw up, I don't know how to not feel this way. I plan on bringing her cupcakes and giving her a good tip next time. Any advice will help.",29Jun2020,1
902,"I am 16 years old. Both me and my sister are normal on educational levels. However my brother is very different, very picky. When my mom first brought him to school, his school’s principals just told my mom to never bring him there back because he has shutted down the electricity. They have never returned her money but she moved him to a preschool for special ed. He was doing okay. He wasn’t doing much with interaction but it was okay however not efficient enough. 

My mom has made this rule for me and my sister to spend time with our brother everyday. We try to play puzzles with him or read for him but we want a better way. 

I want to reach my brother to expand his speaking skills and possibly help him get into better experiences.",29Jun2020,1
903,"My boundary issues are most prominent in my friendships. With casual friends, I overshare personal details and feelings; With close friends, my boundaries are still inappropriately low (nonexistent).

I have a tendency to overshare about personal issues and feelings with entirely casual friends. Part of the reason why is that I get overexcited about the idea of being closer friends with someone, which leads me to share things as if we are close friends. The other part is that I just don’t have a strong sense of if something is too personal to share because *I* would be fine sharing anything.

Surprisingly, oversharing has gone incredibly well for me and has started closer friendships with people. Unfortunately, I think it is also borderline manipulative. While I don’t intend to share emotional stuff to create the illusion of a strong friendship, I think it is just as invasive and harmful to the other person. It puts them in a difficult situation because it is hard to maintain personal boundaries in general.

With closer friends, it is so close to being a perfect situation. I love talking about feelings and oversharing, and that’s actually appropriate with close friends. Apparently personal boundaries are still important in close friendships ships though. 

I never really realized this until I had a conversation with one of my closest friends. We had just reconnected after not talking for a while, and talked a ton about our feelings for each other.

In our friendship, she would jokingly be mean to me and tell me to do trivial things. It wasn’t anything really bad— just telling me to throw things away for her, jokingly saying she hated me, telling me to leave a room, pretending to be angry with me over trivial things, etc. 

We talked about it and I shared that I never could tell when she was actually angry with me or just joking. It surprised me to hear that it was all fake. She has never been angry with me, and her reasoning for being “mean” to me was because she thought that no one else would do that and the I enjoyed it.

It also surprised me to hear that other people thought it was concerning? Like the last time she was jokingly mean to me and told me to throw something away for her and leave, apparently one of our mutual friends was upset with her and called it “abusive.”

She felt really bad about it because I also pointed out the the behavior “cold be seen as manipulative” and said she would entirely stop. I felt really weird about her stopping I guess? It’s weird to admit it, but I genuinely really liked it when she was treated me like that. I shared my feelings, but that didn’t change her decision.

Reflecting on the conversation has made me feel concerned about if I should have boundaries in the friendship. She jokingly brought up the idea of a blood pact later in the convo, and I ‘jokingly’ said that I could send her a pic/video of me cutting/hurting myself for the pact...  and I genuinely wanted her to tell me to do that. The weird part is that I legitimately would have been fine with her telling me to hurt myself too??

She didn’t tell me to, but that topic ended with the fact that’s it’s supposed to be done in person/sharing blood— not her saying that it was inappropriate or wrong or not something she would want me to do.

I don’t know how to feel about the friendship and my boundaries in it. I love talking with her so much and she actually likes it when I overshare personal things. We left off with a plan for talking next week specifically about incredibly personal things, and I am really excited to just openly share suuuper private stuff. It’s definitely “inappropriate” in general, but is it ok to have zero boundaries with someone?",29Jun2020,1

906,"Say I (f/25) have a slight rape kink, but have recently told my s/o (m/26) that I am waiting till marriage to continue having sex.. 

We'd been celibate for probably about 2 months. This weekend, it's like something came over him and he lost control. After intensely making out with me, he then put his hands down my pants and started playing with me, I tried to walk away from him but he kept pulling me back and holding me down..

Eventually went back to the room, made out intensely again, told me that he can't wait will we get married so he can destroy me, a little afterwards, he played with me some more and regardless of all my ""no's"" and pulling away, he ended up screwin me. Afterwards he told me to basically hurry up and get him his ring so we can get married. 

He knows I want to wait till after we're married to continue having sex, he clearly knows since he even stated it himself.

It happened 2 more times..The 3rd time, I mentioned my h*** was hurting and burning slightly as if raw and he I guess dismissed it..

910,"I'm just having a really hard time processing the trauma of my abusive relationship. I broke up with this guy 2 years ago, and he is still contacting my friends telling them, ""tell (my name) to have an awesome day!"" and ""tell (my name) she's perfect!"" He used to do it to my one friend, but then she blocked him, so now he does it to my other friend, and she is blocking him now. I really just want him to stop. I have a new, healthy relationship and a new life.

I'm in therapy, so the therapy helps with the trauma of my relationship, however, small things like how he would manipulate me and other people still stick with me. For example, he would cheat on me a lot. He would tell everyone that I was crazy and obsessive, and that's why he would cheat. He would just blame me and tell people, ""I'm trying to break up with her!"" when he would never even try to break up with me? It was all a lie so girls and his friends would allow him to cheat.

I don't know, I'm just having flashbacks of when he would do this. I'm a really shy, timid girl, and I am unfortunately extremely caring of what others think of me. I don't want them to think I'm crazy because I'm not at all. It wasn't my fault I was being manipulated by him.

There was one time where he began to snapchat a girl. I am not a jealous girl, but after I suspected him to be cheating on my for years, of course I got mad. Later that day we went to a restaurant to have dinner with his friend and his friend's girlfriend. He began to brag about how upset I was that he was snap chatting a girl? It seemed like he was trying to make me seem crazy, without me suspecting he was doing that. He was like, ""(my name) was so mad that I was snap chatting this girl named Julia."" Later on I found out that he cheated on me with his friend's girlfriend's best friend (sorry if that's confusing). I feel like he was bragging about it because he knew it would get around that I was mad, and it would further his narrative that I was crazy.

I also sometimes get flashbacks of the way his friends treated me, and at the time it upset and confused me, but now it makes sense. I now understand they treated me that way because he convinced them I was a psycho girlfriend.

I'm just not crazy and I was never crazy. I guess part of healing from his abuse is understanding that I wasn't crazy like he tried to make me seem, and that it wasn't my fault. However, at the same time, when I realize these things it causes me to have flashbacks and think, ""ohhh that's why he did that thing in front of his friends that confused me at the time, but makes sense now"" and it's painful. It makes me angry. Has anyone else experienced this? How can I stop thinking about this? How can I stop being angry over it?",29Jun2020,4
911,"I own a discord server. If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be a confessional. People submit secrets through a Google form and they're sent to a specific channel.

People lie and make up fake stories that are clearly unbelievable, and while we do have a fair share of mods we can't moderate the submissions 24/7. We also can't use a bot, seeing as some submissions only a human can tell if it's a troll.

918,"For background: I \[F24\] am white, born to white parents, but in an incredibly hispanic area region of the US. Neither of my parents are from that region, but have lived there for the past 30+ years. I saw my extended family (midwest/southern US) at most once per year, so although I love them, I don't feel particularly close to them. I actually have a very hard time relating to them culturally, politically, religiously.

From the time I was a few months old, though, I was babysat by an older hispanic woman (was in her late 60s when she started babysitting me). I spent every day, 7AM-6PM (or just after school when I started school) along with the occasional overnights when my parents went out of town, in her home with her, her family, and around 3 other children she babysat. I ate her food, played with her grandchildren and great grandchildren, watched her telenovelas. I spent nights and weekends with parents who were exhausted from working 60 hour weeks, so I truly feel like I spent my childhood and was raised in her household.

She looked after me like this until I started high school, and since then I've regularly visited her. I know all of her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. She gives me birthday and Christmas gifts. She makes tamales for my family on Christmas. I 100% consider her my grandmother. I love her to death, and I know she loves me like her real family, too.

My issue is with my identity now, though. I've moved to a predominantly white area, and I feel so out of place. I don't feel like I culturally relate to my coworkers or my boyfriend who I met after moving here. I grew up and lived in what seems like a totally different place with different art, food, music, and tv for 23 years. Even some of the language is different. Like it took me a week to figure out what to call a hair-tie/elastic (I grew up calling it a chongo).

I don't feel like I have a right to identify with any of the things/people I was raised with, though. I just don't know what/who I am or where I belong anymore.",29Jun2020,2
919,"ok so a little bit of background/reason why I'm quitting...

I'm 25(f).I started in January, the job was advertised as 6months training with a review for a further 6months but no guarantee of a job after that. I'd just done a 6months course in college before starting and left because I found a great opportunity or what I thought was anyway. So during my 6months there has been no feed back on how I'm doing/getting on so I kinda feel like I've just been floating by this whole time/covering sickdays and used wherever possible. I've worked since I was 16 so new work environments and training isn't something new to me but I honestly feel like this place just isn't right for me in anyway at all.from the moment I started I felt like I couldn't be me.and have to have a whole other persona just to fit in  and the thought of having to go another 6months is giving me so much anxiety. So recently it passed my 6 months of being there and still no word from management if I was staying on for a further 6m. So instead I've spoken to them today and said I want to go back to college (which is a lie I just didn't have the balls to tell them I want to leave, especially since I don't have another job lined up). My partner has been super supportive and we can afford for me to take time out and he would rather see me be happy than go there and be miserable. But now I'm home I am freakinnnng out second guessing if I've done the right thing.

I'm doubting that at the age I am is it acceptable to leave your  job because you don't like it or am I right to put my happiness first???

920,"How do I forgive myself for past actions and move forward?

Hello. I have never been good with making friends, so in the past, I would change my political opinions to impress whoever I could. I would also be an extreme doormat and take bullying and abuse from people as long as they would “be my friend”. I have developmental delays in my eyes and motor skills, and I strongly suspect I have some form of Autism. I can’t make eye contact with people, nor can I truly “connect” with others. I was bullied heavily throughout my entire childhood and made fun of being underweight and strange.

I have realized over the course of quarantine that I spend most of my time by myself. I have become concerned about the fact that I don’t really have a close friend group. I don’t really have anyone to play with or interact with in quarantine. I do have a small friend group I am apart of, but I’m not close to them.
I want to make friends and be active online, but I’m afraid about opening up to others. 

Recently, I have had intrusive thoughts about being evil and disgusting because of my “cringy” and problematic actions as a teenager and young adult. I’m afraid people are going to make fun of me or hunt me down or something. Pretty much I have a fear of people bullying me again. I also am scared of politics because people will disagree with me no matter what. I want to chose the “right opinions” and be the best person possible. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I know I should see a therapist, but it isn’t possible at this moment. I need to stop hating myself for every fiber of my being.",29Jun2020,2
921,"I'm 26 right now. I graduated 3 years ago from university with a master's in applied business economics (specialty: corporate finance). And I absolutely hate the work I'm qualified for. I feel if I would get the opportunity to choose again I'd go for medicine, law (to practice criminal law), psychology (to become a researcher), animation, or visual design.

I can't go back to school because I can't pay for it. Fortunately, I have no debt because I live in a country in Europe where education is heavily subsidized. However, you only get one chance to study something that the government pays for. After you've gotten your degree you're on your own. I don't live with my parents anymore. I can't move back in with them either. Nor do I have enough savings to embark on such a risky endeavor.

Back when I was 18, I made the choice to get a business degree because my mom really wanted me to go to uni. Her reasoning: I was smart enough. So I wasn't allowed to go to college. Because she deemed it much too easy. She would always tell me: ""After you get your university degree, you can still study and become anything you want"". What a big fat lie. But I believed her, so I compliantly trodded on and didn't even look at the degrees I could pursue at college

I didn't study medicine because I was too insecure about my own intelligence. And I didn't study law because I thought we already had too many lawyers, and it would be difficult for me to get a job. I didn't study psychology because I thought it was too easy (insecure as I was, I was still quite arrogant and took pride in the fact that I was quite good at mathematics) and I also thought it'd be too difficult to get a job. Which is not true of course, everyone's depressed these days...

I'm also the first in my family to ever go to uni, so I didn't have anyone that I could ask for advice. Am I making the right choice? Are my assumptions about other degrees correct? What is office work like in a business? Am I actually become ""rich"" with an economics degree. No one knew.

Everyone just cheered me on and was so happy and proud of me that I was going to make it big, become ""rich"". Because that's what people get when they go to uni, according to my family. After 5 years of really hard work, because the degree I currently have, wasn't a walk in the park. It's not some general masters' in business administration. I end up realizing that it was all for nothing. I hate capitalism. I hate businesses. I hate their insatiable need for growth. I hate working to make someone else rich and successful. I hate the menial tasks everyone in a company does to keep the company running. Be it HR, marketing, finance, IT, or sales. What actual value are you actually creating if it's not to make the owner/shareholders richer? You might learn a thing here and there. But at the end of the day, you're mostly doing the same monotonous job. You're not helping anyone, saving anyone's life, making a piece of art, furthering scientific knowledge, helping the planet. You're enabling a system that is poisoning both our planet and its people.

I don't see myself working for the government because of its bureaucracy. Nor do I see myself working for an NGO because my skillset would again limit me to the classic business departments of an organization.

I'm taking a visual design evening course next school year. It won't open that many doors for me. Oh well. It's something. Might make me overthink everything less.

If only I could go back in time and choose something less ""businessy"".

How do I accept this? And get rid of all this regret. I'm quite unhappy.

So a week later, today, she asks me if I have a minute and asks me to step into the hall. She asks if I can cover the front desk at the end of next month.

But he got very aggressive at times and almost drove me crazy since i got used to him being obedient and all. 

I started getting panic attacks sometimes when he just wouldn't stop biting, jumping, growling and barking at me. All my brain can think right now is ""its gonna be like this for the next 15-20 years"" i know its probably going to get better over time with right training routines but at times my brain just jumps to those dark places and just goes ""but if it not"", since we have gone to professional dog trainer and nothing seems to help.

Im not sure if im in the right mindset to even have a dog right now since my thoughts keeps changing so rapidly about this subject.

I was wondering if anyone on here knew anything about what I’m talking about or could give some advice maybe? I was thinking maybe trying fertilizing pills sometime in the near future?

So I graduated middle school few months ago and had big exams we here, in Poland, write after we pass middle school.

Attending to school I, of course, found some visually appealing girls. 

And now this is where it gets dumb, I saw one of them while being passenger in a car, she gave me a LONG glance. The ""she's about to cross pedestrian crossing and has her head turned 160 degrees to the wrong side so it's very obvious"" kind of glance.

Maybe she just likes you physically, what's the problem? I'm 18 turning 19 in November and as far as I know she's 15, maybe 16. And although I know that it's objectively bad idea to even invite her on Facebook I still can't help but think about it from time to time. I am aware that it'd look very bad, maybe a bit incel-y like?

934,"I was basically a house slave. I had to spend all day studying, doing homework, cooking and doing chores because my lazy biological mother couldn't even bother to clean a table. She neglected me, she earned good money but she never bought clothes for me and she used to beat me if I lowered my 4.5 GPA. 

I was a slave, I never went out with friends, I barely made them and I didn't have time to follow my passions like all teens do. But now that I'm an adult I don't have any freedom because I have to spend all day working, and if I want to study something I have to choose between my passions or a career.

So, I'm 22, I've been working 70 hours the last years to make ends meet and I'm afraid to start a career. I know I can't live on the 40 hours minimun wage forever, and the only reason I want to have a career is so I can afford nice things. 

But if I go university while working I feel I'll spend the next 7 years frustrated again, studying all day without doing anything else so I get a chance to earn more than the minimun wage.

But I'll be in my 30's when I graduate and I don't want to start doing what I've always wanted to in my 30's: dating, making friends, having hobbies and passions...

935,I have always saved my money. To the point that I safe every single pound of Christmas money in a savings account all of amounted to more than £2000 but for once I put some money apart to buy myself a mousepad (my mousepad is a mess) the mousepad I have been looking at costs £15 (The money I put aside was like 200 or more) I am 14 years old and I don’t think wanting to buy myself something when I haven’t gotten anything for myself in more than a year is unreasonable What should I also have no control of my savings even though by law. I am allowed to have control of it. What should I do,29Jun2020,1
936,"I need somewhere to talk about this because it's eating me alive and I just have to know other people's perspective. I'd like to just get straight to the point but I feel like you really need to know some context beforehand. 

I grew up with a fairly normal childhood, I was a single child to a middle-class family. I'm very socially awkward and I get a lot of social anxiety. I tend to learn things later than usual such as riding a bike and driving a car age-wise I mean. I've never really had a lot of friends and the ones I did have I never felt that close to maybe you can relate I don't know.

When I was nine I moved for the first time it wasn't super far only about an hour and a half away from my previous home but it was far enough away that I had to leave my school and all my friends behind and start over. I'm sure a lot of you have experienced this and as a young child it's not the greatest thing. I was essentially moving from a small but humble town to a country lifestyle where my nearest neighbor was half a mile away.

That first year was pretty hard having no friends being in a new place and a new school but it's something that people overcome and deal with all the time. Then when I was 10 I met him for the first time on the school bus. I remember it very vividly he was just as shy as I was maybe even more so. Eventually I noticed that he had brought Pokemon cards with him and so I gathered up the courage to ask him about them. Little did I know this would begin one of the best parts of my life and provide me with what I still consider my closest friend.

The best part was he was my neighbor he only lived a half mile away and so he would come over to my house basically every weekend. We would play video games, we would watch cartoons, we would play with our trading cards Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, we would go fishing in my pond and swimming and lots of other things too. When YouTube came around we even fooled around and made some homemade videos of skits and skateboarding which we were in to at the time. We did a lot of things together some of which I remember fondly and other things I regret doing because we were dumb teenagers. Those 8 or so years I still consider the highlight of my life.

When I was 19 me and him both got a job at my dad's workplace. It was a very physically demanding and dirty job but having him there made it a lot easier. I worked there for about a year before having to quit. Without realizing it that job had exposed and strengthened a mental condition of mine. I had developed a pretty strong case of OCD. For years it ruined and controlled my life. I spent over 12 hours a day arranging and cleaning items in my house and I wouldn't allow anyone to come over including my friend. 

Eventually he too would quit that job and he decided to move so that his then girlfriend would be closer to her college. Needless to say I was pretty broken up about it I didn't want my best friend to move away and I did tell him that and he did get emotional but he also said that he would still visit often.

For many years my OCD kicked my ass. I don't know why I didn't seek help earlier I guess it was a combination of being stubborn and wanting to overcome it myself along with feeling like nothing could help me. By this time I'd also become very very depressed. As my OCD and depression got worse my desire to be with or visit my friend lessened. I think I also blamed him for moving away which I realize now is not that healthy.

From age 19 to 28 for those nine years we still stayed in contact through online Messengers and he did visit me two or three times but my relationship with him was never the same. I consider it both of our faults more so mine. It had now been longer that we had been apart and not close friends anymore than we were even friends to begin with. It felt like we were different people and like I didn't really know him anymore and it became awkward to begin a conversation with him. 

Finally at age 28 my OCD and depression had gotten so bad that I was considering suicide. Finally I had considered seeking help medically. Long story short I went to a behavioral therapy place for a year and receive counseling as well as medication that I still take. the OCD has lessened greatly and I feel like I can live my life now although the depression is still there even with antidepressants. I've tried three or four different ones at this point and none seem to work. This is still an ongoing process I'm trying to find a solution for.

When I was 29 and in the middle of my rehabilitation so to speak and things were going well I began to make contact with my friend once again through discord. We talked a bit about the old times what we used to do and games we used to be into and we made plans to hang out again in the future. He was well aware of my situation and I was basically using my depression as an excuse to not hang out with him. I think really though I was just scared that if I went there and we didn't hit it off like the old times it was like my friend was really gone whereas now I can still cling to that hope.

So finally we are at present day. I can finally tell you what happened. You see my friend wasn't devoid of his own problems. He had become somewhat of an alcoholic to deal with his own depression which I didn't even know he had because he never told me until that very last conversation we had on discord. If I had known earlier I would have told him to seek help the way I did because it was working for me.

One random day a few months ago now I received a call from my mother. She told me she did receive some news on Facebook about my friend. He was driving home late one night and he had a head-on collision with another vehicle. I was totally stunned I mean you hear about these kinds of things happening to other people all the time but you never really think it's going to happen to you or someone you know. Apparently he was in the hospital and he had a few broken bones but he was going to be fine physically. The problem is the people in the other vehicle, an elderly gentleman and his son were both killed. The other major problem was his blood alcohol level which was a 0.7 whereas the legal limit is 0.8.

A week or two after the accident he was allowed to go home. He was still recovering but he was allowed to be with his family. We had one more discord conversation which to this day is still the last time I talked to him. He told me that the experience was very eye-opening and that he was going to moving forward be a very different better person. He was going to get help about his alcoholism. I expressed my concern for him because I know how much something like this can mentally torture you. I'm sure he was filled with guilt for his actions.

Not long after that conversation he was visited by the police who took him away. All I really know is stuff that you can find online about the incident I've been too scared and shy to talk to his family about this. From what I know the state is charging him as if he had a 0.8 blood alcohol level because apparently they were going off of what he had at the time of the accident and not what he had during the actual test and so they think that it had gone down.

It's of my understanding he's going to be charged with two counts of vehicular manslaughter and could face upwards of 20-plus years in prison. To be honest even now typing this all out it doesn't feel real. So many things going through my head so many what-ifs and so much regret of not spending more time with him.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story you totally didn't have to and yet you did. I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for from people. Whether it's sympathy, or advice, or something else entirely. All I know is my best friend is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. Should I try to move on make other friends put the pain aside or should I try and maintain contact with him? I really don't know both options feel like the wrong choice.",29Jun2020,3
937,I'm a 36 year old male and to begin: I started a job today that I honestly had no business trying due to social issues and anxiety. I left by my first break because I was mentally breaking down.

I have no education (dropped out and got my GED.) No skills of any kind and I have learning issues so going to school isn't really an option either.

938,"Throwaway account bc my brother is on here and I don't want him to ever find this

Wtf is wrong with him? He is currently 27 years old. He graduated college with a 4.0 GPA in 2015, went back for his masters (without telling my parents and also made them pay for it) and finished that in 2017. Even when he was younger, he has had a history of wasting my parent's money. Then he took 2 years off, and did absolutely nothing with his time. He stayed inside, refused to find a job, played lots of video games, slept a lot, never talked to any of us in the family, and also seemed to cut all ties from his friends. He has said many times he does not want to get married and he has also never had a girlfriend. He has stayed at home with my parents and still lives there now. He doesn't pay rent and still refuses to get a job. Starting in January of 2020, he decided to go back to school for a third degree and get another master's (not really necessary because he already has 2 degrees and got 4.0s for both of them). He actually got a loan for this one so thank god he's not wasting my parent's money for once. 

He is always rude. He is never nice to anybody and he is mean and bitter. He is an extreme germaphobe and refuses to talk to anybody in the house unless they stand 5 feet away from him. Whenever I even walk near him, he freaks out and goes into another room until I walk away. I haven't had a conversation with him in weeks, maybe even months, even though we live in the same house. He has an awful temper and absolutely loses his shit when anyone in the house makes any noise. We usually yell at him to shut up and calm down and that usually does the trick. He sits on his computer all day and when he's not doing that he locks himself in his room. He always thinks he's right about everything, and when he rarely does converse with other family members, he usually turns it into an argument. He has no sense of empathy and he is extremely isolated. He is also a very reckless spender. He logs onto the family amazon account and purchases at least $400 worth of things every single month with my mom's credit card without telling her. I know this because the account is in my email and I get every notification about it. My parents yell at him but never do anything else. They pretty much coddle him and enable all of his weird behavior. Conversely, they are incredibly critical and strict with me, while they allow all of these ridiculous behaviors pass when it comes to my brother. Not fair. 

Furthermore, he claims that his fingers ""tingle"" all the time. He has been on the keto diet for a couple years now, and so all he eats is cheese, peanuts, and chocolate, and he also takes countless vitamins everyday. He is too scared to go on walks outside due to germs so he paces back in forth in the house in a dark room instead. He is definitely a hypochondriac and constantly complains about some new problem with his body every week. However, since he is too old to be counted as a dependent on my parents' health insurance, he has stopped making his various requests to go to different types of doctors but still refuses to get a job to pay for his own insurance. 

My mother has implored him to seek therapy and even offered to pay for all of it but when she brought the idea up to him, he ran away (no joke) and locked himself in his room. I think he might be slightly autistic but I am not sure since I'm not him. He used to talk to me but now he doesn't even do that. He only communicates with me by text, even if I'm in the other room, and he often texts me rude things for no reason. At this point, I don't even see him as part of the family and I have lost all respect for him because of how rude he is to me and everyone else around him. 

I want to help him but he makes it impossible to get near him. As his younger sister I'm obviously very concerned but I have no idea what to do. I go back and forth about caring about him and not giving a fuck because he is constantly rude to me at all times. But at other times I wonder if there is actually something wrong with his mental health which means he cant help acting this way?? What is wrong with him????? Any and all opinions are appreciated. Thanks in advance",29Jun2020,5
939,"My friends and I (all 16, both male and female) have been planning a week-long trip to France over this summer for the past four months. We were planning to go to a region with not many coronavirus cases and were prepared to take all the necessary precautions and such. Our borders have also opened and that little spike has also gone down. We all will also quarantine ourselves when coming back.

They put the trip under two conditions: 1) a girl other than me would go (which I took care of), and 2) I need to pass. Due to all the chaos during online school and such, some of my final grades weren't very good. And these grades are important as I need to apply to university next year with these grades. I barely passed math and failed biology. For that I will need to take a retake exam in August. However, I technically did pass the year, I did well on the other 5 subjects, and I actually don't need to take this exam as at the very end of next year everything depends on credits and other assignments as well. I just have to work harder to pass next year. But I was planning on doing that anyways. I also am part of the ""student council"" and play badminton regularly, so it's not like I'm a total failure academically. 

But they now claim that it had to be a certain average, which isn't what I agreed to. They now won't let me go and even canceled my ticket. I spent the whole day crying yesterday because now all my friends are going without me and I'll be stuck here for the whole summer. I already know that I'm going to be incredibly sad, lonely, and terrified (as the next year is incredibly daunting, with half of the deadlines due before 2020 even ends). 

I have been looking forward to this trip. I have a horrid relationship with my family, and it's important for me to leave to regain some mental peace once more. There's fighting at home and general negativity all the time. They constantly ruin my happiness and crush my self-esteem. I am depressed and have had really bad anxiety for a couple months now due to stress of finals and socially-related stuff. I probably would have run away or killed myself a long time ago if it weren't for the fact I need my father's money for another year at my private school so I can get into a good university and never contact them again. I believe I'll be much better without them in my life.

So, as you can see, it is crucial for me to just enjoy myself with my friends and be alone for a bit, for just once. My parents, however, don't believe I have depression. They invalidate my feelings and make me feel worse than I already do, so they don't understand for why I need this, no matter how much I try to talk openly about it with them. Right now I need to be with the people that actually seem to care and love me and want to see me succeed than be trapped here in this horrid ""home"".

I worked so hard for this. It took me a lot of pain to get the motivation to even read and bring myself to go to school and take the exams. My friends and I don't know what else we can do to convince them. I think it's super unfair of them to do this; they could have picked a different punishment for me. They already control much of what I do and I require my electronics heavily, but I'm sure they can find something else to make me feel miserable.

Any advice on what to do or how to convince them to let me go?

I have a friend who is 28 with a borderline personality disorder. She self harms and has tried to commit suicide multiple times. One time she left a note, and her family was calling people. She went to the Golden Gate Bridge. We immediately called the police and gave a description. She sent us vague texts when we asked if she was okay. 



Then she was calling us hysterical complaining about life and her job. Her family, like mom and sister, were trying to call. My friend said we should stay on the phone with her and coax her out as long as possible.
It was traumatizing for me, I felt kind of guilt-tripped and manipulated when before we were trying to get her to therapy, but she refused. She's tried to commit suicide two times in one in half years. What is the best way to handle a suicidal person like this? Was my friend, right?",29Jun2020,2

Normally I would’ve let it slide but then I noticed my bags and backpack were moved around and opened. Some of my money was also missing (about 40 pesos which is about $1.74 as of writing this) not really all that money to get upset about but still that’s wrong. I know he’s a little kid and he probably didn’t know better but there was no reason he should’ve been looking through my bags and in my room without telling me.

I had a half sister who left me when I was 2 to get away from her dad who is also my dad, and then my mom needed a break and went away for a few months, my life was hell, I tried to lie to teachers to get through assignments and get candy or to just get out of something. When they left I was angry it was hard to be happy in a situation where your with someone toxic.

Fast forward to middle school I'm homeschooled my mom came back atleast so thiers that but I'm forced into a very cult like religion who will ostracize you when you leave or even think about leaving, and then I'm in highschool as cliche as it sounds I was great at being annoying in a fun way and seeming happy but I had no one.

I planned on commiting suicide but could never do it, up to this point I had no friends, you weren't allowed to socialize with anyone out side of the religion I was alone, my second year of highschool almost caused a car wreck by walking in the highway when I got home I went to something like Omegle and met someone.

Naturally, we both connected with other students around the world who will be attending the school as well. We have met several people and even have our own group chats. 

However, one guy really stood out to me. I’ll call him Leo (not his actual name). I have never met Leo, but he and I connected online through Instagram a few months ago. I don’t know why, but I feel a strange attraction to him and I don’t know what to do.

Leo is not insanely gorgeous or anything, but I just feel drawn to him, and I have no idea why. We are both going into engineering, and we have a shared love of the Marvel Universe, but that’s pretty much all we have in common. However, we engage in conversation somewhat often (about every other day or so) on Snapchat. He hasn’t flirted with me and doesn’t answer me immediately sometimes, so I know he’s not interested in me. 

I love my boyfriend very much. Ever since I’ve been with him, I never looked at or thought about another guy, nor have I been attracted to anyone else, even though several have tried to get my attention. That being said, this startling attraction to Leo is weird to me, and I feel horrible about it. I’ve tried waiting it out for a month now, but it’s not going away. 

My boyfriend is the only guy in my heart, but he’s not the only guy on my mind. I’m worried about what this means of my relationship, and where to go from here. Is this cheating? Should I feel guilty? What do I do? Any advice would be great. Thank you. 

TL;DR: I have a small crush on another guy, but still love my boyfriend very much. I’ve never been attracted to anyone but my boyfriend, so this is weird. I feel horrible, and I’m not sure what to do about this.",29Jun2020,1
961,"So I was sexually abused as a child by a family member and am finally at a point where i think seeking help would be a good idea. But I'm 21 and still on my moms insurance. So I dont know how to go about asking for her help finding a therapist covered under our insurance  without telling her why I'm seeking therapy. Before anybody comments saying that i should talk to.her about the actual reason, I'm sure i will at some point but I'm not ready to do so at the moment. Nobody in my family knows about the abuse and my abuser is deceased now so I see no reason to change that until I'm ready which I hope therapy can help with.",29Jun2020,1
962,"I just found out my dad has another family in my neighboring country.

Today I woke up to an email from a lady (not her real name) Tina with a picture of her and her my father asking me if I know the man in the picture. She says she is his daughter.

Obviously I haven't answered yet but I had to show my mother, she was devastated. Apparently 2 years before I was born my father was sent out to the border for deployment and had a love child with a woman from a small village.

&amp;#x200B;

He came back 9 months before I was born an about 5 months into my mothers' pregnancy he left and said he had to go back because you know the army.

I was born and I never saw him until I was two years old and since then he only comes back for 1 or 2 months every year since then, never helps my mum, complains every time he comes home,

Should I accept tina  I don't want to be the bad guy?

So back to the top, I asked him if all this is true but he acts like I am crazy. I just sent him the photo and I will update as soon as I get a response.

963,"I hope for general advice and arguments against his weird behaviour...

So I (22) live with my boyfriend (30). He is a 6""7, bulky guy with a lot of tattoos and he is bold. He often makes jokes about his apperiance. Like he said if he ever has a daughter and brings her to the playground, people would think of him as a ""weird man"" watching children. Or that in a supermarket elderly women would take a step back when they see him. He is very proud of himself tho and doesn't give a **** about what people think of him.

But the way he talks hurts me. Whenever there is a casheer, a coworker or any kind of woman crossing his way, he later tells me ""there was this chick that..."" or ""today I saw this cow."" 
I corrected him a million times with ""you mean a woman"" but he doesnt seem to care.
Some months ago I got a new coworker I really liked. She was sporty and extroverted. She had dark skin. My boyfriend and I met her once doing groceries and later in the car he flat out told me (and later also his brother) that my new coworker is a cute ""chocolate cookie"". I hated that.
Today we spoke about a friend of mine (25) who got a son when she was just 16. She moved and we helped her, together with a male friend of hers. Despite being sure they are just friends, he asked her to ""spend the night"" after we finished moving and they placed her bed. She was hurt by this and called me today to talk.
My boyfriend hurt some bits and pieces and asked why she is such a slut. And how she ""must have known men want a kind of payment when they help a slut moving"" and how he ""would freak out if he helped a chick moving and later she would just offer a cold beer""

I took some private time after this conversation coz it hurt me deeply. Then I asked him for a talk. I told him to PLEASE evaluate his way of treating/talking about women coz it hurts me. I told him I am JUST like my friend coz I asked male friends for help before and never wanted them to stay the night. He said I am differend coz he loves me. I think thats a shitty excuse. He then said in a fake crying voice that he is hurt people are afraid of him and people back away when he comes along. And that he really hopes next time a chick will hold doors open for him...


Any arguments? I just signed a contract that I will stay in our shared flat / pay rent for the next year (til May 2021) ... how do I solve this without just running away? :/",29Jun2020,1
964,"Background: So my mom has been talking to my girlfriends dad every since she moved here originally they met at the store and he was asking for her number and eventually her facebook which he then saw she had the same last name and even asked to which she told him that I'm her son he got even more flirty and asked her out multiple times a week this has been going on for 6 months
So with all that being said my girlfriend and her dad dont have a good relationship she left his house and blocked him multiple times and even a restraining order (but it was lifted a couple months ago)because hes mentally abusive and is an alcoholic with a bad temper,that happened a year ago and my mom knows all of this 
 Shes also has told me she doesnt want me with her and has said she dont like her which we faught over yesterday

So fast forward to today he asked her out again and she had said yes she spent the morning getting ready and putting on makeup we asked her multiple times who it was but she wouldnt answer us,she had finally told me shes going out with him to which I got super pissed,and not long ago he told her sister that's hes only going for my mom to make her upset to which I told her,she kept arguing about how she doesnt even like him and they're only friends and shes only doing it because shes bored and lonely,what should I do?

967,"I’m applying for dental schools right now in Texas, and since the schools mostly accept residents, my parents decided to buy property in Texas. They did this because Texas schools are 1/2 to 1/4 the cost of other schools. However, the decision was made too quickly, and since there is more nuance to residency determination, I have listed myself as a non-resident rather than claiming residency. I did this because if I claim residency and do not get it, I most likely will not get into my state school. My parents do not know that I put myself down as a nonresident, and are curious whether I will receive it.

What should I do? I feel bad that they decided to make a commitment in buying property inTexas without being ensured that I would receive residency, but I feel like it would be disappointing to just tell them that I didn’t bother with trying.",29Jun2020,1
968,"When I was a young teen I was with this dude (same age) for years and it was one of the worst times of my life. Idk how to sugarcoat it, he was emotionally and sexually abusive. I know we were young and he probably didn't even realise what he was doing exactly and he's probably changed now and all that but he still did what he did. 

We used to hang out with this friend too but she didn't really know everything that was going on because outwardly we swore everything was okay despite very public and drama filled arguments and other things.

Anyway, the point. Fast forward like a decade and we're in our twenties. Haven't seen or spoken to either of them in years. She gets back in touch with me and few of our friends. Cool. I like being back in touch, I've missed her. Few months later, her and her long term bf have split. She's seeing a mystery guy. 

She asks me why our friends and I always trash talk this dude. She tells me she's seeing him and asks me if I'd share what happened. I sent her a long and vulnerable text including certain things I'd never told anyone. She thanks me for letting her know, swears he's changed and also mentioned she'd been seeing him previously when we weren't talking. A few more months and they're living together during lockdown.

When she told me at the beginning, I said I hope she can be happy with him and I hope he'd changed and stuff but the longer it's been the longer I realise I'm not actually okay. It's hard for me to look at her the same and I'm dreading life after pandemic when we start hanging out again. It scares me that I might have to come face to face with him at events or parties. I feel like I'll never escape from him being in my orbit. 

I don't want to lose our reestablished friendship but I feel physically sick every time I'm reminded of the situation. I feel selfish for not just being okay with it. How do I be okay with it?

I'll put this into groups, mainly consisting of time periods.

I'm going to have to explain my past so you can have a better understanding of my situation.

People - Me, Girl #1 (problem), Girl #2, Guy #1 (not so much of a problem but still somewhat of a problem) Guy #2, Guy #3. Online Girl. We'll call her E-Girl. There are more friend in our posse, but they aren't important for this story.

\~2018\~

It's October, I found out Girl #1 liked me. She said if I didn't date her, she'd cry. Since I was a naive recently turned 13 year old, I was upset, and said maybe. She assumed we were dating anyway.

She was physically abusive, But I didn't think too much about it, even though it hurt like hell when she slapped me constantly.

We broke up in December 2018.

\~2019\~

January, Girl #1 is a mean bitch by then, and was talking behind our backs (Me and my friends). It was upsetting when she said fuck you to me, which no one had done before. Since I didn't want to be a burden to her, I started avoiding her. I got depressed because I thought se was superior ro me in every way.

March, I discover she cheated on me, Which broke me. She was into a girl she met online, (F17) I forgot she was bi-sexual. We were tired of her manipulating people, and toying with my feelings, and my then best friend, Guy #1 (They were dating a few weeks ago, at the time)

I wasn't familiar with the bi-sexual, transgender stuff, i was basically living in the 90's, because the Bahamas doesn't have many of those people. I actually didn't know what ""gay"" meant until Seventh Grade. So having a girl cheat on me with a girl HURT.

We kicked her out of our posse, which then made a chain reaction. The guidance counselor was involved, eventually. I spent the next 1 1/2 years hating her guts.

\~Ninth Grade\~

September 2019, Hurricane Dorian killed our Island, Grand Bahama, the storm was a Catagory 5, and it sat on top of us for 2 entire days. It wiped out half of Abaco, LITERALLY, and Grand Bahama lost alot of property. My dad works pretty high in the one University there, and It was completely destroyed.

After 3 weeks or so, We went back to school.

There was a new kid, who we all quickly befriended. He was cool, and he was into Girl #1. We all warned him about how Girl #1 kill manipulate his feelings. He didn't care. Well, They dated for a day, The new kid like her ALOT, and Girl #1 was sending hearts and stuff, but she dropped him like a napkin at the end of the day. We told him so. Now, HE hated Girl #1.

He got over it though, and Girl #1 gives him a very, VERY important note. I asked what it was about.

Girl #1 was a furry. I cried. Alot. Now, I strongly dislike furries. They freak me the hell out. And, alot of them are twisted people. I'm not saying everyone is bad, but I just don't like what they do. Now, this girl had the NERVE, to not tell me this, cheat on me with some girl online, and FUCK ME UP MENTALLY? Hell no, I was done.

I now live with the label ""My First Girlfriend was a Furry"" :\]

My friends and I decided that Girl #1 was manipulating people constantly, so no one should date her, ever. I'm permanently scarred from the events, but my friends are too insensitive to care, other than Girl #2.

October, Girl #2 likes me, which didn't surprise me. We didn't date, for some reason.

November 2019, Girl #1 likes me, which makes me super mad. For the last 6 months, she didn't understand why I hated her guts, which angered me even more. How could this daft, spineless bitch not realize that I disliked her..?

December 2019, Girl #1 has a dream about strangling me to death in a blank room. Since I was a naïve 14 year old boy who was kinda abused by this girl, who also watched her beat the shit out of my male best friend, I freaked the HELL out. She said she would actually do it if she was mad enough, and she's a trigger happy person, who's kind of an idiot. I had a plan to be as nice as possible to her, which worked.

Too well.

She liked me again, so she gave me a love letter, which I said maybe to because I was scared if I declined she was gonna fuck me up. She immediately asked for a hug anyway, and since i like me some hugs, I did it. She then assumes we're dating.

She goes to America the next day to shop so I get Girl #2 to tell her that I'm not dating her. 

\~2020\~

Guy #1 left the school.

January 3rd, 2020, I rage in my Eighth Journal, about Girl #1 and how I liked Girl #2, but then it just hit me outta nowhere. It was useless to hate Girl #1. Everyone likes Girl #1, no matter how insane she is, and whenever she likes someone, the person she likes gets sucked in, and raped of happiness. I was hurting myself mentally by hating her. I was so hellbent on not falling into the hole again, and thinking about how someone could do such an awful thing. At that point, for my mental health, I stopped hating her, and decided to ignore all the shit she pulled, and pulls from then on, like every one in the school.

February 10th, 2020 - March 12th 2020, I decided to date Girl #1, so there'll be no more people getting upset and manipulated. I also did it to make it a little easier to live in this school. She instantly accepted my fake love letter and we dated. She was the same as ever. Quirky, making dog noises.. (yeah. She's insane.), and being very loving towards me. I also got titties and thighs, which I enjoyed. In the back of my head I always knew, ""This is fucked up"". I started liking her too, I was falling in the hole. This was an in and out mission. All of my friends were in on it, but It worked so well, that everyone forgot that this was a setup. I also kinda forgot too. She was really nice, I lied on her lap everyday. I had my arm around her waist. It was heaven, in hell. *I was so tired. And I was so upset with myself too...*

There was something I forgot though, Girl #2, which I still really liked. She was BROKEN. This was 10 days after my in and out mission. I cried alot when I realized she wasn't talking to anyone, since February 10th. I did this to help myself not get mentally fucked but I forgot my closet friend.

I approached her and we made up.

Then things got \*complicated.

I technically had two ladies, which was bad, so Me and Girl #2 had stopped 3 day later, agreeing that it was bad.

I couldn't risk getting fucked up again if she was cheating on me again. I always kept that in mind. It scared me. I also told Girl #2 it scared me. I broke up with her on March 20th.

She cried alot, but I didn't see because I was hiding, I couldn't watch what I just did. I explained that If this goes on any further, and Corona hits, the separation will hurt her alot, so I cut this quick. She said she knew this was coming, but not this early..

Corona slams our country 5 days later. We just had Dorian, the worst hurricane in a FUCKING CENTURY, and got Corona in a tourism based country.

Our country's fucked.

April 2020, Me and Girl #2 text forever. I discover that Girl #2 actually cared about me VERY much, and loved me.. I die on the inside. One night I go Ace Attorney and slam her with allegations of her mental health and it's all true. She's desperate for someone to love her, and she was extremely depressed that it just, well, ENDED. I hit her so hard with facts, that she cried somewhere. It was around 2am, so I went to bed.

I'm moving to a new school in September.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Now\~

Now It's time to talk current issues. I've grown, and I'm a more mature person now. I make sure to look at the entire picture. Since my relationship with Girl #1, It changed my entire perspective on life. I'm not as happy as I used to be, I curse alot more, and I'm hoping I can make friends in my new school.

I'm going to the same place that Girl #1 went before Eighth Grade. It's a big private school, it's basically my school, also a private school, but frickin huge (For Grand Bahama standards). I'm paranoid and scared ever since school ended this year. I'm praying that I get to meet real friends that respect me.

In my current school, while this thing was going on, I was ignored by every soul in the school. I once even sat in a corner in Language and I didn't get noticed until the end of the class. It destroyed my self esteem several times, and I'm scared that it'll happen again, and I don't know how I'm going to go on if it happens again? I'm in the fourth dimension, I'm the kid no one takes seriously and I have been since 6th grade.

If I get a girlfriend again, which may be the case, I'm fucking scared of the possibility that she'll manipulate me like Girl #1 did or even..... worse..... I don't think it's healthy to freak out constantly about the possibility of her ditching me, but I can't help it after this whole debacle.

Please give me some advice. That is, if anyone will bother to help me.. :\[ I'm vulnerable emotionally, currently...

971,"Hello, I have a question and I'm not really sure what sub it's for, so I'm posting on several subs.

My cousin is a 31 y/o guy (for reference, I'm 29 y/o guy). He had a few-month relationship with a girl about 8 years ago, but not any other relationship that we, as his family, know of. His brother is really close to him, and he doesn't know either. He broke up with that girl because ""she was too indecisive and doesn't know what she wants"" - they were, like, 23+/- at the time. Anyway, before that relationship and after it, he never wanted to talk about dating and relationships, he'd always deflect or bluntly say ""I don't want to talk about it"", or even lashed out ""why are you asking me? I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!"". He's usually very stubborn and is often very loud in discussions. He and I are not too distant, but neither too close. Most of our talks are about movies or TV shows, or food, cars, computers and other ""guy stuff"", but never about girls and relationships, because of the reasons above. We tried asking, several times, often very gently. I am in a very serious relationship, we are engaged. He met my girl, and I was hoping, enticed by my relationship and engagement, he might open himself a bit, but he didn't budge. Throughout my whole life, he's extremely emotionally closed.

We're all worried about him from that perspective, well, not *worried*, but curious. I, his cousin, am getting married, most of his friends are already married, the rest of his friends are in longer or shorter relationships, all pretty normal. But he, he lives as if that component doesn't exist in his life. (His brother is similar, but he's had a very serious relationship ~3 years ago. She moved far away and ended it because of the distance)

I talked to his mom and dad, and we don't know what to think. We thought doesn't he feel a need to connect with someone? Emotionally, mentally, physically? Sexually? Is he gay? Is he in the closet and can't admit to everybody he's gay? Maybe he can't admit to himself? But he never gave even slightest inclines towards guys. We thought, is he maybe asexual? A few years ago, I looked for (yeah, I know, privacy... But he doesn't know I did, and I never told anyone I did) and I found actually some porno images of girls on his PC, but very soft porn, i.e. only images of naked girls posing.

He and the whole family is one of those ""religious but not really practicing"" families (usual Texan...), and not closed, but also not open to someone being gay. I'm excluding myself because I'm the black sheep of the family as far as that goes, i.e. atheist, open-minded, accept everyone, ...

I tried once to introduce him to psychological therapies, more like counseling, to help him find out what he wants in life, but he completely ignored that, and I didn't want to push.

So what do you people think? Can someone shed some light on my cousin? Because we, the closest to him, are baffled. I mean, we leave him be, but we're curious since he's in his 30s and never had a meaningful relationship. I'm guessing he may still be a virgin. I mean that's ok. We're just curious. He's not ugly and he's not stupid, he *could* get a girlfriend (or a boyfriend). Could he just be very shy?

In other aspects of his life he's very friendly, very reliable and dependable, likes ""manly-guy"" stuff like cars and guns and such stuff (movies like Fast and furious and Transformers, ...). During Corona time he dug out our old Lego box and is reassembling Lego from childhood, says it's fun and he likes Lego.

Thanks for the long read. Turned out much longer than I planned.

**TL;DR** Cousin is 31, never had a meaningful relationship, very emotionally closed and refuses to talk about relationships. Family curious.",29Jun2020,1

974," 

I  am at crossroads in multiple areas of my middle-aged life and need some advice.  I am stuck and feel like packing a backpack and walking away  from everything.  Looking back I feel I made several missteps, but I'm not certain what I would could have done differently.

To sum it up what brings me to this point:

1. Employment.   I moved from another state for a contract position almost 4 years ago.  A few months after I arrived, employer insisted on me becoming an  employee and putting me in a new position, but with nearly a 40% pay cut  from my contractor rate.  They also wanted a multi-year agreement.   Because of extenuating circumstances (read further), I reluctantly  agreed.  While there have been raises, at the present time I estimate I  am earning about 20-30% less than peers in similar positions at other  companies based on salary surveys and open opportunities I have seen  posted.  I have had no success in negotiating a raise.  I also no longer  completely hold to the belief system that my co-workers do (it is a  faith based company).  I think I’d actually like to get out of the line  of work I’m doing completely, and go back to one of the other freelance  jobs I did before which, in retrospect, were much more rewarding both  from a personal and financial perspective.
2. Housing.   I currently rent from my employer at a reduced rate, but need to be  out by the end of the year.  The cost of housing here is about double  what it was at my previous location.  The original plan was to move here  and rent for a year, then purchase.  But housing prices 	have increased  at a faster rate than my pay, not to mention very high property tax  rates.  	While I now have an option to work remotely, I’m not sure I  want to stay with the company.  But if I don’t stay and go work for  someone else or go back to freelancing, any chances of getting a  mortgage are pretty much lost (both companies I am approved with now  require you to prove 2 years of employment with the same company).   Thought about just trying to buy a fixer-upper for cash just to be free  from the job even though it wouldn’t be exactly what we want.  We’d have  a bit more money for housing, but my savings efforts have been thwarted  by having to pay high deductibles for multiple surgeries over the past  few years. Anyhow, best we’ll be able to do is move at least 3 hours  from here or purchase a house in a crime ridden part of the inner city  around here.  We really don't want to rent again (we had owned two  houses prior to moving here, and as you can tell by what we've done  before for freelancing, they don't exactly work well in a rental  situation).  Which brings me to the last problem...
3. Elderly  Parents.  Part of the reason our family moved to this area was to try  to help out my parents who moved in this general vicinity, but in an rather affluent area.  Shortly after we arrived, mom had severe  complications due to surgery.  I don’t know what she would have done if  we weren’t here.  In the last year she has been diagnosed with multiple  heart problems and has issues with falling.  Dad has hypertension and  diabetic issues.  They really shouldn’t be staying on their own anymore.   We offered to purchase a side by side duplex a few hours away.  Dad is  adamantly against leaving their current house or area (he says mom can  do what she wants, but he’s not going anywhere) or going into assisted  living; and my mother’s “needs” for a new home are far and beyond what  is typically available on the market.  They have no other family in this  area, nor do I have any full brothers or sisters – my dad alienated his  other two children in various degrees years ago. My dad, who is  probably one of the most wounded souls I’ve ever met, says that if we leave, he may as well just end his life.  My parent’s marriage is not  healthy.  It would be very unwise for our family to move in with them  (hence the duplex idea to give them their own space).

976,My mom was fighting with my dad last week which is something they do all the time. Lately she has been taking her anger out on me. She always has but here recently it’s gotten worse. Treats me like a dog and makes faces and says sarcastic remarks. I bottle this up. Throughout the week I have been angry about it but have tried to move past it. She keeps on with making a face whenever something doesn’t go her way or generally acting like a shitty person. That’s when I start to do the same to her. I’ve had enough. Yesterday I was showing her how to do something and she got all pissy with me because I questioned what she had done. I fired back with if you would just listen to me in a rude tone. Well damn this set off a chain of events. She asks why I’ve been like this lol. Really? So I said it stemmed from last week. She said I was irritating her even though I said absolutely nothing the entire day. Zero. She goes off on a rant about how it’s weird I’ve been harboring anger towards her yet she keeps being a shithead to me. I’ve had a fine week except for the moments of her being rude to me. She tells me I’m going to have to leave the house if I can’t get along. Like wow I’m the one who is treating someone with disrespect please. She starts guilt tripping me and start telling me she doesn’t know where she’s gone wrong that I don’t love her and that I don’t appreciate the things that she’s done for me. Get this her apology was I’m sorry for every wrong I have ever done to you. I don’t know what to do I have one more semester of college. I guess I will just be a doormat for her and my father for the next six months until I get my education. Then I’m either joining the military or getting the fuck outta here some way.,29Jun2020,1
977,"Hey guys I couldn’t find what sub-reddit to post it on, but here seems as good as any. I just received a phone call from a no caller ID and upon picking it up (I know bad idea) it was my partner, after some confusion they explained that they had randomly received a phone call from no caller ID. This obviously confused me as I also received a phone call, they sounded sincere and honestly probably wouldn’t be able to pull a prank like that (also if it was a prank it wasn’t very well planned). Just wondering if anyone has any idea what could have happened?",29Jun2020,1
979,"Hey everyone, im seeking for advice on my personal life that would be greatly appreciative.

Im currently is kind of a gutter at the current moment in my life. As it stands, there is not a point in time where my mind is simply quiet, where i can just enjoy the moment and the opportunities that I have. I have a stable job in something that i love doing. I was lucky enough to be able to land where I did. Im currently studying in University for my bachelors which leads me to one of my points

I am constantly scared of not making it in life. I do not know where the wave is going to take me and what im going to end up doing. I dont know why im so worried and i question everything all the time. I do say that I used to prioritize other people's happiness over mine and ive been working for years to fix that issue, its like a roller coaster, sometimes i do sometimes i dont. 

Im a single child living with a mother who is going to retire soon, who herself has a bunch of regrets, and mistakes that she claims that she has made in her life. She cannot manage money well, she is very materialistic and i barely talk to her about my problems because i know what the response is going to be half the time, and it always turns into some sort of fight or argument. So really i see myself as being on my own right now, with the exception of my girlfriend that i love with all my heart and the great friends that surround me.

I also feel like my overthinking mindset is affecting my relationship. It's one of the worst things for me. Im always asking myself where we are going to be in the future, if i am too over obsessive, if i talk to her too often and dont give enough personal space. I just want this feeling where i can just enjoy what i currently have and stop being scared. My relationship is what means the most to me right now, but it's starting to scare me a little. I dont want to say that im setting aside my own personal goals, and what I want later in life, but thats the thing, i don't know what i want other than a House with a loving dog. 

I dont believe in people changing the way they are for others, i dont think its right, and so far between me and her, its been super wonderful. Were open, we talk to each other about our problems and we are super vocal about everything. I just dont want to destroy any of it because of the way that I am. I know i am young and i have the rest of my life ahead of me but at the same time, she is the one that I want to be with, and invest everything left that i have into our relationship being healthy, successful and everything that comes with a relationship.

Another issue that I have is wanting to do things but never really actioning them. I would love to get a car, i would love to buy a Property, i would love to own my dog as mentioned before, but as stated, in my mind there is always the ""What if"" question that appears that prevents me from doing those things.

At the end of the day, i do love my mom, she always was my mom and my dad at the same time, i love my girlfriend so so much, and ultimately, i am fighting myself. 

Im just tired of living in fear, anxiety and questioning. If you have made it this far in the post, thank you for taking the time to read this, and im wondering what the world has to offer as advice for me because, im really done. At the end of the day, i want to be everything my father was not, provide for my girlfriend and be there whenever she needs it, and develop myself, to reach my goals and dreams, but now is the time i want to lay all these things to rest.

Thanks guys, love you reddit.",29Jun2020,1
980,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I work at a FedEx as a CSA, in other words I am a customer service agent. I help people send out their packages and pick up packages that weren't delivered. I'm transferring out to a four-year and therefore had put in a ""notice"" that my last day would be toward the end of August. This ""notice"" was put in about a month and a half ago, so way ahead of time as things looked like they were going to go back into in-person classes. THOUGH, my school has notified me that I have the option of doing online, which I most likely will as I can save money that way from not having to dorm.

 The issue is, that I am tired of working at my facility, it hasn't been long but management is horrible. We are seriously understaffed so I am usually left by myself in front having to help 40+ people. They all get mad and use profanity because of wait times, as well as not being able to pick up packages. Since I am staying home at least for fall classes,  I want to look for another job in order to work until I have to move to school.

So I basically wanted Advice on what to do, should I just take at FedEx until my original departure date, or should I look for another job and put my two week notice in? Or would it be 'rude' to go from end of August to end of July?

983,"i (21F, almost 22) still live at home with my mom. for a little background: my dad was kind of a wild guy when he was younger, and he had some problems to work through, so my parents started trying for kids later in life. they were 40 when they had me— and i was kind of their miracle baby. growing up, i had a very weird relationship with my mom, while my dad and i were very close. my parents got divorced over money problems, but were still in love with each other and still saw each other a lot. fast forward to a week and a half before my 14th birthday— my dad, while riding his bike, got hit by a van and died on impact. as you can imagine, i have never been the same, and it had a huge negative impact on my life. 

the biggest one was, my mom is such a push-over when it comes to her family (she worked for the uncle in question for 30 years for very very little pay while he embezzled 90% of the funds for his lifestyle of expensive restaurants, multiple drug and alcohol addictions and spending money on his girlfriend, who eventually left him bc he was clearly fetishizing her as an asian woman.) so when my dad died, she just crumpled up like wet newspaper and let my uncle hang out with me whenever he wanted. well, in addition to fetishizing asian women, he also fetishizes lesbians, and at that point began expressing sexual interest in teenage girls. i was a 14 year old lesbian— i think you see where i’m going with this. he groomed me, abused me, sexually harassed me and inappropriately touched and slapped me every time he saw me. then he sold the family business so the IRS couldn’t get him on tax evasion for all the embezzling, and he gave my mom 5 grand. for 30 years of her doing all the work while he slept and did drugs (i do not demonize drug addicts as a rule, but he had every opportunity to get help, everyone tried to get him to go to rehab, he had the money, the time and he chose not to get better, because he enjoyed his lifestyle.) 

my mom, obviously, had no savings, so she let him come over our house 3-5 days per week for dinner, when he would bring her a little check ($200 out of the millions he had embezzled from the business, my grandfather’s estate, and my mom’s personal money. it barely covered the cost of how much food he would eat. he had millions of dollars in his bank account, to be clear.) they would get crossfaded together, and once my mom was fucked up enough, that was when it got really, really bad for me. he used to spend so much time telling me how i was ugly because i had gained weight bc of my depression, and i developed an eating disorder (the second of the four i would eventually have,) he would pick me up from my job (where i worked to try and help my mom pay the mortgage. 

i worked 30-35 hours per week, and never kept more than $20 of my paycheck,) and the whole ride home he would try and touch me, etc. etc. i won’t go into the years and years i spent living like this— i’ve been to therapy, i’ve been diagnosed with ptsd, and my whole family watched this happen and did nothing. then, there was a court case, where the company whose driver killed my dad had to pay out a big settlement. lo and behold, everyone started treating me much much better. i forgave my mom, because she’s my mom, but she’s chosen to forget everything my uncle did (that she let him do) to me. 

i share the money with her, because i think my parents probably would have gotten remarried, and she really did love him (and again, she is my mom.) but she’s been giving my uncle money for years because he blew all of the money he stole over 30 years and now is penniless. but this is the final straw— my whole family wants us to buy him a house, and i don’t know how to put my foot down without alienating my mom forever. everyone i really loved in my family (my dad and my grandparents, who helped to raise me bc my uncle refused to give my mom maternity leave and had basically no use for me until i was about 8,) is dead, and the rest of my relatives were just fine with my uncle abusing me, so long as the money train didn’t stop. 

i try really, really hard to be a good person, but i CAN’T forgive him, and i can’t do this. i did not grow up in a shack in the woods, where we often didn’t have enough food or even heat, so that i can blow 200 grand of dad’s blood money on a man who had every intention of raping me until i got “too fat to be sexy.” i don’t want to do this, but i don’t know how to say no. the only way i will agree is if he moves far, far away and i never have to see him again, but my mom will not agree— no matter how many times i beg and plead for her not to let him into our house, because every time i see him, i have ptsd flashbacks. any help or advice would be very much appreciated— also please do not say anything about how i deserved it, or it wasn’t that bad, etc. bc i will report you. i have been gaslit by my whole family on this issue, and i will not hear it from strangers. if you think i’m a bitch, keep it to yourself ❤️

984,"Hello everyone! First of all I just want to say that I’m only 14 years old and that I’m in 9th grade so I’m still young and I understand that I’m still young. So I hope you will understand this all because it’s a bit weird ngl. I’m a very shy person but when it comes to love I’m very open about it to my friends, so it’s a bit weird but in the past 2 years I had a crush on around 4-5 people, this is a lot, I know that, i can’t really help it and it’s not just that I think that girl looks hot or something, but that I actually feel something for her, to 3 of them I actually confessed that I had a crush on her and sadly they all rejected me, this had a bad influence on “my reputation” because people thought of me as “that guy who has a thousand of crushes”, I don’t like that but it’s also my own fault that I told my friends almost every time, I learned from that now tho. But this sounds kinda weird, idk if it’s actually normal but I had a crush on multiple people at the same time, is this normal? So now I definitely learned from all this and I won’t tell everyone that I now have a crush on that person. But the thing is, I’m in a class with only 7 people (we sometimes sit together with other classes and we’re all friends, not “very good friends who hang out a lot” but yea, we even had a pool party with only the 7 (me + 6 girls in my class) of us a few days ago, and it was fun. But for a few months i actually felt a lot for one of the 6 girls in my class, I know for sure that this is different from all others, she’s absolutely gorgeous, she’s very kind a smart, she’s a friend of me, she just has everything and I feel very attracted to her, more than ever and I know that for sure. But i haven’t told anyone this yet, and I don’t really want to let her know what I feel for her because if I do that everyone will just think this is “another crush of him” what it actually isn’t, it’s my own fault, I broke my reputation and know I just don’t know what to do. Do I let het know? When do I let het know? How do I let het know (with a msg, actually saying it face to face,...)? And will it be a good idea because I feel like if she rejects me (think that’ll be a big chance of that happening) everything between us will just feel “weird” and we’re in the same small class and I don’t want it to be weird but I want you to know this isn’t just a crush.

985,"So I (M20, not sure if that’s relevant)  get home from work around 8, and walk upstairs and see that nobody’s around, but my parents friends car is out front, for our purposes we’ll call him Greg.  And my parents vehicles are both home. So I assume they’re in the hot tub so I walk out to check if they are, and first I just see my dads friend sitting there and my first thought was “is Greg alone in our tub?” And I walk a little further to see my mom and dad sitting right next to him, my dads arm around my moms shoulders and I see that my moms shirt is pulled down over her breasts, and she’s holding this long black cylinder that I thought was a water bottle that she has that looks similar, but I quickly realize it’s a vibrator.  Greg looks up and noticed me and he says my name and I, not yet realizing anything was afoot, just waved at him and said ‘what’s up’. I stood there for a few seconds longer waiting for someone to say something and then I realized what I had just walked into. My parents asked Greg why he said my name and he was like “he’s there”. And my parents didn’t bother looking. I heard my mom respond “it’s okay we had the jets on”. I just threw up a peace sign at Greg and casually walked away, I’m pretty good at acting like nothings wrong so I just tried to act oblivious. It’s not uncommon for them to hang out in the yard together so I was just saying hi like normal. I just stand on my deck out of their sight for a moment just so I could process what I just witnessed. I then hear my parents asking Greg where I was and he told them I literally walked right above them on our deck. My mom keeps saying stuff like “well we had the jets on” and Greg says something I didn’t quite catch, but I managed to hear the phrase “had a good orgasm” which based on his personality I’m assuming he said something along the lines of “well we got caught but at least I had a good orgasm”. 

I’m probably the best person to have caught them. Anybody else in our house would’ve been very disturbed or angry. I’m not upset, and I intend to keep the secret to my grave. (Aside from telling the entire internet) I’m just worried they’re embarrassed and I want to keep up the charade that I didn’t notice anything was going on. Like I said I’m pretty good at hiding my immediate emotions, but prolonged interactions I don’t want to come across as awkward or anything. Any tips for acting like everything’s normal? Or anybody ever been in a similar situation? The LAST thing I want to do is talk to them about it cause that just seems embarrassing for everyone.",29Jun2020,0

988,"I (22F) have a friend (21F) who I met while at college. It was a nice friendship while we were both at school, but unfortunately her mental health got very bad and she dropped out at the beginning of our junior year. 

We are both from the same hometown so after I graduated we would hang out from time to time. However, things were not the same. 

When we do hang out, she’s 30-45 minutes late each time. The conversation always ends up taking a super negative turn, we’ll either talk about how she’s perpetually single, is extremely depressed, or just hates her life in general. 

I have been as supportive as I could have possibly been with her. Back at college, she shared with me her plan to kill herself, and I immediately contacted crisis services on campus. Each time she texts me how sad she is to be single, I offer new advice. I’ve been here to help for years now and unfortunately the friendship feels more like a therapy session for her every time we hang out. 

Additionally, she’s not exactly the kindest to me, either. When I would share an issue going on with me, she’d immediately say something along the lines of “yeah but I’ve got it worse than you.” She’ll send condescending texts to make her feel better about herself (I.e. “I know you have 0 self confidence and don’t believe in yourself, but I’m glad to be your friend!”)

Now, I know the obvious answer is to just let communication die between us. But the issue is that every time I think it’s officially done, she’ll text me and ask for reassurance that we are still friends.

I have posted to Reddit a couple of times before, and now I’m back asking for some more advice. A bit of back story, I am currently employed with a company that I have been with for the past 5 years. During this time, I have seen the company get sold off to someone else (who isn’t the nicest employers). Now with COVID-19 I have been laid off since March. With word that I will most likely loose my job, I am now looking for another job.

If you had read any one of my previous posts you will know that I have anxiety which was diagnosed by a doctor. I will post my previous post down below if you want to read it.

Now with a lot of job postings that I am looking at may require me to work weekend and nights. The only thing is, my work hours are unfortunately limited as I cannot work weekends or nights, due to other circumstances. Now I am scared that because of this I will not be able to get the job that I do desperately need. Not only is my work hours not really that flexible (can only work Monday to Friday during the day), but a part of me is telling me that I am not good enough for the job and I will not get it. Along with this there is also a great deal of guilt.

One thing to note is that in previous jobs, I was judged and let go due to my anxiety and panic disorder which is why I am probably scared to find a new job. As I am scared that it will happen again.

Please, someone help me figure out what to do. I need advice.

Hi, I posted one time before on this and it helped. Now I need some more advice, and I’m hoping that someone can help.

One thing to know about me is that I have anxiety, and it was even confirmed by a doctor. Now I have been seeing a psychotherapist just to help me manage my anxiety. Now due to the recent events I can no longer afford to see a psychotherapist because of COVID-19. I can not longer afford it because I got laid off as what I do is considered a “non-essential business”. 

Now I have always had anxiety  it was always apart of my life for as long as I can remember, and I don’t think it will ever go away. At one point it got hard for me to manage which is why I was seeing a psychotherapist. Now I have been recently talking to a guy online, and our conversation moved to talking over the phone. Now I have been able to manage my anxiety up until this point. Now that we are talking over the phone it seems like that my anxiety is starting to sneak it’s way back, and it’s a little challenging for me to deal with. I just want to know, is what I am going through normal? Like, I have talk to him over the phone once before, and now we are going to talk over the phone again today, and I can feel my anxiety rise. I don’t know if this is normal, I thought I got all that anxiety, nervousness, etc. out when we talked over the phone last. Like I said, I will be talking to him again over the phone today and my anxiety is starting to rise. If someone can please give me some kind of advice that would be great.",29Jun2020,1

based on credits I’m a Junior in college  majoring in Biology and my parents want me to go to medical school, but I can’t even figure out if it’s what I want to do. I enjoyed biology in high school because I found it interesting and didn’t really need to study because I remembered everything that interested me. Now I don’t know if it’s what I want to do or if I don’t want to do it because my parents are pushing me to do it. 

At the moment as in last week my parents paid for me to take my chemistry lab class that I just failed this spring and I found out last week failed it again. I AM IN COLLEGE this has affected my gpa very badly. I have always been a majority a student and some b’s but after my freshmen year in high school I burned out. Since I was a kid my parent put high efficiencies in college education that what I do now will affect me in college and her I need to get good grades etc. i attended a dual enrollment high school and the classes were rigorous they were all AP including the college classes we took at the community college. My freshmen year in high school I was so stressed I decided after that year I would finally take a break for my self and stop beating my self up for getting B’s. I would cry if I got a B and my parents weren’t happy if my siblings and I did but they were becoming more lenient that time and said it was okay. Ever since then it’s been down hill and my work ethic when down as well as my motivation. Now I will be a sophomore in college. 

Keep in mind my parents are paying for it all and the guilt is eating away at me. I am doing terrible in school and they are doing so much by paying for it for me. I am privileged in that sense and I’m very grateful. I just lose all motivation since then in high school. 
Also, I think I was kind of depressed in April once the virus hit. Before the virus, so beginning of my first year in college  I  was not motivated at all. I barely passed my first semester and failed my Chemistry class and had to retract it for spring. I understand this was long so I’m sorry for he long post, I really need some guidance because I don’t even know where to start. I feel gross with my self, he fact that I’m failing, not motivated,not trying, don’t know what I want to be. My parents are nice and helpful but I still fall short. 

TLDR: failing college and haven’t been motivated since freshman year of high school. Was pushed to do well in school since elementary like kindergarten.",29Jun2020,3

So for the past few months, my (now ex) close friend (I'll call him A) has been acting very different. He was harassing one of our mutuals (I'll call him G), acting like everything in my life didn't matter in the grand scheme of things (despite me making life changing decisions and my father getting a cancer diagnosis), and was being very passive aggressive. I was getting very annoyed by it, but stuck with him anyway until Saturday. On Saturday, we got into 2 larger arguments:

1. He was harassing G on a group chat and I asked him to stop. He claimed he was just making ""harmless jokes."" He has made these ""jokes"" for a while and A knew they hurt G. He then said I shouldn't be defending G and that he knew it was a joke. He didn't and I had been saying that. I told him to knock it off and he went off on me asking why I was defending our friend when I had only knew G for a few months but I had known him for four years.

2. I sent the groupchat a Tik Tok I found. https://vm.tiktok.com/JdCMwyv I said I had done the ting on the Tik Tok on myself as a joke. He kept going on and on saying it was witchcraft and that I shouldn't be doing it. I said I didn't believe in that stuff, so he told me to talk to someone I don't know. I said no because I didn't want to talk to someone I don't know about something I don't want to talk about. He shoved me in a groupchat and I left, because he was not listening to what I wanted. I told him to quit the bullsh*t. He sterted going on about how I was calling his religion bullsh*t.  I said I wasn't and was saying what he did was bullsh*t and asked him to calm down. He didn't. I asked him not to talk to me until the morning because I didn't want to deal.

An hour or 2 later, I decided to cut him out. I sent him a very long message saying I didn't want to be friends, why I didn't, and apologizing if I sounded mean. He said it was ok, but that was a lie. Today, he is telling my friends he is s*icidal because of Saturday and he is asking them a million things about me. AITA for leaving the friendship and what should I do moving forward



TL;DR: Got into 2 arguments with a long-term friend, because he was being rude to my friend and ignoring that I didn't want to have a certain social interaction. I left the friendship because he had been being rude for a while to me and my other friends. Now he is claiming he is s*icidal because of the fights and asking a million things about me. AITA for leaving a friendship? What do I do?",29Jun2020,2
1002,"At first I wanted to be a tattoo artist but really my desire to dedicate myself to that is disappearing (and mother does not want to let me study art). I started to remember what I said since i was a kid (like 5 y/old) and always said I wanted to be a ""Wildlife Biologist"" but I started researching and it really isn't a very pleasant job.

1003,"Lately I’ve been doing some thinking and I’ve noticed I’m a lot different than some of the people around me. I have felt obligated to go to college, get a degree, and have a successful career from the minute I graduated high school. The only issue is that I’ve had no clue what career I desire.

I have had zero aspirations when it comes to a career, but I have hobbies. I love to spend time with loved ones and I love taking care of them. I was an advanced student all my life. I haven’t enjoyed every job I had, but I’ve been successful in them. I frequently earned leadership positions and raises because of my performance. I’ve worked anywhere from retail to the medical field to the marketing business. 

I’m currently pregnant with my and my husband’s first child. She was a surprise to us, but we are more than happy to welcome her into this world and are able to successfully provide for her, emotionally and financially. 

Some of the only lifetime goals I’ve had were to find a loving, dedicated husband and have children that I can support and raise to be happy adults. I think this goal stems from the lack of parenting my siblings (currently 13 and 9 y/o) and I received. My father struggled with commitment, drugs and alcohol and my mother was often absent in our lives, leaving me to care for and raise my siblings.

I’ve already achieved one of the previously mentioned goals. My husband and I met when I was 15 and we’ve been happily married for a year. My husband is an extremely hard-working, energetic, loving man. He’s dedicated to me and both of our families. He helped me take care of my siblings when my mother was absent and we still happily helps my family when they need the help. He graduated with his bachelor’s degree with honors and is now working his dream job. My other goal will, of course, take a lifetime because I will always be a mother to my children.

I am currently working in a family business that my mother owns and I’m enjoying it quite a bit. She was not a good mother, but she is an amazing business woman. We have a great relationship now. Professionally, we work well together. Right now I’m only currently making $10 an hour, but with how the business is advancing, that hourly rate is going to raise in the near future. On top of that, my mother is allowing me to take my child to work with me, which is an opportunity that seems priceless to me. My husband and I are able to comfortably support ourselves financially, even with how little I make.

I currently only work 30 hours a week, but I am the main care-taker of the home. I do a majority of the cleaning and I provide the meals. This is an arrangement that I’m happy with. My husband works hard, so I like to let him relax when he gets home, but he does take care of things I currently cannot, such as yard work and heavy lifting. With us both working together, we have a beautiful home.

I’m currently more than happy with my life right now, but I see people with these big dreams, getting college degrees, moving away, etc. Compared to these people, I’m extremely simple. I feel like making people feel loved, emotionally taking care of my husband, and raising children to be able to take care of themselves is what I can do to make this world a better place. 

I’ve received comments from people that address my lifestyle. I’ve been asked, “don’t you want to do something with your life?”

1004,"A couple of years ago (12 or 13 ish maybe) I had a dream. It lasted 5 years to me and my life moved on so much, I got a bf then broke up, another bf then he cheated. I’ve never seen these faces apparently, but this could the been a dream. It was so long. I remember so much as well and I know there are memories I completely forgot. It’s still shocking none of it happened. I even remember the guy who did my driving test, he reminded me of like an old pot belly pig. And one minute I’m looking forward to my 18th bday, the next, I’m bloody 12 again. It’s so weird, I remember this one time me and my sister ( in the dream she was like 3 years older too) and we went to a water park and she got cute from the drains or something. And I remember all my classes and learning stuff that I didn’t even know. It’s so sad really. Like I’m still younger right  now than I was at the end of my dream. And this one time, we had a barbecue in the garden and it was so nice. But all those memories apparently aren’t real. I don’t know what advice I’m asking for, I don’t know honestly.

1005,"So basically during an event in which I was blackout drunk, I hooked up with some guys (tbh I couldn’t even tell when and where stuff happened, i only remember like 1/10 of that day), and I know that none of them actually recognized how drunk I was because even my girlfriends couldn’t tell that i was basically unconcious at that point. But I still feel so violated by those people, I tried explaining myself without a accusative attitude, and all I’ve heard was “Yeah lmao I was very drunk too” and “I’ve asked multiple times, and you said yes”. It still doesn’t feel right. I guess I just want an apology. It’s hard solving issues like this where none of the parties are blatantly wrong.

1007,"26, M.  I’ve landed a lucrative job which requires me to relocate to the Midwest, practically in the middle of nowhere.  For all my life, I’ve lived at home and commuted for college and work.  I’ve never really lived on my own, and the last time I tried, I failed and quit my job after 3 months being out there.  

This could be because there are underlying issues, but the fact is that being the son of immigrants, I never had extended family or trusted friends my whole life.  I always was supported by the immediate family I had here, which is not large. 
It’s a big 0-100% to be self sufficient and live alone.  I do fear I’ll fall into heavier loneliness or depression.  

But I accepted the job because it doubled my salary and is aligned with what I studied—making up for years of lost time of settling for bad-fitting jobs. 

What are some strategies I can use to ease into the new lifestyle?   I find the house search to be overwhelming, as well as relocation logistics, even the hassle of registering and titling a vehicle again/new license.  And it’s truly a big change. 

In this year, my parents have become unemployed and my sibling is heading to live in the dorms. It’s like we’re breaking apart.  Maybe it wasn’t the best idea, because I’m doubting if I can handle it.",29Jun2020,1
1008,"I would like to get a Venus Fly Trap as over the past few days,flies have been coming Into my room and bugging me in my sleep as I leave my windows open for fresh air and to let a breeze though. I think they’re cool plants and my aunt recommended I get one as they work as decor and also as insect killers. Which is fantastic for me,because FUCKING HATE FLIES. 

I understand they’re pricier then regular plants eg,petunias but I’m willing to spend my money on it if it works. This isn’t just a one time thing either,I’ve thought about having one but when I wanted one,I had no flies as it was winter and they didn’t come in as often. 

Also...is it weird if I name it? I really want to call it Lucifer. 

Anyway apparently they aren’t like other plants and require a lot of work,like raising a baby,but a baby that doesn’t wear a nappy and a baby that actually eats flies instead of just attempting to.

Is it honestly worth my money and time or should I just stick to being infuriated at 4am?

1009,"This will be long but i need to spill it out:

 Since birth I've heard from my narcissistic dad(M55) that I'm not ""man enough, weak and probably gay"".

 I've born with a cist in my hypophysis, with among other things, make me have GH deficiency. This means my muscles don't grow and I'll always have them in atrophy state. I discovered it last year but nothing had changed in my father's and I relationship.

 I've began an hormone treatment about half a year ago but since then still haven't any significant results.

 I have depression since i was a child (but have only being able to go to the psychiatrist last year, when I finally got a job). It didn't take long to my condition start showing. When i couldn't hang anymore because my fingers and knees swollen to the point that i can't move.
 Since then I've stopped the treatment. It also happens that i need glasses but lost mine about 3 months ago, so I'm having trouble with headaches every day.

 I'm living with my parents because life, but everytime I cry, barf, get angry with myself or anything that show that I'm not completely fine with the situation I'm in, my mom get's sad and everyone come shit on me . I need to constantly reassure that I'm fine, happy and ""totally not depressed"". I currently living with a total of 6 people, being my mom, dad, brother (M31), his wife (F27) and child (M7) and if any of them see me in a bad spot bad things happen. My brother and father are extremely aggressive and sometimes straight up shitty persons. He and my constantly makes me feel bad or afraid of them. I'm not stupid. I know I would only be a punch bag in a fight, so I usually have to let them be. My brother and his wife are in constant fights and sometimes I just wish I could be alone in my room. I don't have locks on my room since my brother broke the dor to ""fight"" me over I'm being drunk and saying that I want to die. This day he almost kick me but left saying that I should kill myself when my mom started crying. 


 I smoke. I need to stop and I'm trying to. But if i show any kind of difficulty in doing it my mom buy me a pack and put in my room or throw it at me. If i get rid of it she just buy a new one and do it again. I keep asking her to stop because when I can't do nothing i can't help myself. I smoke. Today I was on my bed and was without nicotine for 6 hours. I was trying to draw because i was good at it before things getting this bad and I'm trying to get back to it. This made my finger unusable in 1 hour. I'm also trying to get to walk again but my legs are trash so it hurts and don't move after i walk and I usually do it in the morning because I'm to bad to do it another time. She said that she'll buy a pack and i said her not to. She does anyway and throw it on my face. I lost my mind and scream to her to stop doing it. Now she's sad, my father and brother are mad at me. 


I can't be mad, feel pain or anything bad. My existence consist of me being patient so nobody gets hurt. The thing is: I'm losing my sanity. Sometimes it feels that I'm being stone in the way of their lives. Excluding my mom everyone here don't like me.

I dont have chance of get better the way things are now and don't have ways to get money to change it. My dad and mom are getting too old and I will just be something in their way. My future is probably already doomed and if I keep living the things will only get worse for me and them. I don't have many options. 
I really know that i should be thinking that and that's not healthy, but rationally thinking... What else can I do?

1011,"I’m 19 now but I’ll just list everything summarised that has happened in the past 4 years: 

15 I decided I’d like to do modelling or something in that direction. However I also am trans MTF and so I wanted to transition before I started that. Also at school people constantly tried insert their selves in my business with fake rumours and tear me down because I had a ‘glow up’ recently and lost weight.. 🙄 so everyone felt it was okay to lie and say I had eating disorders lol wtf so annoying especially because they treated me bad when I was a little chubbier too.  Can’t win. This was also the age the depression started. I remember having a breakdown secretly on holiday and being so sad, and I was so close to coming out but it just felt impossible because of their previous anti lgbt comments and him using homophobic slurs before. Also I got all of the heat at school for being one of the only openly out ppl and lost like any male friend and the girl ones I had I was never really a part of the group because I wasn’t outwardly a girl and they’d defend homophobes to me instead of me.. Chile n e ways 

————-
16 I couldn’t take it anymore so decided to try socially transition by growing out hair and I’d constantly hint to parents and try show my real self. My dad would get me to wishlist stuff to order for my birthday etc and I finally decided to just do me a little more and add some pink tops, jumpers etc. Nothing that ridiculous or even expensive. and it literally is still in the Male category.... Then on the day I’d get none of it and it would be an ugly more masculine colour I didn’t ask for. So I took this as okay he’s just never going to get it, so I’m not going to come out to them and I’m just going to have to do it all myself. This was also because he’d tear me down and constantly try change me and yell man up etc. 
Also facial hair was beginning to come and it literally drove me crazy. And my hairdresser my dad took me to became female only and so I had to stop going there because of the game my parents created where I had to hide who I am. So that also threw me off especially growing it out lol. Also OMFG the biggest mess. At school I had my nose broken in a tragic class I didn’t want to do for that reason. That literally spiralled me and destroyed my life. But I didn’t realise it was actually broken because no one acknowledged me when I said I heard a crack and so I thought maybe I imagined it or it was to hard to believe. So I somehow convinced myself it was Male puberty that might of messed up my nose and that made me even more dysphoric. Also people at school constantly harassing me and me being an inbetween mess because I still had to try hide it from parents even though it was obvious. This drove me crazy not knowing if people thought I was a boy or girl. And when half of random family members literally think I’m a girl, infront of parents and my parents still pretending to think I’m this straight boy lol Gtfo even after I eye roll to their face whenever they mention me having a gf. I eventually spiralled so hard and had breakdowns of me cutting my hair in the bathtub and crying 💀. I just felt so doomed knowing I had to go through male puberty, especially after basing my identity on me being one of the lucky ones that would be able to transition in teens and be pretty. But I seriously lost the plot and didn’t know why I didn’t recognise myself anymore but it was the damn nose that caused that. So I went from such a high of feeling my best the year before and now feeling so ugly when I was supposed to be prettier because I was trying to transition. Also everyone at school seriously convinced me I was an awful person. Also teachers called me out of class and ganged up on me and tried say I had an eating disorder because I’m naturally skinny and tall now without letting me defend myself and then they called my parents telling them I did. This gave my parents an excuse to focus on and feel good instead of the actual thing they should be focused on. 
Also my first kiss ghosted me right after and then months later said it’s because his family didn’t like that he’s seeing someone not a cis girl. Not in those words but basically that. All of this made me resent society so much and that it was impossible for me to live because no one wants me to be able to. Also I wanted to escape that school this year the second I was able to but my nose getting broken before that made me feel trapped and so I stayed since it messed up my plans.

——————
17 i knew it was doomed from the start and I just wanted to try feel like myself and attractive again and so I went to hairdresser originally to just tidy it and make it feminine and still longer but I had enough of all the mess and then just asked for it to be short. Ever since then I felt like my transition was over and I’m so masculine and ugly now. Especially because my nose looks so ugly like wtf happened. Which I didn’t notice as much when my hair was longer and kind of distracted from it. Also you could see the effects of my months of binge eating more now that it’s shorter. I just looked so busted and different compared to literally a year before. I’ve felt suicidal and so low ever since and not myself. Also constantly yelled slurs at, at school almost daily. I could’ve applied to the gender clinic this age but I legit felt my life was over and so didn’t.
Also I’d stay up so late and was sleep deprived like the entire year and get like 5 hours of sleep at most school days, besides weekends  also I realised maybe I didn’t have depression, I think it was actually most likely bipolar 2 

————
18 the same constantly harassed at school and I legit was so quiet because I wasn’t myself anymore and boys in my year literally grabbed my ass without my consent and there were so many ‘chasers’ for years that just sexualised me online, I legit didn’t feel like a person. I decided to finally apply to the gender clinic, then realised it was like a 3 year wait to be seen.. the second I left that school was when I could begin to try rebuild my life. I then also applied to a private clinic I’d pay for myself because I did not want to wait that long. I also started laser hair treatment. All of this still hidden from parents. Have 0 plans to keep them in my life or involve them after the shenanigans that took place when I did try involve them.

————-
19 still feel so ugly, and low and in a crisis but isn’t quite as severe as when I was in high school. Quarantine was so necessary for my reflection time and seriously have had so many breakdowns but it’s finally let me realise why my nose isn’t the same as before. Which makes me even more frustrated that literally all of my downfalls were so avoidable and I should’ve been further hellbent in my direction I wanted. And refuse to do anything compromising it and I should’ve straight up just said to parents instead of allowing room for their games. Also I came out to my sister before this which went well but it all feels too little to late. I’m just so far from my goals now and can’t stand how I look now. I want my old face. I also saw gp about. (Was so mortifying and I couldn’t stop crying lol). Also isolation has halted laser progress and I haven’t been to the private clinic yet but maybe next week. Just so annoyed I need to spend all this money that could’ve been so easily preventable lol. Oh oops forgot to mention I had a crisis in isolation and accidentally got myself involved with the police currently because I decided to report everything that happened at school one night. So soon I’ll be outed to parents regardless. (Also my sister was trying to help it happen soon anyways). I also got a part time job this age right when I left school but I quit after 8 months and wanting to for so long because it was so not worth it.

———————————

Yeah how do I recover from this? Any thoughts would be so appreciated❤️.  I’ll list some things I plan on doing when isolation is over:



I’m going to try get on the nosejob waiting list. I just hope to god it can look the same as my original nose or better afterwords. Giving me so much anxiety and I think about it nearly all day. I know I could probs never have an actual model career now because by the time I get all my surgeries and stuff I’ll be to old to be considered by a lot and it just won’t be the same. Hope I’m wrong tho. 

Continue laser hair sessions.

See the private gender clinic soon and hopefully start hormones within a year. (Seems weird tho because I don’t feel myself until I get my nose fixed and good). So it’s not really like me transitioning until then.

For Christmas and birthdays I’m 100% just going to ask for only money. And that will go towards my transition. I might also (most likely not) say I want to do modelling and try see if they’d be willing to fund a non trans related plastic surgery to them. Like maybe I could say my nose has made me so over aware of my appearance over the years and my insecurity with my appearance is halting my life and future etc. Like could I get away with asking for their help in getting my hairline fixed?? I mean probably not lol he’ll just deflect and talk about his but Atleast it will open them to the prospect of me wanting procedures and that I don’t need to be how they want me to be.

And I’ll do my last year of college then probably get a full time job to fund transition. I so badly want to make a YouTube for the longest time but I’m just to unhappy with my appearance to do so, maybe I could still but idk. After my nose job I probs could especially if it turns out really nice. My brow bone isn’t bad enough for ppl to really focus on and I can hide 5 o’clock with makeup if I have to. It is just the nose I’m embarrassed to be seen with.

I also do illustrations that I was trying to build into a thing I could one day hopefully benefit from monetarily as a side thing but I’ve slowed down on that. Maybe I could seriously commit again. I’m just more focused on myself and my transition rn. 

Yeah I think that’s most of it. Would be so grateful for any thoughts, impressions, suggestions etc about any of it 💖. Sorry it was so long I didn’t plan on it being so detailed. Hopefully that helps get a better idea.",29Jun2020,0

i could tell over the past few days that she was upset about something but when i asked her about it, she wouldnt talk. i kept pressing then today she spoke. said that i was annoying her by asking her again and again. that she wasnt as good a person as i made her appear to be. that she was felt i was being too obsessive and didnt feel comfortable with me calling her sis. i knew someone that just disappeared before. she said she understood exactly why that pwrson did it .she said she wanted to spend some time not talking. i said ok. i cried. i hurt myself.

1014,"Hi guys! New to Reddit so please excuse any errors. I'm 20F. Here's my predicament:

My grandfather is in his mid-80's and incrediby has no mobility issues but has chronic heart failure. He still lives alone in his regular home, however he has severe memory problems and is extremely confused.

Shortly after the pandemic started, he lost his balance sitting down and fell to the ground but was not injured. Both he and my mother were very shaken up by this and he came to stay with us ""for a few days."" It's important to note he has been vehemently against moving out of his home, but somehow ended up staying with us for 2 weeks. It took some adjustment but we all finally got into a groove and everything was working well. This really brought to light how many memory problems he was having and the fact that he can't be left alone any more. He often doesn't remember to take his medicine and repeats himself every few minutes. My mother has begun referring to him as ""the baby"" when he is out of earshot. When he is in our house, he does not make his own meals and cannot be left alone otherwise he calls out for someone consantly- all of which makes sense with what he has going on.

My sister (16) was invited to travel to a private beach house with a friend who had also been isolating. This caused my mother to panic and she moved my grandfather back into his house (against my suggestions) and stayed with him for two weeks after my sister returned. Once the two weeks was up, my mother returned home, leaving him alone. She visits every day or every other day now, and makes more efforts to call but I personally feel this isn't enough. She herself said that he shouldn't live alone any more (a conversation we've been having for the better part of 5 years) and knows he is barely able to function.

Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation? How do I go about facilitating a conversation about this so she doesn't feel like I'm attacking her? Everyone else in my family (sister and dad) agree he shouldn't live alone.

Please feel free to ask questions if you need more information! I did my best to include things but I inevitably left things out I'm sure.

Also: my mother returned home because a) she hates living in his house b) she does not have the patience to deal with him 24/7 and c) my sister snuck out of the house while dad and I were sleeping and she feels we're ""incapable of watching her""",29Jun2020,1

I was just finishing and enjoying the total peace when my mom got home from work. Instantly, I felt a wave of negativity and anger enter the space. She looked horrified and annoyed with me. I tried to explain that I just finished, and that the smell would dissipate in a few minutes (with all the fans and windows open), but it didn’t matter. Just annoyance all around. I don’t understand what I did. I get not everyone likes the smell (I absolutely love it), but to be so upset and ignoring me when I tried to calm her worries really destroyed the peace that I felt.

She’s been pretty open about me exploring witchcraft and everything in the past, but it seems that no matter what I do, witchcraft or not, she’s always mad/upset at me for something. 

Note that every day I do everything she asks of me. Both of my parents are essential workers, so I’m the only one that is able to do chores around the house. I vacuum, do dishes, laundry, mop, clean our barn (we have horses), tend to garden/house, and plenty of other things. I am happy to do all of this because I can. I am a member of the family, but a ‘Thank You’ or something is still be appreciated. My dad is always thankful and tells me that everyday when he comes home. 

I was originally going to post this in r/witchcraft, but I think I need some advice over anything right now. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? I don’t know what I want, but I know something is off here. I still feel refreshed after my cleanse, but there is a little sad spot about my mother’s reaction. 

Thank you so much for reading this if you’ve gotten this far. I hope you’ve enjoyed my mini-rant.",29Jun2020,1
1018,"for context i just graduated college and have been living back at home, i got a job out of state for the next 3 months and i won’t know anyone else there. i’ve had this issue for maybe a year or so now, i think it got worse because i’d feel really homesick while at college and i’ve formed lots of online friendships recently who i talk to nearly everyday. there was also a death in my family last fall due to a car accident and its just left me always feeling on edge since then.

i’m also aware that i get really obsessive or clingy about it sometimes, like if a friend is taking a long time to text back i get really panicky, or if my parents are out of the house longer than i expected, i panic and text them to make sure they’re ok. if i know a friend is travelling i ask them to let me know when they arrive safely. i feel like everyone thinks its annoying or weird, plus panicking like this all the time is really exhausting, but i don’t know how to stop feeling like this. i used to consider myself such a positive person but i feel like nowadays i’m always anxious and expecting the worst.

i guess i’m just worried since i’ll be away from everyone for so long while i’m working and i want to know if anyone else has struggled with this, or if anyone has advice on how i can ease my mind.

edit: i do also plan on finding a therapist once i’m back home from working. i tried therapy while in school and it didn’t really help because i didn’t vibe with the campus therapists but i know therapy is something i need",29Jun2020,1
1019,"So I dont really know where to start. 

I had a horrid childhood with parents who didn't know how to parent and unfortunately to make things worse, I had a severely disabled sibling who took up all their attention, was a constant stressor, and that cost me the normalcy of having friends or good relationships with my siblings or parents. 

Essentially, growing up I had no one. No relatives I was close to. I hated my parents. My brothers resented me. 

On top of that, I was gay which actually wasn't as bad compared to everything else. But definitely was tougher in terms of gaining experience in relationships or intimacy. 

I spent middle school and most of high school surviving my home life. Didn't really hang out with anyone outside of school and didn't really like most of my friends in school. It was just an escape from home. 

In college, I was faced with a decision. Stay close to home or move away and start over. For how terrible everything was for me, you would have thought that would have been an easy decision. 

But even though I've never had a good family life, I've always longed for it. And I thought at that point that my disabled sibling would be moving into a facility alleviating much of the stress on my family. It was also cost efficient to stay close to home. And its all I've ever known. 

So I decided to stay home and I really excelled in college. It became my life. I graduated with a 4.0 and will graduate with my Masters Degree next year although I still never found a passion. I went from having no care in high school to college being my only care. It was escapism of a different variety. 

Unfortunately, my family life continued to deteriorate. My mom had for years ignored my dad with the excuse of being busy with my disabled sibling. My dad finally cheated on her (after she lied about moving my disabled sibling into a facility). 

Last year, my parents decided to get a divorce. I'm not upset about that, maybe about the timing though (I always thought they should have earlier as it would have meant my sibling would have gone to a facility earlier and they would have fought less). 

My sibling is moving out in a couple days as my Mom can't take care of her alone. This is what I stayed close to home for in some ways. I wanted to see if my family would be different with my sibling gone. 

And while I'm sure it will be less stress, it took until now to happen. My Dad is gone now, my mom isn't healthy mentally, my brothers won't be here for much longer as they are both in college. 

I haven't dated anyone despite being a good looking guy.

I'm applying for the military right now but won't know anything for another year. Getting my Masters in the meantime. 

But I'm yearning for change now, I really want to date but I live in an area where everyone seems to want to stay here and most aren't academics or travelers. I dont want to start something now and then have to give it up a year from now. 

I also want the freedom of the military to be able to visit new places and even ""sleep around"" a bit. Explore what I've suppressed for so long. So I dont want to commit to a relationship. If I wait, I might be 25 before I even start and I feel like I lost out on High School and College to gain those social experiences and support. 

On the same lines, I want to move and explore but I'm also locked in for at least a year and scared beyond that. 

But I don't know what to do, I have depression and anxiety constantly ever since I was a kid. 

My parents failed me, but my hope for change has turned into a paralysis.

I'm struggling to move on. Part of me really still desires those HS Football games I missed out on, Prom, that first relationship in HS or College that is innocent and awkward. Just being myself in a controlled environment.

I just am looking for any advice, I have tried to get into psychology a couple of times but it hasn't worked out yet. 

So just looking for general advice atm.",29Jun2020,1

I'm an otherwise perfectly healthy guy and I have no problems at all getting erections by myself either with or without porn.

1027,"So I just wanted to ask something, but I can't go on ask reddit because it wouldn't post. Also if it isn't normal then I would be asking for advice on how to stop it since I am uncomfortable with it.

&amp;#x200B;

So has a young child my mother found it funny to playfully touch or hit mine and my sisters butts or boobs. We found it funny as kids, but as we grew it changed.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother would playfully either hit mine or my sister butts or boobs and we did the same for her. But as I grew up I just got tired of the game, my sister Anna (Fake name) whenever my mother playful hits Anna's boob it seems sometimes depending how her mood is, Anna could also hit my mother's boob playfully or if she isn't in a happy mood she'll get upset and hit back but hurt my mother, which in turns makes my mother cry and go to her room. It makes us sad but Anna doesn't apologize which I don't blame her.

&amp;#x200B;

So with me, I got sick of the game and whenever I'm doing my chore which is dishes, my mother sometimes would come up behind me and hit or pinch my butt. I have complained about it well more like my noises of distress and have asked her not to do that again but my mother just shrugs me off or also complains that she's just playing. She has stopped hitting my boobs. I can tell this part isn't normal at all... I don't sometimes want to hug my mother because growing up my mother found it funny to playfully bit me and my sister really hard to the point she marked us. Now I am scared of hugging my mother because I scared she will suddenly bite my neck. I do understand that it isn't normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to know if those hit and pinching of my butt or boobs is normal for a mother to do to her daughters and if not can I have any advice on how to ask my mother to stop because I do love my mother she hasn't been abusive to us, but sometimes I feel like she favors Anna more than but that's beside the point of what I'm asking. Can I have advice on how to ask my mother to stop because it's making me feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I wanted to say I am 18, DeDe (Fake name and older sister) is 20 and Anna is 16. And that even though my mother hasn't bit us in a long time and I don't remember the last time she touched my butt or boob. I just wanted to know if it was normal because I am scared of hugging my own mother because I'm scared she'll bite me or hit my boobs, seriously when she comes over to me I hold my arms up covering my boobs and she just laughs it off. Sorry, my self-concession is second-guessing posting this. Because I don't want people hating my mother because she does love us and care of us, I just wanted to know if it was normal. Because she does still would hit or pinch my butt when I'm doing the dishes but I just don't remember the last time she did that.

I have this friend of mine I’ve known since high school, good guy but he is awkward af and doesn’t have many friends (maybe like 2-3 that he talks to, including me).

Regardless I’m willing to overlook flaws, as I’m not the best person myself either but I feel like he’s taking things in a bit of a strange direction recently.

Ever since the start of the pandemic we’ve been talking and playing games together, which is fine but at times he’d talk on the phone for over an hour. The majority of the call being stuff about his life and not to be rude but it’s pretty insignificant things that he should be figuring out on his own.

Even in games he’d try to force me into conflicts with other players despite me clearly saying I don’t like that stuff (he likes to troll apparently).  

Oh yeah and other things like him wanting me to buy a bike to ride together, which is fine but he was interrogating me about my own money and even accused me of lying about how much I have in my bank account (I didn’t have enough for the expensive bike he wants me to get), needless to say I was pretty pissed at that.

Regardless I pursued the friendship and life goes on. 

Recently though I’ve missed some of his calls, admittedly one of these I purposely missed because I literally was tired of talking to him 24/7 every day but the other missed calls were in the middle of the night so I was sleeping (I out do not disturb on because otherwise discord goes off every 3 seconds) 

Now he’s accusing me of dodging all of his calls and giving a lot of attitude despite the fact that he knows I go to sleep early and wake up early.

1039,"Hi everyone, I have recently been using reddit as a way to get help with family problems, since I don't want to involve a lot of family members.

Please, I need sincere opinions, even if it is: ""you are being super sensitive"", thanks in advance for the answers

I was always an introvert, but I was able to publicly express opinions and feelings without much trouble. From the age of 7 years, I developed social anxiety and shyness, so at the age of 11, my mother took me to a therapist to treat shyness (at least according to her, but I'm not sure what she said about me)

Shortly after, the therapist released me, stating that I had no problem, ""nothing wrong with you"" she said

An important thing to note is that I was constantly afraid of escaping any emotion or memory, I kept everything, so I lied a lot in the sections

I returned to therapy with her a year ago (I am 17 years old), because of the exponential increase in anxiety and sadness

Within that time, my discussions with my parents got much worse and nowadays I know that the fear I had was of them

I tried to bring this to the sections, but she constantly says things like: ""she did it because of stress in marriage"", ""children are the result of marriage"", ""this is the result of stress from working at a school""
or ""your mother did it because she didn’t want you to become your father, mothers always know more, because they carried their children in the womb""

These types of responses accompany even serious things, like when recently, my mother hit me on the back and arms, and then called my father saying that I was almost hitting her, as soon as my father arrived furious, she denied everything, that I hadn't done anything

Sorry, I changed the direction of the conversation. Returning to the subject, also discovering by chance that my mother had sent her to do a homosexuality test on me when she was 12 and tell her the result, the test was negative and my therapist confirmed the story, They will never tell it to me, I only discovered it, because of a coincidence, if I don't search I wouldn't never know

So, I think my therapist is a good person, but I think her empathy is with my mother and not with me, as a patient.

Honestly, what do you think?",29Jun2020,2
1040,"my \[23F\] friend called me last night on the phone. I could feel from her voice that something was wrong, so i stepped outside and asked her if she was ok. now for context i need to explain that she is bipolar and takes daily medication. she attempted suicide multiple times before but each time she contacted someone right before ot called help from firemen herself.

back to yesterday night, she told me on the phone that she had just taken all the medication that she had in stock along with some wine? I told her i was goig to call for someone to help her, but she begged me not to and cried. i had never seen her like that. she told me she just wanted to talk to a friend in her last moments and not be alone. I couldn't say no to her face, eventhough I truly do not want her to die, i undersand how she feels, and i know that this was different from usual.

so we talked a little and after a while she got quiet, she had fell asleep, or something close to it (idk the term, english not first language). I could hear her breathe though, but at the time i thought maybe she was already gone and i was hearing her cat. An hour or so after i had answered ger call, i hang up, and called for help. I could not stand the idea of leaving her there, alone, whil eher body was slowly being destroyed from the inside. She could have stayed like that for hours for all i knew. i didn't know if she was in pain, if she had ultimately regretted her choice, if what she had igested was even lethal at all. And I wasn't even sure she was still alive.

she is now at the hospital, alive, but in no state to speak or communicate. Should I have let her go ? should I have rejected her wish and called for help earlier ?

1042,"I've known him for a couple years now, we've always gotten along well but were never really friends. A year ago, he messaged me while I was studying abroad, and we talked for months and I thought he had asked me out. I come back, and he tells me his girlfriend is ill. Ofcourse I'm surprised and I tell him I thought he asked me out (rather than just a hang-out between friends). He acts oblivious and doesn't give a straight answer. Another year goes by and he now asked me to hang out again. When I asked why, he says that he was curious how I was doing. I obviously find it a bit of a bs reason, so when I address what happened last year and that I thought he asked me out, he admits that he ""used to"" have a crush on me. I'm willing to forgive what he did last year (he said he didn't really know what he was doing when he asked me to catch up). However, for some reason I get this gut feeling that he's currently in a relationship. He has never broadcasted his relationships on social media so there's no way for me to confirm. But, the reason I feel this way is because of his odd texting behaviors. On some days, he texts me a lot the whole day, never 30 minutes going by before he texts me back.  On other days, he literally texts me once. In the past, I've dealt with guys who had this hot-and-cold behavior as well, and it always turned out to be because they were talking to other girls or they were in a relationship. Also, the fact that he says he ""used to"" have a crush on me, despite being eager to hang out, seems to me as a way of insuring that he's technically not doing anything inappropriate. Please give me some advice :)",29Jun2020,2

1045,"exactly one year ago i was in china at a summer camp for chinese-americans. everyone in our assigned group became pretty good friends, but there were a few i became even closer to and developed a deeper bond to the point i considered one of my closer friends that i trusted. however once camp ended we all went our in separate ways because most of us lived in different states. we stayed in contact for a few weeks but then the school year started so we all became busy. i tried to stay in contact with a few friends but some didn’t respond due to being busy i presume. anyway a few days ago i teared up a bit because it never settled into my mind that i truly may never contact/talk to these people ever again. obviously i would still wish them happy birthday, merry christmas, etc. but it’s obviously not the same as us hanging out and stuff at camp. so i’ve been wondering how you would stay as friends/how do you stay as friends with people that live across the country. thanks!",29Jun2020,1
1046,"I understand that I’m young, and these just seem like general teenager concerns, but I don’t know what else to do. 

All my friends are guys, there’s no apparent reason for this, I’ve just grown up so far with them. Recently one of them out of nowhere started telling me to ‘shut the fuck up’ because he find my voice annoying, making and laughing at jokes about my father leaving and just making unnecessary snarky comments. Everyone else in the group also acting like sheep and finding the need to laugh along even when it wasn’t moderately funny. 

The basic advice is to always make new friends, but I just can’t. I’m not outgoing and I have no general talents or abilities which enables me to be in a club. It’s much easier than said.

I find it unfair the amount of jokes which are made at my expense. I understand this is your average 14 year old boy humour, but it’s hurtful when they humiliate me, and I often find myself feeling genuinely unhappy. 

Don’t get me wrong either, I do enjoy being with these friends and doing stuff too, It’s difficult to drop people I’ve known for seven years, especially when I have no other group to go to. However I’m exhausted of having to put up with them taking the piss out of any of my interests or just crossing the line, and having it excused as them just being ‘immature’. 

Saying that people grow up doesn’t make up for the fact that I’m feeling mentally tired, because of the people I’m around. Not to mention, anyone above the age of 12 tends to understand that continuously insulting someone you consider a friend isn’t the greatest way to go about things. 

The jokes are also only ever aimed at me, like they respect each other but exclude me. 

I was curious as to know if anyone was in this position when they were my age? And if so what they did / would do about it? Apologies for any mistakes, I’m pretty new to this!",29Jun2020,1
1047,"So my boyfriend and I are taking a break so we can both get our shit together so we can focus on us when we get back together, The thing is, he isn’t very romantic, or emotional in any sense. I don’t know how to tell him that either.  We both love each other, and we’re both working hard so we can do this. But part of me thinks he’s not doing anything to get better either. I’m making active steps to better myself, but I don’t think he is. He has a lack of aspiration, and admitted it. How do I make him less emotionally closed off and help him find aspiration?",29Jun2020,2
1048,My friend and I got close over quarantine. He asked me out like around two months ago. I said I don't want to date anyone for a long time since I had just got out of a relationship please find someone else to date. He has asked me out about three or four different times now I've said no of course. He keeps calling me cute I tell him to stop. He messages me four or five times in a row before I answer asking if I hate him at three in the morning. He's gotten jealous of me talking on the phone with another friend when he wanted to talk to me said I wasn't important to him. He checks my status to see if I've fallen asleep before two in the morning and will message me to go to sleep. He keeps pushing things I don't want to do on me. He keeps saying its cuz of his anxiety and hes worried I dislike him and I have anxiety too so I feel guilty for getting irritated because I understand worrying profusely. Should I be angry or not? Its technically because of his mental health.,29Jun2020,3
1049,"(Me: 16F and him 16M)

I literally cannot tell with this guy. I’ve liked him for a long time but it hasn’t been till recently that we’ve started talking.

Basically, we text a lot sometimes and he always says “I’m bored” or game pigeon’s me or something pathetic.

My mom arranged a birthday thing for me and him and another guy and girl friend. It was the other guy’s birthday too and he’s close friends. He ended up getting me a gift and not him, and remembered my favorite candy. My mom swears this means something but I honestly just think it’s a friend thing because I’d do this with my guy friends.

ANYWAYS... I’m just ranting at this point because there are so many mixed signals and it’s driving me nuts.

I guess most importantly he’s mentioned liking another girl and refuses to tell me because he said they were good friends last year (and I didn’t talk to him last year) and implied they SnapChat and I don’t have SnapChat. I know it’s not me. BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE SAYS IT IS!

Like the more I talk the more I realize he doesn’t. Idk... I’m so confused guys.

I would confess but like it’s Covid time and he’s someone I actively talk to and now’s not the time to ruin that because I’m awkward... He can be awkward. Blah blah blah.",29Jun2020,1

I was trying to win her over. Looking back i'm disgusted in my own behaviour.

I am(17 F) someone who pushes people away even if I like them very much. Showing feelings are a taboo to me and I ruined many relationships because I seemed distant or disinterested. Recently I reconnected with an ex whom I dated on and off for 2-3 months(18 M). We had a rocky relationship but this time I wanted to change my prior mindset but I don’t know how to get to him. He used to complain -and still complains- about how it was one sided before and he constantly felt like as if he had to push me to be affectionate. It was part of the reason we fell out before. But now everytime I try to be more open and show that I care, he gets mean. He told me before that he doesn’t know how to be affectionate or how to react when someone is affectionate towards him. How can I break into him and make him believe that I’m sincere?",29Jun2020,2

At first it wasn’t so bad but now I am scared to even try a lot of simple things that I want to do. It’s pretty pathetic honestly, an example is I like to jump on a trampoline with friends but I am so scared to jump too high and get hurt when I land. I have also attempted to do cartwheels before but I just can’t get the courage to actually bring my feet properly upwards because I am scared I am going to fall into my back. Another example is when I am rock climbing, I am so scared to do anything too daring even when there is a mat underneath me because I am scared that it still might hurt when I hit the ground. I feel like this fear is preventing me from doing things I like and I don’t know what to do.

1058,"Tried posting in relationship advice but got 0 replies over several hours and I need help.

For some background: I am working on my parents farm in order to pay for college and have a place to stay, the problems I’m about to address have been going on for as long as I can remember but recently has gotten worse and is severely affecting my social and mental health. I would like advice as to how to speak with them about the issues I’m having with how I’m treated while I’m living with them.

I generally try to be respectful in our conversations but to no avail, my parents always have to be right in any situation and anything that challenges this is met with being talked over or being punished as if I’m a child.

In the most recent incident my father said something insensitive and I took a little offense to it. To address it I talked in a normal tone of voice and tried to be as respectful as possible when I confronted him. I was met with attacks directed at my shortcomings and things that happened from weeks to months ago, as well as not letting me get any kind of response in because he would raise his voice in order to talk over me, eventually ending with them escalating it to screaming and yelling at me, in which my parents decided to use as an excuse to punish me like a child.

Our “conversations” if you could even call them that always end like this if the parents don’t agree with something being said or if they feel like they’re losing an argument. As someone who deals with severe anxiety attacks this affects me greatly and makes me afraid to leave my room. they use my constant lack of presence in the house as more ammo to use in arguments.

while they are home or awake I can’t have a normal conversation with them without it appealing to their need to be right I just want to know how I’m supposed to deal with this because at this point I’m at my wits end.

I can’t leave because my college is riding on their backs, I can’t confront them because they won’t leave me the basic human decency to hear me out without interrupting and talking over me whenever they hear something they don’t agree with, I just feel trapped and have no idea what I’m supposed to do anymore. I usually try to keep my head down but recently they have been extremely incessant on forcing me into these situations and I’m losing sleep over it.

TLDR: I’m not allowed to have an opinion in any conversation that doesn’t align with theirs, I’m not allowed to be offended by anything they say, and every conversation I have that doesn’t follow these two rules is met with screaming, attacks at my shortcomings and punishments as if I were a child. constant fighting is affecting my mental health.",29Jun2020,6

1061,"Hi everyone. I don’t want to make this a long post so I will keep it short. I am about a couple months away from completing a fellowship. Unfortunately, to work in my department you have to have at least five years experience. Naturally, I am asking other departments who do not have that standard minimum. I’ve been with this company for almost a year so I know quite a few people. 

I’ve made some inquires on position openings and was made aware of some some possible positions. A few colleagues went as far as taking my resume or giving me a person to contact. 

However this one person, completely shut me down and said they were uncomfortable discussing the matter and hung up on me. I asked the same questions I asked everyone else and made sure not to overstep. I was so surprised because this is person and I have a solid work relationship. I know I’m not entitled to an answer but they were so blatantly rude. I fear that I may just accidentally damaged a work connection. In this field, connections mean everything and I will cross paths with this person in the future. I’m sure of it. 

Should I apologize the next time I see them? I genuinely feel I did nothing wrong. It wouldn’t be sincere. It was a bizarre experience and definitely an overreaction on their part.",29Jun2020,1

I've always loved music, I played piano for several years when I was younger but it felt like an extra thing I had to do and saw it as a hobby that I sometimes enjoyed.

Tony always defends me, helps me when in need (rides, advise, support, food, etc) because that’s what friends do. We always talk and hangout. 

I guess her “suspicions” of us sleeping together started a month ago when I was staying the weekend at their apartment, Chloe and I were in their spare bedroom (that’s where I’d sleep when I came over) and I was looking in the mirror, doing my makeup in just my underwear and she was next to me. Tony walked in and started talking to us. Chloe asked why did he feel comfortable in the room while i was in my underwear and he said it wasn’t his first time seeing a phat ass, in jest, of course. He and I laughed but she got a little upset but didn’t say anything else about it. 

After an heated discussion last night, she accused me of sleeping with him because we jumped off the pontoon together while holding hands (that was only so that we could do it together). It was literally us just being silly and having fun. If it were the other way around with a guy that I was dating, I honestly wouldn’t care. I would want my best friend and boyfriend to get along well. She’s also making it uncomfortable for me to even be around Tony now.

But the more i thought about it i realized i didn't hate women or want to swear off love and the human condition. In fact i think i desire it just like the average person my mind tells me, when i least want to think about it, that i want to be held.

1079,"Hi, 24F here.

I just ""broke up"" with the girl I was kinda dating. We were not actually girlfriends, but we were building ""something"". We used to talk all day every day, phone and video calls on Fridays, I used to send her food, small presents, you know.

We didn't became girlfriends because she wasn't sure about what she wanted, she had ended a toxic relationship last year and I understood she was hurt. But I fell in love, I fell in love HARD.

We had some problems, but we overcame them. Or so I thought.

Today she has just told me that she has been talking with someone else, and this new girl is making her feel things I couldn't make her feel. She told me that she likes me but only as a friend. Last Thursday we spent some time together, in her car, hugging and kissing, and she was telling me that she wanted to hear my heart, everything was so romantic... She just told me that it was just an impulse, and that it shouldn't have happened because it gave me false hopes. We still talked on Friday, she sent me a song and I read her a story to sleep.

And now we're over because this new girl is making her feel things. I'm not angry, I'm just sad but also kinda glad that now I'm sure nothing will happen between us.

The thing is, how do I get over this breakup if I don't have anything to distract myself? I can't leave the house, I can't hang out with my friends, my life right now is only home office and I'm so tired... What do I do? What do I do with all this love I still feel for her?

It's sad that this new girl is making her feel all those things in such a short time, and I wasn't able to do it during these 6 months we spent together..

Any advice is appreciated!",29Jun2020,1
1080,"I will make this as short as possible, but there needs to be some background information.

I've had the job I'm at currently since 2012. I left my old job to work here; I had no issue performing my duties but the extra stuff you tend to have to deal with got overwhelming. I LOVE my current job but I am working below my ability and training level. 

I am currently on maternity leave and this is supposed to continue until January 2021.

I have some health issues that are not resolved. I am awaiting surgery but because of covid it keeps getting rescheduled. I'm hoping to have this dealt with in July but I have no solid answers. 

My current mental state is not great. I have no real explanation for this apart from I'm just drowning in all the little things adding up, baby hormones etc. I feel like emotionally I am at my max.

The situation: this morning my boss called me to offer me a promotion. It would be salary instead of wage and would be a raise. It is a new position in my company so I would be having to do all the foot work in making this new program function. My hours would be about the same and I would have time to deal with the extra work load but I would probably end up having to do some work at home. I would have increased benefits and holidays.  It is the job that I was trained to do so it would be within my ability to do well.  Down the road it is also a dream of mine to have this job.

The catch is I have to let her know tomorrow and I would have to be back at work in August, cutting my mat leave by 4 months.  Because I have health issues that aren't resolved and my emotional state is not great I am leaning towards turning her down.  I love being a mom and ideally I would love to stay at home but that's not financially feasible.  If I say no, I will continue to work there in the position that I already hold. I am very concerned that I am just feeling badly about this promotion because my emotional state is not 100% and I don't want to cut my mat leave short. I am generally very well grounded and practical - I am surprised at how much this is tearing me up.

1085,"I just turned 20. In high school I was a ""naturally"" smart student and often would get good grades despite not trying as hard as some of my peers. After graduating I took a year off from school and spent some time in another state mostly working and going to live music events. I returned and began college, but it didn't go well. I just failed my entire spring semester and I'm not sure if I want to even pursue college, I'm mostly just doing it because my mother wants me to. It would be one thing if I didn't want to go to school to pursue something else, but I literally have no interests. As soon as I DO find something I'm interested in, I quickly get defeated over my inexperience and lack of understanding of whatever the activity/subject is. I genuinely think it all boils down to my lack of work ethic. I have been religiously working out almost every day for about three years now. When I say ""working out"", I mean I go to a gym. I don't always actually stay because I often lose interest, get distracted, lose my motivation, etc., and it is crushing me. I know that you just have to ""do the thing"" in order to not rely on motivation, but I can't train my brain to actually commit. 

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I fix my lack of work ethic? How can I find interest in challenge? I have constant anxiety about not being productive, but I absolutely hate working and get defeated so incredibly easy. I'm aware that this is a mental weakness, but any advice really helps.

1086,"My brother (26) opened to me today and told me he tried to commit suicide about two months ago. He took a cocktail of 24 pills, but he said his body just automatically purged them. 

He was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about a year ago and went to a therapist for a short period of time. He eventually went on the recommended medication, which did not agree with his body at all. 

They had some major side effects and so was advised to go off them. He decided to go off them cold turkey, which I have since learnt is not advisable. I, therefore, asked him where he got the pills he tried to OD with and he said he was given a prescription by a doctor. Would a doctor prescribe drugs that could be used to OD on to someone who has clear signs of depression? We are based in the UK and from what I know of the medical system here, it is pretty robust when it comes to prescribing drugs, but I am open to being corrected.

He says he has suffered from sleep paralysis (though not for quite some time now) and hallucinations (told me he still suffers from this today). He said he sees people coming into his room and then leave. It usually lasts a couple of minutes and he feels anxious whilst it's happening.

Though I am glad he trusts me enough to open to me about his attempted suicide, I am lost. I don't know what else I can do to be supportive other than telling him that I am there for him and that I am contactable at any time of the day. He said he hasn't told anyone else about this, but did end the call by saying he will go to see a doctor tomorrow about a possible referral to a new therapist.

I'm based in the UK and I've been on furlough since Easter. My company works within live events so it's looking pretty unlikely that we'll have any shows until 2021. 

Today my boss called me and has asked me to consider a part-time contract until 2021 as they can no longer keep me on furlough according to the government (supposedly). I'm currently on a full-time contract and have been receiving 80% of my salary (my company hasn't topped up the extra 20%).

I've checked the government website and I can't see anything mentioning a limit on how many people can be furloughed so I'm a bit confused. Is my boss lying to me?

1097,"FYI: this definitely is not as serious as the other stuff on this subreddit, but I could still use some advice...

I'm fourteen and have older siblings that moved out of my house awhile ago (my sister is 28 and lives in Oregon, and my brother is 25 and is currently in Utah with his girlfriend and her family). When my siblings are home, things are perfectly fine between everyone, but unfortunately, the times when my full family is together are few and far between.

 Normally everything is fine, just the usual me waking up late, playing video games with my friends, my parents telling me to do something, and me working out and then going on my phone and chilling the rest of the day. That's the normal day. (In fact, things seemed to be going better than usual, as my dad was letting me build my own gaming pc, and my mom and I were getting along a little better.)

However, every once in a while things go south. Normally what happens on those days is I do something that doesn't seem that bad at first, but then explodes into high tensions in my house. Today was one of those days. My mom asked for me to get the mail, as it was about to rain, and I, who was super hungry at the time, pointed out that pleases go a long way. In hindsight it was pretty petty and dumb, but whatever- I was really hungry and have been pretty sad lately about my brother, who was staying with us for about a month during quarantine, being gone. I went out and got the mail, and pointed out again to my mother that thank you's go a long way. That prompted her to take my phone, and send me up to my room.

After a little while, she came up to my room and told me that I could not talk to her like that, and how I was being disrespectful, stuff that I was expecting to hear. But then she said something that struck me a little differently. She said, ""we are not peers, we are not friends. So do not talk to me like I am."" I'm not sure if I am overreacting about that line, but I feel like for a parent-child relationship to work they kind of have to be friends. 

Then came dinner- It started with my dad lecturing me about how I spend to much time on screens, and that it is making my attitude worse (not the first time I've heard it, won't be the last), and how I need to take my headphones out because they are constantly in, and I can't interact with anyone (whenever I am home and not playing video games or watching youtube, I am listening to music, I don't think its a bad thing). After that, the rest of dinner was silence.

I wish we could have an actual conversation, but the three of us are so stubborn that we end up just repeating our opinions louder than the last person. So I guess what I am asking is: Am I overreacting? Is this just a bad night and I do not have to address it in the future? What should I do to stop this from happening in the future? Did I do anything wrong? I am pretty stuck here, and do not have anyone in my house I can talk to about it, so really any advice, comments, questions, concerns would be much appreciated.

Thanks!",29Jun2020,2

1100,"So I have been seeing a psychologist during a few months before lockdown (the closest to a therapist in my region and she helps me with social anxiety) and I don't feel comfortable of talking to her on the phone so I'm basically alone since the quarantine started. The first few monts were okay, not better or worse than usually at school. 


Recently though I have done self harm and I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. Even my anxiety is worse. Yesterday I had a panic attack because some people were visiting my parents at home and I wasn't aware of it so I locked myself in the bathroom during one hour and when I finally came out I spent the entire day in my bed because it had exhausted me. 
I told my friend and she helped me so much while I was have the panic attack. 

The thing is that I need help right now, and I can't talk about it with any of my friends because I am so afraid of annoying them since I already talked about it yesterday.  I am always negative, it must be really boring for them. I know they would want to help but I'm just too scared of being annoying again. 


Also as background information I have never been diagnosed with depression but I experience a lot of the symptoms like: bad sleep schedule (I have never been like that before), bad eating habits, weight loss, feeling empty, and not having motivation to do basic things. All I do is laying in bed all day long while listening to music. Today I got up to draw a little bit and I took it as an accomplishment even though it was literally nothing to be proud of. 


Also, I don't know if it makes sense but all the things happening in the world right now are making me even more sad. Especially, BLM. I grew up thinking the world was perfect and now I just realized that it isn't. I'm honestly so selfish. People are victim of racism everyday and I'm here, making everything about myself again. I don't know how to explain, I hope you understood what I mean. 


It took me a lot of courage to post here. I often use this subreddit when I need that kind of help and I delete the posts right after because I feel like I made people lose their time. Today is just worse than ever so I decided to post again.


I don't even know what type of advice I need, I just feel like I need to be heard. I am always talking about myself in this rant, I am really sorryaif this comes out as selfish (it probably is). If you read all of that thank you, I hope you have a good day.

1103,"So I sold my 2000 Mustang with 185k miles on it this past weekend. I sold it for $1,200. It served me well for the roughly 7 months I had it, but it was still an obviously old and very used car. I was only asking $1,300 for it on Facebook and when a guy came and offered $1,200 for it, I took it. 

There are a lot of cosmetic issues with the car, all of which are obvious, but the car has run well for me. I even drove it from Philadelphia(where I live) to Dover to check out another car recently before I bought a new car. 

Back to the sale, the guy and his buddy were excited for the car(its old and clunky but still a Mustang). 2 hours after we parted way, he messaged me on Facebook saying he couldn't get the oil cap off and might want a refund. Obviously no one would give a refund but I told him the cap is fine and he said it's cool. Then he said it was overheating. Then he said it wouldnt start, then it died. Not he just texted me that it wont stop overheating and I finally had to block him. 

The car never overheated for me once. Not even when I basically drove it for 5 straight hours 2 weeks ago. I felt bad for the kid if things werent going well which is why I kept responding but its stressing me out and I had to block him. It's been 2 and a half days of this. 

I feel really guilty about ghosting him and I dont know why. It's a 20 year old car in obviously mediocre condition. It was 1,200 bucks. I bought the same car for $1,300 in November and I just expected to have to put some money into it at some point, wouldn't anyone? I know this is kind of a rant but I just feel like a dick. It's a private used car sale, nobody gives refunds for those. It is what it is, I'm sorry you may be having bad luck with it but I'm not even good with cars, I dont know what to tell you, man, take it to a mechanic.

1109,"This weekend I got an invitation by my dear sister and her friend to go out and grab a few drinks with them at a new bar outside of town.
Both of they are two lovely and fun girls so I wouldn't mind spending time with them. 
However, they are both very, very beautiful. I'm talking ""runway-model"" drop dead gorgeous. I'm not beautiful. Im not gonna go into details but Im really fucking ugly. 

The issue here isn't that they are beautiful, but that my self esteem is just really terrible, and hanging out with people that remind me of everything I am not and will never be just  makes me feel horrible. 
I have been out with them before. I ended up sitting beside them, and two guys were literally leaning over me while talking to them, like I was completely invisible. Three other guys stood in front of us, also trying to get their attention. 
What worse is that one of these gorgeous girls also happens to be my sister, and everytime we are out people comment on how we don't look a like. No shit. Someone once even asked me how it feels ""to be the ugly one"". I cried when I got home that night. I always get compared to her. 

At the place were going a guy I used to like is working. I don't care for him much anymore because he's not very nice. I'm not nervous about him seeing me, but I'm nervous because I know he'll love my sister and her friend. He has previously told me straight up he finds me unattractive. The thought of my previous crush just falling head over heels with my sister, while finding me unattractive just really breaks my heart. I don't even like the guy anymore, so I shouldn't care, but this kind of situation is just the perfect example of the difference between my sister and I. She gets the attention, while I get called ugly or ignored.  

I honestly want to go out because I enjoy their company, but my insecurities always become worse when I see how I different the outside world treats me compared to them. I feel like shit every time. 


Should I go, and try to forget my insecurities or should I decline the invitation? Suggesting we do something else will not work, because they have already agreed to going out together at that place since my sister has really been looking forward to trying their drinks out.

I’ve tried to convince her to give me more time, as well as put me on the adult filter, but she won’t agree to it.

1113,"TL;DR - My confidence is forced up or down based on how well I'm doing with things on any given day. I'm sick of it and I need to get some intrinsic self-confidence that lasts.  


To sum up, my confidence has always been on the low side. However, I feel that at least in some respects, I used to have self-confidence. For a bunch of reasons I won't go into here, though (mostly because I don't feel like typing more than I need to right now and want to spare anyone who reads this all the details), I experienced a massive loss of self-confidence starting my Sophomore year of High School. This took an even bigger nose dive in 2008 and then again in 2010 it got even lower.  


Increasingly, since this all started, my ""self-confidence"" has operated pretty much like this: If I'm doing well (like with work, hobbies, relationships, etc.) on a given day, I feel confident. If, the very next day or even the same day, I experience a downfall in how well I'm doing, I no longer feel confident. I've come to realize more and more over the past year that I need to find self-confidence that is intrinsic and that won't go away just because I have one bad day or even if I'm in a bit of a slump. Here's the thing, though: I don't know where to get it. I don't think I could even find it if my very life depended on it.  


This affects my ability to do even the simplest things. For instance, at my Summer job, I probably had the worst day of work I've ever had yesterday (and I've had like 10-12 jobs since I first started working 13 years ago). I got my first written warning because of some chronic issues in my performance. Without going into too much detail, I then made that same type of mistake AGAIN even though I was deliberately trying to avoid making it! About an hour before I got off work, a couple of things went down that, although in at least one of those cases I had the necessary knowledge and skills to rectify the problem, my confidence was so darn low and I was so afraid of screwing up again that I just locked up in my head. My supervisor had to come back to work after she had gotten off to rectify the problem and give me reminders of what to do because I was so petrified of screwing up that I didn't know where to began to try to do anything, and she was, understandably, very displeased. I'm actually requesting to transfer to a different department at work because I'm such a gargantuan liability in the department where I do work. Once I start tripping over myself, I feel like I just can't stop doing it again and again. It's like a feedback loop.  


I can't keep living with this up-down pattern of confidence that's so dependent on how well I'm doing on any given day. I need to be able to keep my confidence through the good days AND the bad, especially given that I'm going into education as a (hopefully) long-term career. However, I'm so accustomed to living this way that I'm not even sure how to have intrinsic self-confidence that lasts. I KNOW in my head deep down that I DO have strengths, abilities, talents, and good qualities, but I don't actually FEEL confident even when I focus on those strengths. I see a Psychiatrist a couple times a year for anxiety, but I've been thinking of, in the next couple months (got a lot potentially coming up career-wise in the Fall so I want to see what happens first), maybe supplementing that by seeing a therapist now and then. I have people in my life I can talk to, but I feel like I need some professional guidance. In the meantime, though, has anybody here had to rediscover their intrinsic self-confidence? How did you go about starting that journey? Thank you.",29Jun2020,1

1117,"Throwaway account to keep my anonymity.

Context. Recently a very close friend (complicated relationship even?) of mine who I've known for several years started streaming on twitch. Trying to be supportive I've made sure to show up to nearly all of the streams to help boost the view count and sometimes add things to the chat. This friend made a discord as the community grew a little bit and looked to joining other discords with the purpose of meeting new streamers. The friend started spending more and more time outside of the stream with these new found friends and had less and less time for myself. At first I struggled with this but have since found more fun with new friends of myself.

All of these friends were mutuals of the first friend and I quickly found myself in a situation where I was spending more time with the new people than the old.

Fast forward until tonight and Friend B expressed to me that they felt uncomfortable in Friend A's discord as it has became more and more dominated by fans and simp like behaviour. I had previously left the discord without mentioning it because I too felt uncomfortable. Friend B explained that they were planning on talking to Friend A about it but was really worried it'd be seen as a lack of support for Friend A's streaming. I, still having the burden of explaining why I left too on my shoulders, went behind Friend B's back and expressed these concerns to Friend A.

I thought as, I've known Friend A for so long and we've always shared everything that was going on with each other, that it would be understandable for people to want to leave. I expressed both my feelings and the feelings on Friend B without telling Friend B, to Friend A. Friend A now feels incredible hurt and betrayed by friends not wanting to support them.

Everything started to blow up in my face as I thought there was room for friends outside streaming. Friend A went on to kick Friend B from the discord server.

I immediately confessed what I had done to Friend B and am currently now stuck feeling remorse and as if I've lost two friends.

It's super late in our timezone and everyone needs to sleep but I'm unsure as to how to proceed or what to do. It's stressing me out and I don't know where the correct place to express this would be.",29Jun2020,1

1119,"I have been diagnosed a few months ago with genital wards, and it's all over my anus. The docter said that it was a really large number.

They gave me a cream (veregen) that is supposed to help but it doesn't work. I already signed up for the surgery but I have to wait 6 months.

The pain is so heavy that I can't sleep, eat or think about anything else. Also do I feel very ashamed and it's taking a toll on my mental health.

Does anyone know what I can do to reduce the pain or even get them to go away?",29Jun2020,3
1120,"(I just turned 20 and my boyfriend is 27) I love my boyfriend and I always support him. I also always attend his family get togethers all the time and have formed a bond with his family, but when it comes to his co workers I truly don’t feel the need to meet them or hang out. He works as a barber and since me moving out here (we met long distance) I only met his boss and his wife once awkwardly passing by in a mall and it was just a hi and bye basis. From what he tells me about his coworkers they all seem to be thirsty men who cheat on there wives and smoke/drink on the job. 

Some of them say they want to meet me but I’m pretty sure their only purpose of meeting me is to see if I’m pretty or if I have a nice body, I’m sure of it. His boss has a little get together for the 4th of July and I genuinely don’t want to go. The thing about it is that a his co workers are a lot older than me (early 30’s to late 30’s) and they’re all men and some might bring their wives. I’m a lot younger than them so I know I won’t relate to them and I feel like the whole situation would just make me uncomfortable and awkward the whole time.

1125,"So I’m an 18 year old guy and used to be pretty healthy. Since February, I have had a lot of problems with my stomach. I get very full after eating very little (a small fry will fill me up to the point of pain). I can’t go without eating because I get extremely bloated as soon as I feel a small amount of hunger and have to literally walk out of classes and work to go to a bathroom and let all the gas out. It begins with a general feeling of being bloated which I can somewhat withstand and then progresses to the point where I’m trying hard not to scream. I come back to my desk and ten minutes later the gas is back and I have to walk out again. It’s fucking embarrassing when people ask where I’m going and I have to make something different up every time because I don’t want them to know that I need the bathroom every few minutes. When I’m in the bathroom I am bent over with waves of pain that last a minute or two and then relief for 2 minutes which usually goes on for 5-10 minutes. I’m also tired (not to the point of exhaustion but enough to notice) pretty much all the time.

I’m planning to visit a private doctor rather than a GP to get this fast tracked since it’s now affecting my daily life pretty significantly. In the meantime, does anybody have a clue what is wrong with me?",29Jun2020,1
1126,"I (26 M) recently got accepted to a school overseas. I would start in September and move probably a week or two before so I can get adjusted. That would put me in mid to late August for my move. 

I currently work at an early childhood center where I've been getting ""dicked over"" for the last few years. Having 2-3 times the legal ratio in my class when I've been by myself, having 9 or 10 year olds in my class as favors to the parents, working 8+ hour shifts without a break, having close to 30 children when mine and my coteacher have a maximum ratio of 24, etc. are just a few things I've had to put up with. I've been miserable for a few years but have been able to keep a happy face on while at work. Today, for instance, I worked 8 straight hours without a break and when I told my boss about it I was told that I could stay an additional hour past my scheduled time and then they could squeeze in a break in what would have been the last hour of my original shift (I worked 7:30-3:30 and they said at 2:30 [after I initiated the conversation] that I could get a break from like 2:45 to 3:45 but I'd have to stay until 4:30). 

I have enough money to last out a month, but that would put a strain on my available funds for when I'm studying abroad. I'm going to have to submit a letter of resignation soon, anyways, so should I just put in my last three weeks and use the rest of my time here in the US saying goodbye to friends and family or should I just tough it out.

1128,"My mom will be Mom

My Dad will be Dad.

The person my Mom is cheating with will be Him.

I'm 13M  
I don't know when it started. I found out about it sometime late last year. I was on my computer in the basement, and my Mom was talking to somebody. It was in an area of the house where people don't really pay attention to. But she was talking to Him about something. I only caught parts of the conversation, but I knew she was cheating. At first I thought that it was somebody she knew well or something, but I doubt it. One time she said she was going to go meet Him somewhere, and then she left to go buy groceries. I don't know how I feel about that.  
 She also only talks to Him when nobody is around, or early in the morning when everybody is asleep. I'm the only one she seems comfortable to talk to him around. Maybe because she knows I'm not good at dealing with this stuff, or maybe because she knows I won't do anything about it. She just talks to Him as if I wasn't even there. I don't know if it's that I'm invisible or something, but she seems fine talking to Him in front of me. She even says ""I love you"" to Him in front of me.   
I remember this one time  we were at the dump to drop off some useless stuff. I dumped the stuff off, and when I got back she was talking to Him. It was just me and her in the car. She said a bunch of stuff. Talked to Him about her getting a job. She said some ""I love you's"". She hung up. I was going to ask her about it, but then she gave me $15 for helping her. In a way, I felt like I was being bribed not to talk about it. I don't normally get money for doing things, so whenever I do, I start to feel happy. I didn't know what to feel then. My emotions were just messed up. I sat there in silence the whole ride home. Didn't even end up keeping the $15 anyways.  
Everytime I see her or hear her, I can't help but remember what she is doing behind my family's back. It makes me so angry that she is risking the life that she has for somebody else. It's like she doesn't even care about the fact that if somebody else found out, her kids might be affected too.   
Once I caught her on the phone with Him. She was talking about how when my Dad gets angry or something, she can always turn to Him. It just makes me so pissed off how she trusts him instead of my Dad. They should just talk it out. My Dad does get mad easily, but I think that they should talk and see if something can be done about that.  
She doesn't seems to be calling him as much, but that might be because I'm always in my room.  
All this is just so messed up. I don't want to deal with this right now, because one of my friends has severe depression, my grades in school seem to be getting lower and my happiness meter just seems to be going down. I just can't deal another problem right now. My emotions are a mess right now. I feel so pissed off at her, but at the same time I love her. She's my Mom. I don't want this to end badly. I just want her to stop seeing Him. If she ends it soon, then I can forget about it. I'll be happy. Is there anyway to get her to stop without having to tell anybody? Or at least something to help my happiness meter go up?  
Any help, opinions or advice is welcome. Thank you so much for reading.",29Jun2020,2
1129,"I (16 F) had my boyfriend visit me in the town I’m in, because during the summer I’m at my dads and grandparents house for two months. When he came to visit me, I hung out with him in his hotel room some of the time, and even though we didn’t do much i guess it was enough to leave a very, very subtle mark on my neck. 

Today is the first day after him being gone, and I had my hair in a bun downstairs at my grandparents house. My grandpa said “what’s that on your neck, a hickey?” And not in a playful way, in an insulting, judgemental, intentionally hurtful way. I immediately went to a mirror and could barely find anything, and it was only when I went upstairs that I found it; a faint, faint mark next to my hairline and in my baby hairs.

Honestly, I’m not even sure if it’s a mark or a sunburn or whatever, but what matters is that my grandpa has already made his assumptions, and I’ve been upstairs crying for hours. I overheard him call me disgusting. I feel like my boundaries have been crossed and like my privacy has been invaded, and I know I don’t deserve to feel bad about what I choose to do, but I can’t help but want to shrink down as small as possible and hide from everything. I feel so, so disgusting and I don’t know how to cope with it.",29Jun2020,2
1130,"So about 5 minutes ago I had an argument with my sister about how my nephew acted over this weekend. My nephew is 7 while I am 12. What happened was that my nephew was over at my house and he said to me that he wanted to play Minecraft dungeons on my console. I was playing another game on ranked and couldn’t leave, I said no. He got so mad that he started calling me names but, I am used to it(he has autism). It didn’t bother me, but then he started hitting me really hard so I had to do something( weeks  ago my sister said to him that he shouldn’t hit and even had the conversation not to long before she had to do it again, obviously he didn’t listen). 

I told him to get out of my room but, then he started calling me even more names and hitting me more but, I didn’t do anything because his mother or my sister would say “he’s only 7 and he has autism” btw I am very unhappy with my body so the words he told me hurt but, not as bad when I thought that love him a lot. He then tried to turn off my console because of that and I stopped him before he could do it. I really got mad and yelled at him to get out of my room. He then went to my mom and said that I was being mean to him. My mom then started calling me to come the living room so she could ask me if I were being mean, said no. I explained to her what happened on the way back to my room I told my nephew I was going to let him play the game because, I felt bad but, since he lied I wasn’t going to let him play. Then later we started to play loteria which is this game like bingo but with objects on the card and with money. 

My nephew knew that I was away from my room so, he tried to go in and try to play my console and even started a mission, I then went to check if I needed to see if I had enough money to continue playing and before I went in my room my nephew escaped the room and saw my console turned on and my monitor I immediately knew it was him and told his mom which then she responded with “ he is just a kid” and then said to my nephew “when your uncle comes over don’t let him use your stuff”. Just keep in thought that she is 28-29 years old and graduated uni and got her bachelors degree. I also ask her and my nephew if I can play their console and I don’t get mad if they say no. So I immediately thought how stupid she is for telling him that. Then today I went to her house so I could tell my nephew if he wanted to come today and play since I did not feel in the mood to do ranked, I then went to tell my sister that if he could come over and right before I asked her she asked me if I had a good time playing loteria I replied with no and explained why. 

She then started saying that I should’ve let him play and to let him in my room I then said if he didn’t have to call me names and slap me I would then she said that he doesn’t care about me and just cares for the game. I wouldn’t be able to respond to  that or I would have basically killed her and she also gave me another reason why I didn’t let him. 

I then told her how she should teach him not to say things like that she said” you should just remember that he is different and is just a kid” she doesn’t know that she can’t use that excuse when I am a kid to. She then started saying I have anger issues but, my anger was already like over 4 months old and couldn’t keep it in any more. She then started to say how I am his uncle and should not do things like tell him to get out of my room. I then brought up how that I am different by slapping my self on my thigh and because I am basically fat the slap was loud. I then left her house but before I yelled that he is not my nephew anymore and I don’t want to be related to him. 

What should I do should I apologize or just not do anything about it and never talk to my nephew like an uncle. I need guidance.",29Jun2020,0
1131,"I’m going to try to keep this short in case posting about COVID is against the rules and this gets deleted. 

My boyfriend has asthma. I’ve seen him need his inhaler when he first moved in to my place with cats that he is a little allergic to, he hasn’t needed it since and it’s been about 3 months. 

His grandma who lives about 10hrs away is dying and its almost a guarantee we will be exposed to COVID going to see her/his family because his grandfather and cousins have not been practicing social distancing or wearing masks. Some medical issues happened with his grandmother and this is coming as a surprise. I told him we should do it because it’s one of those things I think he would regret not doing. But I also am thinking my boyfriend wouldn’t die if he got COVID, I’m thinking he would end up in the hospital for a bit. 

It’s unfortunate circumstances and I just thought I’d ask the strangers on the internet before making this decision. 

Some other things: 

-if his grandmother does die, he probably won’t get to see her before due to visitation restrictions at the hospital. He did say going and being with his family would help him process and grieve, and if he stayed home it wouldn’t really hit him that she’s gone. 

-he was close with his grandmother

1133,"29M For most of my life I was pretty religious. Went to a small Christian college and have worked at a few different Christian organizations since then. Over the last few years, I have stepped away from the faith (I am happy with that choice, I do not need advice telling me to return to faith) but I am still working for a missionary organization, as with most faith based nonprofits, I ended up doing several jobs, copywriter, grant writer, videographer, Audio /Video editor, and now I am doing data management for them, but I have never felt like I was great at any of those, I was good enough for church work, not real professional work. When I believed in their mission it was different, I could convince myself I was making some sort of difference, but now I just hate it, it is causing me stress to the point of anxiety disorders and heart issues and is the only thing I have energy for. I feel like my work history and education are only useful in the religious sector, and that's where most of my contacts are, so I feel like I need to go back to school. 

Everywhere I have ever worked I've ended up a sudo I.T. guy, fixing computer problems, and I actually like that work, it makes me feel helpful and I have a nack for helping the tech challenged amoung us in a way that isn't condescending or frustrating. Do I quit and go get an I.T. certification from my local community college, and take a few electives in audio engineering (of all the random work I've done for churches and missions orgs, running sound has always been the one I actually enjoyed) or stick it out a few more years.

A part of me loves nonprofit work, just not religious nonprofit work anymore, but I don't know how to even get in the door with local secular nonprofits other than volunteering and with my current work I don't have the energy or capacity to volunteer (I have a chronic health condition and struggle with fatigue as a result, so don't have much energy after working and weekends are just spent recovering from the week)

1135,"I used to think I had a happy family until this year. My parents always split to do their own thing. My mom would have a hobby and she’d take me with her and my dad would take my brother to help out the “family business” at this karate studio and it would be like that maybe once a week. The other days out of the week I would stay with my dad and my brother until closing which was around 9. My dad passed away when I was 13 and my brother was 15, he was a very ‘my way or the highway’ (no TikTok pun included) type of guy. Always said I couldn’t date til I was 30 blah blah well I found out after he died that he used to chew but he wouldn’t chew around us because my mom ‘didn’t want us around that’ so my dad would be in a bad mood. Growing up my dad loved pressure points and he’d always pinch my brother and my neck whenever we needed discipline. 

Recently my brother and I have been getting much closer and it’s been great! Since most of our childhood we really didn’t have each other. Talking to him he said our dad used to make sure my brother wasn’t gay. Which infuriates me because he used to say he would prefer I be a lesbian so I wouldn’t date guys. My dad use to ask my brother “are you a f****t?” Or “spongebobs gay, are you gay? Then why are you watching it”. He once pulled my ‘troublemaker’ cousin into the back of the karate studio for back talking him and hit her. Idk how but she yelled. I once back talked him and he didn’t talk to me for a few days. My mom had to tell him to talk to me again. 

And my brother, my dad used to make him do karate move until he cried. He told my mom he didn’t want to go back but she said “it’s what your dad wants” but when I wanted to quit a dance class, my mom took me out as soon as she could.

Now I’m starting to resent my mom, I’m trying not to because I’m sure parenting is hard but I know she’s bottled so much inside herself that she’s taking it out on us. 

After my dad died my family went separate ways, my mom went out with her friends, my brother with his, I didn’t really have any friends so I was home by myself a lot. My brother apologized for leaving me alone during that time and it was really nice to hear that.

About a year and a half later my mom and I moved in with her boyfriend and I got into a relationship with this boy during HS and didn’t tell my mom but she found out through the school (PDA lol) and she confronted me crying and told me “what would your father think” a couple years later she told me she only said that so I would get out of the relationship because I told her before that I didn’t want to be in a relationship with someone so that was her way of getting me out of it. I guess she also say that to my brother because he was saying hi to all his friends during his graduation and my mom was upset he wasn’t around the family during the time. Which he was. 

Fast forward to this year and my brother and I are confronting her about police brutality and racism (she works for search and rescue which is kind of attached to law enforcement) and we might have been a little to harsh on her and she started to cry and say “if your dad was here he’d beat both of your asses” like great! My parents are the reason why I have so many problems and I didn’t even know it until this year! But now that I know my source I can get better on improving myself. 

I wish I could bring this up to her in a way that would cope both of us but I feel like she’s going to get defensive and cry. It hurts so much to see her cry.",29Jun2020,1

Now when I asked him about how he got to know the same, he said that it was cos he is very good at the art of deduction. I didn’t give much thought about it and moved on.
