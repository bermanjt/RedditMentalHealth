1,"I'm a housekeeper at a hotel in a smaller town, mostly corporate travelers and it's pretty dead this time of year. There is maybe 10 housekeepers in total and I've only been working about 2 or 3 days a week the past couple months. I've worked here for about 2 years now and I'm ready to get a different job. I already have one set up but I just dont know how to quit. I'm pretty shy and nervous of how this will go and this is my first job so I've never quit a job before. I feel like writing a whole letter putting in my two weeks is over the top, but I dont want to show any disrespect and just dissapear. I'm just nervous and wanted to know what's normal for a small job like this.

2,"This all started when I (15M) took a part time job at a local cafeteria a few weeks ago. It is my first ever job so it will take some getting used to.

Anyway about the déjà vu's. At first they didn't happen while i was doing something, but rather when i think back on something. Whenever i would think about how i talked to somebody at the job or certain things happening i would get this déjà vu feeling. I didn't care though. But then it started happening on a daily basis. I even get the feeling while doing the activity itself sometimes. And not just from experiences at work, but also at home now. It is getting really annoying. It feels like i've done everything before and it makes everything so dull and boring.

I apologize in advance if this isn't the right sub but i couldn't find anything better. So how the fuck can i get rid of these déjà vu's?",03Jan2020,1
4,"I've been living in my apartment for about 4 months now. There are 3 beds and 2 baths. The rooms are somewhat similar in footspace, except 1 which has its own private bath. My room has the smallest closet space and shares the bathroom with one other girl. One of the roommates (who I share a bathroom with) is moving out and is trying to find a replacement for her spot on the lease. When she posted the room on craigslist, I realized that she was paying more than I was due to her room having more closet space. I went back to check the lease to see how much the total rent was per month and was surprised to find out that the remaining amount was equal to the amount that I'm paying now for my room. This means that the girl who has a bigger closet and a private bathroom is paying the same amount per month as I am. I brought this up with her and she said that was how much the rent was when she moved in and hasn't changed since.

I don't think this is fair financially, but am unsure if this is something I should even try to change since we all signed on to the lease and didn't have this conversation before then. I may have to just wait this out until the lease is over and bring it up again then. Any other thoughts on how to address this immediately or if this is a lost cause for the remainder of the lease?",03Jan2020,1
6,"Hey reddit, 

So for the past few months I’ve been seriously considering a move to San Francisco, it’s always been in my head but now that I’m older and working, I’d like to make this a possibility. A little background, I’ve lived in my current city with my parents for most of my life, but was born in San Francisco. I would really love to head back there for maybe a year or more, mostly just to experience something other than where I live, but also to get my head straight and spend more time with family I really see maybe once every few years when I visit. If I did this move, I would not be going somewhere brand new, I would be going to a place that’s essentially my 2nd home, and I’d be surrounded by both sets of grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, 2nd cousins, and family friends, all of whom I have a good relationship with. I am currently about to leave for SF for a few weeks before my spring semester starts, but in that time I plan out scoping it out and making my final decision as to whether or not I want to commit.

Currently I’m a college student, I pick up shifts at my job when I can and usually am I able to rack up 400-500 dollars/2 weeks. I also have a good amount put away that I plan to continue adding to. My goal would be to make this happen around mid summer, or early fall. As for school, my parents are completely against me taking a year off- I promised to myself and promised to them that I would go back to school, whether it be in California, or back in my city. Their argument is that it’ll prolong my time and college and I’m willing to do that if I could spend up to a year just getting my head straight and learning new tools tin life that aren’t necessarily academic. I also have other personal reasons. All in all, any advice with this situation?",03Jan2020,1
9,"Sorry for bad grammar I'm German.
To give you some background information:
I am male and bisexual since i had sex with a good (also male) friend of mine, two years ago and since then I have been always having fantasies about him and jerked off to the thought of our sex. We get along pretty good since then and I have always been wondering how his feeling towards me and his sexuality are, since we never talked a word about it. I didn't come out to anyone until 2 days ago, where we both got drunk (new years) and he told me he does not know about his sexuality but that he is probably bisexual. Then I told him I felt the same way...i cant remember the rest of our conversation because I was too drunk.
Now I think about how I want to approach him and ask him to have sex again but I can't decide how I want to do that.
So my questions are: 
Do you think he would be willing to have sex with me again and how should I approach him about it?",03Jan2020,1
10,"I moved to be with my boyfriend and I now live with him and his family. I really enjoy the time we have together after being in a long distance relationship for over 2 years. The only trouble is his sister is a terrorist. Important context is that she has always been ""off."" She regularly steals random shit (mostly food) from us and is extremely defensive over it. If you make any claim of wrongdoing she will start a shouting match. I have a full time job and most of this trouble personally has been when I wake up and my breakfast has been stolen. Ruins my entire day. She has recently gotten SSDI with their mother as the payee. Last evening when she was caught attempting to steal fries off our dinner she got into a shouting match with my boyfriend which later turned into a one sided screeching match which then ended with her breaking our toaster then ranting to herself about how ""we wont get a dime she isnt paying for the stupid toaster."" Any form of confrontation we bring to her is returned with this kind of backlash. The mother is tired and wants us to deal with these problems face to face instead of involving her in solutions. I have bought locks for the fridge and given them to the mother (who owns the fridge) to help combat her eating a days worth of meals for all 4 of us.  She is afraid to violate any laws that protect the disabled. We do also have another smaller fridge (without a freezer) that she would have access to that could suit her needs. I am now buying an entirely new fridge since my meals keep getting stolen and I am sick of eating only boxed or canned foods that we keep locked in our room. Everything in this house now has locks to prevent theft and destruction. My boyfriend does not want to leave his mother and move out and we cannot afford rent in our area.

I honestly think I need to learn how to be like that a bit more. But there is only one thing I have to complain about. And that is his bathroom/ bedroom. He lives on his own, and I live with four room mates, so I usually go to his place since there’s more privacy.  Quite literally I have to wipe down the toilet seat with a Clorox wipe to even use the bathroom. It quite literally looks like he shits standing up. I clean it every time I go to sit down, and every time I go back, there’s something on the seat. His sink always has old dried spit in it. And his bathtub.... I don’t even shower when I stay the weekend. His room, looks like he tries. But he never cleans his sheets. And this is just recently becoming a problem. It wasn’t this bad before. He use to clean before I came over and now... I don’t even want to sleep in the same bed as him. Every time I do, I break out instantly.   I don’t know how to approach this situation.

Some background i guess, I (18F) dated my now ex (18F) for a couple month about two months ago, nothing serious but i broke it off in the end and we hadn't spoken since then. My closest friend (CF for short) really hates my ex for a few different reasons, one she thinks my ex was using me (might be true), two, my CF is also incredibly insecure and gets quite controlling and jealous sometimes and three, she didn't like my ex before we dated but i didn't know that at the time. although she comes across as bad when i describe her to you, she has been amazing to me and helped me through so much even while battling through severe depression and anxiety. Oh and some more background info which will become relevent, my CF is logged in on my Instagram.
On NYE my ex sends me three video messages out of the blue, basically she got drunk and told me she misses me (I think mostly just as a friend), i replied just checking to make sure she was okay in my usual friendly tone. Now my CF sees this and asked me what my ex said so i told her obviously. i know my CF doesn't like my ex and gets very insecure when she knows I'm talking to her so I'm trying to reassure her like all i am doing is replying to my ex's messages, this conversation is just me being nice. I thought my CF understood and was okay with it but I get her insecurities took over and basically i really hurt her by doing this, I didn't realize at the time but now she explained everything it basically seems like I choose s conversation with my ex over my closest friends feelings. 
My CF is talking to me again and basically she asked if I could just not talk to my ex again (just to clarify this is something i could do physically if that makes sense). i on the other hand kinda want to keep s friendship going with my ex because we were quite good friends before hand.

30,"I’m a 24 year old female. Maybe a lot of my feeling fine being single this has to do with my having a good job, good familial support system and friends, but I’ve been single all my life and (at least as of recently) I’m totally fine and content with it. 

I’ve been fucked over by men that were sort of jerks; they led me on when they couldn’t actually commit for one reason or another. Which is sad because I had strong connections to at least 3 of these men (very strong connection to one of them), and it just didn’t work out. I feel a lot of the time they just hung out with my for my looks only, even though I do have a lot to offer. 

I keep telling myself if it’s meant to be it will; and to just do my own thing, but there’s always that wonder sort of lingering in the back of my mind, “what if”. Like, what if these men just weren’t good enough, which is why it didn’t work out? They turned me off so much with their actions and their immaturity. 

I get hit on a lot going out, at bars, coffee shops, by Uber drivers etc. Even though the attention I get is unwanted, which is also why I stopped going out alone as much (also since I’m trying to save money and work on building myself up to reach my long-term goals). I’ve also been told I look really young but what good use are my looks. I want people to see me for more than that, which is why I’m trying to work on proving myself in personal growth and learning.

I’ve been alone for so long and have become so independent and content on my own, that I don’t feel an urge to go out and meet people or try to find a nice guy to date. On that note, I’ve never even had sex. I want to one day, but I want it to be with the right person, since I want it to be with someone I’m attracted to, and I know that I’ll get attached after the fact...but I’m also not bothered for a relationship and find myself really lazy and too defeated/hurt by my past to pursue one at times...do you see my dilemma. Relationships just seem like a load of drama, hurt and pain to me. Especially since I’ve experienced so much hurt already not even being in one, so what the hell is the point? In addition to just not having any experience being in one outside of casually dating, so how will I know how to act when I’m in one?

34,"Hi all,

I’ll try and make this as short as possible.  I’m early 20s. 

Basically I feel as if whenever I meet a new girl who is nice, I will chat with them a fair amount and learn about them either face to face or text or whatever, doesn’t matter. But I feel guilty about doing so because my end goal is to get into a relationship with them, if compatible. 

While talking with them, I may flirt a little more than if I was regarding them as JUST a friend. I may create opportunities to meet up. But all of this I do because of the goal of getting into a relationship. 

If we aren’t compatible then my communication usually falls off. I feel like I’m using these wonderful people just to test the waters, and I’d rather it not be like that as they are people too. Moreso, I am also afraid of them thinking I am using them. 

I’ll clarify that it may seem like I have some obsession with having a girlfriend - I do, somewhat, only because I haven’t ever had a serious relationship and I’d like to experience that. I have worked on myself in other areas so this is a focus of mine currently.

38,"I'm gonna preface this with some info about myself. I'm 24, and a female who recently went back to college. I never really accomplished anything in high school and graduated with what I consider to be an average GPA (2.8). I am very anxious but I also have a lot of drive to succeed now that I have more life experience. 

Upon going back to college I made a commitment to myself to put myself out there and push myself out of my comfort zone. I have applied to scholarships and an honor society and took on the role of a club president, that I thought I wouldn't stand a chance at, and managed to succeed. 

I applied to 70+ internships that I thought I'd never get, and I received an offer. I'm still pushing myself and stepping out of my comfort zone to do more ""prestigious"" things. 

However I am still suffering with insecurities and feeling inadequate.

A few months ago I was faced with a question on a scholarship application asking what I had accomplished and I couldn't make words come out, instead I cried and panicked and didn't finish the application because I felt like I hadn't done enough to deserve it.

How can I over come these feelings? I thought stepping out of my zone would help and that eventually I would feel more confident but so far it's just making me worry more that I will let down my mentors and professors. That at some point I will have a breakdown and run away and just give up. 

I guess I'm looking for advice.

I can only assume this is coming from my past, where my family didn't believe I would accomplish anything, and my ex bf who was incredibly abusive in every way and knocked me down every chance he got. I'm surrounded by supportive people now but the thoughts inside my head still come around. 

I've been seeing a counselor but thus far it hasn't been helping much. I was taken from my biological parents, because they weren't suitable and I was raised by parents who never did make anything of themselves therefore I'm trying to be better, but I often fear that I'm doomed to turn out a failure because I was failed by nature and nurture. These thoughts led to panic attacks in the middle of biology class while discussing the course material and I just want to get over these feelings I've been having and make something of myself.",03Jan2020,1
40,"So my  husband and I eloped and moved across the country far away from our relatives, specifically our mothers, almost a year ago. It’s a long story and to sum it up and water it down my mother is an alcoholic, and emotionally/verbally abusive. She refuses to get real help and after multiple incidents that made her completely unbearable, my older sister (26) and I had enough of the abuse and completely cut her off. Our other sister (32) did too for a few months but eventually got roped back in and now talks to them and sees our parents regularly ( with her children, which is one of the big reasons we decided we weren’t going to speak to her until she gets serious help, because I personally think no grandma is better than a crappy abusive alcoholic grandma, who gets drunk right before babysitting and puts the babies in danger, but that’s just me I guess🤷🏻‍♀️) 
ANYWAY so even though I have blocked the woman and our sister (32) on everything so I can have them totally out of my life, my mother won’t stop making new email accounts to send me emails every few months even though i completely ignore them and delete them, she thinks that if she keeps sending me manipulative emails about how she misses me and wants to hear from me that I’ll just magically forget all the messed up crap she’s done and want to talk to her without any change, remorse, or any type of apology. It’s like none of it happened and she has no idea why her daughters want nothing to do with her. Part of me wants to respond and remind her that I want absolutely zero contact between us until she goes to rehab and completely stops drinking, AND ONLY THEN I will accept a genuine apology from her and we will see after her changed behavior  if we can some how mend the relationship that SHE completely destroyed. But I know that if I did that A. It would only be feeding into what she wants, which is a reaction and B. It would probably set her off into a whole rampage because I brought up that she’s an alcoholic, she needs help, and that she needs to apologize. I just don’t want to deal with her sending me more emails because I know exactly how she’ll respond, and spoiler alert 🚨 it won’t be that she’s going to get help. 
But my current problem is that I have a very large family and we all keep in contact through Facebook mostly, I know a few of them also don’t speak to my mother but there are so many that do still talk to her either because they don’t know what happened or they’re just going along and enabling her. I’ve had so much anxiety over the past year because every time someone in the family reaches out to me that I don’t regularly talk to I’m paranoid that they’re just passing on anything I tell that right to My mother and all the conversations feel completely fake. Along with that I haven’t gotten to post any of our wedding pictures because I have anxiety that people aren’t respecting that I don’t want anything about me to be shared with my mom. I know it’s kinda dumb that not posting on social media is bothering me so much but it just feels like she ruins all the best things that happened to me, like I can’t even celebrate things by sharing them publicly with friends and family and especially since my husband and I want to start a family soon, I want to be able to post announcement pictures and all the exciting things that come along with it but I just don’t know what to do

Our other best friend lives in another country but comes back regularly to live at his parents house which is also on the same street as them. He comes back with his fiance too - so there’s 2 couples and 1 single person in the group on the same street.

I live about 15 minutes walking distance from them. I’m always walking back and forth to their houses, usually carrying alcohol and almost always freezing my ass off. I do this every weekend to visit the first couple and it’s almost every night now that our other friend is back temporarily.

Now, in regards to couple #1 their house is bought and is pretty huge. It has two livingrooms and there’s space for everyone. If we’re going to the house of couple #2 then we tend to just sit in a conservatory as it’s their parents house, so it’s kinda cramped and awkward. I’ve mentioned a few times that they should have a night at my place instead and it’s usually been polite excuses or changing the subject. I live alone and honestly it’s a basic little 1 bedroom flat, but there’s plenty of room for us to sit in my livingroom and watch TV and play music etc just like we can do at Couple #1’s pla ce. 

Last week I got pissed off as they all went for a meal (they invited me but I’m broke) together with other friends and went back to a pub which is 5 minutes away from me. I told them to come to mine afterwards but instead got a text saying they were on their way back to their area and told me to head over to their houses again.

55,"Hi y’all,
So, I’m currently a Birthday Host at a Bowling alley. I’ve been working there for a full year now and let’s just say I hate it! Look, I love making kids birthday parties amazing but it’s just the the company I hate. I’ve been cussed out by a customer for something out of my control! Additionally, I feel like I’m the worst birthday host. I literally have bad luck at that job. (Keep in mind I’m 16 yrs old🙃). A manager yelled at me for something everyone else does but when I had to do it he goes off only on me. Afterwards, I took off for a month ( or Mental health reasons) and my manager was pissed! Also, for my birthday we have an app (crew) and it notifies everyone in the company it’s your birthday and only 2 people told me happy birthday. When it’s someone else’s birthday so many people tell them happy birthday. I just honestly feel like I’m not being respected like everyone else. All the managers treat me differently than the other party hosts. It’s 2020 I’m so tired of this job! I potentially have another job opportunity to work at a national park near me and that’s my dream job for now! Am I just overthink and being a crybaby or should I really consider quitting! 
Thanks 😊",03Jan2020,1

I knew she had feelings for me after 3 months cause she told me. Her boyfriend wasn’t the best of human beings, did a lot of shitty stuff, so I can assume shes been over him for a long time. So as of last week they broke up. As of today me and her started dating. We had planned a hangout at my place before we started dating and so she came over, we played some games, one thing led to another and we started doin the do, not sex but somewhere in between I suppose. Now this is where I need advice. In the middle of it out of no where she said I love you myname. At first I didnt know what to do so I just tried getting back into what we were doing, but she pulled me away and said Hello I said I love you, so I said it back. I don’t love her. Its just too soon and im crazy about her and I have strong feelings for her. I just don’t wanna rush something good. What is love anyways amirite?  I also don’t wanna start our relationship by introducing dishonesty. I tried telling her that im not saying shes crazy for feeling that way, she just expressed how she feels, and I am expressing how I feel. She said she was hurt but she could respect that. I don’t know if I did the right thing or what I could have done better, or what I should say to make the situation better. I know it would take ages to give you guys 100 percent of the situation and the circumstances but that would take hours so I tried giving as much important information as possible.

72,"Hey,

I (21M) am extremely confused about my future. Currently, I am studying Economics and Business Administration on university, and will finish my Bachelor’s degree by summer. For now, I wish to study a Master’s degree in International Marketing, hopefully specializing in the tech industry, as it is my major interest and knowledge skill. I live in Northern Denmark in a small city. However, despite having the educational goals set, I am worried about recieving a job after my degree. I was never employed by anyone, even when I was younger, as I was too busy doing my freetime hobbies, and made money off YouTube videos on that hobby for some years, which was enough for a younger me to sufficiently finance those hobbies, which was my only interest at the time.

I do wish to find an internship, but it seems like every company wants either absurdly high grades, or an absurdly impressive resumé, one which I do not have, also due to the fact that i’m still young and didnt have much time to develop it so far. So, in essence, I feel quite stuck in that position. My dad works in a succesful medium-sized IT company as an engineer and project manager, and I did project work through university with them previously, and hopefully that could be an entry for a great business internship. As my study is very internationally based, I hear alot of people claim, that moving to another country is the best option to expand your resumé. However, as for now, that step doesn’t seem feasible, not only to mention economically (how can any student afford this?), and because of the fact I would have to leave my whole family and social network behind. I would like to recieve any advice on how to better my position, as to get the most friction-free transition to job opportunities in the future. What could you guys reccommend to expand my resumé?

77,"TL;DR: Have been hiding my body under oversized shirts for years, want to change my way of dressing myself, am afraid of reactions from other people 

For context: in the past few years I (18F) kind of slid into this comfort zone of wearing oversized shirts + jeans. There's not much more to it, no one has ever seen me wear a skirt or a dress or show much of my collarbones. Yeah so basically I've been neglecting my outer appearance a lot and I just think it's time for a fucking glow-up, but I'm kind of my own way here. 

It really is a first world problem but recently I pulled a Marie Kondo on my closet and let's just say that not many clothes remained, so I decided to switch things up a bit and have a look at what I think I'd like to wear in the future. I started off by wearing narrower shirts that emphasize my figure a little bit more (which was already a huge step for me because I've literally been hiding my body under those oversized shirts for years)  and that already got a reaction out of people (which was positive, but I'd prefer it if people didn't make a huge deal out of it if I tried something more feminine from time to time, I am serious, once I tried to put on some mascara and people already pointed it out loudly). I'm just a little hesitant because I literally have never worn anything more fancy than a bland pair of jeans, and just randomly starting to wear dresses and skirts gives me anxiety, mostly because I know that people who know me will have a reaction to this drastic change. It would probably be easier for me to introduce myself like this to people who don't know my history of clothing. I know that there has to be a first time wearing stuff like this out in public to get the ball rolling, but I just can't for some reason. I know it might not sound as big of a deal to you but it's eating me from the inside because it's keeping me from evolving and gaining the confidence that I know I'll have once I can wear stuff that I actually enjoy wearing, instead of those ugly ass baggy shirts that could fit someone thrice my size...",03Jan2020,57

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have been friends with another couple K (female) and M (male) for about eleven years. We met them through K's older sister, who I had had a tumultuous friendship with since childhood which has since ended. We have kids of similar age and often would hang out with and without the kids.  We were all pretty close, went on trips together, relied on each other for stuff, etc.  We live in the same neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past couple years, K and I have drifted apart. She stopped reaching out as much and would sometimes take forever to return texts. I attributed this to her return to work after staying home with her kid and figured it was just a rough transition. We would still have a good time when we all hung out together and she would often still confide in me. She said she was having a lot of trouble with anxiety and that caused her to have difficulty with texting. She also related that she had started smoking again and started anti-anxiety medication.  But things were still distant.

&amp;#x200B;

In the spring of 2019, she related she had an emotional affair and her husband called her out on it. She said she was committed to keeping her family together. They started couples therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the fall, they were all over for dinner and when he stepped away for a few minutes she told me she had decided to leave him. She related that she had been unhappy for a while and wanted to be ""her authentic self."" We spoke a lot over the several weeks that followed, with her asking my advice and me trying to be supportive and urging her to be honest with him. She kept telling him she wasn't sure what she wanted and needed a few weeks to think things over and she would make her decision by X date. 

&amp;#x200B;

X date came and she had told me they had a therapy session scheduled for that night. The next day, M came over and told my husband that K had revealed the night before that the affair revealed in the spring had been going on for 2 years, was still going on, and was physical. He was understandably angry and had decided he was done.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night, K and I had a prearranged dinner date. I figured I would hear her out. She said she was glad the truth was out. She said she wanted M to take responsibility for his role in her cheating on him. She said ""it just happened, we couldn't find our way out of it. We would try to top seeing each other but we just couldn't help it.""  She said she had decided to stay with a friend until her appointment with her lawyer the following week and that the other guy had stayed there with her the night her husband told her he was done. She said they've already discussed their future together. I did my best to withhold judgment. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days later, I decided to send her an email basically saying I wasn't sure how to proceed with this friendship but that I wanted to try. I told her that I had felt we were distant for the past few years and I had attributed it to her return to work and was frustrated that it seems she was just busy having an affair. I told her that her distance and dishonesty and withholding the truth from me was hurtful and that I couldn't even really tell if she cared if our friendship continued or not.

&amp;#x200B;

So she wrote me back saying she did want to continue our friendship and that it wasn't just me she hid the truth from and she hoped we could find out way through it.

&amp;#x200B;

We've texted since then and had one awkward dinner when she invited y family to her house for dinner and the kids to play. Thankfully, the new guy wasn't there.  My husband has been in contact with M and he seems to be holding up, but still has a lot of anger, understandably.

&amp;#x200B;

She says when the divorce is final, she plans for the new guy to move in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've given it a lot of thought, and I don't see a path forward for this friendship. Frankly, I have no respect for her and I feel like she has no integrity and I can't trust her judgment at all. Also, I feel like I'm betraying my friendship with M by continuing to be friends with K. But I guess I worry that I'm bailing on her when she's having a hard time. Maybe I should just give it time?

91,"Some backstory:

My mom and I (19) have been going through a rough patch in our relationship throughout the past 2-3 years. My parents are separated and divorced as of the same timeframe, and it hasn’t been easy. I used to fight with my dad every single day, and it slowly transferred to her and I. She got a new boyfriend about six months ago after seeing a couple other men beforehand, and has been “living life for herself” ever since.

And now, my current problem:

Ever since she got with this new guy, my mom hasn’t been the same. She’s been very harsh and selfish towards me, without even realizing she’s done anything wrong. She often says things that hurt my feelings and doesn’t apologize, even after I’ve tried to talk to her and express to her that her words do hurt me. Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall: if I try to express a concern that puts her at fault, I’m suddenly being disrespectful. I understand why she manipulates situations, as she had to be this way to deal with my emotionally abusive father for 15 years. However, even after I’ve told her that this isn’t the way to “argue” with me, she still won’t change her ways. I’m almost always the problem, even when I calmly try to point things out to her, practically walking on eggshells the entire time. 

Don’t get me wrong, I do have my fair share of bad moments with her that are my fault. I say and do things I don’t mean, but I never refuse to apologize or understand her point of view. She often says hurtful things and acts very selfishly, and doesn’t want to work on herself, or our relationship. I often feel like I’m being put on the backburner, while her boyfriend and his kid take the front. 

She makes me feel like she has no faith in me, as I feel like I’m too young to be an adult, but too old to be a kid. She claims that I want to be an adult, but I refuse to take on the responsibility. However, I’m the one who has been taking care of things at home, taking her boyfriend and his kid wherever they need to go, taking on the new role of “sister” to his kid, and balancing school and work with it all. She acts like I have it so easy, because I don’t live on my own, working two jobs like she did as a kid. We live different lives with different struggles, but it doesn’t make either of us better or worse than the other.

My mom makes me feel like a child when she says I’m not allowed to drive home while it’s snowing, but she becomes deeply upset with me for not taking on all the proper responsibility when my car insurance payment is due. Everything with her is so wishy-washy, and I don’t know how to approach it anymore. I’ve tried to talk to her about it, but every time we talk or argue, she ends up manipulating the situation and making me either forget why I’m mad, or like I’m the one completely at fault. She’s extremely sensitive too, so whenever I try to express something to her, she takes it as criticism and blows up at me, taking more jabs at me. I don’t really know how to make our relationship less tense, but at this point I’m willing to give anything a shot.

How do I get through to my mother about my struggles and concerns without being shot down or manipulated in the process?

We’ve been together 3 years and I love him so much that I would marry him. I don’t need the actual marriage but just to know that he loves me enough that he would do that. I want that level of commitment. The complication is that I have major health problems, that prevent me from having a normal life. I will get better in the future but right now I’m very limited and neither one of us is anywhere close to self sufficient yet. So his “possibly” is very influenced by all of this, not necessarily a comment on how he feels about me.

101,"Over the last 2 years, she's had 2 suicide attempts, both of which ruin my mental state because she won't tell me until a couple weeks later. She used to call me trying to acting completely normal while she was overdosing on pills. Didn't tell me a thing about it until 8 years later. Now in the last year, I had to leave uni because i was just too worried about her to focus on school (+ some other things). Last month I gave her 600$ to cover her rent because she won't go to work. Now she's using sex as a coping mechanism and she's doing a new guy every night. Turns out that yesterday, she just told the guy to go ahead and do whatever her wanted. Now she's 30 hours in and only just now on her way to get plan B. 

I just don't get it. I've done everything I can to help her sort out her life, hell I make tiny decisions for her cause she's too indecisive to choose what to eat or wear or if she wants a relationship (told her to write in a journal for a month and see how she felt over that time). I can't deal with her anymore. She maybe listens to me vent 1-2 times a year and I play therapist every day. I hate it and I don't know what to do or how to go about this.",03Jan2020,6

105,"Tl;dr I was at my bf's parent's yearly New Year's Party at his mother's house. A series of mistakes and bad choices made by my bf's step-dad may have led to one of the fireworks exploding rather than firing straight up. The fire work hit me in the left eye leaving me badly injured and most likely permanently disfigured. My mom wants to sue the parents for reckless behavior leading up to the explosion. My boyfriend's mom is lawyering up and asking the other kids to testify to her lawyer. While I agreed that the step-dad's actions were not okay, I don't believe he intentionally caused it and don't want to sue them. Also, my bf refused to go to the hospital with me after I got hurt so I'm feeling really hurt and betrayed by that. I would have gone with him if he got hurt. Advice or comments?

So now for the super long story:

So my bf's step-dad (let's call him SD for short) bought what I suspect to be an illegal firework since the size and power most definitely aren't legal in Georgia. The firework was one big cardboard box that held several smaller firework tubes inside. All the individual fireworks were connected together by a web like system of fuses all leading to one short fuse thread that was meant to be lit from outside of the box. I initially tried to light the fuse, but the fuse broke off of the box. My friend and I tried to put the fuse back in the firework and relighted it (I know that was stupid and I regret that). It obviously didn't work. So SD tried to light the fuse area with a lighter hoping that lighting the box on fire or something for trigger the fuse to burn too. That did not work and kinda cause the sides of the firework and box to singe a bit. So then he took a fuse from another firework and tried again to light it. Didn't work. So finally, he opened up part of the box that was holding all the fireworks inside. He found the web of fuses and decided to light them to trigger the fireworks to launch. Since those fuses had a much smaller distance to the fireworks that the designated lighting fuse, the fireworks went off before I could get away. I ended up getting hit by either a fragment or a firework in my left eye. I'm doing okay so far and just got discharged from the hospital today. My eyesocket is broken in several places, my eye and muscle tissue are swollen, the left side of my nose is broken, and I have several cuts and burn marks with 9 total stitches.

I ended up getting driven to the hospital by 3 of my friends of whom which 2 (Lets call them Steph and Jess) stayed the whole night with me. My bf didn't want to come with and stayed at the house. When I mentioned it to him the next day, he said he didn't want to come with because he was too freaked out and was panicking a lot that night. I mentioned that I understand why he didn't want to go because I was covered in a lot of blood and was screaming/whimpering, but it still hurt because even though Jess and I hadn't been getting along very well lately, she still was there for me. I needed him and he wasn't there. When he was sick or was really upset, I was there for him even when he yelled at me to leave out of anger/frustration.

My mom wants me to sue the parents since it happened at their party and under their supervision. I feel really conflicted about it because I don't wanna cause trouble for my bf's family and it was an accident. I know I'm probably being unreasonable and I know that what SD did was super irresponsible and dangerous, but it just feels wrong to me because I've come to know and care for them a lot.

I don't really know what to do or how to feel and I'm just wondering what you guys would do and think about this.",03Jan2020,1

108,"As the title says I have made a choice in my life. My entire family has been smokers so I assume the influence began there but other encounters have come into my life with me pursuing a career in welding and meeting others in the trades field. Smoking became my everyday life and something I did to relax during a shift breaking my back welding. I've now changed my life and began pursuing a career in policing and I've been very successful so far. I'm actively participating with the local police as well as attending a well-known police school. However, I still cling to having smoking in my life. Its nowhere near as frequent as before but it is still apart of me. I just want to know on why do I still hang onto this nasty habit when my life is going where i want it to finally? I used to smoke because of the work I did but I no longer do that.

111,"So not long ago, I made a post about how I have a job, but only work one 5 hour shift a week, and that the town is pretty dry for jobs at the moment. I also outlined how I intended on applying for a Centrelink jobseeker youth allowance.

So some basic details: I am 18, nearly 19, and am from Eastern Victoria, Australia. I am employed as a dishwasher at a local pub, but only work a 5 hour shift once a week, occasionally picking up other shifts here and there. I don't have my drivers licence, and I do not have the money to afford a car at the moment. I have no financial support from any of my family. My parents are separated, and have been for nearly two years. I live with my mum one week, and my dad the next.

I intend to move in with my girlfriend, to be with her, the house will be shared with her sister so rent food and bills are split three ways, and living in the situation I am in right now has been toxic since my parents separation, and I need to remove myself from that. I also intended to apply for payments from Centrelink whilst I try to find a full time job. This has now been shut down, as my mum is refusing to sign any paperwork to do with Centrelink, especially her income reporting (as Centrelink deem me as being dependent on my parents, and therefore see no reason for me to leave the house). I thought that they only required one parent to sign paperwork, but since I live with both of them on a schedule, they now require both of them to sign forms in order for me to even make a claim.

I just don't know what to do. My girlfriend has offered for me to move in during February, and I just need to get out of my mum's house; its impacting on me too much and she cannot see that.

\*\*EDIT\*\*

I explained to my mum that as she refuses to sign any sort of paperwork to do with Centrelink, I will not be able to apply for any payments. Though, she seems happy for me to get payments if they were for if I moved away and it assisted in stabilising myself in a new town with a new job. Though, what she doesn't understand with Centrelink, is that this has no impact on my so-called dependence to them. They would still view me as being dependent to my parents, and therefore, would require both of them to report.",03Jan2020,1

114,"Anyone else been in this situation? Starting a couple semesters ago I checked with my advisor several times to make sure I have everything in order. I was told by several people that I was fine and they helped me fix the errors on my DARS report. I walked the stage, shook hands with the president and the dean a couple of weeks ago only to be told yesterday over email that I have not met all my degree requirements and that failure to satisfy all degree requirements by January 31 will result in my degree conferral being delayed until a later time. It says I literally only need three more credits. I just started to look for jobs! What am I supposed to do, go back to school? Put my plans on hold just to take one class that i probably won't be able to get into anyway because it's already January? I hope that this is a mistake but I am worried about it not being one.

119,"Okay this might be a long one. So I’ve known my best friend since we were 13. We are both 17 now and turning 18 this year. We’ve kind of watched and helped each other grow through puberty as people and she helped support me with my sexuality and i honestly don’t think I’d have accepted myself as soon as I did without her. Not to be cringe but honestly I love her so much I would literally kill for her, just as I would for all of my closest friends. When we were around 15 she became interested in dating. Which is entirely normal and I loved talking to her about who she liked why etc because I was so happy for her. When she got her first boyfriend I was probably just excited as she was. The issue is a few months in I noticed a change in her. She was becoming really paranoid. I was always there for her when she was insecure about the relationship or unsure about the boy she was dating. Her paranoia led to her being “too much” for the guy and he dumped her. I cried with her lol. I was her shoulder to lean on and that’s not even remotely impressive because that’s what friends are for. As time passed I noticed there were more boyfriends, more breakups, more paranoia and more tears. Every relationship ended with the guy not being able to deal with my friends insecurities and paranoia and dumping her which as her friend I was angry about. No ones perfect right? I did my absolute best comforting her. If she phoned me at 2am I’d answer. If she wanted a shoulder to cry on even if I had an exam the next day I’d be there. Not to like make myself seem amazing or whatever but my home life has never been stable, I have no dad and my mum isn’t well and I’ve had to look after her in many ways. Not looking for pity but I just want to highlight that despite whatever was going on with me was irrelevant, if my friend needed me I’d be there. I would rarely go to her with my problems because I don’t like burdening people with my baggage. When we were 16 she had quite a long relationship for her standards, it was around 9 months I think but like the rest he dumped her. In this relationship I noticed her paranoia had gotten so much worse (panic attacks, accusing him of cheating constantly) and I didn’t know how to help her but I did my best anyway. I suggested that she maybe take a break from boys and just enjoy her teens without worrying about annoying boys she’s dating. She did the absolute opposite and went into another serious relationship a couple weeks later. This new boy was different. He was more involved in her social life which I thought was a good thing since her past boyfriends hadn’t even met her friends. He seemed so NICE. However within a few weeks my friend told me she’d been cheating on him constantly with this older, more sexually experienced boy and she felt bad. I regret to say I supported her. I basically said he doesn’t need to know but she should probably stop. She did but still spoke to him on Snapchat.  Her boyfriend felt she was hiding something and, like my friend, became kind of paranoid but not in the same way. It wasn’t a whole “I’m not good enough” thing, it was more of him not trusting where she was going or who she was with. She would need to send him photos of me or others when hanging out to prove she wasn’t “with a boy”. At this point he didn’t know about the cheating at all. It got worse as he made her give him her passwords for all social media and he would regularly check on who she was speaking to and what about. Any single straight boy on her phone would be blocked, even ones from her college. Her boyfriend then saw some of the chat with the boy she cheated on him with. Luckily there was no mention of sex but there was something regarding her not being satisfied with her sex life and wanting to meet this older boy . Her boyfriend was RAGING. she phoned me while he was screaming at her and oh my god I’ve never heard anyone scream such spiteful things at someone “fucking filthy slut you’re a cow” blah blah blah. Long story short they made up but his grasp over her life became tighter. She didn’t socialise and if she did he’d have to be there with her. She went to a job interview and he accused her of cheating with a boy. She went to the city centre with me and accused her of fucking a boy from college. Our mutual friend attempted suicide, and while she was trying to process it he called her a liar and said I’m a bad influence because I drink? As if that’s relevant? She couldn’t leave the house without being accused of something. This has went on and is still going on. I basically confronted him about everything and told him that his need to helicopter her entire life is abusive and that I basically think he’s a fucking cunt. My friend really hated me for that. Recently she completely stopped hanging out with anyone and only spoke to me or our mutual friends if she wanted to complain about her relationship. She has recognised multiple times that within that controlling relationship there is mental abuse but she wouldn’t dump him. Problems within my own life worsened recently and I found trying to help her and listen to her complain about him despite her not taking anyone’s advice of ending it draining. Everyone in her life except her boyfriend agreed the relationship needed to end. I then needed to focus on applying for university, my mum as well as dealing with demons of my own meaning the huge amount of time I spent trying to constantly listen to her over the phone complaining about the same things was killing me. A VERY LONG story kind of short, it’s been another 3 months of her only speaking to me when needing to vent about him, but another 3 months of her not taking any of my advice. I’m exhausted hearing her agree with everything I’m saying but then keep going back to him. Today she hung out with me for the first time in months. Her boyfriend phoned her 16 times within 10 minutes and I raged at him calling him a cunt. He threw my friends stuff into the rain and told my friend to go to his house to get it. She told me she was ending it today. She didn’t. They kissed, fucked, made up and she told me to start minding my own business despite her being the one coming to me for advice constantly. I told her she can be with him but i can’t continue with the friendship. I have my own shit to deal with and don’t need someone only using me to vent about the relationship I told her to end a year ago. Am I wrong? 

Also i would totally fight him but he’s insane. I don’t want to die lol he’s the kinda guy who’d stab you in the gut and I have a mum to look after. My mums the most important person to me so I’m not putting my physical ability to care for her on the line.",03Jan2020,1

123,So I'm raised in a traditional household where you respect women and date and marry and etc. But as I went to college I was introduced to the hook up culture. Now that I've left college and go on these dating apps to find someone a lot of people hook up or have hooked up. They always have stories and experiences and it makes me kinda jealous. I want to do that kind of stuff too but I cant get myself to do it. And when I'm talking to someone and we talk about our past they mention they've hooked up a lot and they love sex and so on. It makes me see them negatively (sorta like their below me and I'm superior because I don't). I know this is not good and I should get counseling but I just wanted to post it online and see what people thought. I've thought about just giving in a finding someone to hook up but the thought of STD's and pregnancy and getting attached comes into play. So I'm not sure how to see people who have hooked up as not a bad thing they've done and not internally judge them.

Recently my sister has been really depressed after the death of someone very close. She has got diagnosed with depression and is taking medication as well as talking to professionals. 
My sister gives a lift to and from work to him as he lives in the same village as we do (unlike his parents who live where the cafe is). For the past few months he has been talking about his depression to my sister and saying he is going to kill himself and that he does not know what he would do without her. This has become a real trigger for my sister and is not in the mental state really to support him. She has helped him sort his finances out and took him to the doctors about his depression but she really can’t take him talking about his depression anymore to her. 
She dreads driving him to and from work everyday but does not know what to do to a point where she cries pretty much every night before hand. 
She fears if she tells him that she can’t listen to him talk about it anymore that he will do something like hurt himself and she will feel guilty. 
They are not even very close in her opinion but for some reason he has chosen her to confide in about all of his suicidal thoughts. She has told his mother (her boss) that she doesn’t know what to do and how rubbish it is making her feel but she does nothing to help.

132,"I'm not really sure what to do so I feel the need to get some advice from random strangers as well as just release my feelings a bit.

I've been in therapy for a couple of months now and I feel it helps a bit. It's helpful with my workplace anxiety (I have a big fear of failure at work) and some other general anxieties, but I feel like I need something else. I'm not sure what to do. I think I should keep up therapy but I still feel shitty often.

Most days I'm okay, but then there are days when I'm just tired of being alive. My self esteem plummets and I feel like everything's pointless. I get pretty harsh on myself often and it feels like a constant juggling match to maintain an okay mood. I have a hard time talking about how I feel so I'm trying to work on that so I don't internalize my feelings so much.

Overall, I know my life is good. I have a good job that I like (despite my fear of messing up), a good apartment, parents who care about me, a boyfriend and best friend who support me 100%, and I'm healthy and financially stable. I find that I often try to keep busy so that I don't spend all my time moping and laying about...even though I feel like this leads to burnout at times.

I feel like I get the ""your life is fine"" treatment alot and I'm afraid even a professional will treat me that way. Sometimes I feel like my therapist thinks I'm fine. I don't think I'm suffering but I'm just tired of my mood dropping so low and my self worth turning into self loathing.

EDIT P/S -  Would anyone be able to back up the below statement on washing the comforter just a couple ( 1-2 ? ) times a year ?

***Down Comforter***

Although you might have your comforter draped on your bed and use it every day, it doesn’t get exposed to as much of your body oils, scents or skin flakes as your sheets. Because of this, it’s fine to wash it a couple times a year, unless you spill something on it. In that case, it acquires an unwanted odor, making it musty. If that were to happen, simply wash as needed.",03Jan2020,2
136,"When I was younger, around 6/7 years old I would lie in bed awake at night and cry at the thought of losing my parents. Thinking about what I would do if they died. My fear was so great, when my siblings were born, I would kiss them on the forehead every night incase I never saw them again or they passed in the night. When they learned to talk, I would make them say goodnight and I would make sure the last thing I did was tell them I loved them if I was going anywhere or to bed, out of my fear of losing them or them losing me and not having said it. I grew out of this after a while, perhaps around 10/11. 

The past four years, the fear has returned. I'm in a serious relationship and it was as if loving someone new brought the fear to the surface. Every so often the thought of something bad happening to my SO or family members, even my dog - enters my head and I sob uncontrollably at the thought. 

When my partner is in his car I picture him dying in an accident or not making it home safely. I have this overwhelming need to control everything in order to stop this from happening, like if I don't tell him I love him or to drive safe, it's going to come true. I have moved to a different part of the country than my SO and family and this has magnified it all a lot more. I was actually sparked to write this because I saw a post about a dog passing away and I started to cry uncontrollably at the thought of having to go through this. (I might add, I've never had anybody close to me pass away, I don't think I will ever be able to cope with loss)

Time passed, and my sexual tension just went up the roof too. I really have no confidence in myself since all my tries at relationships have been straight out failures (basically everybody considered me fuck material but not gf material, how great). Thinking about it I may just be inept at it. And because of past circumstances I get really depressed around Christmas and New Years. And a friend has been trying to hook me up with somebody else just because hes the only one left without a gf in their group, and I was like pass since we dont have anything in common and thinking about it now Im like wow, what a great friend.

This Christmas, we were both lonely me and A, at least I think so. It was my first time at sexting and it was... too great for my sanity. I got a boost of dopamine. He asked me again if I wanted to be fuck friends with him. I was a bit pissed off because A said relationships mean effort and he wants to chill, and I felt a bit hurt that it made me feel like I didnt deserve the effort but I was too happy in the moment to care.

I tell him yes because I was so happy and even though I didnt like him as much as before I really wanted to try out this, just to take of some tension. I told him no fucking any time soon, only hugs, kisses, make out session and anything that wasnt the act in itself.

And well, during the day, I chickened out. My parents are a bit on the overbearing and overprotective side so it would have been really hard to explain if they ever caught me up in a lie or anything and they find this kind of relationships... just vulgar. That I need to keep it until I find someone special but with my luck, yeah, I have 0 confidence I will find them any time soon.

Another reason was because me and A come from the same group of friends so I didnt want to create unnecessary drama. I have enough shit in my life right now, and besides Ive been feeling left out lately.

And the last reason, is because I was truly scared. What if did something bad like the majority of the time, what if he wanted to just fuck with me for a while, what ifs, what ifs and other what ifs. My mind went everywhere.

After I told him, he just told me that I blew stuff up over proportions just like always and that we better should leave it at friends. I said that too even though I was lying.

But the next night, I fucked up again. After what happened during the day, just like a shameless bitch, I told him that I needed him. And I regretted it so much afterwards because I went against what I said.

Of course he rejected me. He had a reason too after all my bs. And after so much time spent together I know I hurt him too. I said that Im sorry. But I still feel so terrible over it.

I really dont know what to do. Make it up to him, just leave things as it be... I know I cant ghost him because it would just hurt him more and hurt me too. I really dont know what to do.",03Jan2020,1

146,"I (23M) and my girlfriend (22F, I'll call her K) have been together for coming up to a year now, in GB.

I want to start with saying that we both love each other a lot, and that if it wasn't for this, things would be absolutely perfect between us. Without going into detail however, I have quite a few kinks that look really quite intimidating. I told K pretty early on that I was a bit different this way, but never really the full extent of it. As such, we've been incorporating parts of my kinks into our sex life every so often, and keeping it vanilla the majority of the time. I also bought her a book recently that helps explain my kinks, and highlighted parts for her that were relevant. 

I'd be lying if I said it hasn't been weighing on my mind recently, and I guess K noticed because she sent me some messages today clarifying her position on what I'm into, referencing the parts of the book I highlighted. Overall she listed things that she isn't comfortable with, and said that we should take it more slowly with the things that she is willing to try. Overall she is extremely understanding, and accepts and loves me for who I am. 

I know that she has her boundaries and I respect that, I'd never ask her to do something she wasn't comfortable with, but I feel like I'm in a position now where I have to choose between what I really want out of my sex life or K. K's messages really opened up something inside me, it released a lot of emotion I hardly knew was there. My reply was similar to what I've said here, that I respect her boundaries and that I don't want her to feel uncomfortable or pressured, but also that I don't want to be without my kinks. I was pretty upset by that point, and effectively tried to break it off with K. She replied with the most heart-warming messages I've ever seen, basically saying that she doesn't want to be without me and that she wants to find a way to make our sex lives more compatible.

The issue is, what I want isn't compatible with what K wants. I can't see a way our sex lives fit together properly. I feel like for us to stay together I need to give up a part of myself, and the idea of loosing that part of me is just as painful as the thought of loosing K. I feel like I have to make an impossible choice. 

I'm sorry if this went on, but we're meeting tomorrow and I could really do with some extra insight. I guess I'm asking the following: Is it normal or ok to suppress a part of who you are to fit into a otherwise perfect relationship? Is there a solution I'm not seeing here? What would you do in this situation? If you have anything else to add, I would be very grateful to hear it.

Thank you for your time.

(Just an FYI, I've posted this to a couple of other subs just because I need all the advice and opinion I can get before we meet tomorrow, I hope this is OK.)

Edit:
Thank you everyone for your advice, overall it has helped to make my decision clear. Me and K spoke at great length together, being 100% open with each other. I showed her this post and some notes I've been writing down today, plus some porn showing exactly what I was into, and fully explained what I like and why, and we came up with a plan going forward of what we can do and what is off limits. We're going to take it slow and find a way we can both enjoy sex. Maybe the comments saying that we probably won't work long term are right, maybe not, all I know is that me and K love each other, and if there's even a chance we can be happy together, then I'll take that chance.

157,"Tl;dr Is it always worth discussing worries with a partner, even if you aren’t sure how genuine they are? Or can that do more harm than good, by telling them about very negative scary ideas that I’m not sure about, and might change things forever. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for seven years. I love her and care about her. But I have a nagging feeling lately that we might not be right for each other. There are things she does that I don’t like, and things about our life together that I don’t like. 

My issue is, I don’t know how “real” these worries are. I don’t know if it’s just a “grass is always greener” type thing. If that’s the case, I hesitate to talk to her about them because they may sound harsher and more negative than they actually are. 

I wonder if it’s always a good idea to talk to a partner about these thoughts? Or is there a time when that might do more harm than good, and it’s best to just talk them through with a friend. 

I have the feeling that after seven years, I have to either fully commit, or think about whether I am doing more harm than good to both of us by continuing.

My step son is 12..almost 13...He is starving for my SO attention..is this because he has always given him so much attention? Is this normal teenage behavior?

Anytime my SO goes outside or anywhere in the house SS will stop what he is doing and follow him 

He is forever asking my SO to “watch him play” or “watch this video” or screaming “hey dad come here!!!” From across the house just for him to tell him something small like “hey dad I have a stain on my shirt..”

SS constantly asks my SO to get him water,put toothpaste on his toothbrush, find him socks, zip his jacket...all things my SS is capable of..when my SO refuses this results In whining and baby talk.

SS needs my SO to lie down with him at night to go to sleep if he doesn’t he will not stay the night with us

Oh and he starts every and I mean EVERY sentence with “hey dad...”
Every.single.time (this is the worst of them all)

I’ve never been really confident around girls because i wore glasses that girls would find nerdy, and i was awkward, having little experience. During the summer after freshman year however, I finally got contacts and started to feel confident coming into sophomore year. 
At the beginning of the school year, I noticed a girl that i’m going to call K. She was really funny and cute and I got her snap and started talking to her. After a while of us flirting and talking and getting to know each other, i decided to ask her on a date. She said yes and we had our date. I thought it went well, and her friends said she told them it went well, but after our date, she started talking to me less and less, leaving me on delivered for hours and open for even longer. Every time i tried to talk to her in person, she would make a point of avoiding me. So finally, I asked her how she really felt, and she told me that she no longer has feelings for me because she likes me more as a friend and that we don’t have much in common, even though one of the first things i noticed about her is how much we have in common. 
I was sad about this for a while, until a friend asked me if i would be interested in this girl. She showed me a picture of her and i was so she gave me the girls snap who i will call H. I starting talking to H and i started to really like her and i would flirt and she would flirt back. We started to facetime often and we would text each other nonstop throughout the day. I should mention that this girl goes to a different school. After a month of talking we still haven’t met in person. We are both really eager to meet in person at this point,  but conflictions prevented us. 
One night, she told me that she didn’t think it was gonna work because she didn’t think i would like her. We went back and forth throughout, her saying she wasn’t good enough and me comforting her and telling her how wrong she is. Somewhere during all that she told me that she thinks she’s depressed. She told me what she is going through and it sounds like she is. For about a week, everything was fine and we were finally going to meet, until she told me that she no longer had feelings for me.

He’s somewhat manipulative sometimes, lies to seem interesting, and has become increasingly irritating. Often when he texts me, he just says something in meme format (i.e. *image* “me when *insert some situation*”) which is extremely difficult to give any meaningful response to, even if I did relate at all to what he’s saying. Other than that, he’s usually just going off on long rants. Every so often, he’ll get mad at me for something. One time, he was upset that I would respond “neat” too much. Multiple times, he’s gotten angry that I do not respond to his rants correctly. I try to give him help or solutions when he rants, but he always shoots down any solutions I suggest, so sometimes I just respond with things like “I’m sorry” or “That really sucks” which apparently is not good enough for him. One time, I pointed out he did something manipulative and he proceeded to throw a fit and try to manipulate me even more. He’s always overly angry about things that really do not matter or affect him. In general, I don’t like him anymore, meanwhile he is becoming increasingly attached and clingy to me. I was hoping me going off to college would make us drift apart, but it doesn’t seem to be going that way. I’ve never had to drop a friend like this before, and he keeps talking about going to college in the same area as me or living where I’m going to college and talking about trips and plans we could have in the future, so I don’t know that I can wait around to see if me being away at college will eventually separate us.

It's hard to change your habits though! I don't drink anything but water at home (never buy soda, juice, or milk, and don't like coffee) and I don't buy any dessert as well - it's not hard for me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth.  However, I eat a looot of carbs, and butter is too good for my own good. Basically I'm a sucker for pastas and rice lol.   


I would really like some advices on meals I could prepare for myself, but I have three restrictions that make things harder:  


\- I'm a vegetarian   
\- I'm not a big cook   
\- I don't like salad (anything that's green and leafy has always made me sick even when I was a kid!). Don't like raw vegetables much either, I usually steam mine.   


Do you have any idea of healthy meals I could try to lose weight?   


Thank you very much!",03Jan2020,1
193,"Since I've met her, she's had bad breath and lots of plaque so bad it's orange. I've had the dilemma of telling her ever since I decided to ask her out and we've been dating for months now. Her breath makes me uncomfortable but I really like everything else about her. 

I have tried to get her to understand the problem a couple of times now. The first time was when I realized that dehydration was partially causing bad breath, so I told her and tried convincing her to drink more water. The second time I tried to convince her to floss, and she said her dental hygene isnt that bad and her brothers are worse.

 I've gotten her to actually brush her teeth longer than 15 seconds, but she refuses to use an electric toothbrush. A couple of times before bed, I've accidentally asked her if she actually brushed her teeth. 

Recently I straight told her that she has gross orange plaque and it's really bad. She refused to listen to me, telling me that her dentist said her teeth and gums were good. I have no idea what to do now, I've said everything I remember although I know ive tried more. Please help, this is a huge strain on me and I really want to stay with her. 

Thank you


PS didnt realize marking helped was final. I really am hoping for a solution other than delivering an ultimatum. I appreciate the answers I've gotten :) Also, she does brush her teeth now. I brush my teeth with her to support her",03Jan2020,1
194,"(15F) so I need advice. I used to have a giant friend group in 6th grade at the same school I'm at now, but over the years the group got smaller and smaller and after my 8th grade year, the closest of my only real 3 friends left. We still have a group chat with the four of us, A (the one who left), M, and S. M has always been cool but since this year when S started really talking to us more and more I've realised how sensitive and annoying S is. I cut it off with S because I could never say anything around them without them becoming offended and getting mad. It wasn't like I was saying anything racist or sexist, but they'd find a way to make it appear like I was. Eventually I was got so sick of feeling guilty that I cut him off. When I cut him off, M stopped talking to me as well. M used to be really cool but it seems like her whole personality has changed as to not offend S. A always tries to get me back into the chat but because she doesn't go to our school anymore nothing really happens. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty more acquaintances but they're not really friends. I talk to lots of people but I haven't really gotten close because their circles are so tightly knit it feels like I'm intruding when I try to conversate. I've tried to squeeze my way in but it just seems like no one really wants to hang and I'm just a floater. I have a cousin in my grade who has been my best friend since I was a baby but he also has a close circle of boys I wouldn't want to intrude on plus they're kind of annoying. I also have a sister but she's 17 and is always busy at lunch. What should I do? I don't know where to sit at lunch or who to hang with at break because I really have no one to hang with.",03Jan2020,1
196,"Hi all, I posted this to legal advice for specific legal questions, but I wanted to post here as well just to receive general advice and perhaps some insight from people that have been through similar situations.

I've been living in an town house in the Seattle area for 2 years. At the end of last month, my lease expired and I moved into a new place. Ever since I informed my landlord of my plans to move, we've been arguing about our lease, my deposit and damages ever since. She told me she is selling the house, and I get the feeling that she doesn't want to put any of her actual time into it and wants me to do everything to prepare her house to be sold.

For some context, my landlord is new and inexperienced, and even said on the day of our lease signing that she created her lease by googling around and putting things together. About a year ago when our washing machine broke (from ordinary use), I had to argue with her just so she could replace it. She took about a month to do that because she kept ordering machines that wouldn't fit in the laundry space. Ever since then, our relationship has been rocky. Most of my communication with her has been through text message.

As we were moving out, we had her come check the place out, and she attempted to aggressively deduct from our deposit (almost $2000). However, a checklist was never provided to me and I found out that she was in violation of [RCW 59.18.260](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.260&amp;fbclid=IwAR3KMs5oCKIxS46Oxf87uC5OyeQcLtJO0cYZTbtxieI3PPb5sFcrIZS3syg) for her failure to provide us a move in checklist. She was also in violation of [RCW 59.18.270](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.270&amp;fbclid=IwAR1VheOZWvBDVgxZsbMuzrF-nx5emVSYRudlJb7JJpXFlt-e7HWDPdZvTQ8) because she never provided me with a receipt for my deposit. It seemed really unfair and unreasonable that she would do that. Her own lease said that deductions from the deposit would be made according to the checklist.

Despite me telling her that she did not take the deposit legally, she has continued to send me pictures of various things she's not happy with about the house. Eventually she agreed to send me my deposit back minus a late payment fee (my automated payment online had a delay/tech issue. I actually did initiate the payment on time). 

However one thing she is not happy about is the carpet. I had a mattress on the floor in one of the rooms. The area underneath the mattress looks brand new, but the area to the sides of the mattress look noticeably worse/darkened (but does not look destroyed by any means). I paid a professional carpet cleaner to come, but he was not able to fully fix it. She says that it is damaged and wants me to pay about $200 for the small section of carpet that looks worse. She has even threatened legal action over the carpet. She said that my deposit is on the way, but she expects me to pay her the 200 immediately after receiving it. Over text, I agreed I will pay her, and the deposit (minus 30 dollars)  is supposedly being mailed to me right now. I think the carpet is fine, but I also don't know what ""normal"" wear and tear constitutes, since it seems to not be defined too clearly in law.

It seems that I have two options now:

1. I can eat the $200 and just pay her for the carpet as she wants. I still get my almost my full deposit back and hopefully she will go away. $200 is not a sum that I will lose sleep over and I don't think it's worth my time and energy fighting for it in court if it has to go that far. I'm just worried that if I pay her, she will sue me anyway. How can I protect myself so that if I pay her, she will not turn around and sue me anyway?
2. I can ignore her request for the money and just go about my life. After all, the deposit is being sent to me anyway. If I get served I can go to court and have the legal system decide what to do. I am worried if I take this option I may be end up being responsible for even more damages somehow. I would also rather not burn PTO and time preparing as I can make the 200 back much faster by just working. 

I'm not really sure which option to take, or if there is anything else I can do. My priority is not wasting my time but also protecting myself. I basically just want to get on with my life. $200 isn't a big deal, but if I am in the clear right then obviously I don't want to waste that money away. What would you do in my situation?

201,"So we’re from a relatively conservative(ish) Asian family, but my parents have been a lot more lenient with my little bro since he’s the baby.
Recently he’s been opening up to me about a lot of things, and that makes me happy since I love my little brother to bits and pieces, and I’m glad that he’s able to share his college experiences with me.

But recently his stories have become more and more...concerning.
First off, he’s underage. But he’s begun going to parties and getting black out drunk. When he drank a small amount and told me not to tell, I promised him, but it’s been getting crazier and crazier. And I’ve seen videos of him chugging it down like water (he’s shown me several of them), so it’s not like I’m exaggerating in my mind (if anything I’ve been underestimating him like damn little bro).

And his recent escapades have turned into smoking weed (it’s not legal in my state). The scary part of this is that I’ve been told university conducts random drug tests for dorm residents (haven’t checked to see if it’s true myself but my brother told me that). I want to believe that he’s got a good head on his shoulders, and he knows where to draw the line about what’s too much, but like I’ve mentioned earlier, he’s been doing riskier and riskier things.

As a result, his grades have been suffering significantly. My parents have mellowed down a lot since my university days (getting a B used to be the end of the world for me), so they’re more accepting of Bs, but he’s been falling into the C and Ds recently too and that’s a big red flag to me. 
My little brother is honestly a smart kid, and perhaps I’m being a overly-worried big sister, but I’m worried he’s gonna do something stupid and let his grades fall into the gutter, or worse: get caught and expelled.

I don’t want to tell my parents and break my promise to him because (1) they’re gonna lose their minds and (2) I’ll lose his trust and break our relationship, and I really value him. He’s my only sibling. 

That being said, today my dad asked him about whether he drinks or smokes, and he lied to his face. My mom 100% believes that he wouldn’t do it and I’m being torn apart by guilt.

I want to talk to him about it and the consequences it’s having on him, but I just don’t know what to say. And he’s at the age where I’m not “cool” enough for him.

Idk call me a square or annoying or whatever, but I could really use advice about how to talk to him about cutting down (at the very least) and refocusing on his studies before he screws up his gpa entirely and can’t get a job. The guilt is also really eating away at me, and sometimes I wish I didn’t know (especially since if my parents do find out, he’s probably gonna tell them I know and I’ll get the brunt of it). I know it’s probably not a big deal for most people, but idk man recently the things he’s been telling and showing me recently are kind of terrifying, and I really don’t need this stress about his wellbeing on top of Med school kicking my butt every day.",03Jan2020,1
203,"Okay so there is a lot of backstory here, but this is the current state:

Soon 30, studying engineering CS ,second year at UNI out in nowhere.

My ex suddenly broke up right before exams and it messed me up making me needing to take another year. So it will be atleast 2,5 years before I graduate.

This hit me like a truck as we were planning on moving together soon, and the uniwork was extremely hard in it's own right and I kind of hate it!; though the jobs after are VERY secure and high paid.

Now almost 30 I really don't feel like living out here in nowhere for the next 3 years to be honest. My relationship and our plan held me afloat during that. But now especially since all the jobs are in the main big city I kind of want to move there asap. 

Even thinking of just doing a coding bootcamp.

Problem is I don't have good enough grades for enrolling in the big city unis now, so I would need to take some time fixing my grades again and apply the year after. 

I got almost 1 year of approved coursework from this uni. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also dating is on my mind. I',m soon 30, and if I stay here I will be 32,33 when I move and settle in the big city. I don't like the thought of not dating for 2, 3 years. I could but I would be moving again. I feel my dating ""peak"" is around now and will go down when I'm 33. This might be me overthinking though.

204,"This is a deep and tormenting story for me and reader discretion is advised...

Background: So my immediate family and all my relatives are very close. My mother has quite a large family and trusts them very dearly. I'm an only child and have always had a close relationship with my cousins in which I have a lot of. This story takes place when I was around the ages of 7 or 8 and is about how I was taken advantage of by cousin. My mental turmoil is immense.

All my family has always been there for me. When I was a young child I was often sent to stay at my aunt's house for nights as my parents would go away on trips. My aunt has 2 children, one quite younger than me and one only a little bit older, a boy and a girl. We were all very close as children, I would stay in the same bed as my older cousin and this was no problem for a long time, until one night when she began to kiss me as I slept. I knew this was wrong but I froze, no one had ever done anything like this and I was at the age where I thought girls were icky. I was very upset and didnt understand what was even happening. After she had finished I just went to sleep and woke up the next morning confused but acted as if nothing had happened. I didnt tell anyone... everytime my parents would leave town I would stay with my aunt and would be taken advantage of by my older cousin, I was so scared when she would do it but I was only a young confused child. My cousin then began to touch me in places which are not appropriate and would force my hand to her private places too, all while thinking I'm asleep. This continued for about a year until I decided enough was enough and begged my aunt to allow me to sleep with my younger cousin instead. She was confused but allowed it. It all stopped then.

Now: I'm a young man now and my cousin who touched me is a young woman. Our families are still very close and I have a close relationship with my cousin. We have never mentioned it since but I have been completely messed up with any sexual experiences that I face. I see women in a very negative way and find it hard to grow an emotional relationship with them. My history with my cousin always plays at the back of my mind and Its torture to have it bottled up inside. I fear that if I were to tell anyone, I would be responsible for destroying my family's relationship. My cousin now has grown into a ""perfect innocent lady"" and I fear that If I were to speak up, her status may lead people to not believe me. Aswell as this I fear the social backlash that was arise, as I live in a very small town and word gets around quick. I am completely stuck and trapped in a mental hell with my history on constant repeat in my mind. Can someone please suggest an appropriate form of action for me to take to ease my pain. I will do my best to reply to most. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",03Jan2020,1

He'll call me ""selfish for abandoning him"" if I try to talk to other people. He makes me feel guilty for talking to my old friends, so I generally don't. I wanted to talk to my friends again, but I didn't want to go through that whole process again.

So. I have a complex situation. And this is going to be a lot of rambling .

Some background for context: I was diagnosed with a very rare brain cancer at 10, believed terminal. I survived, to battle it again my junior and senior year of high school. I attended school going through chemo, and traveling constantly to see doctors who might be of use. Despite this I was Honors/AP. Was the president of 3 clubs, in 3 choirs, theater, varsity athletics, got admitted to college on a presidential scholarship and then some. 

My health however meant a lot of hardship for my family. Economically, emotionally, etc. 

I was attending a school away from home, on a very big scholarship, was in the honors program and was set to start doing an internship with the head of our honors program in cognitive science. 

Shortly before fall semester began, shit hit the fan. I had more than 12 new lesions on my brain on my routine MRI. I was starting to lose feeling in and use of my legs, was always in intense pain. I underwent emergency surgery, and started chemo. This meant leaving the school I loved and was succeeding at to live at home again and transfer to the satellite campus of a large university near my hometown without connections or scholarship. 

This semester was hell. In and out of the hospital. Busting my ass to try to pass. Constantly sick. 

That’s beside the matter of my family. My mother is a controlling narcissist. My father is her doormat and takes her side in everything despite her treating him just as poorly. 

I spend every second I’m at home being belittled and reminded how me and my illness is the reason for my families misery. I’m told how my suffering is in my head, how it’s so much harder on her than it is me. 

I don’t have the option to return to the school I was at, and with everything that went on I wound up failing everything at the new one this semester. I’m behind where I want to be, struggling with cancer and depression and feel like I can’t go on in this situation, but I have no idea what to do.

For context, about 6 months ago my parents found out my now ex and I had sex and they totally flipped out. Although I've never really liked the status of my ex and I's relationship, over that time it basically just resorted to hookups. She's also the only girl I've ever been with. Just today my parents found out that we hooked up again (i've also been caught in the months prior) and proceeded to take my phone, my car, and sent me a formal note (see below) forcing me to leave. 

I currently have a steady job at Target where I make $13 an hour and have $3300 in the bank. I have steady grades and take plenty of AP classes, I'm a pretty smart kid. Right now getting myself to college is the priority and I've applied to several colleges but I doubt I'll be able to afford the out of state schools. I'm waiting to see if I qualified for the Army ROTC scholarship which would cover 3-4 years. My goal is to become an army officer. It's an extremely competitive scholarship so right now I have to assume that I won't get it. 

I truly don't even know where to begin. Whether I should get a phone, a car, how I'll pay for college, where I'll live come march, or whether I should just save my money I really don't know. If any of you guys have any advice on steps to take I am dying to hear it, my life literally depends on it.

And regarding my parents, to be honest I'm not even mad at them.  Because I know they got tired of getting lied to but ultimately I just know that me hooking up with a girl does not warrant this kind of response. After all I could be doing much worse. 

I love all you guys and I'd be lying if I said I don't need you right now, I can't do this alone.

242,"Throwaway account because reasons. 

I hate my body. Since I've been a kid, I've been insecure about being overweight. I've gained a good bit of weight over the past year (perhaps in part as a symptom of clinical depression), and today, my bmi registers as 32 (obese). I'm disgusted, and I hate myself for the way my body looks.

Naturally, a good part of me is compelled to take any action to change this - exercise, dieting, pills, calorie restriction, and so on. But I've read all these studies showing that people who are able to lose weight and keep it off in the long term are in the minority (somewhere in the range of 5%, if I'm remembering correctly). Of course, our bodies have evolved to keep our body weight relatively constant over the long term, so our metabolisms are designed to quickly adjust to new diets and exercise regiments. Human biology is working directly against the one seeking to lose weight.

And then there's the toxic culture surrounding weight loss. I'm well aware that the main reason I'm unhappy with my body is because I've been conditioned since I was a little girl to hold up some anti-fat bias. I watched my mom yo-yo dieting while I was growing up, saw her project her own body image issues onto her daughters, and watched in awe at commercials promising fast and effective weight loss solutions on TV. I know how toxic the culture surrounding weight loss and an obsession over ""thin-ness"" is. And I know from all these studies that most people will fail to keep off weight in the long term, and yet this culture places blame on the individual as a personal, moral failure resulting from a lack of willpower.

All of this, of course, encourages me to not bother trying at all, and rather resign myself to being obese for the rest of my life while doing the best I can to live healthily. But then again, I hate the way my body looks and the amount of fat I carry on my body, and I'd rather live in a world where I was a thinner, more attractive version of myself.

I'm pretty stuck here, so I decided to reach out and try to get some other peoples' thoughts.",03Jan2020,1

244,"So today (January 2nd) I got scheduled to have my wisdom teeth removed Saturday (the 4th). Last Saturday (28th of December) some friends and I got talking about going ice skating in the outdoor rink in my city and decided on this Friday (the 3rd) bc that’s the only time we could all go before we all go back to college. My mom practically exploded when I told her of this plan, saying I could get injured, sick, etc. and then what if they have to call off the surgery. 

So my mom is a paranoid person by nature. Always thinks the absolute worst of people, always worried about going places alone bc she might be kidnapped (we live in one of the safest places in the US), etc. and so when I was younger I shared this scary view of the world but I’m trying to grow out of it? When she brought these things up I was worried but then I tried to talk myself down. I have been doing skating lessons/coaching and skating a couple times per week for a couple months now, so I am not someone who will be hugging the boards and having no idea what I’m doing. I go skating on Fridays anyway, so I was intended to go even by myself to the indoor rink I practice at, and my mother was fine with that, so I reason I’m about as likely to get injured on either rink. I went to the gym today, at her suggestion, and I figure I’m as likely to contract something there as anywhere. 

I’ve been trying to get people to go skating over the course of my whole break, because I’ve always wanted to go to this rink and I’ve never been able to skate before, and this is my only chance for another year. This will also be my last chance at movement for about the next week due to my wisdom teeth removal and I think it would take my mind off the anxiety about the procedure.

245,"So as some back story: I’m currently 20 (F) and 288lbs. At my highest weight, I was 303lbs. Up until that point, I was afraid every 10lbs I gained, but I just didn’t give a shit. Until I saw that 303. I was absolutely disgusted with myself.

I suffer from clinical depression and some severe ADHD, so I would typically eat my feelings or eat to just feel SOMETHING because I wasn’t producing enough dopamine or serotonin. I’ve been taking Lexapro for the depression, and was recently put on Adderall for my ADHD.

The Adderall seemed to be the final factor to finally get me to have some kind of restraint, or motivation. As soon as I was put on it, I lost my appetite and resisted every urge to eat out. I started cooking healthy meals for myself at home, and dropped 15 pounds in about 2 weeks which is A LOT. 

I actually felt okay about myself for once. But today... I slipped up again and I feel awful and stupid and just weak and worthless, and disgusting. I had forgotten to take my Adderall today, and because of this, I lost my inhibition and just BINGED like I never have before. I had: a chicken salad croissant, a hot pocket, a big cheeseburger, a chili cheese dog, AND like 4 bbq boneless wings. I didn’t feel anything.  I just felt numb. 

When the initial dopamine high subsided it all hit me what I had just done. I failed. I failed again. I’m never gonna get the weight off.

I need help. I can’t keep doing this. I felt so proud of myself and now I just feel like a pig. I wish I just had the courage to just say fuck it and just get to 600lbs and just die already and do the world a favor. 

I’m afraid to eat. I’m afraid of eating more than a cup of soup. I’m afraid of people hating me for being so disgusting.

Any advice on how to go on from here would be appreciated. Thank you.",03Jan2020,5
246,"(Please no vegan bashing) 

I'm 30, birthday in a few weeks. The majority of my large family lives within 2 miles of me. We are close. 

About a year ago, after 60+ years of an omni/Mediterranean leaning diet, my parents transitioned to an extreme form of veganism in an attempt to reduce some symptoms related to a rare disease my father has suffered from for almost a decade. Their results were beyond successful-- my dad was actually cured and is in the best health of his life! 

However, my parents (mainly my mom) have become so passionate about this diet that it is impacting all of our relationships. They think everyone should follow their diet immediately and perfectly, and it is basically all they talk about. We have all made accommodations, but it feels like nothing is good enough. My (hisband/kid) family and I eat primarily vegan now, but because I use oil and some meat substitutes, I'm doing it wrong. My sisters became vegetarians which is apparently ""just as bad"" as eating meat. Our Christmas traditions all changed to inedible mush-- no sugar, oil, fat, onion, etc. They don't even want to be around food that doesn't fit their diet  And it is ALL they talk about, even if we ask to change the topic.  We have-- many times-- explained their expectations are too extreme and their passion is causing negative feelings and conflicts. They feel they must continue to try to convert us, as it will save our lives. 

My birthday is in a few weeks and we always have a get together-- food, cake, etc. --always at my mom's house. I know this will be a problem. I do not want to sit through a vegan lecture, and I don't want to host it elsewhere and have my parents upset by the food options. I know canceling will cause drama but I don't know what else I should do? 

Do I cancel? Grin and bear it? Plan some kind of alternate activity?",03Jan2020,2

My ED stems from me being afraid of choking or vomiting from the food im eating. My mom did try to get me help when i was younger but she was convinced my ED was from vanity and that i wanted to be thin and ""more attractive"" this was completely false. When she found out that my therapist diagnosed me with ARFID eating disorder she pulled me from therapy and tried treating me herself. This included lots of screaming fighting arguing and a lot of her forcing me to eat in a way that was not loving. All of that behavior caused me to go days without eating, my longest was 6 days and i ended up fainting and having to be rushed to the hospital because i wasn't waking up. this went on all throughout highschool still fainting in class at least 3 times a month. I'm now 23 and have just now started seeking professional help.

252,"Throwaway account. Apologies for the long post. 


I’d like to start off by saying I’m making this post in hopes that the community will respond in kind and non-judgmental ways. I am coming from a place of not quite yet desperation, but some severe stress. 
I have been in a relationship with an extremely kind, loving and understanding man for seven months now. It is the first healthy relationship either of us have been in for years, and that in itself is amazing. While not perfect, we are pretty damn near close. I see a future with this man and we have talked about marriage and babies and dogs. We have plans to move in together this coming summer. We are both bartenders so our schedules match up pretty well. 
When we became official, I had been a stripper on and off for just over three years in addition to working in bars and restaurants. I made excellent money at the clubs and genuinely loved the work, averaging $300- $900 per night and sometimes making as much as $1,000 or $2,000. In the industry it becomes extremely easy to get accustomed to high levels of income for fewer hours than most people work. (Not insinuating the industry is easy by any means. I earned that shit.) Like many young women in the industry I was irresponsible with my money, ran into unexpected expenses, etc. basically I’m saying I have nothing to show for it. I had never seen that kind of money before and I failed to exercise self control and think about the future. That’s on me. 
I stopped working at the club about 2-3 months into our relationship. While he was endlessly supportive and never showed judgement, he is also the worst liar I’ve ever met. I could see it paining him every time I left for work. A big part of it was jealousy. A big part of it was the fact that a lot of his/our friends go to the club I was working at and had seen me there and made comments to him. I don’t resent him for this in the slightest. We are both very in touch with ourselves and aware that we can be jealous people. It takes a very specific and secure type of person to date a sex worker. I know myself enough to know that I wouldn’t have it in me. Anyways, the tips I earned started getting smaller and smaller as my guilt grew. Eventually the money I earned did not meet the money I had to give away at the end of the shift to the DJ/managers/bar/ food expenses/ and house fee dancers are required to give the club for every shift they work. I was literally leaving in the red. I’m addition, we were (still are) deep in the honeymoon phase and all I could think about was going home to him rather than working. I left almost every shift early because I missed my boyfriend. So I stopped. I quit dancing to bartend full time. Money was all good until the summer ended along with the good weather. In my city, slow season for service industry runs from November - March ish. Failing to realize what was coming, we took too many trips in the fall, bought too much shit, spent too much on the holidays, etc. and next thing I know it, my bank account has been on a roller coaster for three months. I always make rent/bills but it seems to be getting scarier every month. Tip outs since November at my bar have ranged about $30 - $160 per night, with a rare few nights over $200. My industry friends all over the city are making similar. Compared to what I was making last year this is devastating. I have made some necessary changes such making food rather than eating out, going out less, picking up shifts at multiple bars, etc. I just cant seem to get to a space where I’m comfortable financially again. Today I looked at my bank account and realized I have $500 in it. This is unacceptable for me. My boyfriend makes more money and would be in a space to help me out but I refuse to accept help from him. I’m used to making more money than my partners so this feels very alien to me. I know that once spring arrives I’ll be more than ok, but that is over two months away and the stress seems to keep eating at me. I’m getting one day off per week and working as many shifts as I can pick up but I can’t seem to get afloat. I want to bring up the possibility of my going back to the club for a while but am not sure how to facilitate the conversation. I’m looking for help on having a constructive talk as well as lessening the guilt I feel because of my relationship should I choose to go back to work. Thanks.

257,"I started this on New Year's Eve, didn't get around to finishing it until now. Better late than never. Apologies if this is all over the place, I don't know where to start.

I suffer from pretty bad anxiety, and very rarely (if at all) make first contact with someone because I'm paranoid that they don't like me. No exceptions to this rule, unfortunately. Even a ""hi, how are you?"" makes me feel like I messed up!

I have a friend who has become distant from me recently and I don't know how to feel about it. Over the last year, it's become obvious that he has no interest in continuing with the friendship, and I'm trying to move on but I'm finding it difficult because I'm always hoping he'll message me or something.

The turning point was when I asked him on a Sunday if he wanted to do anything during the following week and he declined. The very next day, he told me that he and a mutual friend were going out... in 15 minutes. I got 15 minutes notice after he declined the day before, so I assumed it was only an invite to save face. After that, I stopped messaging him and things fell apart from there. 

I don't know what I want. I recently told him some of this but nothing has really changed so it's officially over, I'm just looking to be ok with it and move on with my life. I always felt like I was a burden to him so it's actually better for me.

After that, they'll probably lecture me on the importance of school. See, k-5 grades were important. All of this other shit isn't. Don't think so? Here's a demonstration. 9x9? 81. Easy. Now, what's 4 1/3 - 1 +  1/2? Not so easy huh? See, the human mind forgets stuff that we don't use every day, stuff is isn't essential to life. We all know how to walk, but all of us probably don't know how to skate or how to swim. The same logic applies to education.

And finally, last but certainly the most fucking frustrating, is the idea that school is comparable to a job. It isn't. When you go to work, you get something valuable, and that's money. I go home and I don't get shit accept homework and a salty attitude. You can choose your job, you can't choose to go to school. You can be genuinely happy at your job, because you chose it. You can't choose what you want in school.

        I’m 15 and it was New Year’s Day at like 6 am and we were chilling for a couple hours earlier laughing at dumb people on her instagram and TikTok. Eventually we decided to get some sleep but that didn’t go to well because neither of us were tired. We ended up staring at each other and slowly moving towards each other. We kissed (I don’t know how long I was a bit preoccupied to be counting) and I just kinda went with the flow because (as the title suggests) I hadn’t really done anything like this before. She pulled away a bit abruptly (I think) saying “I’m a terrible friend” and I said “maybe we should get some sleep” (I later discussed with the shampoo bottle that this wasn’t the best move, but I’m not an expert on this kinda thing) she just said “yeah.” Neither of us got any sleep. The whole day I was completely exhausted because I got like an hour of sleep and I didn’t do many activities (I forgot to mention that we were at a water park) because I felt like I could fall asleep at any moment. I haven’t talked with her much after that besides a few stupid jokes.
        I’m not the most extroverted person in the world but I’ve been working on being a bit more outgoing (I’d say I’ve been doing it right). I have really good grades and play video games.. a little to much. I love running and I’m the fastest on the cross country team, even though I’m only a freshman.
       As for her, she’s like one of my step-sisters best friends and she’s pretty popular, I can’t say we’ve interacted much in the past but there have few times when we talked, but not much. I don’t know her that well, although I will admit that that night I did a lot of Instagram stalking.

269,"Basically, around September/October we had a severe conflict because she was reading through my private conversations with her boyfriend (not suspicious conversations or anything, I'm in a 1.5 year long relationship), and she spread false rumors to multiple people about my own relationship - she said I no longer liked my boyfriend but wouldn't break up with him, which is nothing close to what I actually said. This caused a lot of people to dislike me for something completely false and I haven't forgiven her for that at all (don't know why she thought my relationship was her business when we rarely speak in the first place). So we've been on very rough terms since then, although I can't quite figure out why she dislikes me for that whole incident...

However, a few days ago she apparently found out that I told someone that she's bad at dancing (she does kpop covers, has a dance account and performed in a school show), and I don't think she took it too well. She said something like she's ""used to"" messages like that on her dance account and such, but elsewhere she mentioned that it ""kinda hurt"" and blocked me after that. So, I don't know. Before, I was upset by her because she was the one in the wrong. I feel like what she did to me was way worse than this, but I still feel uncomfortable/bad/sorry/uneasy about the fact that this time I wronged her, and she has something objectively bad to hate on me for now.

So I was considering messaging her about this whole issue, but I have no idea what to say. I don't want to lie about what I said - I'm not sorry for saying that about her dancing (numerous people I know have said the same thing, even her friends/people who aren't my friends) because I find it true, and she showed me such a despicable side of her in the previous conflict that I can't feel sorry for offending her minorly. She is also a bit melodramatic on social media and prone to rash, frankly a bit crazy logic (I know this seems just salty, but I can provide more details on what I mean if you want), so I have no clue how she would react if I messaged her. As I said, I'm not sorry for saying she's bad at dancing (as I can explain it more objectively, in a constructive-criticism way) - I'm sorry that she found out in such a way and that it widened the gap between us. And, frankly, that for once I seem like the offender instead of her (as aforementioned) - this one is kind of selfish but yeah, it makes me very uncomfortable. Also, I know that she didn't like me because of the first incident, but I have no idea *why*, and that could be a factor in what I should say to her.

So yeah, if you have any advice on what I should say or shouldn't say, I really really need it. Thanks!

284,"I grew up in an extremely stric muslim family and I personally always hated and wanted to be free. The religion wasn't the problem, but the tribal culture my parents came from were. The culture and the religion made two stric parents that never allowed me to go outside. They always some as a fragile object, made to be protected and then forced into an arranged marriage with a degree in engineering. I hated that and so I started to fight for my freedom. I have been through fight almost everyday of my life ranging from a few slaps and hits with a stick, to straight up having a hot burning knife put on my skin. Also being threatened with a bullet through my head and being called all kinds of fucked up things. 

But there is a big problem I am facing now in my long battle. I am planning on moving out next year when I am going to college,  but I don't know what education or should I say Major to choose. 

My whole life I have been fighting against my familiy's fucked up rules that I never had time to find what I am intersted in. Now I have been trying best the last 3 months to find something appealing to me, but I am unsure if the thing I like is something I like or something my parents like. 

You see the deal I have made with parents is that I can choose whatever I want as long as I make a lots of money. 

Second part of the problem is that most things I have learned in my life I was forced to learn them, never thinking if I like it or not. I always had to learn quick and as much as possible like my life depended on it. Never learning or doing something for fun, but purely for the fact if I didn't learn it either my parents or somebody else would have hurt me.

So now everything I look at reminds a bit of my past and I have hard time deciding do I enjoy this or not. What was that helped you decide and what is good advice for me?

I've been with this company for a few years but I've not been getting treated with the same respect as my peers. I'm moving on to hopefully gain some confidence and be happy this year. The issue is I have many friends there and I know management will take this really personally, as it seems they think I'm being really ungrateful for being unhappy. I hope I am treated with respect when leaving but I'm not sure that will happen. My career field is really small so I will probably still see people in the company quite often, and the thought of the attitude I might receive makes me worry.


I am really scared to actually tell them I'm leaving, it's all I have been able to think about over the holidays. I really dont want for anyone to fall out with me over this. I'm obviously going to be really respectful and thankful for everything, but they won't be pleased.

Personally, I was never a very sexual person, so I couldn't say for sure what I was until recently. Unfortunately... I believe I'm a sub too even though I've been the dominant one in our relationship. The only reason I could enjoy the dominant role was because I knew he liked it. So what can I do?
I don't want to always be the dominant one when it doesn't turn me on, but I hate to ask him to do it when I know he wouldn't enjoy it either.

So my cousin and I have a really weird relationship. When I was in high school (and he was starting university), we became extremely close and were basically like best friends. He was seeing someone during that time which I knew about- this person was someone we mutually know. But one day we were just talking and the topic of sex came up, and he basically said he wanted to fuck me. I had no relationships prior to this, so I had no idea what this even meant. He also tried to kiss me that night but I kind of went away to my room, and couldn't sleep the entire night. I didn't bring anything up, but the next day he said he didn't want to do it anymore. I was already confused with what was going on, so I just went along with it.

The next few years were basically me trying to get through high school, but we still remained very close. I looked up to him a lot, and went to him for any advice whatsoever. But he would always bring up this day, and the way he would say it was like I initiated things even if I didn't. When this cousin broke up with his then girlfriend, he told her I was part of the reason because I tried making a move onto him. 

When I got to university, i started dating someone and he has tried to sabatoge the relationship so many times by creating problems.thankfully the person i' with could see him for what he truly was.  I found out that he has also been telling select family members about what happened. 

I am finally coming to terms with the fact that he has tried to take advantage of me, and when it didn't work, he keeps on bringing it up to keep a hold on me. He has said some very inappropriate comments to me in front of my cousins as well about what happened, and it really hurts me every time. 

I want to tell someone, but I didn't know who so I turned to you, Reddit. This situation is so hard, because I want to cut him off, but he is very close to my entire family. I know it will tear them apart if they find out, but I don't know how long I can keep this inside me.",03Jan2020,2

304,Ok so I recently went to a friends high school New Years party and I found myself in a very scary and troubling situation for me. I met this girl a while back at school and we talked and were pretty close but I never had any feelings for her I’m M16 and she’s F16. She also happened to go to the party and we talked for a bit and caught up on our favorite 2019 memories. I could tell she started having feelings for me for about a month or so. (I usually bring my own drinks when I go to high school parties just to be in the safe side) I offered her the water that I brought in bottles and she said that she would rather have alcohol (even though she wasn’t allowed to drink because of her age). She knows that I like to be on the safer side and she asked if I wanted to alcohol too. I said no and it felt like she took that as an insult and kept trying to pressure me into drinking. I had enough so I got up to leave but she stopped me and told me that she had some “important” things to tell me. We went into a bedroom and I questioned why she locked the door. She answered with a “no reason” and that was peculiar because she always has an explanation for something. She confessed her feelings to me (she thought that I hadn’t realized that she liked me) and she was waiting for me to react and I stayed neutral and just said ok then she leaned in for a kiss. I kissed her back (with no tongue or anything like that) I could feel her trying to give me tongue and we kissed for a while until things escalated. She started trying to take my shirt off and that’s why I told her to stop. I’m personally not ok with highschoolers my age having sexual interactions because it’s too early and bad things happen. This time she got really mad at me and she went on a rant about how “men are supposed to like sex and want it all the time” stuff like that. That’s when I knew there was something wrong with her. She knew my views on sex and relationships but she still crossed the line and I’m planning on filling a restraining order and I’m never EVER going to a party no matter the type and I’m sticking to my word.

then i open the door threw toys in and go to my room and close the door quickly... then here he comes running upstairs busting my door opening grabbing on me going straight for my neck talking about hes gon kill me etc... he tells my mom he did all of that because i was talking shit about his kids which i would never. My mom said the last thing she heard me say was ""ill take care of them "" and then heard him coming up stairs after me."" 

After all the commotion i drove to the police station to make a statement and that was about 4 days ago they went to the house and my mom said no one was there. (Basically lying to the cops) cause he had left and i was sitting in the car when they came (i didnt say anything when the cops came because i was nervous and i told them i was going to a homeless shelter, but i couldnt go because it was like 6:30 in the morning and they said they were opening back up at 4-6pm to let people in.) And ive been back home ever since. 


Fast forward to today so just an hour ago i was sleeping and she bust in my room like you got your brother arrested? I said huh? She said you got him arrested.... whatever you said to the cops that day they arrested him. I told her i said he assualted me and she just stayed silent. Now i feel guilty and anxious any advice? or any support? No i didnt lie but its just the principal i think im more upset that my mom is upset... yes multiple times 3 and 4 situations like this has happened but she doesnt know about them she only knows about this one because she just so happened to be home. &amp; another serious one when i was younger because i was scared of him. Please help

311,"I am reposting this from r/legaladvice, but I'm honestly really desperate for answers. Even in terms of how to handle this situation on my behalf 

My mom is a Guatamalan immigrant who works as a Janitor and living assistant for our 90 year old landlord. She is unfortunately not legal, and didn't get her papers done right prior to 9/11 - so we'd risk having to send to back to her country for 10 years. And it's not a nice place.

Anyways, this is the only form of work she can get until that guy passes. 

We've lived in this apartment for almost my whole life - practically 20 years. And she's worked for that long as well.

However, a neighbor (Jessica) who moved in 4-5 years ago with her two children has become notorious for being extremely unruly. Fighting with neighbors, gossiping, and and even being openly abusive to her children. 

She has gossiped about the fact that my mother is an illegal ""wetback"" who sleeps with our fucking 90 year old landlord. Ridiculous but... not like she's doing anything illegal.

In July of this year however, my mom stepped out to walk to the store alone, and Jessica randomly pulled up in her car beside my mother and called her racist names and threatened to call ICE on her. 

My mom was so terrified, she ran back home and contacted me. We went to the police, made a report, but they couldn't do much.

Today that woman strikes again. My mom was cleaning near her back steps of the apartment - because that's her job - and opened up her door only to follow my mother around the apartment and continue to tell profanities, disgusting sexual gossip, racist slang, and treats to call ICE. 

My mom again is terrified, and went to the police today while I was at work, and while they made another report about Jessica, the cops said they can't do much.

My mom Lives near this woman, is afraid of her, and (rumors are rumors but) this woman has been notorious for fights, having a lengthy criminal record (including felonies and apparantly a child murder charge?), and for being ironically racist despite her being Hispanic/American.

I am really worried that this woman is/will stalk my mother, or will actually call ICE on her just because she doesn't like her. It is so ridiculously petty, but this is now getting out of hand. I am contemplating approaching her and speaking to her, and asking her to stop. 

I've also contemplated on contacting my Alderman.


Any advice on how to handle this? We live in",03Jan2020,2

320,"So idk why but this girls kind of just been on my mind and i never thought of here in any way before, but we’ve always gotten along well but there’s a slight shift now I think. I started seeing her kind of differently when she started complimenting me regularly, touching my shoulders like a couple times, and just talking more. She’s one of those types of people I know, and where we don’t go out of our way to talk, but when we do see each passing by we talk for like 5-10 minutes just standing in the middle of everything. We’ve talked for a good hour or two just when we go to tutoring and we end up just talking about different things. I think we know each other pretty well and we’ve talked a good amount.

And as I said before every time she sees me, she compliments me and she points out how my eyes look, how she likes the way I dress, how cool my height is, i wore glasses one time and she complimented them as well, and she makes me feel really good to be honest, and I’ve always just said thank you and tried to complement her as well. I cant tell if she thinks of me romantically or not bc she’s kind of one of those “quirky” extroverted girls, so she’s kind of direct and subtle at the same time.

Anyways pretty much every time I see her it’s a highlight of my day just bc she compliments me, and we actually have good conversation about anything really. I don’t really want to ruin that, and I would regret it so much if things got “weird” and things changed. 

I was just thinking of asking her if she wanted to smoke weed and hangout, but so far every time I’ve smoked weed with a girl it’s ended up making things weird or it turns out bad. To be fair it’s only happened with two girls, but those were the only two I smoked weed with.

I figure i pose the questions and if she says she’s busy or something, then I’ll get the idea, and if she’s down for it I’ll just go with the flow. I’ll be a little flirty and what not and judging by things, I’ll probably get an answer to my question.

What I’m most afraid of is just messing up the friendship and it won’t be the same after we hangout or something. Do you think it’s worth it to not even ask her out but just ask her to hangout and smoke weed? I feel like that’s pretty natural and substances kind of usually allow you to put your guard down.

322,"Hey everyone! I met a girl back in June at a church event and she was just kind of another face in my life. Didn't think much of her (this was an entirely new group for me).  Well I started hanging out with this group a lot more and it got worse. I thought she was rude and didn't like me. Well time went on, and the group kinda split and some of us started to really enjoy dancing. Every Friday night we'd go out taking lessons then dancing at a social. I still didn't like her a ton but we were becoming friends. Anyways it's December now and her and I are asked to do a couples performance together for a new year's eve party. We said yes.

That involved meeting a bunch together (apart from the main group- just with 1 or 2 others) to practice. Just getting to know her and talk to her a bunch I started catching feelings. Anyways the performance happened and we crushed it. So we're not dating or anything but we at least are becoming good friends. We have quite a bit in common, and I think a relationship would be great, but the problem is she's 24 and I'm 18. I don't know if age should stop me from pursuing. On one hand I really value our friendship and don't want to ruin it by confessing my feelings- but on the other hand I don't want to be fake and pretend I don't have feelings when I actually do.

(Also I'm not confident that she likes me back- but she shows ""signs"" -for lack or a better word- that she does though. Laughing at bad jokes, not recoiling from touch, being considerate and listening closely etc. etc.)

Any advice would be awesome! (Just a bit about me- I'm pretty mature for my age, very reliable, have a steady full time job, ect. ect.

I have been confronted to  move back to the U.S. before my benefits from my parents 'expires' thus allowing me to continue to reside here. I am also in a long distance relationship with an American who lives in the U.S.  


I had planned to move to the U.S. for awhile to be with my SO but the problem with jobs and a driver licence becomes a recurring topic for us since I don't have a drivers licence. As a foreigner living in Japan, the option to get a drivers licence is non-existent and therefore not being able to attend any drivers education. I was able to be flexible about this and hitch a ride with my coworkers before work started and either walk home or get picked up by someone to go home. I know I need a car in the U.S. for sure to get to places such as a job or grocery and whatnot as well as the fact that I will be starting off new with no friends with just me and my SO with their friends. (Currently live with my parents and siblings so I only help pay bills and grocery when needed)

It took years for me to understand what I did. It's been alternately at the back and front of my mind since. I try so hard to do good things for people and my strongest guiding principle is to never hurt someone.

I've been punishing myself in one way or another for most of my life. I've spent most of my life single and when I'm not my sex life is pretty awful. I be lying if I said my self loathing was because of this, but it probably plays a part. Righteous justice.

I want so badly to make amends but if this traumatized her, hearing from her abuser years later could only hurt. Any sort of apology no matter how sincere would only be for me. And no matter what my situation is, I'm not the victim. My welfare is secondary.

My therapist is telling me I need to forgive myself after so many years. I don't know if I should, or how. What would she want? Would she see the loneliness and sporadic substance abuse as justice? If she did see it that way, should I continue that? What if I did forgive myself and five years down the line I have a family while she's been dealing with trauma that's wrecked her life?

About a year and a half ago I bought my dad a really simple 2nd infantry division hat he wanted because that’s his unit (I think that’s what it’s called) he was in during the Vietnam war. One time when we were leaving for the store my hair was a mess and I couldn’t find any other hat but that one (he loved with me and my wife so our shit was all mixed). He told me to wear it but I said I thought maybe it wasn’t right because I’ve not served in the military so I don’t feel I’ve earned the right to wear it. He said, “Fuck it. You’re my daughter and if anyone asks you about it just say it’s mine. Who cares?”

He passed away about a year ago and I’m obviously heartbroken about it. I wanted to wear his hat because I miss him so much and I don’t know why but it just matters a lot to me. I just recently started wearing it out of the house on occasion but I still feel kind of guilty or disrespectful. I have a huge amount of respect for veterans and soldiers and would never want to be seen in any way as being disrespectful.

Today while I was out to eat with my family a man (presumably a veteran) approached me and excitedly asked me where I had served in Korea. I said “oh no sir, this was my dad’s hat. He served during the Vietnam war.” So he said something like oh that’s awesome he was in the 2nd infantry, then went back to eating at his table. He didn’t seem weird or upset but it made me wonder again if it’s okay to wear it. 

So, any military people and/or veterans out there, can you help me out? If wearing it makes me an asshole please just tell me. If it doesn’t, I’d like to wear it because I just miss my dad so much and it’s one of the only things I have of his that’s meaningful really at all.",03Jan2020,1

They've been together for like maybe a month and I'm really happy for him, like extremely happy, but since he's been gone with her, we don't spend time together. We've been friends since elementary school, and we play games on our computers all day. It's not an exaggeration when I say that he's everything I've got. So now that he's been hanging out a lot with this girl... I can't help but feel depressed and lonely. I don't want to say anything to him because I don't want to cause any trouble with him and his girlfriend (she doesn't like me that much because of a separate reason).

370,"About 20 years ago I had a girlfriend (Jenni) and a best friend (Dave) who had a girlfriend (Kelly). The 4 of us were inseparable, we did everything together. We all graduated college the same year, vacationed together, holidays together, everything. 

When Dave and Kelly were married I was the best man, Jenni was the maid of honor. It was just the greatest thing. A year later, Jenni and I were married. In the summer of ’99 the four of us were waterskiing at a lake when Kelly said she didn’t feel well. She had just taken a long ski run and she said that her arms felt strange. Honestly, she was kind of soft and we all kind of thought she was just being kind of a baby. But we got her back into the boat and within a couple minutes she lost all feeling in her arms. A few minutes later she lost all feeling in her legs, she collapsed and I hauled ass to get her back to the shore. An ambulance came and she was med-evac’d to a hospital. After a time she was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a condition that caused inflammation in her spine and she never walked again. Only after a period of a couple years did she regain partial use of her arms and very, very limited use of her hands.

Kelly did not take the illness well and lashed out at the world (completely understandable) and Dave became her emotional punching bag.  For two years he was by her side bathing her, changing her soiled clothes, everything and she destroyed him. One day he took her to physical therapy, brought her home, got her settled into her chair and left. He didn’t return for a year. He didn’t return Kelly’s calls, my calls, nobody. During that time Jenni and I stayed by Kelli’s side and Jenni sort of took over as her caregiver.  They became like sisters and their relationship was beautiful. Dave eventually returned, had a girlfriend on the side for a couple years but eventually returned to Kelly completely. They both matured immensely in that time and Kelly became this incredible human – full of kindness, joy, grace and many other great things.  For some reason Dave has always had a grudge against me and has had no interest in renewing our friendship, though I have tried. I never condemned Dave for leaving Kelly. I even briefly talked to him once about it and told him that I don’t know if I could last as long as he did without cracking under the pressure. 

In 2014 Jenni and I were driving back from an out of state triathlon when we were hit by a drunk driver. Jenni did not survive and I spent 3 and a half months in the hospital. It took me 8 months to walk again and the therapy was grueling. I stayed in contact with Kelly through all of it and she was a great support to me. Without her encouragement I don’t think I would have survived, I probably would have taken my own life. 

This morning I was told that Kelly passed away in her sleep last night. I am absolutely devastated and broken. I feel like the primary anchor in my life has been taken away. I called Dave but he didn’t answer. I went to his house, his sister said, “He doesn’t feel like visitors now. He’ll let you know if there is going to be a service.” 

I know there will be a service. Implicit in what she said was “Dave doesn’t want you there”.  Can someone please give me some advice on what to do. I don’t want to cause pain to Dave by being there but I desperately want to say goodbye to my friend.",03Jan2020,1

373,"In college I had a health problem that caused a major defect on my face, and I rationalized to myself that since nobody would ever want to date me with this defect, I would just pay for cam shows until I was 'fixed'. After I underwent a procedure, it did indeed fix my dating life a lot, I started to have girlfriends, lost my 'incel' mentality, and was just doing a lot better overall in life. However from time to time I would still pay for cam shows.

In an attempt to quit I have been trying to think of the WHY I want to quit. This is what I've come up with so far

1) When I pay for cam I feel low and worthless afterwards. I hate feeling this way and cam is something that makes me have these feelings. I also have to resort to lying about where funds went, have to hide payment accounts that I've created just for the purpose of cams, etc.

2) Paying for cam is a huge financial burden. I wouldn't be surprised if I'd have spent over 10k over the years. I realized that sometimes I'll rationalize to myself, I've been working so hard, I DESERVE to reward myself with a cam show.

3) I am going to start tracking days on a calendar where I don't pay for cam. Hopefully this will motivate me to not break my 'streak'. I am also looking for accountability partners and/or attending local sex addictions anonymous meetings.

375,"Background info: i have 2 little sisters, one is 1 year younger ill call Gan, the other is 9 year younger which ill call Jen.

Jens been home schooled all her life. 

Reason being that Gan had multiple breakdowns, caused by malicious teachers, and would shut down completely for weeks on end, we live in a poor neighborhood, have been in poverty for my entire life, so we of course couldn't take her from that school when nothing was EVER done no matter what they tried. Take her from one bad teacher, she would just get shuffled to another that would scream in her face. i had proof of this cause her classrooms, both of them, were separated by a thin wall from my own and i would constantly here teachers screaming about how 'retarded, and stupid you ugly deformed wastes of air' they all were. (one of the worst ones said, by the teacher i had the year before)

I never shut down cause i was already used to dealing with malicious evil pieces of sh\*t and my personal way of dealing with shit was to lie to myself and smile until i either forget it ever happened, or was convinced it wasn't that bad.

Until fifth grade, where i was under a lot more stress than usual, with caring for a baby with my sister, having terrible grades cause i never had time for homework, and a mom and dad that were fighting to the point they were thinking of getting a divorce, ONTOP of getting a really shitty teacher who screamed in my face for not understanding the assignment we had due. I started having visual and auditory hallucinations and it only got worse from there, until i ended up in PEMS for a week, a place that had other older kids who were in there for violence, drug use, or break downs, a kind of rehabilitation place for kids before they go home? i don't remember cause i blocked most of it from my mind, except for the scene of that kid being locked in chains and dragged to his room.

and then when i could finally go home a week later, a week in my parents get a call from school, threatening a call from cps if i didn't go to school the next day. i of course reassured them that i would be fine, in the way i always did and went to school.

so my parents have really sh\*tty experiences with the local elementary school and don't want her anywhere near that f\*cking place. They had the bright idea to home school her, which would have been fine if they didn't basically leave it to me and Gan to teach her, middle schoolers at the time. of COURSE that was a TERRIBLE idea, we didn't know how to teach, much less stay patient with a young child. every now and then they would take over for a good couple months, until they pushed it right back to us.

over the next couple years as Jen was getting taught every couple months stuff she may or may not remember the next week, i kept reassuring myself that it would get better, that they would pick up the slack and she would easily catch up to the other kids. but then 3 years passed with little progress in math, a lot of progress in science, and no progress in reading and writing.

4 years pass by and i'm freaking out, but i still have hope, i just pitch in more, push for it more. which works, they are finally helping teach her more, actually taking over more.

6 years and now i don't know what to do, Jens a genius when it comes to animals, and the planet in general, also knows a lot of medical knowledge and stuff about the human body, knows basic math, but can only string together simple sentences.

I understand why she was home schooled, the local elementary school is hell and f\*cked up all of us, me, Gan, and an unnamed elder sister. We all came out with our own particular problems that popped up at most a year into schooling. they didn't want Jen to suffer the same fate.

but she can barely read or right, can only really add and subtract yet, i'm really worried.

i don't know what to do. i love my parents and i know they did this with good intentions, but they really messed this up. me and Gan cant really do much cause were now in college and working towards getting a bachelors so we at least have slightly higher positions available to us a little more easily, so we can get out of this hell hole (the neighborhood, not the house). the only good thing though is that mom is picking up the pace and is teaching her every day now for hours on end. so Jens starting to finally pick up more and more words, but shes still years behind in that aspect.

what do i do? cut some of my sleep to help? i only ever have time to help at 12 am which is past her bed time and the time i usually go to sleep, is that something i should do? or is there something else i'm not thinking of.

(i need advice, cause i don't want to call cps. i'm sincerely hoping that that is not my only option)",03Jan2020,1

380,"This is a long one but i feel all details are necessary.

I’m 18 years old heading into my final semester of high school. There are two main environments that i spend time at which is school and my job. 

When it comes to school basically ever since my freshman year i’ve been a social wreck. Through three and a half years of high school i’ve made no relationships with people i’d consider friends from my classes and i’ve been carried socially from the fact that i played football and track so i always had a group of people who knew me and i could hang around. I’ve only gotten invited out to do stuff a couple times (all by that football group) through all of high school. I’ve always been considered as extremely quiet and sometimes even described as mute lmao. Most people i think have pretty much given up on trying to get me talking so i really just do my own thing. Id argue that it’s only gotten worse but mainly because of the fact that since the start of senior year i’ve pretty much given up and i’m just trying to graduate and get a fresh start. 

In terms of work i’m leaps and bounds better than school but still nowhere close to where i should / want to be. Here i’m much better at talking with people but i’m nowhere near 100% comfortable (despite working there for over a year). Here i mainly struggle to strike up / maintain good conversation. 

One important detail is that I moved to a new town before freshman year so i knew nobody prior to starting high school. I do have friends from my old town that i’m 100% comfortable with. I did recently visit them after several years and it was a bit awkward at first but i did warm up to a point that’s much farther along than i ever got with anyone where i currently live and that took less than a day. For this reason i feel that the case isn’t me just changing as a person.

Now here are my suspicions as to why it’s gotten to this point. I think the main 2 reasons are that for some reason i have issues talking, such as stumbling over words or just overall saying shit weirdly. The other reason is that i don’t know what to say in certain situations and it takes me too long to figure out something. It’s almost as if my brain processes shit too slowly. Often times i find myself wanting to say something but doubt whether if i should say it or not and by the time i decide it’s already too late. Usually it takes way too much mental preparation to tell somebody something (non work related).

Now here’s my situation: To work on this i wanted to see how developed of a relationship i could create with a girl i like that just started working at my job in roughly 6 months before i leave for college (most likely Arizona State).

Some backstory in case it’s useful: She’s the same age as me and she lived most of her life / graduated high school in Florida and moved here (California) and is currently taking a gap year (which gives me the idea that she doesn’t know many people but i’m not 100% sure) 

Note: I’m focusing on this person and others at work because i like the people where I work and hate most people at school.

Now that you know my social status, some possible reasons, and my goal, what is the best way i can grow to become more comfortable in social situations and work on this goal? 

I’ll answer whatever potential questions and any advice is appreciated.

Thanks",03Jan2020,1

Hi guys/girls, im looking for advice for my cat.
Recently he has lost alot of weight, he doesn’t eat alot almost anything,had diarrhea and throws up sometimes. The only thing he does is either drink water or milk and pee around the house. 
His fur isn’t soft too, its almost like its old (the fur) but the cat is like 6-7yo.
This would happen before too but not at this rate, sometimes he also had a wierd wound on his neck that would pop open, but we healed him eventually.
We have a vet coming soon but still need advice how to help him or what this actually is.
The reason we didn’t get help sooner is because he isnt a house cat, he would sometimes be in the house but most of the time he was out and about....

Hi!

I’m currently reading a book about Cognitive Behavior Therapy called Mind Over Mood from Dennis Greenberger and Christiane A. Padesky, and I'm here to ask for a recommendation on books that teach the reader how to use CBT techniques to develop and keep the cognitive and emotional skills that are related with high performance and achievement.

I’m now in my mid-twenties and, although I’ve achieved special goals so far, I’ve noticed a prevalent correlation between how well I perform and the existence (or absence) of external triggers (e.g. incentive and feedback from friends who have already accomplished similar goals before) that lead me to emotional and cognitive states of deep immersion in the process of attaining my purpose (be it academic, professional, relationships, etc.)

By this I mean that there were times that, even if I wasn’t really committed to the aim at first, I became deeply attached to the idea of achieving that particular objective as I got under the influence of those external triggers, thus, I found my way to excel at it mostly by my own. There were other episodes, however, I didn’t get the positive emotional and cognitive involvement and failed even if the aim was relevant to me and odds were in my favor.

So, as I’ve read that CBT techniques can be used to develop positive states of mood besides treating mood disorders, I wonder if someone here could recommend me a book (or more) I could benefit from in order to learn how to set myself to the same states of deep emotional and cognitive immersion I described before.

Thank you for your time.",03Jan2020,1

395,"Hi all, first time poster. Tried to keep this as brief as possible (TL;DR at the bottom).

I (24F) grew up in Dallas, where my parents still live. I went to Austin for college. My parents (both about 50) weren't super thrilled with the distance (\~3hr drive) but were very supportive for the most part. After I graduated last year, I decided to pursue a master’s degree which ended up being online. Because I knew I didn't want to move somewhere with no support system, I was basically left with 2 options: move back in with my parents or move to Virginia with my best friend where she would be attending law school. I decided that moving back in would not be good for me, as my parents (especially my mom) would probably let me stay there rent-free indefinitely and I would have no motivation to move out once I graduated. 

I decided to move to Virginia and try to become a little more independent from my parents while maintaining a support system in my best friend. When I announced this to my parents, it caused a huge argument between me and my dad. My mother was very unhappy but did not protest much; she got angry at my dad for trying to keep me from moving, as she worried it would strain our relationship and cause a permanent rift.

I'm now 3/4 of the way through my program and have plans to move back to Texas, but I'm not 100% focused on Dallas. I have some really good friends in Houston, and for a while, that distance from my parents (\~3hr drive) seemed good to me; I could visit my parents when I wanted and if something happened it would be easy for me to get there. But it wasn't so close that I would be expected to see my parents everyday.

However, when I told my family that I wasn't 100% sure where exactly in Texas I would end up (which is true; there are not enough job opportunities for me to be certain) some of them got frustrated. Most of my family (especially my dad's side) live within about 20 minutes of where they grew up and have lived in the same general area their whole lives. It seems like (especially to my extended family), whether I live 1200 or 200 miles away, there's no difference. They can’t seem to understand why I wouldn’t just move back to Dallas. Additionally, I’m becoming increasingly worried about hurting my mother, with whom I do not have the healthiest relationship.

I have intense feelings of guilt towards my mother because she suffers from fibromyalgia (along with other health issues), which was caused by the stress of giving birth to me (which she’s never blamed me for in any way). This guilt leaves me terrified of hurting her, and I feel like I should sacrifice my own happiness for her, lest I be ""selfish"" (something I'm currently working on in therapy).

Because of this guilt combined with my anxiety, I'm scared about not moving back to Dallas (a fear that has worsened as I visit home for the holidays). If I lived in Houston, I would ideally drive to see my parents for one weekend every 3 or 4 weeks and spend a little extra time there on holidays. Because of my mother's health issues, traveling to see me is not feasible. She gets tired and overheated easily and doesn't like being out of the house for more than a few hours at a time. However, I worry about boundaries if I move back to Dallas. If I move too close, I feel like I'll be expected to see my parents every day. I also worry about not having a good support system; I'm not comfortable leaning on my mom much, and my dad is emotionally distant. I’d have one friend locally who I don’t feel would be able to provide much support.

Right now as I start looking for jobs, I'm looking at both Dallas and Houston, and there's a good chance I'll only get one offer and the decision will be made for me. But I'm so scared that even though I would be moving from 18 hours to 3 hours away, it won't be enough to make my mom happy. Even worse, I worry I may accept a job in Houston/Dallas and come to regret it, and feel stuck where I am, unable to move to the other city.

Some other info:

\-I have one sister (18F) starting community college next semester. From what I can tell, she'll likely live at home for the next 2 years and then she wants to transfer to a university 2 hours away from my parents. Her living at home has relieved some of my guilt as my mom is not yet an ""empty nester.""

TL;DR: After almost 2 years of being 1000+ miles away, I'm torn between trying to move to my hometown to satisfy my parents or move 3 hours away from them, which is what I think I want. Would I regret moving back to my hometown, or would I regret sacrificing what I want for my mom more?",03Jan2020,1

My husband has always been treating my cats awfully to 'discipline' them, he will shout at them, stop his feet and chase them. I've told him time and time again to stop this but he always turns around and says that they have to learn and it's not a big deal because they come back to him later for a cuddle.
This morning I heard some banging upstairs, I kept quiet to hear into what was going on, I could hear some scratching on the floorboards and quiet yelps for one of the cats. I go upstairs and open the door to find one of my cats cowering and laying down in the litter tray, his face was covered in litter, his nostrils, bits on his mouth and some on his eyes, it broke my heart.

This job that I currently have (I am a junior level service desk technician - basically I'm the guy you call when your work PC goes down) I managed to get through a friend of mine recommending me to the company. I live about a 12 minute walk from my workplace and my living arrangement is quite suitable.

&amp;#x200B;

What I need advice on is why do I feel like I'm going nowhere? I get this crushing, overburdening weight that seems to make me feel like I'm not doing enough, I know I'm fairly lazy as a person, but all in all, my life is in a good place. Do any other 20-somethings feel this way at all? I've learnt to cope with it, I do smoke a lot of weed to numb but I've never had the cravings (yet) to properly \*use\* again. My friend who got me this job keeps incessantly asking me why don't I join him at the new company, keeps offering me job listings, but I'm satisfied with my junior level at the moment. He just does not seem to understand that and will keep going on about how great his new job is. I've kinda learnt to just ignore it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So again, the advice I'm really looking for here is how to cope with this overwhelming negativity that seems to crop up?",03Jan2020,2
405,"I don't want to go into details, but my ex-friend wants to sue me over this project that we did back in late October. I did some shitty things, he did some shitty things. Now the only reason that he hasn't done anything by now is that he doesn't have my freaking last name! Either he never cared about me enough to know my last name until now or maybe he is too dumb.

Honestly, when I think about it logically, I know I am innocent. But every night and day, I am spending my time thinking about what he can do, wondering how he can destroy me. Because of this, I need some legal counseling to ease my mind, and I can't wait for him to sue me. At the same time, I don't want to go to any of the subreddits and explain the details of what happened between us. Because I fear that there is a slim chance that he or the police can use my posts as evidence, even if I use a throwaway account. 

As a result of all of this, I need to talk to a lawyer in person. But my family is poor, and I don't want them to know anything about this mess. Funny thing is that around Thanksgiving, I telephoned this lawyer, and he told me to come to his office to talk with him for free. But since he told me to come the day after Thanksgiving,  and also I feared he might pull some trick to charge me, I didn't go. 

Now, I don't know what to do. I am wondering if it's possible to talk to a lawyer for free.

TL;DR: Is it possible to talk to a lawyer for free?",03Jan2020,1
406,"First post on the sub, but here goes. So I’m still in school, and I’ve had a thing for this girl for the past few months. It started in October when she told me she might not be straight, and in the weeks proceeding we almost kissed, and held hands for a bit (real spicy, I know). I was in a relationship at the time but I broke it off soon following; but no moves were made between us. Fast forward, I ended up somehow setting her up with my best guy friend. They’re now super happy, but it was killing me so I decided to get it off my chest that I used to have feelings for her. She was super understanding, and told me that back then she actually came out to one of her friends by saying how she wanted to kiss me. Now, I had told her that I didn’t have feelings for her at the time, but that was half a lie. She was only in the back of mind, until of course she expressed what she had felt back those months ago. 

All was fine, until at a party we cuddled and fell asleep in each other’s arms, and as she was falling asleep she literally held on to my arm as I was talking to some people. Feelings are resurfaced, and we nearly kissed again that night.

However, the next night her and my best guy friend sent me pictures of them together and it broke me. I’ve been ignoring them for the past few days, although she’s reached out way more despite me knowing him for years. I want them to be happy, but it hurts and I can’t talk to her because I’m too scared I’ll say something and mess up their relationship, and therefore, the happiness of two of my closest friends.

Winter break is almost over, and I’ll have to go back to school and see them both daily. 

Do I wait it out until they maybe break up, or do I let it be and get over her?

tldr; old feelings resurfaced for a close friend, but telling her would break lots of things.

407,"Hello. I don't know if this is the best place to post this. If theres a better subreddit, please let me know! Thank you. This is going to be a long post but I need help.

Throwaway account because its a sensitive topic. Me(20M) Friend (20M) At the moment.

Everything started about 4 years ago when one of my friends developed a crush on a girl that I was pretty close to. He is not the most outgoing person so seeing this, I became happy for him. Eventually, they continued to talk but it was pretty clear that the girl didn't have the same feelings for him. He would continue to talk to the girl and be friendly but never really make a move. The girl just thought that he was a good friend and didn't think anything of it. Long story short, he confessed his feelings and she rejected him. After this, he got very upset and said some vulgar things to this girl and she blocked him on all socials and distanced him from her life. I understand that this wasn't the best thing to do on his part but he is truly a good person. Anyways, this led to him being extremely depressed and eventually suicidal. He began to cut himself and started to drink and take pills to try to commit suicide. One of the most extreme cases of this was when he tried to take 20 of some type of pill. I am one of his closest friends so he confides in me a lot.  He told me about this and that he will continue to try to take his life. We were in class in high school one day and I noticed that he had to go to the bathroom a lot. I didn't know about the pills at the time but then he told me about it. I am assuming he went to barf a lot throughout the class. Anyways, another extreme case was when he told me one night, that he was going to try to end it all tonight over text. This naturally made me fear for his life and I made the decision to call the police to his house. At this point, I have not talked to the girl in a while but I panic texted her to please text my friend and tell him that she is sorry and whatever. I don't actually know what she sent him but eventually this passed. I had called his brother and told him the story at this point and he told he me he would try to help. I told him to get rid of all the alcohol in the house and hide all the sharp objects. After this, there wasn't another huge incident that had me really worried for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I always knew that he was still delusional about having a relationship with the girl and would always tell him that it would never happen. He never truly let go and continue to feel sorry for himself and attack himself for ruining the relationship. In reality, it was never his fault. The girl just never had feelings like that for him. Throughout these 4 years, there would be flashes of horrible instances but never anything as bad. I got him to stop cutting himself, to stop drinking, and to stop taking pills. Everything was on the up and up.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until recently that a couple of mutual friends hung out at a get together where the girl was also at. They posted pictures to socials and he saw it. The instant he saw it, he deleted all socials and went into his old depressive self.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to go to a trip that lasted about 5 days. This trip was just this last week. Everything during the trip was smooth except the second day where he became all gloomy. I noticed that he had cuts on his hand again after the third day. I brought it up to him and confronted him about it but he told me everything was okay. After the second day, he became happy again until the last day of the trip when he drank some alcohol at night and completely broke down at 3 A.M. in front of the entire group. He began scream things like ""Get the demons out of my head"", ""I fucked up"", ""Kill me"", ""Someone help kill me..."" and, ""Help me"" over and over again while crying. This went on at least 15-20 minutes. We all helped him and eventually he became back to his old self. We did not trust him to be alone and hid all the knives in the kitchen. We had a friend help watch over him because we were afraid that he was going to do something insane.  I then called his brother and told him the story and told him to take it seriously. It seems like his family does not take this seriously and just believes that it will pass.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend had told me to get in contact with the girl and to tell her to forgive him over text. I didn't agree with this because I do not want her to be in his life ever again. My reasoning is that if she is in his life, he will feel delusions of a chance at a relationship again.

&amp;#x200B;

My solutions to his brother is to look into a therapist and to get a perscription of anti depressants for him. He has been to a therapist before but he stopped going because he said that the therapist was talking shit about the girl and he didn't want to hear it.

Meanwhile, my grandmother (who I am living with) has yet to help me look for a psychiatrist of any kind so I can get help. She often says I’m fine and have no need for medication where my therapist says it would be for the best.

413,"Potential video game spoilers below...

Just as background, my son just turned 16 and he has high functioning autism. He loves to play video games, hang out with his siblings and watch movies with the family. For Christmas we (his mother and I) bought him a copy of red dead redemption 2, as it was something he had interest in for a while now and we decided it would be a nice gift.

The thing with autistic people, is that they often get special interests or fixtations, and that was what happened with my son. He became obsessed with the game and specifically the main character, Arthur. What I didn't know is that at the end of the game, Arthur dies from an illness.

My son shut down after this. He cried a lot after it happened and he has stopped using his PlayStation and he just sits in bed all day reading books alone. I know that to some people this may seem an overreaction but it's not anything he can help- it's just how his brain works and that's something I have had to adapt to for 16 years now.

He won't properly talk to my wife or I, even though it's been almost two weeks now that he finished the game. I am worried for him- because even though I know this will pass, I'm his father and I can't help but be scared for him when these things happen.

I don't know what to do in this situation, it feels like there's nothing I CAN do except wait for him to stop feeling so upset... I just want to know if this is normal, am I overreacting? Is this all going to just pass normally, or should I be worried?

Thank you if you do reply to this


Edit: Thank you for all the comments! I spent all morning with my wife reading over them and we've decided to talk to him about it. Both of us researched the game so we can understand why he is so upset, and we're going to try talking to him about it when he gets home from school. Thanks for all the comments!!",03Jan2020,1236
415,"Late February of 2019, I(21) met a girl(19) at my college via tinder. After a week of conversation, we began seeing each other solely as a casual/fwb relationship, we were very close but just weren't a couple. This relationship lasted to the end of the spring semester/mid May. We both went back home and really only chatted during the summer. Come September, I move back up to the city where my college is and attempt to chat with her. She told me that she got a real relationship because she wanted a partner and felt as if I wasn't comfortable with that. Throughout the semester we were still good friends but I had this tiny gut feeling I missed something, since the moment she told me about it I felt so much regret. We exchanged Christmas gifts a while ago, and my emotions/feelings for her are just getting to me. She has a boyfriend, but it's just eating at me every day that I missed my chance, because now I realize I had major feelings for her.

417,"**Before we start this is a throw away account as i don't want this tied to my normal account.** But i had a very horrible childhood. I was abused in horrific ways to the point CPS was finally forced to take me from my family and place me in foster care. My boyfriend knows about all the horrible things that has happened to me. Now we're getting married in a month and we randomly got on the topic of children.

I told my boyfriend if we have kids i do not want to tell them anything about my family. This is what i said ""And i know you wont like it but i refuse to talk to our children about my family if we ever have any. I'll tell them they were bad people but go no further to indulge their curiosity."" And my boyfriend looks me dead in the eye and says ""So be like them?"" and that broke my heart. My family is full of two faced liars and worse and to told me id be like them. It's one of my biggest fears and he knows it.

He knows how much that would hurt me to say it but he did anyway. I just want to shield my kids from knowing about how horrible my family is if i have any and somehow doing that makes me the equivalent to a child abuser. Am i overreacting or not? As of right now I've told him how much he hurt and broke my heart and that i wont forgive him and i honestly don't think i ever will.

EDIT: So yes for people asking no this isn't normal behavior for him. We've been together 3 years and i can count on my fingers how many times we've argued. We rarely ever fight and when we do we're both calm and talk it out. So this is very unusual for him to speak to me like this. I mean yes this could be a one off thing but it kinda threw up red flags for me.

418,"I have an amazing group of friends, I’m the youngest at 20 and I am the only girl in the group, the oldest is 24. I’ve known them since high school and we have been friends for over 4 years.

One of the guy’s (we will call him Stan) grew up without a father and wasn’t always the nicest guy to be around, he started to get better around 2 years ago but recently has just gotten worse.
He is all ready showing incel signs.

I started to notice it as he was attracted to me and got mad when I didn’t like him back, he also doesn’t come to hang out sessions if he discovers I’m attending, even if he promises prior.

It’s completely divided out group as one half wants to help him and the other half wants to kick him to the curb.
On New Year’s Day we sat down and spoke about it without stan as he didn’t wanna come, it caused some arguments with one of my friends basically saying that we have already attempted to help him and he never cares and some other people who still think he can be helped.
One friend is actually making a decent effort to help him and it seems to be working but it’s still difficult as leaving him and kicking him to the curb could potentially make the situation worse.

I’m on the fence as I want him to get help but I’m also worried that he could attempt to do something to me as I am the only girl in the group, he already tried when I was 15 (he was 18) and he could definitely try again.

Almost a year ago, My account was hacked. The hacker purchased hundreds of dollars worth of in-game content. But the transactions were done in small increments. The first few times, I assumed it was either me or a remote family member making the purchases, but the increments were getting larger and I started to suspect something.  I didn't catch onto this until about 2-3 weeks after it started happening. I first reported this to Sony customer support and the representative filed me in for a refund. Sony denied my refund, saying something along the lines of ""the user has enough hours on the game to understand how transactions work"". Thing is, it wasn't me making the purchases. I contacted customer support a second time and they suggested that called my bank. I did so, the bank took my money back, but now I'm banned from using any of the games that I previously bought. I contacted Sony A THIRD time and they basically said that I have a debt on my account now that the bank got me my money back and until I repay my debt, I'm not able to access the contents of my account in any way. I told them that it wasn't me making those purchases and that I was told by a representative from Sony to contact my bank. They basically told me that there was nothing that they could do unless I was willing to pay that debt. I left it alone for a couple of months but I've been really wanting to replay some of the PS exclusives. I'm considering to pay the debt and just go on with it but I wanted to try contacting customer support one more time to if there were any last-ditch efforts that I could try before doing so.

To understand you better I was fifth grade. She professed a good period of her life in communism (illustration) and everything worked with ""small attentions and gifts""from parents. I always hated that kind of thing and I always tried to keep a low profile. But I started to stand out because I loved art and I always wanted to be satisfied with my work. I started participating in art competitions and at this moment I have over 70 national and international awards in my portfolio. To be honest they were great at a point, but now it's kind of waste of creative potential.I also made hyperrealistic portraits at 12, participated in over 30 exhibitions around the world. All besides school.Coming back, the teacher did a number of things in which I will not go into details, but she showed her true nature to everyone. In the 8th grade it was an important exam (still nature) and a given complex composition, after which you could specialize on a profile. I worked a whole year but I was the only one who took 10/10 out of 164 children. I decided to choose painting (for many it was a shock, especially for her, waiting to choose the architecture or at least illustration). Out of all of my 24 colleagues, only 2 went with illustration because honestly it was the closest to what they wanted to do (animations). The following year, the painting teacher was drunk at school (he had always a drink in a bottle of sprites so we wouldn't catch him, we reported him many times, but the teachers said we had to endure him for another 2 years until he retired because ""he was a good man, a good artist, with a hard life who had adopted a child ""). Then my depression started. I decided to move the next semester to my former teacher (illustration). From then on they began a continuous humiliation.I became more and more insecure and now I'm afraid to make art.At her class I was feeling like a 40 yo who does the most boring job and is just waiting to go home to cry. This year the former teacher retired and another painting teacher came, who convinced me to choose painting in the first place years ago.

2020 found me in kinda a new situation. Not great, but better than I was.

I would like to be a little more organised and motivated to do things, e.g. read more books, go out more. It would be great for me to start a daily routine, in which I do things for myself.
As for my weight, I started a balanced diet with a lot of vegetables and fruit. I cut out most of the sugar I eat, drink a lot of water and eat less.

He also told me that he about how he wants to die, that he joined a cult obsessed with death (complete with a ritual involving goat's blood), reminded me that he hates all humans (a conversation we had previously in which, at my inquiry, he reminded me that I'm ""one of them""), and that he had a blade to his throat to ""tease destiny"" (he says he won't kill himself because that would interfere with the universe's plans). 

I don't know what to do. His mother put him on suicide watch, but all other attempts to get him to counseling are ignored and mocked. Whenever I would try to contest his image of life and humanity he wouldn't listen and would only assert his opinion. We've had other problems too, and I'm at a loss as to how I can help him.

The next day felt so separate and I was struggling with my mental health to the point of an overdose, I realised when the meds set in what I'd done and I called an ambulance and got the medical help I needed. 

I was in the majors unit at the local hospital, my partner at the time didn't come and see me, he broke up with me whilst I was in there over the phone. I was later sent to a crisis house and got diagnosed with a separate mental health disorder that explained a lot to me.

450,"Back story: my friends family are controlling. They are a strict religious family while my friend isn’t religious at all. They recently found her reddit account that talked about her denouncing the religion and running away from home. Since then they have taken my friends phone. 

When they went on her phone they found that she had been wearing “immoral” outfits and have since taken her laptop and her bank card. They still allow her to go to work and work events. 

They have always hated that me and her where so close and that she’d rather hang out with me than her family. So much so that they have restricted how much we get to see if each other. At one point they asked her if  we where lesbian lovers. 

They also wanted her to do a virginity test, but they have yet to find someone who would do one.

She has 5 sisters who are all constantly trying to get the attention of the parents, but they do this by knocking each other down. They gang up on whoever the parents focus is on. 

My friend said she felt better about her family knowing she was none religious and that she didn’t feel like moving anymore even if her stuff was being held hostage.

—————————————————

Today: 

I’m at home and my friend emails me from her work email. In it she asks me to come meet her for lunch, and that even though she knows I’m on my holiday from work that she just needs me there.

So I drive to her work, she comes out for her lunch break and we eat in my car.

That is when she tells me that her first cousins family came to her home and asked for her hand. Not only this. But his mum is sisters with her mum, and both their dads are brothers. That means that they have only one set of great grand parents. Talk about too close to home. She showed me a picture of him and i could help but say to her that he literally looked like a male version of her. It’s like in the Simpson’s, why do milhouse’s parents look exactly the same?

I asked her what she said and she started crying. She said they when she said no, her mum took her into another room and sat her down. Asked her again and when she said no she was slapped across the face. And this happened over 5 times. Every time the answer was no. And on the last one she said yes, but her mum yelled at her to answer happily. And she said she couldn’t. So the mum walked away. She would have run away that day but guests where at their house. My friend cares about the image of her family in the extended families eyes.

But also while she was being slapped her sisters where sat in the same room. And the one who was 18 years old said to her “you aren’t a victim, this is for your own good”.  At that point my friend said “if you didn’t want to marry someone I would be on your side.” But her younger sister said she would marry the guy. 


—————————-

After my friend tells me all of this I first off tell her that if she doesn’t want to marry him, to never say yes again. Not even in fear or to stop them flipping out. Once they get a strong yes, even if it is forced, they will use that to move things on and say “well you said yes”. 

I told her I had a spare phone that she could have which has a working sim in it and that I also that should she choose to leave I have a spare card to my bank account that she can borrow to use to book a hotel or whatever she needed before she could get access to her bank again.

But as her lunch break was ending she told me that no matter what, if they try to force her into marriage she’ll leave. And I said I’m here for a quick getaway if she ever needed one. The thing is she asked me when she should...and that’s the part that I don’t know. 

I know if she took a much bigger stand in front of her family they would back off, but her quality of life would remain as it is. Restricted.  

But if I tell her to leave now, and she isn’t ready, or her family freak out and weren’t going to force her, then she will go back to them and her quality of life will be like she’s in prison. 

I don’t know what to tell her. I know people will suggest the police, but if I did that she’d lose all trust in me and her family will have an even tighter hold and she would never want her family in trouble so she would just end up pretending like everything was fine. 

So do I tell her to leave or not?

————————

TL;DR my best friend is being pressured and slapped over an arranged marriage to her cousin. I’m helping her get a back up plan in place, but she asked me when she should leave, and if she leaves when she isn’t fully invested in leaving then she’ll go back to her family and her quality of life will worsen. Going to the authorities is not an option.",03Jan2020,1

Hi everyone,

I’m new to this so I hope I did this right.


I guess this is a little silly—I have a plan of what I’m going to do but I always feel unsure about these things, so thanks to everyone in advance.

I have a friend I’ve known since we were thirteen—I’m in my mid-twenties now. She lives 6 hours away from me, &amp; over the past ~4 years I’ve visited her. But she never seems to come visit me. I’ve brought it up, but never given specific dates.

I feel bad, because I don’t want to be like “to be my friend you have to do x, y, &amp; z,” but when other people visit her she makes a huge deal out of it. She has a closer friend whose family who lives in my area that she just visited, &amp; she invited me to meet up with them. A few months ago she was in the area for a friend’s wedding &amp; we were able to meet. 

I don’t think she’s doing this maliciously, &amp; I’ve always been sensitive, but it just hurts my feelings. I didn’t visit her this year because it just didn’t work out. 

I understand if she doesn’t have the time &amp; resources, but I’m starting to feel like she can set aside time &amp; money for everyone but me. 

My plan was to just visit her when I felt like it, on my own terms &amp; have zero expectations. I have family who lives near her so I could visit them too, &amp; maybe I’ll say something like “want to visit this fall?”

I just wish I could stop feeling so hurt, because I then feel guilty &amp; like a spoiled brat about feeling hurt lol. Maybe that’s what I need advice about the most. 

Sorry this is so long!!",03Jan2020,1

453,"Hello all, thank you for taking the time to read this.

Lately, like the title says, I dont care about anything. It's been this way for a few months now and I've finally decided to do something about it. A little background to what I've been dealing with:

 My boyfriend and I have been going through some issues and I couldn't be bothered to try and make things better. It's so bad that I cheated on him. He doesnt know. And I dont care if he find out. At this point I wouldn't care if he broke up with me. 

Work has been rough, we just lost 80% of our already tiny staff. I have now become the worker with the most experience at a measly 2 years and theres a lot of pressure on me to lead a team and get things done. Which is far above my pay grade and my knowledge at times but the work has to get done.

I havent cleaned my room in days, I barely get out of bed. I dont feel sad necessarily, I just feel empty. I'm not sure what to do about it or where to go from here. I'm 21 and I havent felt this way since high school. But even then I just rode it out and waited for some semblance of ""normalcy"" to return.

I guess I'd like some advice on how to move forward? How do I go about getting better?

457,"Hi all, so my mother is asking me for some help and im not really sure on what to say so im asking the Redditors :D

My cousin, lets call him Jim. Has been smoking weed casually at first and its starting to get out of hand. Sure the odd one or 2 j's at a party is ok, but he is smoking what i think is too much. He sleeps the entire day, goes out late at night with his friends and ofc smokes weed and im not sure about other drugs. 

Jim now has started to steal money from his parents, at first not a lot. However the other day his parents caught him stealing 250 euros from their housekeeper! Now i cannot assume its for drugs but he isnt really showing any other possibilities. He just blamed it on his friends, saying he needed to pay them back (probs for weed, if this story was true).

What can we do about this situation? Drug tests? No more pocket money? Rehab? different schools? Just speaking to him?

He has a very ""I dont give a f\*\*K"" personality and is very arrogant. Im really not sure how to approach this scenario. 

I dont think speaking to him will be much of a help. Drug tests will just reveal what we already know. Removing his pocket money will just make him steal more. Rehab i highly dough that his rents will send him there. Different school, dont think its possible.

Please give any advice you think may be relevant. Thank you and happy new year!",03Jan2020,2

459,"Sorry about the throwaway to begin with.

I'm a 21M. I know full well I need to sort my shit out but have no idea how or how to have the motivation. 

I'm currently in my 4th year of university (comp sci) which I never wanted to attend to begin with. I know I'm not going to pass this year. Even with all of my effort I wouldn't be able to at this point. I haven't paid attention for the entire time I was there and wouldn't know where to begin. Whether I passed or not though I detest computer science so wouldn't want a career in it. But even with a career I have no passion for literally anything anymore.

 I played an instrument for over a decade but for the last few years have barely touched it as I've lost interest. I have no hobbies anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I work part time in a restaurant which pays my bills while I study. But that's not where I want to be. My sleep schedule was decimated years ago. A week where I sleep every night of the week is a treat but sleeping 4 nights a week in the summer is usual. I'll just lie in bed for hours wasting my own time. I feel like I'm watching myself throw away my own life but can't bring myself to do anything about it.

On the plus I have a long term partner who I genuinely care and love more dearly than anything on the planet who supports me no matter what but I don't think it's fair to throw this weight on her while she's busy living her own life. But other than my partner I genuinely feel I have nothing in this world I feel strongly for.

I'm just pissing my future down the drain. Any advice, even anecdotal, or completely useless like don't eat the stickers on apple's would be greatly appreciated.

461,"Sorry that this is a little long. Just adding this since it might be relevant to the problems I'm having, but both me and my boyfriend are transgender, pre surgery. We started having sex a couple of months into our relationship and had sex nearly daily for about 2 months or so. We both struggle with depressive symptoms and such, so having a low libido is something I'm familiar with. But since like three months ago I've completely lost all interest in having sex with him. Around the time I stopped having interest we were using different drugs quite regularly and mainly only had sex while on them. I went through some stuff while out of the country and stopped taking my pills regularly in which I didn't see him for about two weeks and we had sex once sober. That was about 3 months ago. Some traumatic stuff happened between us about a month and a half ago so we decided to stop using drugs recreationally. But my interest in having sex with him just hasn't returned. His libido is normal and once he instigates I'll just join in but I won't instigate and when we have sex I just don't enjoy it as much as I used to. The thing is I really love my boyfriend and I couldn't stand losing him. It's just the sex that I've been uninterested in. I'm not asexual I know that for sure. Am I doing something wrong? Are there ways to spice things up which might get me interested again? We have showers and baths together regularly and hang out everyday. Should we reduce that to get that spark going again?

Firstly, social media. Have any of you quit using social media and has it made your life better? If so how should I do it? I’ve been thinking about cutting out Twitter and Instagram. I figure those two should be fine but maybe I should cut out Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat that being all the social media I use. Any advice would be wonderful.

Secondly, working out. I used to be very fit as I was a gymnast in high school. The ladder end of this year I’ve slacked a lot. How do I get back into it without burning myself out. How do I self motivate. Just a brief 30 minute to an hour workout everyday would be good for me. Advice? 

Third, video games. I spend too much time on them even though I love them. Should I limit my time on them and how? It almost feels like the only way to connect with my friends while they’re all at separate colleges. 

Fourth, my sleep schedule. As of right now I’m typing this up at 4 am. That’s bad, how can I get in the habit of going to bed at a good time like between 10 and midnight and waking up between 6 and 8 am. Is this a more optimal sleep schedule? I think less social media and video games would benefit my sleep schedule. 

Finally, I just want to become happier. I feel as though I’ve been struggling a bit with motivation and energy and positivity. How can I boost this and make 2020 the best year of my life. A year I can say I made big lifestyle changes. Should I meditate? Watch motivational speeches? Eat healthier? What can I do to make myself feel happier and more motivated?

I (F19) and my two closest friends (F19) have been friends since 2017. We didn’t really get close until after we graduated from high school but since then we’ve probably hung out with each other almost everyday. 2019 is probably the year we formed that special bond with each other to the extent where we knew what each other wanted, what each other wanted to say and so and so forth.

However, recently I’ve noticed that they’ve begun excluding me from a lot of things. For example, we usually eat out a lot and most of the time we decide to share meals that way its cheaper and more convenient. This week at a restaurant they were discussing meals they would share together without including me. I know what you’re thinking its a far stretch and I’m probably overthinking it. But just today, while we were shopping, they were making plans with each other and acting as if I wasn’t even there. I tried to join in the conversation so that they would acknowledge me but they just ignored me and brushed me aside.

There’s more examples but those scenarios are the ones that made me realise something was wrong. 

Just for some extra info, I think all three of us have some annoying traits but none that would cause a falling out. We’re all pretty similar which is why we connect the best. But until recently, I feel like they’re drifting away from me.

All I know how to make extra cash is to bake and sell Toll House cookies for $6/dozen, invest in the stock market with the very little spending coin I have, be an Uber/Lyft driver,work nights as a waiter or some other job with tips, and possibly grow and sell weed. Is that gonna be enough?

484,"for years now.. I've always thought about death. trying to avoid it.. being safe from it.. the thought of existing to this day, amazes me.
i think about at night of how things could end at any moment. Not just my life, but for example; the world. or galaxy. just gone. nothing else exists then. no conscious to feel or know.. and that thought itself of having no conscious or that my inevitable death will come one day just tears me apart inside. im not religious, all i think after we die, its just nothing. i cherish everyday i wake up, but im always scared that one day or second.. boom.. gone. 
it hits me hard all the time and sometimes it makes me a  better person appreciating the little things and being a better person towards others.. but at the end of the day when im alone. everything just hits like a brick and i feel like I've been heartbroken with all those overwhelming thoughts. 
i never really talk about stuff like this outloud. im very rational and logical about my actions. but my thoughts are always all over the place and i cant find it in myself changing my train of thought when i know the reality to life and what could and will happen eventually.

how do people cope with thoughts like this?

486,"I work retail returns and customer service, but I’ve also got some personal issues that I’m having trouble seeing a therapist about. My life’s kind of a mess right now, and I’m also a full-time student. However, I always try and do my best at work, especially at Christmas time, when things get busy. But, as humans go, I have rough days. I have days when I’m not 100% and maybe I’m more 10%, if even. Still, I do my job. Probably just not as well. Things have been extremely busy since mid-November, and I haven’t really had a big enough break to recuperate and deal with my mental issues. I work part time, but they’ve been giving me probably 40-45 hours a week since mid-November, so I’ve been high-stressed, sleep-deprived, and emotionally pent up since then. All that being said, this is my first job, so everything I experience here is new to me. 
A lot of my fellow co-workers think I’m annoying and have kinda ganged up on me a bit, and I finally stood up for myself maybe a week ago. Sometimes I work stock in the back, and this is usually where the issues happen. I finally cracked and told a fellow coworker (let’s call him A) that he doesn’t have the authority to yell at me since he’s not my superior, deflecting all his remarks for about half an hour straight. After I went out to cover someone’s break at the counter, I told one of the managers about it.
Back to just a few days ago, I got called upstairs for what I already could feel, would be a warning. A manager that I don’t particularly get along with had me sit in her office and explained to me that she’s been seeing my performance drop, and went over my job description with me. She kept focusing on the first word of the entire description, which is smile. “Smiles and says Hi to customers” is the first line. I always greet them, do everything else that’s required of me, even if they throw things at me, or yell at me, whatever. For some reason, this manager really wanted to focus on the fact that I don’t always smile. I couldn’t quite figure out why this was such a big deal, since I’m definitely not the laziest or unfriendliest employee working at the store, and I hadn’t really done anything to piss anyone off, as far as I knew.
My roommate thinks the manager is covering for me after a customer made a really bad complaint, but I’m not ready to give her the benefit of the doubt, since we had a rough start. (Really, I cant ever see myself getting along with this manager, since when I met her, she asked me some inappropriate questions. Kinda feels like she’s had it out for me since.) The fact she made the whole talk seem like it was really a big deal made me uneasy, and it actually stressed me out so much that I started crying. I thought she was looking to fire me.
I can’t figure out if she just wanted to fuck with me, if she actually is covering for me, or if the group of coworkers who don’t like me decided to pull something on me, OR if smiling is Really that big of a deal. We had an agreement to continue the conversation today. I need some advice. What do I do when I go back to work today? (Besides try to smile...)",03Jan2020,1

So like the title says I like this girl, but theres a lot going on that's really confusing me right now. So as context I guess I've known her since the 7th grade and we both are now in 11th. The past few times I've gone to hang out with her it's been, more physical than usual? I'm not really sure how to describe it. Usually we just sit on the couch, vibe, and watch youtube and stuff. But after a Christmas party I was spending the night and somehow it ended up with us holding hands for a bit, then she said I could sit closer if I wanted, so I did, then we started like half cuddling? We were sitting and she put her head on my shoulder and we ended up falling asleep like that. We hung out once between then and new years but I could only vibe for like an hour so nothing really happened. We went to a new years party for like half an hour with some friends, then back to her house to have some ""spicy apple juice"" to put it subtly, not enough to forget anything but enough to have fun. We were partly through a card game when one of the friends left. It started getting late and she said I can sit on her bed with her, I didnt really think anything of it so I just sat on it with her. Our other friend was on the loveseat she had in her room getting ready to pass out as well. We were just sorta chillin when she scooted over and did the head shoulder thing, we held hands again for a while and just looked at memes. It hits around 4 in the morning and she says she has to lay down and I can if I want to as well. Since I'm a dumbass I read this as 'oh cool I dont have to go downstairs to the couch'. We lay down for a bit then she turns over and passes out laying on my arm with her head on my chest. I fall asleep and when I wake up we were full on cuddling at that point. We both get up bc I had to use the bathroom and so did she. We then just sat on her bed because all of us were awake at that point. And the guy that left the night before came back. This is the point where its confusing, that dude that left, drove us back from the christmas party, drove us to and from the new years party, shes dating him. So I really have no clue how to interpret the signals shes sending, I dont know if that's just her being friendly, but shes not really a physical person, at least she hasn't been towards me. I dont know if she likes me back, but obviously shes already dating someone. I dont know if it's because she doesnt feel appreciated, but they're really happy together.

493,"I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and depression and as a result of that, I’ve been taking Zoloft since late September. Getting that diagnosis was no surprise, because I knew what I had since around 2015 or even sooner than that. I’ve stopped seeing therapists because I don’t feel any help or any change at all after any visits and there’s always some sort of problem. I’ve also noticed the medication doesn’t even help, even when I got my dosage raised. 

Well anyway, lately I’ve been starting to think my diagnosis was wrong and what I felt so sure was wrong with me is wrong. I left out a few things every time I talked with the psychiatrist and my previous therapists because I thought they were things everyday people dealt with, everyday. But, I don’t think so. Some things I’ve opened up about with friends have made me start thinking about it and I’m questioning if what I’m dealing with is actually schizophrenia. I’m not saying it’s definitive and I’m not trying to ask for a diagnosis here, but I need to know. And I know googling it or straight up assuming is not the way to go. 

Getting professional help the first time was hard enough. It took a couple of episodes of me actually breaking down and screwing things up in my room out of rage for my parents to actually realize I do need help. I hate it and I don’t want to go about asking because I know they won’t take it seriously or they will start telling me I’m delusional. 

I guess why I’m even posting here is to ask, what is the best way to actually find out if I have schizophrenia or not? A few relatives have it, so I’m thinking maybe I can privately speak with them, but I want a professional to be the overall judge of this. I’m too reluctant to ask my parents to take me to a professional to find out because it was too difficult and took years to finally get help and get medication. I see a school psychologist and she knows what’s up with me, so maybe I can speak with her, but how would I even go about that? I don’t know what to do. I’m really worried and I just want an answer. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks. 

Also, I’m sorry if any of this sounds insensitive. That’s not my intention, I just need help with deciding how to even approach this situation. I’m tired of pushing it to the back of my mind just for it to keep me awake later on that night.",03Jan2020,0
494,"Backstory(kinda boring tbh):

So I met this guy while I was on a school trip and his mum(who is a teacher and is really sweet) brought him along. I developed a crush on him and we both had a crush on each other until I ghosted him for a month(at this point we had been talking for 4 months via text and hadn’t met up since the school trip) then we both lost those feelings). We then talked for 9 months until we actually met up irl.

So now I had talked to him for over a year at this point. My friends then shipped us and on NYE my friend Milly pranked him by telling him that I liked him I liked him(she stole my phone), but then he said he liked me too. Turns out Millie was texting him privately telling him to say that and he didn’t know it was a prank. But I went along with the prank pretending saying I liked him(lying). But then he still said he liked me, so I convinced myself that I liked him(which I now know I don’t). I said I wanted to think about if I wanted to date him bc I knew he was kinda a player.


ACTUAL STORY:

So the teacher’s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies AS FRIENDS so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.

When we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didn’t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldn’t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasn’t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldn’t.

I went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. 

After I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)
“Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with it”

So I acted like he didn’t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didn’t want to be a rebound, he said I wasn’t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying “we can just be friends if you want” and then I eventually said that and he replied “ok gn” and I said “goodbye and sorry”. I eventually apologised(**). 

Aftermath:
I cried a couple tears because I didn’t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didn’t really like him, or maybe I do? I’m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. I’m keeping up with this whole ‘just being friends’ with him and it’s going really well.

WHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:
So now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? I NEED HELP




* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry

** I said “Look, I’m really sorry about yesterday. I wasn’t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didn’t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to ‘deflect my problems into other people’ or ‘blame myself for things that aren’t my fault’ so I think that’s what just happened. Sorry. Also I’m off my pill and it’s shark week so I’m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings.

So I met some guy on tinder about almost three years ago and we’ve been messaging each other on and off. We met one time at a club and had a nice short conversation. I ended up dating someone else so I ghosted him and blocked his number, but every time I unblocked it (after several months) I would get a text from him—it’s like he’s been texting me even when I didn’t reply at all. 
Sometimes he likes to send racy messages and when he gets to the topic of oral sex he keeps saying that he wants to know how I taste. He literally says that and it creeps me out, and it also makes me wonder if he might be a killer.

He is currently working on this, but won't pass until at least Summer 2021. He wants to go to university in London, as he feels that the course at this specific university is the best one, especially as he wants to move abroad later on and the university has an excellent reputation and is one of the best in the country. As I will be an NQT starting September 2020, I'm currently looking at applying to teaching jobs. However, we currently live nowhere near London. If I apply to jobs here, I will only be able to stay for one year maximum at my new job, and then only one year at the next job when we move closer to London. I am very wary of how that will look on my CV, and I'm reluctant to shoot myself in the foot like that, especially at the beginning of my new career. I'm pondering applying jobs that are outside of London but close enough that my partner could commute in and I can do my NQT year there as well as my second year of teaching to show on my CV that I am consistent and dedicated.

I need advice on two topics really - what is the best option - to delay London for a year so that we can have more time to save up to move to London and that I can keep some consistency in my career, or move nearer to London early and completely uproot ourselves. 

Additionally - in a master's Computer Science conversion course, does anyone know how often my partner would need to be in University each week? If it's only a few hours, I feel like living further out of London would actually be more realistic and therefore more affordable.

508,"The title may seem odd, and if it is then I apologize. I’ve known this guy since elementary school, but we really started being friends in middle school. We went to different high schools but we stayed in contact via text. Last year we texted a lot in the beginning of the year (we texted everyday) but slowly stopped towards the middle. It was my fault as I am the sort of the person who doesn’t feel like they need, or want to, text a person everyday because sometimes I don’t want to talk or I just don’t have anything new to say. 

Last year, when we were still talking, this guy told me he liked me and wanted to see if I wanted to get to know each other more, and I said I liked him too. I did like him at the time, and I still do. We’ve gone to three movies, had lunch/dinner twice, and got ice cream. 

We continued to talk until our conversations via text fizzled out. It’s the beginning of a new year and I feel guilty. I don’t want him to think that I led him on or anything. The reason why I failed to keep conversation going is because I’m scared. If getting to know each other were to have worked out, and we began to date, it would have been my first relationship. I’ve never kissed anyone and I just keep thinking to what all/most relationships require. By that I mean sexual things (if we were to make it that far into the relationship for things to lead to that as I’ve never had sex before either). I’m scared of being uncomfortable, and I’m scared of change. 

This guy and I are still cordial, and I don’t feel like we have any bad blood or anything like that. At this point, I don’t mind if we don’t move forward and see where things went. If he’s moved on then that wouldn’t hurt my feelings. I more so just want him to have answers. I just want to be able to let him know that it was because of me that we stopped talking and not anything he did. Is it a bad/weird idea if I were to text him and tell him that I’ve been thinking lately about things and would like to talk to him about it? I would tell him pretty much what I wrote in the text post. I just don’t know if that’s just too bizarre to come out of nowhere with all of what I just wrote.",03Jan2020,3
509,"Hello. I'm 17 and currently trying to raise my siblings due to my parent's messy divorce.  The past year I've been raising them along with my boyfriend (bless his heart) and we've been having a hard time bringing up my brother with Autism. 

I don't know where he falls on the spectrum. All I know is that he has autism and my mother failed to explain to me. However, his behaviors are very violent when breaking out. This time, he was caught almost killing my cat, by trying to snap its neck. I took his xbox privileges away along with chromebook and legos. I gave him other means to support his interests and I had a discussion with him about how he felt in what he did. So far it has consistently been architect, buildings, cars, planes, etc. So, I let him draw the plans out or use cardboard to build his planes and buildings. After that and he started to seem to show understanding, I gave the legos back for models. 

However, lately he has been caught multi0le times now on other xboxes at really late points at night. (My other siblings xboxes.) Times like 4:30, 4:00, etc. I've taken controllers away and everything and yes, I have been to frazzled what to do with him that I have yelled at him. I don't know what to do. I've looked up how to deal with the condition and it's stuff I already have tried or currently do. 

What I struggle with: 
*Basic language, I forget that even though this kid is an encyclopedia and uses words I don't know my vocabulary he doesn't understand. 
*Consistency, my parents tell me to handle all of this, yet they will in the same breath get onto me for taking care of it and make me give his stuff back because ""I shouldn't be a parent figure"". (yeah. Okay..)
*Staying Calm, sometimes I feel like he's so smart that he just manipulates the situation. He's completely different to my parents than me. (understandable to a degree) I've only gone off and yelled at him once in this month ordeal, but it's not ideal for me to.

510,"As the title states, I had to put my girlfriend and I’s cat down last night. I’ve never had to be the one to make the decision. I know it had to be done but it’s so painful mentally... read on.

I came home from work last night in an awesome mood. I normally work 3-11p and my girlfriend works 8a-4p but I was asked to work the day shift due to my clients back to back appointments and my boss being on vacation. Naturally I was excited to spend the evening with my girlfriend, bought some alcohol and grabbed a pizza to just unwind.

I get home at 5p, girlfriend is running late, no biggy. I seize the opportunity to tidy our apartment and put some things away. I was putting a box in my attic, as soon as I put it down  I hear a strange meowing, kind of similar to a cat in heat but different. After looking around I find our cat in the litter box laying on her side, unable to get out. I immediately pick her up and bring her down stairs feeling quite alarmed, her body almost completely limp.

I brushed the litter off her and clean her the best I can, to make her comfortable I lay her on a pillow on a chair in the kitchen. She’s having extremely shallow breathing, her tongue hanging out of her mouth. Her stomach is ever so slightly raising from her abdomen area, breathing extremely fast yet shallow. She gets off the chair and I can tell she’s trying to get away from me like I know cats do when they’re dying.

I’m struggling to keep it together, having to talk myself down from hyperventilating. I call my girlfriend, can’t reach her, call her work and get ahold of her to tell her what’s going on. Immediately after I get on the phone with the vet, describe her symptoms, they tell me I should get there ASAP. I run downstairs, throw on my shoes, bolt it to my car and pull it up to our door to grab the cat. Every time I move her she’s meowing in pain, it’s killing me...

I get to the vets and I hand her off to the veterinarian. What felt like an hour was only 3 minutes before they asked me to come into a separate room to await the doctor. At this point my girlfriend is finally calling me. I’m telling her what’s going on minute by minute. She knows somethings wrong due to them bringing me into a separate room..

The doctor comes in to tell me the bad news, while my girlfriends listening on the other end. As she tells us our cats dying, we both lost it, her on the other end of my phone and me sitting there in an empty room. Our cat had a blood clot that dislodged from her leg and got caught in her heart. Her prognosis was terminal at this point and we were told she was in a lot of pain, nothing could be done at this point but to let her be at peace.

Signing that paper to allow her euthanasia was absolutely heartbreaking. A part of me died as I put the pen to the slip to sign my name, my partner on the other end in agreement but heartbroken by the decision. There’s nothing we could do but I was told it was the best thing we could do for her at this point.

We have today to decide what to do with her remains. We’ve not a lot of money at all and the emergency visit was quite a bit for us but I’d be on the street before I let our animals suffer. Our options are to bury her, which in the North East, the ground is frozen solid which isn’t an option. A communal cremation or a private cremation where were given the ages afterwards.

Obviously our last option is the most expensive, I’m not sure we can afford it but I feel we can go without some things for a bit just to have a piece of her with us. What would you do in this situation? 

I’ve never been in this situation where I’m the one that had to take the reigns to make a decision like this before. I still can’t wrap my head around the true reality of the situation. Like any loss, it’s going to take a while to grasp that she’s gone.

I called out of work last night for today, obviously in the wrong spirits. I had told my boss what happened and that I had only today to figure out what to do with her remains. It’s a cat but it was like our child, never met a more human-like cat than her in my entire life. I feel anxious that I actually called out as I’m a manager but I feel so broken. Was it wrong for me to take the day off to mourn a pet?

I just feel weak.. I can’t decide what to do nor if calling out was a good choice. I have more than enough sick time though it’s been hours later and I’m embarrassed that I showed an untethered, emotional side to my boss. Maybe I should have waited to calm down a bit but I didn’t want to make finding coverage difficult and last minute.

Life is cruel, it’s painful and it’s temporarily beautiful. Any support is good support. I hope I don’t come across as being ridiculous for calling out over this but I want to make the write choice, I want to be there to mourn with my girlfriend just for the day. 

Thanks for listening, just so much going through my mind right now.",03Jan2020,3
511,"My Mum has been going through a tough time recently, her and my dad have been divorced for years and she has had a few unsuccessful relationship's since. One left her recently which dramatically affected her financially. 
In the run up to Christmas everyone noticed how irritable and touchy she was being. So I had a frank conversation with her and she told me how she was really worried about affording Christmas etc. 
I offered to lend her some money (£1000) and since then she has been fine, Christmas was good and she seems relatively stress free.

For the record, I am in high school.

Back in October time I really wanted to join cheer so I can make new friends. I was really bored of barely having a sustainable friend group and staying at home all day.

I told my mom that I wanted to join cheer and she was pretty supportive. She signed my up for cheer training (it’s starting on the 7th) to get ready for tryouts.

But I changed my mind.

I’m really lazy. Like seriously lazy. I like to go out and have fun with my friends, but when it becomes a requirement I just can’t do it. 

I don’t know what was going through my head to think that 1) I would even make the team 2) I am not flexible and I have no energy at all so how am I even gonna do good

But I told my mom this casually during dinner and she flipped out because she already paid for the training and she said I needed the exercise. I honestly understand what she’s communicating but I just really don’t wanna do this anymore. It was a phase 

At this point I’m thinking about doing the “training” but not showing up to tryouts... and lying to my mom saying I did when I didn’t. And when the results come out, I’ll just lie again and say I didn’t get in and I don’t wanna keep trying at something I’m probably not that good at.

542,"My boyfriend (18m) and I (18f) have been together for 3 years now and have known each other for 4 years since the beginning of high school. We were each other first for everything from holding hands, to kissing to having our very first intimate encounter with each other. My mom, a faithful catholic Mexican woman in her 60's, is disgusted and disappointed that I am dating someone outside of my race, someone who can't speak Spanish at all and who is younger than me (he is white, 3 months younger than me and is trying hard to learn Spanish to get over the language barrier).  
My mom and I used to get along so well up until the point I got into high school when I decided to join clubs and be more social than I used to be in middle school. I wanted to have friends, hobbies to have fun in and make the most of high school. She was also disappointed upon finding this out when I mentioned that I joined the theatre, art, gaming clubs, became a member of a pro-college program at the school. She threatened me to drop the clubs and program or she would make me change schools. And I did for a while before working up the courage to tell her that I would still go to the clubs and program even if it means her leaving me to find ways to get there on my own, and I did just that. Every time I would get home, I would be given underhanded comments and insults about how lazy I am and how irresponsible I have become. I didn't mind because that's something I've always heard her say no matter what I am doing, that includes if I give her half of my check from working. 

Last year, my boyfriend and I decided to become sexually active for the first time after we went over our options of birth control that was both affordable and safe for us to use. I was also concerned with whether it was okay to do it at all because at the time, I was a month away from becoming 17 and he wasn't... meaning that if we did it at all, I would become a pedophile for touching and sleeping with a minor. My boyfriend then introduced me to the Romeo &amp; Juliet law which states that as long as both parties were no more than 3 years apart, being over the age of 15, and both parties being consenting, then it is not statutory rape and legal. I had to double and triple check the legitimacy of the law and postponed us doing anything of that kind until I felt ready. When the time came, we both used protection and had our virginities lost to each other. A month later, my mom found out that I had premarital sex with him. She shamed me by calling me a sl\*t, wh\*re, a piece of sh\*t and a disappointment for going after the first d\*ck the first chance I get. She would call my boyfriend a piece of trash. a sinner, a p\*ssy seeking c\*nt that only wants to use me and leave me pregnant and alone, calls him racial slurs, constantly attack his image in front of me at home knowing full well that I am afraid fo getting hit or yelled at by her. I admit it hurt me on a very deep level and that kind of verbal abuse kept happening for about a month, she began to give me threaten me to either marry him, break up with him or she would call the police because he ""raped and abused me"". Keep in mind that my boyfriend has done nothing but help me overcome my anxiety, has tried to learn Spanish to speak to her and my father and has gone as far as making sure that we had protection to prevent all unwanted pregnancies. We weren't being dumb about the whole experience just twitling out genitals and giggling and cumming. No, he made sure I was comfortable with it, as I was older than him by a bit and waited until I was ready for it. He knows I hate doing things at the wrong time, place and with people when it comes to big milestones like this. he had no idea that I was hiding all of that and the threat my mom made to me. Thet threat of legal action was up for as long as 4 weeks and was giving me enough stress for me to almost commit suicide one night from the blame I gave myself, the insults and condescending words and phrases my mom would say to me every night. It was only because of my boyfriend that I didn't jump off a bridge and into a river to drown. 

that night we swore to always be honest with each other and I began to tell him why I wanted to do it. I even told him about the threat and he broke down in front of me...

The way my mom would say those things were in such a way that it was a frighting experience; she would wake me up in the middle of the night completely drunk insult my boyfriend with racist insults, comments about how disgusted she is with my life choice. She'd hit me, spit at me, insult me and my boyfriend until I cried if I ever respectfully disagreed with her, asked to go to bed or to stop hurting me. My boyfriend is aware of the abuse because I once came to school with a huge bandaid on my cheek and with my whole right arm covered by that elastic wrap you normally see on someone who injured themselves. He tried to help me by offering me a place to stay when things get too violent or I get kicked out. To this day we still argue with each other and our relationship hasn't been the same as it used to be. I'm seriously considering cutting ties with her for a few years and going to a college far from home, but at the same time, I can't bring myself to do that to her. She is my mother and I will always love her no matter what; she has tried her best to raise me as best as she could but it's difficult to be around her when all I hear from her is racial slurs against my boyfriend, me being called all sorts of terrible things like a sinner, sl\*t, wh\*re and piece of sh\*t...

So its the last day of school and as we left school i invited to him to my house to play some fifa (soccergame) on my ps4. We had  fun for a couple of hours and then his phone rings. A group of 3 girls that are close to him tell him to go out with them and he asks them if i can come too.Fast forward they agreed we went out for couple of hours and 2 of then seemed to be a little cold towards me but not too much. So its july of 2019 and me and T go out almost 3 -4 times a week until its Auguast of 2019 and i invite T to come with my family on holiday for 2 weeks he leaves.( he seemed like he was having fun he was talkative and all) after the first week  T goes back home after telling us his aunt died and i stay at the holiday place. After 4 days he uploads an insta story of him singing chants at a soccerstadium whilst watching his favorite soccer team and he looked as if he was having fun .I thought that was a bit of but i didnt say anything to him. After those holidays we sat down in the same table in class up until now (december 2019 aka winter break in my country) in 40% percent of the time we walk together around but he is mostly with that group of girls.When he is with me he rarely brings up any intresting topics to discuss on and when i happen to tell him about some intresting events in my  life he usually answers with a: ""no way"" and doesnt say anything else after that. In the span of 4 months i have asked him to go out and play football or just generally go out about 9 times he has agreed on 2 of them and on all the others he has given me tons  of excuses .In the christmas break we have gone out once. And i asked him out today and he send me a text about something  else  as nothing happened and today this was the true tipping point.  


Im thinking about discussing with him since he has never told me about an issue he has with me or that he just  feels like hanging around with the group of girls rather than me. But keep in mind if i discuss it with him in real life he is going to be awkard as fuck and i feel like it will result in more excuses or cutting me off. 

I forgor to mention when i text him when he is online he doesnt open the text for up to 2-3 hours.

Also the one of the few reasons it think he considers me a friend at this points is. That hs tells me about the stuff with his girlfriend and asks me for advice.

Okay this is a weird scenario. I will try and make a long story short.

Three years ago I was seeing a guy on and off for about 6 months. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship and then I didn’t hear from him for like 8 months. By then, I found a new guy and got into a relationship and I told him and he said he was happy for me.

Anyway for the last year I noticed he never posted anything on his insta stories until I realised he had blocked me from viewing his stories. The way I found out was I was with a mutual friend one day and I saw her view his story. We still follow each other on insta and he watches my stories all the time and he even has a gf now.

It takes me some time but my comics/manga and drawings sell for a little bit so I make my own money. But my dad isn't really amazed. He thinks that drawing is a ""cool"" thing but it's not very manly. 
One day we were just talking and I said that joining the military would be ""interesting"" (but i was more thinking it would be something new for me.) After that my parents went crazy and said after i finish school i am going to a Cadet army camp. Now i don't want to disappoint but i wanted to go to a Technological school after i finished. I am in 7th grade and I'm 13 I have 1,5 years to tell my dad that i don't want to pursue the army. Yes, I am athletic and my grades are very good, but I am a wimp. Everyday my dad says he is so proud of me and they always show of to guests and friends that ""his little boy is going to be a soldier, he is so proud!"" 
I asked people for advice and they just said to build up the courage and talk to him... But I am just not sure. Even my teachers are confused they are always like ""You have golden hands you can really make it, but why the military?"" So, I ask for advice. What should I do?",03Jan2020,1
560,"So let me start from the beginning we met at work and she was the most amazing person I had ever met. We talked for hours on end, just as most couples do when their relationship just starts. We also had sex all the time, and I mean all the time. A few months into the relationship I started noticing her becoming distant, our conversations became stale and every time I made any sexual advances she refused blaming it on a headache or feeling tiered. Got to the point where we would spend 4 days in a row with eachother and not even a single naughty look at eachother. This I can be ok with if it wasn't for the fact that it was night and day compared to a month before. She also seemed to be on her phone much much more. When I asked her about it then she told me it was just school friends. TL:DR she was talking to another guy, they sent nudes to eachother and kissed once (pretty sure they hooked up but neither of them ever said that out loud). Worst part was that the guy was my all time best friend. So I broke up with her, lost a friend and was heartbroken for a few weeks.

After a while she contacted me again, saying she was sorry and almost begged for me back. After a few dates I told her I was willing to take her back but I could never forgive her. She understood and we started dating again. Our sexual life improved and we talked all the time, hanging out almost everyday.

Fast forward to three weeks before Christmas. Phone screen breaks leaving me without means of contacting her for 3 days before it got fixed . When I got my phone back I had noticed that all her social media accounts pfp had changed to pictures with just her and not me. Thought nothing of it , her life her choices. But then the same thing started happening from before, we became more distant, less talking on the phone, kisses and any sexual advances got turned down for various reasons. She then had a trip with school the week before Christmas, barely heard from her and when I called her the last day she seemed surprised and in a hurry to hang up. Holidays came, celebrated at her parents and then mine and decided to celebrate New year's in her home town. She started turning off her phone around me, saying that she wanted to give all her attention to me, but one night when she forgot I heard a notification come in and when I checked it was her phone with a message from a guy with a ❤️ emoji at the end. I brought it up and she said it was her best guy friend just being nice (yes they are good school friends but she has always avoided me meeting him).

Now it's a few days after new years, I'm back home and she is still in her home town, past new nights she has been up all night till 7 in the morning on WhatsApp and Instagram. Telling me she is going to sleep early over the phone and me seeing her up all night just spooks me. Right now I'm working and she is sleeping, only seeing her in a few days when she's back from her home town. I'm afraid something is happening but I already brought it up once, I'm afraid if I'm wrong she might get sick of me asking.

To anyone who read this , thanks for sticking through to the end, any advice is helpful!

TL;dr : gf cheated on me once, got back together. Now few months down the road I'm noticing the same signs as before I found out last time. Help ;/",03Jan2020,1
561,"Backstory: A couple of days before the last of the year, I asked this girl out in person and she kind of ghosted me. 

She's been very inconsistent with her trying now as opposed to before I asked her out. Late yesterday she said she can't meet up today but another day in the future (no exact date). I didn't ask why but I responded ok. 

Was I supposed to ask why she couldn't make it? Or to tell her that I just gave her a compliment and stop acting weird? (Or more simply that I gave her a compliment) How do I indicate that rejection shouldn't make things akward and I value her friendship? 

Tldr; Asked a girl out and now she's acting weird. What's a good, chill way to react and show that we still cool?",03Jan2020,1

570,"So I've (16) been dating this guy (16) for at least 2 yrs,he's amazing and so sweet and I truly love him. He met a girl a few months ago and he became really close with her, they play minecraft a lot together. He always says she's a cool person and close friend which is nice, I'm always glad to see him happy and making new friends. The thing is...I feel like this girl is flirting with him. Like touching his hands and squeezing up against him. My dude's pretty oblivious when it comes to things like that but I talked with him and he said that he'll talk with her about it. He did and I'm glad about that. Nothing much has changed besides seeing them talk less at school and probably stopped flirting. The thing is, our relationship has been rocky recently and I lot of bad things happened (arguments) and there was this one really bad time where I was crazy and snapped and hurt his hand when trying to grab something from it. It was terrible of me to hurt him like that- I was not controlling myself and we talked it out and it'll never happen again. Also, a lot of these arguments involved her (like the previous one above). He protects her and continues to spend a lot of time with her and she just brings up so many traumitizing moments of my relationship with my boyfriend. I really dont want to be the controlling type, it'd be unfair of me to ask him to stop hanging out with her. But I'm also just traumitized by her. All of this is very unhealthy for our relationship. What should I do to make amends? I thought about being friends with her but It's too late for that- she's a reminder of everything bad about our relationship. I also want to mention he has a lot of girl friends (actually I think most of his friends are girls) who are p close to him. It's just this one girl where everything went wrong. Probably the flirting. I know I'm also 16 and don't know much about handling relationships and I know I messed up, having arguments about a friend of his.

Disclaimer: This might not be the shortest post.

Two years ago, after a new start, I met a girl in a university class who I clicked with instantly. She instantly made me feel comfortable enough to open up.

Now I'd like to add this girl may have some underlying mental health issues which will be evident through this post.

But it wouldn't be long until I find out very unsavory things about her. We stayed good friends for months. I overlooked snarky remarks she made and thought them as nothing but jokes. I would overlook the times she would conveniently forget I had money issues and take me to expensive restaurants which even she wouldn't always be able to afford.

Then one day both of us got into MBTI. She felt connected with her type as the glamorized version of this type is that of a regal psychic that knew how to social engineer people and the type is also very rare. So she talked to me about the ""times"" she has done ""social engineered me"" by putting thoughts into my head knowing I'll oblige and used food as an example. She told me often times she thought I was the devil for being into new agey stuff but conveniently kept that fact to herself. She also mentioned how she keeps files on people and looked me up online.

I don't like being sensitive or making a mountain out of a moe-hill so I took it well but the keeping files thing bothered me. Fast forward, she starts engaging in activities that don't always suit her, far from her good girl persona as I without even trying to rubbed off on her. And unfortunately she gets herself into a terrible relationship as a result. The guy was a total sociopath and traumatized her. But she ended up collecting all his personal documents, checked through and videotaped the content on his phones and more. Her other friend also happened to be in love with this sociopath (which she found out after being with him but continued anyways). Later, she justified it though saying things about the friend(some of which seem like lies) -this will have significance to the story later.

After she gets over her codependency toward this sociopath, she eventually returns to her life and attempts to overwork herself to move on. She's asked me for money and made it seem like she'd turn to prostitution if I don't help. But I'd help nonetheless.

So one day, she opens up to me about how she absorbs the traits of the characters she watches on tv and she has destroyed a project because of a character she saw in university and the TA nor the student she was working with found out what she had done because she hid it very well.

Eventually, another abusive relationship later, things all of a sudden seem focused on me. When ever a guy befriends me, tries to talk to me or more, her initial reaction is to degrade the guy and act like he has a motive. This is even true of guys I've been friends for years with.

So one day, a guy on my campus hits on me. We instantly become friends but often times, he would be somewhat creepy. He added me on facebook (he had a small profile with four friends only ) which even I found suspicious. When I showed her his facebook, her initial reaction was ""I think he sent me a friend request before but I'm not sure.""

I took it with a grain of salt. So when she was telling me ""he probably just wants to use someone for sexual purposes before his strict conservative parents force him to settle down and he probably used this facebook account to lure you in."" When I said ""why me,"" her reaction was ""remember he also added me before you.""

I had plenty of reasons for not believing her though (not because I was jealous) but for other reasons.

Anyways, I did break things off with him within 2 weeks because it just didn't work out and didn't think much of it.

Then I catch her in another lie. A guy (this guy I typed as the same personality as her) in front of me was telling a girl ""when I think of girls that are agnostic, I think to myself that the girl has nothing holding her back from doing immoral things.""

So I texted her what the guy said. She replied with ""Haha, he thinks like me, something I'd say."" (I'm an agnostic). When I didn't reply for a day. She found me at school, and said ""I thought I lost a friend, what I sent you the other day, it was by accident and for another friend."" Her lie didn't make any sense.

She's lied so far about accidentily sleep texting an ex she didn't want me to judge her about. She's lied to be about seeing an ex and later coming clean about the lie because she wanted to spill tea. And she lied about never ever lying to anyone. (LOL)

Her possible lies about herself include things like : She was a psychic that could lucid dream, she was mathematically gifted ( I don't for a second doubt that she's smart though), boasted about being seen as a wise old soul from childhood, boasted about her ex's friends wanting to fuck her or talk about her sexually. As for her other friends: 1 was in love with the sociopath who she 'accidental and unknowingly' stole, another friend's boyfriend talked about her ass, her enemy's boyfriend friend stared at her too much, and her friend's long term crush feels more comfortable talking to her than her friend who doesn't know how to read people often. That friend is also very pretty and super intelligent (graduated from a prestigious university) but she emphasizes her lack of wit, loudness, inability to read people, lack of boundaries she has and more as if it'll make herself seem a little superior. Almost making that friend look like an idiot in private. I remember the first time I called this friend pretty and smart for achieving her goals; a compliment meant to mean absolutely no deeper thought. But she gave me a lecture on how looks are deceiving, 'just because someone's pretty,' doesn't mean .....etc

As for her opinions about me or other people. Her memory is poor. Everyday's opinion is a reboot dependent on the last memory she [had. One](https://had.one/) day, to her I'm rigid with good work ethic, and as such I care excessively about what people think of me. OR I'm lazy, too carefree and abstract almost like a hippie that needs protection and help from a stronger man. Also, if I'm authentic, and a little edgy is translated as I have no tact, and I have tact is also often seen as I care about what people think of me. Funny thing is subjectively, she herself has fit into all these traits at specific points in her life.

I have found out about her tragic past and the terrible way her family bully her even to this day. Much of this bullying and intolerance from her parents she internalizes and projects it onto me and those around her.

She even befriended the only other friend I had and I feel as if she did that, so I'd have a more difficult time leaving her especially now that we both graduated.

The issue is I want to know I can trust her. From her track record, it's obvious she has a broken soul and have been severely hurt, but her ways are/have been affecting my life. My self esteem is often lowered, I feel drained often times around her, and as an individual that strongly values agency and freedom, I feel like she'll affect future friendships/relationships I have.

I don't know whether she lied about the guy or not, but if she has I don't know whether she does it for self-gratification or to save me from getting hurt.",03Jan2020,2
613,"I can't and won't alert his parents about this. They're phisically and mentally (sometimes sexually) abusive, controlling, gaslighting and just plain horrible. I barely get to see him because they keep him locked in the house when he's not going to school.

He says he can't live like that anymore and i totally understand (mine aren't the greatest either) 

He says that if he has one more mental breakdown because of them, he will pack his bags, leave and then call me. I'm not sure what to do if that becomes the case, and it might soon. 

Should i talk to my parents and see if he can live with us? I'm not sending him back to that house... How would it work, exactly? Could he notify the police to say he left voluntarily as not to be classified as a missing person? Would he drop out of highschool?

Long story short I had a fling with a guy for for a while,we hadn't talked about where we stand or anything and when he brought up him not wanting a commitment I told him that it's better we stop seeing each other because knowing myself I'll get attached if we continue. I also told him I'd prefer we don't speak at least for a while and he was completely fine with it. Two weeks go by and everything was fine until he messages me asking me how I've been,we chatted a bit and as I end the conversation he told me he misses me. We have spoken two times since,wished him a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year but both weren't extended conversations. My issue is ever since we started ""talking"" again I can't stop thinking about him. I keep getting reminded about the good times we've had together and I feel like it's taking over me,even though I know I shouldn't feel this way. I'm constantly anxious waiting for him to message me,see my stories or like my posts. He is currently out of town for the holidays and told me he wants to see me when he comes back but I don't know if I should. I like him as a person but this whole situation stresses me the fuck out and I think I would be better off completely cutting him off but at the same time he is a person I wouldn't mind having him in my life because he is genuinely a good guy,we were just looking for different things. I don't know if I've caught feelings or not but I am genuinely so confused by this whole situation and I don't know what to do. Should I keep talking to him? Should I cut him off? Should I tell him all this and hopefully we can find a solution together as long as he doesn't think I'm losing my shit? lol. My mental illness is making

620,"Hi All, I've (28M) been struggling with the above and not sure my title really does the scenario any justice.

In short I'll be getting married in Las Vegas in May of this year and we will be hosting a reception party a few days later in California (Orange County) so that most of the family can be there and enjoy it with us. My mother lives in GA with my step father and has no issues hopping on a plane and attending both events, however, my step father refuses to board a plane due to anxiety and fear of flying. As you can imagine this complicates things. He would rather drive all the way to Las Vegas (25+ hours) however, this means they can only attend one event as he will miss too much work. I personally want my mother to attend both events and feel it's important to have her there and to be able to experience this with her. I've offered to pay their airfare and hotel costs for both events to try to make this decision a bit easier on them, however, he insists that if she has to attend both, she will just need to go by herself and he will not come to either event. I wouldn't be as disappointed if it was just my mother making the trip and he didn't come, but I want to make him feel included as well but he is the one complicating the situation.

On one hand I feel as though he needs to put his adult pants on and get over it and make it work for both my mother and myself, but on the other hand, I have not had to deal with this anxiety he is having and not sure if my viewpoint is selfish.

622,"Hello, so I’m gunna try to make this quick.
My boyfriend (25M) and I (21F) have been together for only about 6 months. He’s a really good guy. A dream guy actually. But he’s the absolutely terrible  at sex. Some of the time he can’t get it up. For example I went away for a bit and he picked me up from the airport and took me to his place we were in bed, excited to see each other, I thought we were about to have sex but he wasn’t getting hard and proceeds to say “he’s not a morning guy”. It was 12:00pm. 
And then one night we are in bed together he asked me to wear some lingerie he got me and so I did. We talked for a bit and then tried to have sex and once again couldn’t get it up. As he proceeds to tell me “I should be sexier “ I was quite confused when I literally wore what he asked and started going down on him. And at times he uses the excuse “I’m not spontaneous “ And the times we do have sex and he actually gets it up, he finishes in like 1 minuet and then apologizes. 

My last relationship was nothing like that, my ex who I dated for 3 years he and I had great sex pretty much all the time anytime. And he always made sure I finished and he would last 30-60 min even our “quick ones” were at least 15min and he never had an issue getting it up and we’d have sex pretty much everyday. 
What should I do about this? I already talked to my boyfriend about it and now we argue about sex it’s so stupid, something that is fun is now stressful between he and I.",03Jan2020,68

628,"I am in my early-mid 20s. I have $4,000, a GED, and effectively an empty resume. I have yet to attend university. I now have the ability to move out of my terrible situation, live my life, and go to university. I hate my state. The universities and community colleges are expensive even for residents, and they are far away. I will not stay here and intend to move away to a better place. 

These are the options I have found...


--------------
Option 1. 
-
Attend community college which I've already applied to, located around Western Washington, which is a low cost even for non-residents and I recieved a generous financial aid offer.

Problem:
I am not a resident of that state, so I could not transfer to their public universities, so I would not have an obvious pathway after earning the associates degree.

Benefit: I can leave right now and begin school and it seems, financially, to work out if I rent a room.

Possible Outcomes After Graduating:

A. apply to free universities in Europe with an Associates Degree, although they do not seem to like someone with a GED at all. I am fully willing to save the required fund for the student visa, learn their language and assimilate. Choosing this, I will spend 5 years earning a bachelors degree.

B. apply as a transfer student to private schools in the northeast which have low net costs(Cornell, Boston College, Trinity College, Wesleyan College, Colgate University etc...) and hope I am accepted, probably losing credits. Choosing this, I will spend only 4 years earning a bachelors degree, but they have low acceptance rates of 33% or less, so it is naturally unlikely, especially with a GED and a several year gap, that I could impress them even with a high GPA etc...

---------------
Option 2. 
-
Move to a state with a good public university with great financial aid (UW-Madison, UNC-Chapel Hill, UW-Seattle, UM-Ann Arbor etc...) and earn residency to that state over 1 year, and then attend their community college for 2 years, and then seamlessly transfer into their good public university.

Problem: I need to have a gross minimum wage job and make little progress until probably the fall of 2021 when I could finally enroll into their community college.

Benefit: I will have over 1 year to study, exercise etc in preparation for school, and I know that all credits would transfer seamlessly. If I have a high GPA and choose program which is not extremely competitive, it is practically guaranteed as long as nothing unexpected occurs while I earn residency (lose job somehow, cannot pay for room, end up homeless etc...). Choosing this will require 5 years to earn a bachelors degree.

-------------

I have thought about this for a while and I cannot reach a  conclusion. I feel that i'm in a nirvana fallacy. Frankly, they would all end up working out, but I want a best choice or perfect solution. I want opinions. 

I am expecting people to ask why I cannot simply stay in the state which I'm a resident, attend community college, and seamlessly transfer. The costs are higher for residents of my state than they are for non-residents in other states. It is a complete waste of money, and I greatly dislike this place. I want to get out. I hate it. The resident net costs are equivalent to non-resident net costs in other states. It's unbelievable.

629,"So I just started a new job yesterday selling insurance for a large insurance company. I work in a small office, ran by an independent contractor that has about 1,500-2000 households under their books. I have a little experience at the job (I worked for a little over a month for another agent doing customer service) so my new agent had me get right to work in my new office, doing the little I could do at the moment, waiting for the company to give me access to sell their products. 

One of the reasons I left my previous job was due to the fact that my primary responsibility was to answer calls and provide customer service. This terrified me. Here, at this new gig, the call volume is a lot less, due to the fact the new agent has 3-4x less customers; however, the fear is still there. 

I answered maybe 5-10 calls my first day. Very little went wrong. But, I’m about to go into work for my second day and I’m afraid for those phones to turn on and potentially ring. I know this fear is dumb and this job has a lot more perks/positives that outweigh this issue, but I don’t want the issue to phase me or potentially push me to quit. I really need this gig - it pays more than I could possibly make elsewhere and I generally like the environment. 

On the phone I sound obviously nervous. The programs we use to make changes, look up information, make payments, etc. are a little confusing, but the little exposure I have of them usually is enough to get the job done. I know most of this is going to be fixed with time and experience, but I just want some tips or tricks to do a better job or not to let this fear to overwhelm me. 

So Reddit, how do I get over this fear and/or get better at my job? Thanks.

TLDR: I work in insurance and answer phones as one of my main responsibilities. I’m deathly afraid of doing so and messing up or making the customer mad. What are some tips and tricks to get better at my job and/or get over my fear.",03Jan2020,2
630,"This will probably be difficult to read as I think my English skills have gone down the drain over the years of me doing absolutely NOTHING with my life... so apologies in advance.

I don't even really know where to begin but I want to start off with what I think the crux of my problem is. I genuinely feel like there is no possible way for me to get better or to end up somewhere that I can honestly say I feel satisfied with and not regret how I chose to live my life. This is mostly due to my age and my progress relative to that age. What I do know is that I want more. At this point I would just take a normal life where I am living reasonably comfortably and independently.

I have a really weird and fucked up situation probably due to an enabling mother and father and a family where every single person has mental illness and avoids their problems. This has led to a situation where I haven't had to work since I was 24 due to my parents thinking they are doing the right thing because we all genuinely believe I am incapable of being independent right now due to my disabilities (bipolar/depression/anxiety). I have two siblings and both siblings have a depression/bipolar disorder diagnosis including myself. This even extends to my grandmother.

I had a lot of promise when younger. I was considered reasonably gifted academically, wasn't quite miserable yet mentally, and even was able to hold down jobs without issue from the ages of 17-24. I went to college a year after graduating while also holding a part time job and even nearly got my degree after dropping out several times and being set to go into my final year at 27 years old. Everything seemed to be going well, but then I could no longer afford to finish my last year of college and couldn't find a job so I had to move back home with my parents with no degree and entering the worst depressive episode of my life.

That was 6 years ago and nothing has changed... I feel like I blinked as a 27 year old and woke up as a 33 year old with absolutely ZERO progress. When I think about this and my life I become physically ill. This is not an exaggeration. I completely shut down in despair and it's pathetic. I can't look in the mirror without having a panic attack because I look at my 33 year old face and missing hair and compare it to my youthful 27 year old face who still had so much hope. I can go entire days feeling this way with no relief. It's as if I feel like I am about to die or something and this happens on a regular basis. The fact that I let this happen feels like a nightmare that will never end. I hate myself for it. It wouldn't all be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that during a suicidal mental breakdown at the psychiatric clinic I ended up getting arrested for assault. I didn't actually hurt anyone, but when the cops were called in to help me and take me to a hospital my mother told the officer that I put my hand on her neck just because my mom wanted to tell the truth to the police but in my state this is considered domestic assault due to being perceived as a threat of violence or physical harm. Now I have a criminal record for domestic violence (a misdemeanor at least) and a huge gap of unemployment. Who the heck would want to hire me? I can't even get an apartment due to failing their background checks. After the arrest and 16 days spent in jail is when I really shut down and began to lose all hope for my future.

The other important details are that I am HEAVILY addicted to porn/internet/video games. This is almost all I do and I hate it. It feels impossible to change though and I don't even know how to begin undoing an entire lifetime of being addicted to these things. I've been addicted to these three things since the age of 13.

Now I'll just list the positive things going for me right now. I am working with a lawyer and my mother to get my criminal record expunged since 5 years have passed and she is advocating for me as well as many others. Hopefully this will be successful and open up some opportunities. I'd really like to finish my degree at some point even though it's just a Psychology BA but I only need 20ish more credits.

I am also exercising regularly and trying to take care of my health. I just starting running 3-4 days a week and will eventually incorporate strength training again as that used to be something I really enjoyed. I plan to finally learn how to cook (pathetic I know) and want to start eating healthy. I try to get outside in nature whenever possible and I still have friends that haven't given up on me so I'm not totally alone. Unfortunately I feel like I am losing my ability to feel connected with people though so that really really sucks but at least I have friends.

I guess the main point of this post is that I need to know... is there any hope for me? What can I do? I just want a normal life. Please help...",03Jan2020,2

638,"New to Reddit so sorry if this is the wrong place to ask advice for a situation like this!

As of recent, a stalker has been harassing one of my favourite Korean singers (if anyone wants to look the story up, it's TWICE's Nayeon), and it's gotten to the point where (two days ago) the stalker managed to board the same flight as the celebrity and tried to hand her love letters. This stalker has even been on national news and addressed by the singer's agency.

The problem surrounding this stalker currently is that he's not a citizen of Korea, and so taking legal action against him (such as a restraining order) is undoubtedly proving quite difficult. The singer's agency has known about the stalker for a couple months yet hasn't really done much bar up security for the celeb.

The stalker has a Twitter and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkui891C4A4rlyh15lmgQdA/feed), and regularly posts updates of his travels and encounters with the singer, primarily as a way to justify his actions. It can be interpreted as him almost boasting about what he's doing.

Obviously, the online fan community is extremely worried, especially as many people seem to back the stalker's profiles (he's got a following of over 11K across both platforms) and egg him on with his pursuit of the singer. I have a following of 3K within the community and am being asked about what should be done with this stalker. 

The stalker is clearly delusional, and in his recent video he tries to explain how he's not a stalker but a ""normal person trying to express his love"". Many people have tried messaging and commenting, telling him that what he's doing is in fact stalking and that he should seek counseling/therapy. Nothing seems to be working, and he continually uses his platforms to defend himself and receive support. He also stated how on Twitter people messaged him with the singer's schedule and private flight details, which is how the flight incident occurred. 

What I'm wondering is: **would it be wrong to encourage people to report his accounts, and get them taken down? Or would de-platforming him seem unwise?  What's the best course of action that fans can take?**",03Jan2020,1

BF has tried to tell them that he loves me, and that he wants to be with me, but they are not relenting. I've tried to find several solutions for this, such as:

•Suggesting we Marry. This is not only because I love him and will protect him, but also because he is not legally a citizen of the US, he would have to return to Sri Lanka when he graduates from the Air Force Academy, but he would have to give up his time in the academy to do this.

I also went in yesterday because of how important she said it was. Yesterday morning I realized it was exaggerated. The problem wasn't something I could independently fix and I really couldn't do much about it other than send off a few emails. She sent me more emails and called me and each time doubled down on how much extra work she's had to do since I've been gone.   


I had worked very long hours before leaving and did as much as possible to tie up lose ends. She just isnt used to covering the volume of emails I receive on a normal basis. I tried my hardest not to give into the guilt trip and not to volunteer to come in on my final day off (today). She asked me to be on a phone call today and I agreed because it felt like the least I could do since I could tell she wanted so much more. 

The call was cancelled and no one reached out to me to let me know. I had completed rearranged my plans (and spent too much emotional energy \*not\* being on vacation). I'm feeling a bit upset that she guilt tripped me throughout my time off and completely disrupted now 3 whole days of leave including one actual holiday. How can I respectfully and professionally address this? We have a small office and she has always relied extremely heavily on me. One year I faced losing most of my annual leave because she kept asking me to put off taking it because of the work volume. When I told her I was concerned about my leave and was wondering how we could compensate, she told me ""you could have taken it."" I believe this is willful ignorance of the authority she holds and is an abuse of power. It's never a good time for me to take off and she guilt me every time.

This time feels egregious because she actually disrupted entire days. I had plans that I disregarded (and it shouldnt matter even if i didn't). I know she was swamped and that I'm a senior employee but after a while it doesn't feel right. She is the CEO and our org is so small we dont have an HR department - we use an external company for things like that but dont have anybody who works with us on these sorts of matters. 

Advice for addressing this behavior and setting boundaries without abandoning my responsibility?

TL:DR: Boss doesnt let me take leave without guilt tripping me. This time, she asked me to work for a portion of 3 of my pre-approved vacation days, one of which did not tell me she actually didnt end up needing me. Cancelled plans to be available.",03Jan2020,1
644,"Ever heard the saying ""Stranger danger""? Well this guy is just the definition of it.

A few days ago I was looking around Discord servers hoping to find some new friends. About half an hour later after I joined a Discord server a guy DMd me. He claims to be turning 15 in March, but I'm not so sure about that. 

One of the many reasons I believe he has malicious intentions is because he is trying to find out anything he can about me by going through my social media, hell I had to make a new Reddit account just so he wouldn't see this. He's trying to find out my age, where I live (country), what I look like and etc.. He also DMs me every hour or so to tell me that he loves me, which I always jokingly reply to with ""haha love you too man"".

I would try to block him, but the fact that he has all my social medias and could contact me through those when I dont even know his social medias worries me.

I'd really like some advice on what to do in this situation, since I dont feel like I should involve my parents in it either.",03Jan2020,2
645," I live in a house with 3 other guys in the age between 24-28. My problem is with the oldest one in the house, and there are multiple reasons why. 

He does not inform when he is having guests over at the house. One time I was having friends over the night and informed the rest of the guys 2 days before, then a couple of hours before my friends show up, he says that he has guest coming for dinner in a couple of minutes and will stay at the house the rest of the day. 

He rarely locks the door to the house.

It takes him 3 days to clean up the kitchen after having people over.

He is often away for the most of the day and sometimes comes home at the middle of the night, without saying anything about when he will be home.

He always changes his plans, even if we plan a dinner, a trip or anything together.

It is getting real hard to plan anything with him, and I am at the point of just not caring anymore. How am I to deal with this type of personality and behavior?",03Jan2020,1
650,"My dad was taking care of the health insurance thru his federal job. My mom got a job with the state and for whatever reason the health insurance is cheaper even though they would have the same coverage.

Mom made the switch but didn’t see that she needed to provide a copy of her marriage license. My father doesn’t have health insurance now. 

Now my nearly 64 year old father and has COPD and needs 3 different monthly inhalers, they’re already expensive on insurance so off of insurance he would not be able to afford them. On top of that there’s been several times in the last 3 months that EMS was nearly called due to how hard of a time this disease is giving him and he isn’t making it any easier chain smoking.

Anyway. He CLEARLY needs to be on insurance.

I also am not insured, missed the deadline to see if I qualified for Medicaid so I definitely know a drop of how my father must feel, but I’m half his age and am not currently suffering with any life threatening conditions, so I think I can get by until I get myself sorted, he cannot.

My cars engine locked up. Big oof right? There's nothing I can do with the car because to get it fixed would make me completely broke. I don't have a job and I live about 25 miles away from town. I did have a job at Target but they didn't tell me they weren't keeping me full-time until my last day which was December 26th, 2019.

My mom and grandma have been down my throat about not having a job and make me feel worthless because my car broke down. I don't have a proper way of transportation and I won't. I can't continuously beg my friends and family for rides because after a while I can tell they're tired of it. 

I have a friend that's going back to Colorado and I want to go with her but she told me that taxes are really high out there and I just don't freaking know. I'm overwhelmed and all my friends that I always listen to and am there for are never here when I need them. My ex girlfriend that broke up with me when I came to Mississippi to be here for my grandpa only messages me when it's convenient for herself and I'm just so tired. If you're gonna sit here and tell me to stop feeling sorry for myself, don't even. I hear it enough everywhere I go. 

I've applied for jobs and am waiting for a call back. I still don't have any way of transportation. My grandma is constantly telling me to get out of bed but I have been. I go out with friends and try to stay motivated but these last two days has been dreary and raining and I'm exhausted.

653,"So I applied to a job through the hospital. I applied early December (like the 13th). I got a call the next day to do a interview on the 26th. Everything went well as far as the interview goes. I feel pretty confident about it. They sent me a email as part of the interview time and location stating for me to call the recruiter for the next steps.  She was very hard to get ahold of because of the holidays and she was super busy. I totally get that. However I finally reached her last Friday. She told me she would find out how my interview went and would give me a call by the end of the day to let me know something. She never called. So this past Monday I call twice, no answer. Tuesday I decided why not call one more time. She didn’t answer. But moments later she called back. Yay. Only to inform me that the lady that interviewed me was out for the holidays and she would call me as soon as she heard something. So today being Friday I’m still anxiously waiting to hear back. Should I give her a call? I feel like she might be so busy she might forget about the whole thing. I don’t want to be to pushy but the waiting game is killing me. Or should I wait to give her a call on Monday? Any advice is appreciated. This is a dream job for me and a step up the ladder.",03Jan2020,1

Anyway, the neighbor upstairs moved out, the leasing office is upgrading the unit from carpeting to hardwood floors. I can hear the workers whistle while they work as I write this and one was just on the phone, I could clearly hear what he said. It's not like they have heavy metal blasting. Is there anything I can suggest in terms of sound proofing since this would be the time to install things BEFORE the fact. I think the problem will get worse with hardwood floors. 

Also, as these guys go up and down the stairs to work, it sounds like a herd of buffalo are going up and down. I assume this is due to the carpet being removed.

675,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 3 months, but lately I've realised that I don't  feel the same way anymore. He has always given me lots of attention. He compliments me all the time, gives me tons of presents, texts me constantly, talks about me with his friends and family, talks about me on twitter, plans all our dates, and many more things. This doesn't sound like a problem, but I can't do the same for him, and I sometimes feel overwhelmed with all the attention. When I try to do something nice for him, like buying him something, he loves it, and tells me how I'm such an amazing girlfriend, but the next day he gives me something twice as expensive or just tries to do something twice as big. He truly believes that I deserve more than him. That I'm more important. When I call him handsome or cute, he denies it. He has self steem issues, I get it, but he always says ""no I'm not"", or ""stop it, you're the only good-looking one"", and he's serious. I've tried to talk about this with him, and told him that I find him really attractive, that I'm definitely not the only one, and that he should try to love himself more, even if it's difficult, because I'll be there for him to remind him that he's amazing. He promised me that he'd try, but he hasn't made any progress. All he can say about himself are negative things. 
For context, I met him in a Japanese course. I'm a 18 year old female. He's 25, has a disability that is not very noticeable at first, but that you can clearly see if you're standing next to him or talking to him. Even though I find him attractive, he's not ""objectively handsome"", and many people have told me that he's ""ugly"" and that I'm much prettier than him.
He's been bullied all his school life, and has struggled to find a girlfriend. He had one a few years ago, but it only lasted a month and it was apparently very toxic. 
I never cared about what people thought, but he did. He put me on a pedestal and I started to feel uncomfortable. But that was just the beggining. A few weeks ago, he started talking about living together. I clearly told him that I didn't want to think about that, it's too soon and I still have to figure out what I want to study or what I want to do with my life. He didn't listen to me, and brings it up all the time. He has started saying ""when we live together..."". He started talking about things really far in the future, and it's beggining to make me uncomfortable. I've already told him this, but he can't help it. Two weeks ago, he proposed to me. He has already joked about it a few times, but this time he was serious. I just laughed and said that I would, in the future, and somehow managed to avoid the subject but make him happy. He sometimes says things like ""I stillcan't believe I'm dating a girl like you....When I tell people, they don't believe me. I'm so lucky..."" He thinks I'm too god for him, so he's afraid to let me go. He thinks he'll never find someone like me. Even after all this, I was really in love with him, and kept convincing myself that he'd calm down soon and stop being so obsessed, but lately he's started to say things like ""I can't live without you anymore... I've never been this happy in my life"" ""I can't be without you... I'm gonna stay with you forever...will you stay with me forever? You promise?"". That was the sentence that broke me. I realised that I can't deal with so much pressure right now. I feel so overwhelmed that I don't even feel like seeing him, and I think I should break up with him as soon as possible, because If I stay, I'm gonna end up hurting him really bad.
I know I want to break up with him, but I don't know how exactly. He's my first boyfriend, so I have no experience. I want him to know that it wasn't because of his appearance, his disability, or any of that. I want to make sure that he doesn't blame himself or hate himself even more. I know I should just tell him this, and I eventually will... But I just need any advice I can get. It would help me a lot. I really love him, and I don't want to hurt him.",03Jan2020,1

I'm really scared some crazy guy just decides to kill us all with a nuclear bomb, i know that sounds farfetched and i've been trying to convince myself that such thing won't happen and that my country will just suffer economacally (which  still doesn't calm me down at all), but i still cant shake off the feeling of dying a painful death because of radiation. I also don't want to lose my dad, since he is in the military, i'm afraid i won't see him again if a war starts.

I'm also even more scared because i'm really young,i'm not even an adult, i can't die just yet. I just need advice, on how to stop feeling that way, or maybe just hear something rational that will make me stop thinking of such ridiculous things, like dying before tomorrow.

Right now if i even hear a plane engine i will just start panicking. Though i'm still trying to convince myself that Iran doesn't have a problem with Brazil, but the US.

679,"So I will try to explain this as much as I can. Its a weird situation but giving me lots of anxiety. 

I am a software engineer. Before christmas we started working on fixing tests. We were asked to work in pairs of two. So after a few days we found out My pair and another pair were more or less working on the same problem. So the solution would be the same. Somewhere during the week there was also a discussion on if we should abandon this issue because we are spending far too much time on it. My holidays started on Friday 20th december while the rest worked on friday.

I came back this week on thursday. I saw an email from the other pair that they had come up with a solution but cannot deliver it because that solution is causing other problems. They had also had a discussion with a senior member and they put the discussion in the email. I was not in the discussion on friday because I was not working on that day(given he did send some explanation by email).

Thats when I made a mistake. I did not continue working on the same problem because the other pair was already close to a solution, my partner was not in and we had a discussion before christmas that maybe we are spending too much time on the issue. I could have worked on it and maybe solved it. 

I joined another colleague working on a different problem. A guy from the other pair came and he continued working but he is very new so he made no progress. The guy who keeps the list of tests told us that we could continue working on that problem because thats higher priority. I didnt think too much of it at that time. However as soon as I left the office I started getting stress and lots of anxiety. I started thinking that I made a bad decision and on Monday I am going to get in trouble. I am also proving the point of my team lead who said that I rush to solutions without thinking. I am trying to tell myself that it will be ok even if they fire me but cant stop thinking about it.

We were raised together, she is my own flesh and blood.

It all started from a very young age, we used to pretend that we were a ""couple"" and we enjoyed telling other kids that we were not siblings but partners.

When I was a kid I did not think that our relationship was strange, for me it was normal to feel like that about her. When we started growing up, we noticed that most siblings did not act that way so he distanced a little bit.

Two years ago (I was 15 and she was 14) we said ""f\*ck it"" and we started our relationship (which lasts until this day). I am deeply in love with her and I believe that I have always been.

We do not plan on having children.

Our family and friends do not know a thing about this, they would reject us if they found out. We plan on moving to another town when I am 18.

We do not hurt anybody, I do not know why it is so taboo.

Even if I feel really good with her, I do not know if this is healthy, I love her and want to be her boyfriend but I also know that this is not the usual.

I think we should see a therapist but in my country  psychologists are allowed to tell our parents about the sesions (we are underage.) Even if the therapist did not tell my parents about it, they would start to ask a whole bunch of questions about why do we want to go to therapy together and stuff and I am afraid they would eventually discover it.

686,"My insecurities have reached a point that it's taken control over my life.

Some examples are that I become judgemental to others so that I can stand above others who are worse than me, but whenever someone is better than me I feel like I'm not worth anything. And because of this I can never feel equal to anyone. This also make me feel extremely isolated, because I feel so lonely that I can't be the same as everyone else.

I never have the courage to pick up any hobbies other than gaming, because if I don't see immediate results I immediately accept that I'll never get good at it and just stop. 

Following the judgemental part I can't have fum conversations with people because I either come off as an jackass or a absolute beta ass bitch. I can't even walk properly sometimes, because if I even feel like someone is staring at me I get self-conscious about way I walk and over think the walking pattern and end up walking like a new born horse. 

The thing that made me finally realized I'm in too deep of a whole to stay anymore, is when I absolutely blew my chances with a genuinely sweet and beautiful girl because I just couldn't except the fact that someone as amazing as her would find genuine interest in a shit show like me. And she said that it was insulting that I would belittle fondness towards me as an ulterior motive and has blocked me on every platform imaginable.

Instantly I was attacked for my statement. In short, I didn't believe everyone who didn't like a character in the new trilogy was a toxic man baby.

Well of course, being a man myself I was called a toxic man baby for my belief. As someone who suffers from anger issues and who went to counseling to control my PTSD and Anger, I use every tool to not blow up.

One person (op) would constantly tell me to ""calm down"" after each of my responses...in which the people who were talking to me used profanity and personal attacks. I would respond in defense of myself, but with no hostility.

I would tell this specific person that I am calm. I'm not upset. I'm not hostile...but they and everyone else attacking me placed their own ideas of who I am...on me.

I did finally snap after the 5th time...by calling them love. I said ""I'm calm love, I'm good love, I'm not upset love. One Love."" To which I was then attacked for being a misogynist....

I mentioned it to my parents casually and they seemed a little concerned. I’m wondering if this is enough to report to the police or something. I’m a girl in my teens so naturally I’m a little worried but he looks like a hipster and has AirPods and I’m pretty sure I could beat him up.,03Jan2020,46
698,"My friend group consists of really funny, kind and overall great people. One of these we will call James. James and I were best friends in our old school, but we went to different secondary schools. He became an asshole to me when the boys were around but is exactly how he used to be when we are alone. I think he feels pressured to act like that, but no one liked him to act like that.
    We all take the piss out of each other, it’s just what we do. He takes it fine from everyone else but as soon as I say a word he threatens to fight me. We’ve already fought and I don’t want to fight him again (I didn’t lose).  The boys just want to see a fight. It’s not like they’re not real friends or anything. 
    I’m conflicted on whether I should ditch the entire friend group to avoid him or take it and suffer through. I can hardly get them to stop talking to him because he’s such good friends with them. What do I do?",03Jan2020,2

703,"I'm going to a workshop for work in 10 days. One of the requirements is to come prepared with these set of rules memorized verbatim including punctuation, grammar, etc.

In total these rules are broken into 15 different numbers for a total of just over 2,000 words. So far I have been able to memorize the first 4 rules verbatim while typically making only 1 word choice mistake throughout.

Any advice on memorizing these? Right now I'm reading them a few times in my head. Then writing them while looking. Then verbally saying them out loud, before ultimate trying to write them from memory. Each time I learn a new one I write all the previous ones from memory as well.

This is great but I'm starting to wonder if there is any better approaches? I have about 15 hours invested in memorizing what amounts to about a quarter of what is required. 

I'm also finding it harder to recall some of the earlier ones I memorized as I learn more. For instance, I used to be able to do #1 without stopping to think, but when I learned #4 now I have to wait and reason through #1. I can still get it but it's taking more time to recall and making me nervous that as I continue with more I will start losing some of what I've already done.",03Jan2020,2

705,"*tl;dr at the bottom. Two quick things though, I know my decisions made in the past, and easily forgiving someone for something gross, and almost dating them only a year later isn't the best decision. But, hindsight is 20/20. I had horrible self esteem, had just been dumped by my abusive ex boyfriend, and was going through a lot. Please don't judge me, I've realized that a lot of things were messed up and just want to make the right move going forward.*

So I have this friend, we'll call him Alex.  
  
This is a guy that way overstepped boundaries and borderline sexually assaulted me by holding a charging cable around my neck and asking me ""If I liked it like that."" It was all pretty rough at the time. It was about a year and a half ago I think.  
  
After about a year of him repenting and doing everything the church told him to do, (getting help, going to therapy, staying away from me, etc.) I forgave him and we became friends again. Fast forward like half a year and we were kinda flirty but I always felt like he took it a little far. After a while we still flirted and started to see each other for a couple weeks.  
  
Even when we were seeing each other however, I had to regularly remind him of boundaries such as,""Hey if I'm pulling away from kissing you, don't pull my hair so I can go back and keep kissing you. I know you think it's sexy but this isn't a movie and I want to leave.""  
  
Or when we made out twice (like day three of us seeing each other) and he asked ""What are your boundaries?"" That sounds like he's innocently asking where I stand on certain things, but we've had that discussion before and what he was really asking was ""How far can we go / can we have sex?"" Which he knew I wasn't comfortable with. He also went straight to choking me because he knows from things I've said in the past that I'm into it, but that's more when I'm in an established relationship with someone who I go on dates with and who I've been with for a while. Not a guy I've made out with twice. It felt really weird that this was pretty much our second time making out and he was actively trying to have sex.  
  
We eventually stopped seeing each other and remained friends but every now and then I still have to remind him of boundaries such as  ""Hey please stop regularly tickling me, it feels awkward and uncomfortable."" In general he just does things that feel condescending or things that I feel like most people wouldn't do.

The most recent example, and the reason I'm writing this post, is because I was hugging him goodbye yesterday. He started doing this thing over the last few months where if it seems like I'm getting worked up he hugs me to try to calm me down and just shushes me.  
  
This was cute like... the first time. After a while it was like ""Okay yes I'm angry and worked up but let me express that instead of just trying to calm me down. This feels demeaning."" Not only did he do it yesterday, but he kissed me on the forehead out of nowhere, which made me uncomfortable as the only time he had done that to me in the past was when we were seeing each other. I [texted](http://imgur.com/a/ni0scME) him about it, and it felt like a gross interaction. His apology felt like he forced it out because I read his message and didn't respond.

tl:dr guy friend of mine has a serious knack for overstepping my boundaries. I'm really tired of it and two of my friends have told me to ghost him, but they're also very extreme people. Thought I'd ask Reddit how y'all feel.",03Jan2020,1
706,"I was born in America but left to live in Japan at 2 months old. I’ve lived there my entire life with my adopted Japanese grandfather up until I turned 17. over the years every summer I came to the states to visit family. I move back to the states 3 years ago for school. My problem is the argument I had with a friend. She is 4th generation Chinese and I’m Portuguese Japanese (fully Portuguese, Japanese citizen). Me and 4 other (including the girl herself) were hanging out. (Is was 3 Asians and one African American) We always make jokes offensive and non. We were joking around and I made a small joke about Ching Chong. Everyone laugh and she got angry. She started by saying “for someone like you, you can’t say that. Your not asian and you never grew up Asian.” She went on and on and I try to explain to her it’s a joke amongst friends and that just because I don’t look asian, people have also made fun of me by saying Ching Chong because of my accent and where I was from. She continue to just say the same thing over and over. She started to annoy me, so I told her to get over it. My other two Asian friends also told her it wasn’t a big deal. Fast forward a week I’ve talk to my Japanese friend back home in Japan and some friends in Taiwan who also said she over reacted. 
I don’t know what’s it’s like to grow up in a Portuguese/ American household, all I know is Japan. I believe I grew up Asian considering I know nothing but Japan and Was raised by my Japanese grandfather. I don’t denied my origins it’s more of the fact that I’m not familiar with it.

I’ll get right into it: I was doing webcamming for a little while when I was approached by someone who offered me a lot of money to do private shows.  I know, already sounds shit.  He said after his the first show he’d send me payment with the condition I continue Skyping him all month long.  Well after the show he sent me 7 out of the 10 digits of an MTCN saying I had to work for the others.  Which was not what was first agreed on.  I’ve done two shows for him and each time he tells me I’ve earned the money, only to send me an incomplete MTCN with another condition.  I’m getting incredibly frustrated with what to do.  He’s being a real prick about it and I’m wondering if there’s any possibility of something I can do here.  I know there’s nothing at western union can do anything without a complete number.  I’m at my wits end.  I’ve been up for days stressed and arguing with this guy being a piece of shit.

717,"I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I'm so damn hurt and even if I try to speak to her, she won't try to listen to me. My mum has a history of bad relationships. She always jumps way too quick in a relationship. Down of the guys were completely assholes. Abusive, alcoholics and so lazy to the point they stink. Im 21f. I have 3 older siblings. Sherrill always come to me and tell me about guy x and guy y. And I have no problem with it but considering her past I always try and tell her not to jump too soon. She always says yes and then does the opposite. She's been talking to a man on internet for about 2 years, finally brought him here to move in. Everything was fine. She was so happy and I loved that. But what hurts me is that, if it's not for a guy, she won't cook, if it's not for a guy, She won't clean but scream about me regarding the cleaning and cooking. She had a savings account and swore that she will never touch it and the moment that guy moves it, she went in the savings account also took a loan out, asked me to be her guarantor just so she could buy him a damn car. That hurt in particular because she never did try and help me in any way to get a car even knowing how much I want one ( I do work in case you're wondering. 14 hrs a day ) then, She asked me to take a bigger  loan out on my account ( she couldn't take any more ) so she could pay the car in full. And have some extra money. I did it.i clearly told her I will take a loan out, as long as 1. You pay the car in full. 2. You give me the money every month. When I recieved the money, I gave them to her, said she will pay the car. I believed her and she lied straight to my face, because I was her guarantor, I was able to see whether she paid or not and of course she did not, confronted her about it and SOMEHOW I'm the bad guy. She did end up paying it the next day. She also makes me pay for a part of the loan and I can't do anything about it since the money are coming out from my account. She promised me she will help me with the driving lessons ( she never did ) at some point, everything starts to crumble with this guy and he moved out NOT even 2 months later. I was sad of course. Then as always, I was there for her to listen to her frustration and anger. I'm the only one of the siblings who knew about him, because my siblings wont understand her. I'm always here to listen to her, try and help her but it's never good enough, I'm never good enough for her. She will come to me and my partner and ask for our help regarding a university paper of her laptop doenst work, she doesn't know how to write a essay, etc etc etc. We are always helping her. In the rare case we can't, She will just get overly upset and she we never do anything to help her. I'm sick and tired of her criticizing everything and everyone but she doesn't see herself at all. I suffer with depression and anxiety because I was severley abused by my own that in so many different ways. I had an abusive relationship I've been through hell and back and I don't know how much more of my mum's behaviour I can take. The reason why we fought this morning was of course, for another guy that she's only knows for 1 month. As I said,the previous guy left this house only about 3 weeks ago. And she already wants to bring the new guy TO MOVE IN. I told her that I think it's too early and she should wait before but she literally started screaming at me, saying I have no right in this because she is the one who is paying in the house, who do I think I am to judge her, who do I think I am to judge him. I've tried telling her  don't judge anything and anyone, I'm literally saying that it's too early and asked her to please listen to me as well every now and then at least since I'm her daughter but she won't have any of it. She also told me how I dont know what loneliness is even though she knows  very wll what ive been through. I'm the one who always listens to her hours and hours on end about all her problems but she will never listen to me, if I try to open a conversation about myself or anything in general, she will completely ignore it and move on to her again. I'm never listened to but I always listen to her, I always try and help her, I always worry about her. The moment a guy comes in the picture, it's even worse. remember how I mentioned the car earlier, I asked her what she was gonna do with it and she said she will sell it so she can cover some of the bills, I offered to help her with it. The moment this new guy comes in the picture ( the one she already wants to bring in ) she said she will give the car to him. I was so damn hurt, Literally there is no me in this picture, it's always guy x, guy y and so on. I was so shocked, told her why is it only guys and guys but not for your own daughter and sarcastically she she she will give it to me but I'll have to pay in thst case ( even though for all these guys, she paid ). I have heard problems, I was recently taken to he hospital by ambulance from work because of my heart. I didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to worry her. I ended up telling her the next day, when I was home. She was ""upset for like 2 minutes and then asked me to do her make-up because she was going on a date with this new guy. I tried calling to her about it, about what happened, how scared ai was but she was literally much more focused on getting ready because she was late. Came home the next day and never asked me about it since then ( been 2 weeks ) I genuinely have given up. After the argument from today, I'm so damn heartbroken, I can't believe this is my mum. It feels like I'm the mum and she is the daughter I'm so hurt, shocked and angry. This kind of behaviour has been  going for years now and I'm genuinely reaching my limit. I always try and be strong, I never tell her my problems because she will judge me and criticize me. I never tell how I fell because I kmow she won't understand  I genuinely don't know what I can do anymore.

720,"Hello Reddit.
My friend told me his feelings towards a girl a while ago. He was in deep f-zone. I had a crush on a same girl so it crushed me inside. I had a dispute in my mind about telling him some BS in order to give me more chances or tell him the truth, my honest opinion, maybe some advices and be a good bro. 
I chose to be a good bro. I told him what is he doing wrong and that sadly he is in f-zone IMO. 
He seemed unhappy, little did I know that at this time he started hating me. 
I was a bit sad, but I gave him a free way. I stopped my attempts for her, although it was really hard. Christmas came and everybody was with their families. (We live in Poland, we are Christian oriented. Like a lot)
During that time I had a lot of time to think about it. I ended up deciding that the best thing for me would be telling him the truth. 
It had some problems:
The earliest time I was able to meet him was a New year's Eve party...
1. I didn't want to TEXT him that
2. I didn't want to ruin a party for him by saying that
3. Next time I was about to see him was after Christmas holidays since we are in the middle school. 

I ended up deciding that the best will be to wait after Christmas. 

New year's Eve came and we met at the party. Everything was going normal untill we got drunk. We were at our mutual friend's cottage. The girl was there with some others as well. 
The more we got drunk the closer we were getting together (me and the girl). We were hitting on each other entire night... Some intimate things happened. Nothing that serious tho and after she left my friend confronted me. He said he noticed how I was hitting on her since he told me his secret. It is not true. I truly tried to step away and I tried to give him some space. We got in a dispute. He told me he was trying to to undermine me in front of her for entire time I knew his secret. He told me I was doing the same. Only thing I was doing was cracking some jokes. I always do that, I say something that I find funny about someone. It wasn't meant to be embarrassing. The thing is that if I intentionally embarrassed my close friend in front of a girl he likes I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

(He even confessed to her in an awful way thst night. He yelled that he loves her so loudly that everyone could hear him. I was trying to stop him from doing anything stupid entire night when I was around... After he confronted me I knew why he didn't listen. He thought that I am a betrayer.)

He then proceeded to call me names. I was talking with him about an hour and I tried to cheer him up, then he went to sleep. Next day he acted pretty normally. We talked about his awful things that had happened that night. He seemed fine. I was thinking that he realized he exaggerated things and we will br fine. I tried to not bring up anything that could hurt him.

The day after I texted him if he is feeling okey. If he was feeling fine. He coldly replied that everything is ""fine"" and that I shouldn't care. 
I texted him afterwards a lot. He doesn't respond. He just reads the message and leaves it without any answer. 

My point of view was that he doesn't own her. I have feeling, he has feelings and she has feelings as well. If she likes him then hell it doesn't matter who intervenes.
I like her a lot. I did for a long time. I am extremely closed about anything revolving my feelings. That's why I hadn't told him earlier.

I normally would be able to put all these things aside. I was drunk. I liked her a lot. Conversation was flowing. She was hitting on me. I was hitting on her. 


I am sorry for my grammar. I am tired, bit depressed and I can't tell this to anyone I know. I would hurt him even more.

722,"Long story short, I went into my very first relationship last year, which lasted for only 2 months. I fell in love for that motherfucker (or for the image I had for him, at least). He kept telling me cold weather made him sad because it made him remember his ex's suicide (1 year ago, 1 year relationship).
I was going through depression at the time and, when I told him about my problems (I told them a bit too early and and little bit in too much detail) he wanted to stop talking to me because I was too ""immature"" (which was true, but fixable) and whined about my ""not so problems"" (true to an outsider, not to how I perceived them). 
He literally told me before we broke up ""I don't care about you, you don't care about me, you just wanted to get laid, and that's it"" and that I ""annoyed him"". To give some insight, I'm an overthinker and tend to treat things too systematically without realizing, and the ""problems"" that annoyed him was why I sometimes felt like ""X"" and all. 
I know, sounds stupid, why the fuck would I stay with someone like this that even ignores my messages? I don't know. I remember him crying to movies and I feel terrible for him, I feel sympathy for his pain. 
I don't think it's smart to stay with someone that doesn't care about you and I don't think I would even if me and him wanted too (it would hurt me too much now, not so responsible), but I can't stop having disturbing nightmares, I can't stop remember him crying. Any advice?",03Jan2020,1

I toured apartments yesterday, and I narrowed it down to two. One is less nice (cabinets, aesthetics, amenities) but the area is quieter and more peaceful (less traffic). I checked out the yelp reviews and they’re pretty positive right now—  there was a recent management change and they’re refurbishing all the units— but older ones complain of roaches. 

The other is extremely nice as far as cabinets, aesthetics, and amenities, but the location isn’t prime. This one *is* a gated community, but the yelp reviews say the management is terrible, roaches, and that the place is a joke. It’s right across the street from a mini-mall (McDonalds), which I’m told attracts characters at all hours of the night. 

Both are the same price, and both are technically rated an “F” via the crime stats issued by a website I was using. So do I go with the less nice, non gated unit in the quieter area or the nicer, gated unit in the worse area with terrible management reviews.",03Jan2020,2

If it were smaller I could say I ordered shoes or something. But it’s a very big package and I’m not sure how to pass it off! I could definitely get some of his friends involved if needed, but ultimately didn’t send it to another address because of how large it is. 

It comes tomorrow and he won’t be home so I can set it up.",03Jan2020,1
732,"I like him very much and I really want to confess and work things out with him. If I had nothing to worry about my personal life, I would ask him out straight away. However, my personal problems are too high that I can't even keep my own self happy for the moment. So, it would be a waste of time for the both of us. But I am like really in love with him... I know y'all are going to say ""It would be best for you to fogret about him early and focus on yourself and your problems."" I know that's the best thing to do but it's not easy letting go of someone who was so significant to me. Just the thought of not seeing him for a month is making me feel empty. He was what made 2019 so amazing for me. What do I do??",03Jan2020,1

So I' (f29) been talking to this guy (25) and we met this church full of mostly senior citizens.

We decided we while just be friends even though he does like me because I am a Christian and hes not even tho he likes talking about God and the bible with me for hours.

Anyways we've only been talking for 3 weeks and someone always has something to say everytime we talk at church.

One young lady suddenly starts talking to me when I talk to him and she said ""you are a flirt"" to him and another time mentioned that they use to date when we were talking to each other.

The same day at church another girl said she would get pregnant by him when I mention the 3 of us should do bible study together. I asked her later what she meant and she said he has a thing for her. I ask her if he told her that and she said yes. I told him later what she said and he was so shocked he didnt believe me.

Last he saw me sitting by my dad and my mom's friend who likes to call me her niece. He went over to us to say hi to me and them and she looked at him hard and said ""thats my niece"" three times in a stern voice and he had to walk away.

And later that day another older man told him outlined ""you better do the right thing"" in a stern voice. When he saw us talking.

And he told me even the pastor walked up to told him ""Im watching you"" to him regarding me.
.
 have more stories, but this post is long enough.

Im kind if worried because I think my friend is going to stop going to church because of the way all these Christians are treating him.
Im trying to show him Christianity is the right way but everyone is making it hard.

What do I do?",03Jan2020,2

736,"I’ve been working part time at my Dads law firm while I’m in college. There’s this woman that works as a secretary there she’s older than I am she’s 39 and I’m 27. 

I find myself attracted to her she’s beautiful inside and out. 
I finally got up the nerve to ask her out for dinner after work and she shot me down so fast my head spun. I didn’t even get the whole sentence out of my mouth before she said “I don’t date people I work with” 

I can deal with rejection what I can’t deal with is the fact that I noticed her car parked outside my dads house at 6 AM on a Saturday when the office is closed and he doesn’t even work at the law firm anymore he just owns it. Barely makes an appearance but maybe once a month. 

So I asked him about why her car was parked outside his house and he gave me some BS line about her bringing something he left at the office before he finally admitted that they’ve been seeing each other for the past 4 years! She’s been working there for 4 years and he’s only been retired for 1 year. So much for not dating people you work with right. 

I don’t know why it makes me so upset that my dad got the girl. To be honest this is the first woman my dad has actually dated in years. 
He explained to me that he has very strong feelings for her and I don’t want to mess that up for him but now that I know about it. It makes it hard to work with her knowing she’s sleeping with my dad. 
Not a lot of people know about the relationship my dad is a very secretive person he likes for his personal life to stay personal it’s always been that way. 

How do you keep a secret relationship for 4 years from everyone? How have I just caught on obviously this is the first time her car has been openly parked outside his house because I pass by every morning as I only live a block away. It’s all so confusing and I don’t know what to do or say I feel so awkward around both of them because I asked her out she told me know then my dad comes out to me about his feelings which he doesn’t do at all. 
I’m afraid if I leave it alone I’ll end up resenting my dad. He’s a good guy and deserves to be happy. But I can’t shake the feeling of coming in second to my 50 year old father. Advice?",03Jan2020,2

739,"Hi all,

I recently got a drone for Christmas, a Ryze Tello. A little bit of info on it to provide context for the rest of the post, it's powered by a lithium-ion battery that slots into the body of the drone (with a plastic cover, [this](https://shop.makerfire.com/products/fullymax-1100mah-3-8-v-li-po-battery-for-dji-tello-rc-quadcopter-drone-battery-pack-of-2) exact battery).

Anyway, I was test-flying it and accidentally flew it into a wall. Don't ask, I'm clumsy. Anyway, the drone still works, but I noticed that the battery fell out on impact and landed on the floor. It fell at most a meter, isn't visibly damaged and isn't warmer than usual, but I was wondering if any of the more tech-savvy people on the sub would know if it's safe to use this battery and keep it around or should I dispose of it and get a new one?

I normally wouldn't be worried about this sort of thing, it's just that I've heard of lithium-ion batteries exploding and going on fire before and would rather not have an explosion or fire on my hands. Also, this happened around half an hour ago in case that's relevant info.",03Jan2020,1

I don’t know that I’ve ever messed with someone so well. He’s not set on the move (understandably). It’s a big jump and a lot to invest in someone he’s only been seeing for 4-5 months.

743,"So over the course of the last two years I’ve lost many friendships. Some of them weren’t that great, but I still feel really bad about how it all ended. Sometimes my temper gets the best of me and I react poorly to things. Just for context here’s the friendships I’ve lost: I lived with a girl one summer in her grandmas home. At the beginning she told me I didn’t have to pay rent. This was because I was trying to escape my toxic home at my parent’s.Then we adopted two kittens together. At the end of my stay I figured out that her boyfriend was slowly taking ownership of my kitten. He took both kittens to his apartment and I never saw mine again. When I confronted her and asked her for at least my $200 back that I spent on my kitten she obliged, but then later ordered me that before I left I had to give her $300 for rent, which I did. Later over text, I told her how I really felt, and afterwards she turned everybody against me, including another good friend of mine, who then accused me of being a bad friend. I also had another friend at the time who used to always tell me what she did for me and then expect that I always be there for her (I knew she was there for me a lot). And I always felt bad that I ended up disappointing her. When I came over she liked to redo my makeup and change my clothes, and I realized in the end make me look more like her. After I left a mental hospital for suicide attempts, she came over to my house the morning after I got out saying we needed to talk. When I asked her if it could be another time she said no and that we had to talk immediately. What she told me took me a year to get over: I was so hurt. But basically I had been a bad friend lately and let her down. And that I use my mental Illness as an excuse to gain attention and get what I want. My depression went worse after that. When I told my ex at the time what she did he seemed to side with her and hung out with her behind my back even when I asked him if he could remove her from his life and stand up for me, the way all the other boyfriends of my ex friends had when I reacted badly to their girlfriends. He said no at the time and also told me I was selfish and only thought about myself. That I didn’t understand his mental illness/behaviors. Eventually I lost him too. Now a few days ago I lost two really good friends and I’m completely down and horribly upset. I invited my two friends to my graduation lunch and afterwards we all hit it off and started hanging out together as a group of 3. One day we went shopping at Victoria’s Secret and it was funny when me and my girl friend were asking our guy friend which colors looked bad or good. When I found out that they had been secretly hooking up behind my back I felt completely betrayed and also disgusted that I had to actually see them talk about which underwear she’d look good in when at the time it felt more like a joke but now when I look back on it, it makes me uncomfortable and I wish they had done that privately together because it felt too intimate while I was there. Later, my parents and I got into a bad fight in the middle of the night so when I left the house I texted her if I could stay over and when she told me she already had plans I knew it was only so that she could hook up with my guy friend. When I told her I was done with the friendship and couldn’t handle it anymore and how I really needed her help after what happened, she told me that I’m a “manipulative little cunt,” that I have a victim mentality, and I’m selfish. I know I shouldn’t have told her that for all the times I had been there for her (listening to her on phone calls and offering advice) that I had wished she could help me this one time when I really needed it. After I apologized to how I reacted I tried explaining the situation in that I felt I had no where to go, I was stressed, I was handling things poorly, and I hadn’t taken my medicine, they only saw those as excuses and wouldn’t accept my apology. They kept arguing with me every time I said how I felt even when I acknowledged that I messed up. Now they’ve written me off completely. Maybe those things my friends and ex had said about me is true. And I’m starting to wonder if they really are. Because when I look back on these friendships I think about my hurt but not about how maybe I hurt the other person by my reactions? I wonder if I am a good person. If I do use my mental illness as an excuse. I feel so bad about myself. I want to change. I don’t want to keep losing friends and being blamed for my poor behavior. I can’t stop thinking about this and it haunts me every day and in my dreams how I feel so bad for hurting anyone, and that maybe they might be trying to talk about me behind my back still. When really I already feel so much pain and I want to be forgiven and offered a second chance, but I know that’ll never happen. I don’t want to continually go through life messing up relationships and friendships so if I do have a role in it, I need it pointed out to me so that I can change for the better. What advice do you have? Is everything my fault? Am I a bad person?",03Jan2020,0
744,"yeah it is pretty long story.
It started one year ago. My close friend Mike started to date with a girl named Stella that i didn't use to talk with.[We all 16 year old highschool students]

After a while I and Stella got closed , we started to talk much. She told me all about her relationship problems. We were friends but Mike wasn't happy about that he got jeaolus for no reason. And then he started to treat me like shit. He had never spoken with me about that.

And I listened her relationship problems like 10 months and then they broke up.She was never happy though. 

And the breaking point now. I realized that i started to feel something for her. 2 weeks from the break up she said she is going to find new flirt. That time i started argument for no reason. On that days i couldn't even confess to myself that i have feelings for this girl. We didn't talk about 5 days.We couldn't stand seperate and it's also her saying too. I am one of her closest friends. We got that closer that everyone around us thought we were dating. She really cares about me and we have a great relationship. And then i found out she is talking with her twice ex*.Now they are dating. It has been 3 weeks. Everyone around me is blaming me because they think i stole my close friend's ex. Stella wants to keep it as a secret so everyone still thinks we are dating even if I tell them we are only friends. And as you can imagine Mike is really mad at me. Sadly we are not talking anymore.

The weird part is we are still that close. I don't know that she is using me as a bandage or not. I think i can't stand this any longer so i decided to express all of my feelings and tell her if we can't be gf and bf we can't be friends anymore. I know she has a bf right now and If I tell my feelings to her, she might get hurt but I cannot stop thinking about it otherwise. Help me what am i supposed to do?",03Jan2020,1
745,"My bestfriend and I were classmates during 9th and 10th grade but we weren't that close. We only talked through facebook chat in 11th grade (our current grade). We became really close because she like memes and I also like memes. We had the same personality so I really treated her dearly. She is an ABM student and I took HUMSS so we got separated. 

At the start of the year I had a crush with this guy in my class. He's really cool, funny, smart and he also even love memes. I'm an introvert and I'm super shy so when he told me once in a group debate (we were discussing how we could defend our side) after I finished sharing my thoughts (you see I'm a competitive person so I spoke with force)   he said to me ""Hey, chill. You seem like an interesting person to talk with"". That's when I confirmed that I had a crush with him. 

He added my social media accounts,  I also discovered that he also likes Pewdiepie, he would make things to catch my attention, chat with me, hold my hand, stare at me jokingly, he even used my name for roleplays, so I thought that he also had a crush on me. 

That's how I shared it to my BFF. She didn't believe me when I told her that I think my crush likes me. Instead she messed up my posts on any social medias, she would comment and give hints (like comment his initial J. B. B) or just comment something about me having crushes. 

Then she told me that he added her (this is on facebook) she accepted and that's when all shit started. She'd tell me that he would always react to her memes (he reacts to mine sometimes). Then I discovered that they were already chatting. At school he stopped noticing me and I discovered that what he was doing for me are all the same things he did for every girl in our class. 

My BFF and I stopped talking but I'd see them flirting on the comments section. I got jealous, I felt angry, and I felt ugly. I stopped talking both of  them. 

One day she chatted me that she's sorry,  she knows that he's my crush but she also likes him. She knows that I'm angry but they're together now. 

My world shattered, I felt betrayed. I know that I don't have any right to be jealous but I can't help myself. 

Please help me see things differently. Should I talk to her again?",03Jan2020,1

Since I know this world my mother worked so hard to let me stand where I'm now. My father works hard but the thing is he doesn't care for the situation until it becomes out of hands. I love them both and so do they. 


I am in final year of my graduation(btech biotechnology) and want to pursue higher education. Recently we are in debts due to my father carelessness and my parents are asking me to do job after my six months study from now. Doing job and clearing debts won't be a problem which happens in three or four years but we have to sell the house and start from beginning after all what they have constructed for years. That's one situation I'm in. 


My parents are foreseeing the future and asking me to continue job for the rest of my life because as for the culture I'm in they marry at 26-30 age. When I asked my mother that I want to do PhD she said it will be late for my marriage, I didn't speak. I don't want to hurt them because I know how hard they worked to send me to schools and good engineering college and all.

747,"Hi...first time posting and only after reading some other posts here thought I might find some good suggestions because I feel like I’m at wits end.

I (46f) am having a difficult time w my brother (44). This has been going on for some time and hard to summarize but I’ll try .... he goes in and out of moods, sometimes he’s good, great even and then it’s like he does a complete 180 and he gets nasty with me, accuses me of the weirdest things - and they all have to do w me (according to him) ’screwing his life’. For example, over holidays all was fine we had a nice Christmas dinner, gifts, laughs and all. Two days later he sends me loooooooooonnnnggggg texts (I mean NOVELS) talking about how I am going behind his back and talking about him with family here, family overseas, friends we went to high school with...he thinks I ask people in our old neighborhood to tell me stuff about him so I can feed to other people.  Thing is, I absolutely do not do this, I don’t live in the same area (for the last 18yrs), I’m a grown woman with a job a son a life and he goes on like we are teenagers still and im running around talking about him and spreading rumours. His accusations are so ridiculous it makes me think he is either on serious drugs or he has mental issue I’m unaware of.   
sorry this sounds Crazy jumbled up how I’m typing it out but I feel upset and it’s so crazy ridiculous it has started to make me feel like I’m going crazy. We are a small family. My parents are in their 80s and not in best health. i don’t tell them anything as to not upset them.

ive tried all different approaches with my brother: telling him truth that I don’t do these things, I’ve cried I’ve begged him to stop, I’ve told him to F off I’ve not spoken with him for 2 yrs.... nothing gets through to him. Now I just ignore because I can’t let it upset me but I just don’t know what the hell this is. Is he bipolar? note: can’t tell my brother he needs help or anything like that as he then says he’s smarter than all of us and Goes into a fit 

just typing this out it sounds so ridiculous.....and this is just a fraction of the last 18-20yrs of this

NOW with my brother it’s kind of different. he’s has some issues in the past with lying (as little kids do) and whenever he would tell my mom something she wouldn’t believe it and now that he’s older, he doesn’t trust her or tell us anything or he says he’s emotionless and doesn’t give a shit about how anyone feels or he’s remorseless and very blunt. not the constructive criticism blunt, the blunt that’s mean and deconstructive and doesn’t go anywhere. im sorry i’m rambling but i’m getting to the point. now i love my brother to death because he’s my only sibling but that’s the one thing that irritates me about him - he doesn’t share how he feels because he’s a “man” and then he’s just straight up rude whenever my mom asks him to do a simple task, you know how parents as you to go to the store and stuff and he’ll be like “why don’t you go to the store? why don’t you go get it?” like why are you being so difficult !!! and then he gets mad and blames her hating him when he doesn’t get what he wants when he doesn’t get what he wants because he’s so disrespectful. i also hate getting in the middle of their arguments because it feels like they want me to pick sides and i just feel closer in and trapped and i want the best for both of them but i can’t help either. like today my brother pissed my mom off because he was driving them recklessly in my car, aka over the speed limit and all that, and then he said “on god i’ll kill us both” AND WHO TF SAYS THAT?? and then he told her he doesn’t need her that he has me... like no offense yes you’re my brother but i don’t have the means to take care of us both. i’m not your parent. and i feel so guilty when i don’t give him money when he asks so i end up giving him money anyway which i don’t have a lot of money as it is but i have a job and he doesn’t and it’s just tearing me in two like what tf do i do it’s my money but god. he also claims that i’m the favorite child and get everything but the thing is i’ve never asked my mom for anything; she’s bought way more for him and spent more time with him than me because she was actually INVESTED in his childhood. i had to be a mini adult during my childhood and help take care of him. she went to his school activities and did stuff with him and i had no one; i understood she had to be with him more because he was younger but i’ll never forget not really having a childhood. if anything he would be the favorite because he’s spoiled and essentially got anything he wanted when he was younger and even now when he’s not disrespectful but yea. i have a job and buy my own shit because i don’t want to ask my mom for anything now. anyway i’m so sorry for this being long as hell but my question basically is: how do i get my brother to stop playing the victim card and treat my mom with respect?",03Jan2020,5

I want your guys opinion on the issue and how you would feel if you were in my shoes.

In september of 2018, I went to a friends birthday party. I am not a heavy drinker nor do i smoke. However, that night i had maybe half a glass of punch which was no where near the amount to get me blacked out/unconscious. I am 6'4 and 230 lbs so that is usually a minor buzz for me. My friends who drank more that night who usually do get blacked out, did not either. That night after drinking a half a glass of punch, i do not recollect much afterwards. I know i a few things here and there but the later part of the night is completely dark to me. I woke up in some girl's bed, and she started telling me what had happened. She also told me that she took off the condom because i was not getting hard. I was so upset because this was my the first time i felt so helpless and in such a uncontrolled situation. I also had a girlfriend at that time, which was also on my mental. That night i met up with the girl i slept with and asked her if she got pregnant, if she would keep the baby and she said yes because she does not believe in abortion and also that she was a christian. After talking to her a good bit, she finally agreed to take plan b. She bought the plan b and took it in front of me and also told me that she missed her birth control pills that weekend. I didn't think much of her getting pregnant but i was more concerned about STD's. Fast forward to december of 2019, i went on her IG page and saw she stopped posting full body pics after february (which concerned me). I hit her up and she told me that she never had a kid and never got pregnant, but how can i trust this since she did so much sketchy stuff to me? So i asked her for a picture of her in may, which would be around 8/9 months. She did not want to provide it. I just feel so traumatized by this situation and wanted closure so i can move on with my life. I don't want her coming back and telling me i have a kid with her. I just feel sad and helpless. I had no intentions of hooking up with her, and i just feel like im not able to move past this. I don't want any consequences from it because i never gave consent to any of this. If i was in the right state of mind, as a man i would definitely take responsibility for my actions. What can i do to get over this? Should i trust her ? Should i seek a private investigator? I just want closure...",03Jan2020,1

This story is about a coworker of mine. 

She’s young, just graduated high school last year. She due in a few months, probably 2-3 months. Her family isn’t super wealthy: 5 people living in a 3 bedroom house in the more “ghetto” side of town. She lives in a renovated backyard shed. She doesn’t seem close with her family. When I asked her how she planned work after her delivery and she said that if her mom HAD to watch the kid, she probably would; she wasn’t sure. 

Her baby daddy is in a relationship with her, but is legally married to someone else. I honestly don’t think he’s ready to step up to the plate. According to my coworker, he drinks a lot. 

They are both super excited about the baby, but I honestly think the bf will either not step up to the plate, become an issue like becoming abusive or spending too much money on booze, or cheat. She doesn’t have a lot of money and has almost nothing in her savings, around $300, I’d say.

FIL owns a generational applicant store and claims to just barely be making ends meet and has for awhile. Last month, right before Christmas, he his son, my fiancé; to buy a stove because he “needed a payday”.

A month later, his mother wants him to drive her  a state away to get yet another dog she won’t have anything to do with, once it’s not a puppy anymore.
This problem right here is essentially why she has 7 kids. She loved having babies but, had almost no real interest once they were not babies anymore.
Her uterus became cancerous and at one point had it removed and ever since has been buying exotic birds and puppy’s as a fix; wil hi how I’m certain now is bleeding FIL dry.

When she asked fiancé to drive her a state over to buy a puppy, my fiancé asked his dad “if he knew about it?”
And now, they are both upset with him and are not going to talk to him for awhile.

Fiancé is struggling and thinking he made a mistake and should have done things differently but I have been trying to reassure him he hasn’t done anything wrong.

Any advice?",03Jan2020,1
763,"Hi all,

I’m (23F) a university student, currently studying PSCI and aspiring to become an attorney in the next five years. I have horrible taste in men. So much so that during parties the topic tries to become part of the conversation. 

Since my last relationship, I have been in counseling and have been able to identify what I do and don’t want in a man. I’m also being more strict on my red flags. 

That being said, I met a young attorney. He’s a romantic and handsome guy. He takes interest in the doing things I want to do and overall he’s a very sweet guy. 

We went on a coffee date followed by a walk under the Dallas Christmas light show and then off to a bar street well known as the “gayborhood.” I was surprised at how well acquainted he was in that area knowing multiple staff, and locals. The bars consist mostly of gay men. Some of which gave their friends weird looks after greeting him.  We went to five bars and continued to get greeted by many, even as we walked the street. We said goodbye with a hug. 

I am unsure of how to approach the question because although the gayborhood is fun, it wasn’t the nearest bar and he disguised it as so. 

He keeps trying to set another date. 

I don’t know how to ask the question because I am uncomfortable with making anyone feel out of place with themselves. I don’t want to hurt the image he thinks others may have of him. 

It just doesn’t make sense that he knows that many people in all the bars without being a regular.

Question: How do I approach this with him?",03Jan2020,0

I've tried everything I could think of: the official desinfectant bottle, salted water on a cotton bud, anti inflammatory cream, iodine and soaking for 20 min in cooked salty water. Only that last one really helped, but not for long. And to be honest, soaking twice a day is really time consuming and I can't always fit it into my schedual.

776,"I (17M) haven\`t had any sexual desires for the last half year, and can\`t get hard anymore when i watch porn. The last time i was horny was when i was on vacation, but i didn\`t act on it. Right now, my dick can only get floppy hard. And when i wake up in the morning my penis isn\`t fully erect anymore. I also have a sensitive penis head, because i am uncut, but i am treating that right now, it used to be painful to touch but it isnt that bad anymore. During my early teens i could easily get erect by watching gay porn, but now i can\`t anymore. I have tried watching straight and bisexual, and homemade porn but nothing works.  I thought that maybe i couldn't get hard because i havent had many experiences yet and so i didn\`t know how good it would feel.

And thus this afternoon i had sex with a guy, and i could get hard again, but not to the point that i could cum. And after about half an hour it got soft again. 

I have searched on the internet, and it told me that i probably have low testosterone, but i am still in puberty and i exercise and eat healthy? Some websites said that i could be asexual but that isn\`t right either because i have been horny before and have had boners before. Do i have erectile dysfunction? Or am i overreacting?

Ever since we started living together, I would be hyper aware of things he does and I feel like I’m being a bit too clingy sometimes. Like I’ll find myself trying to look at his phone when he has a notification or when we’re out, catch him looking at other girls.

Now I wouldn’t say I have low self esteem. I think I’m not ugly or fat but I do think I need to tone up. I’ve always been confident and I love looking pretty and dressing up but as I’ve mentioned, I’ve caught him looking at girls a couple times and although some might argue that it could just be a normal reaction, it still affects me.

He is kind and sweet and I confronted him about it and he explained that sometimes he just happens to look at people but that doesn’t mean he wants to do something with them or anything which I understand because I look at other people too but just admire them.

However, it affects me and lately, I’ve found myself looking at the mirror and just hating myself. Like I would notice my blemishes more than I ever have, pinch my tummy, or just not be happy. I think that maybe I’m not pretty enough or hot enough or that I’m not giving him enough but I know that’s not the case.

Please don’t be negative. I just want advice on how to start loving myself more again because I seem to have forgotten how I got to a place where I was really confident about myself.

785,"So two weeks ago there was heavy rain and that caused the roof to leak - my bedroom had very minor leak that did not cause any damage besides the ceiling having wet spots. The maintenance manager came into to check and helped me schedule a fix order to remove and replace the interior ceiling - also assuring me that my room’s furniture will all be covered and protected while the repair takes place. Fast forward to yesterday when I came home I saw my bedroom was barely covered - just a small sheet of plastic covering a small portion of my bed and everything else from the pillows to the desks were all covered in dirt and dust from the ceiling repair. The repairman even asks to use my vacuum. I told him to leave and immediately contacted the apartment manager. He is shocked and comes to my apartment along with the maintenance manager - both apologizing and contacting the company they hired for the repair. They said that they hired a substitute repairman since their main guy was sick. They also promised to make sure the rest of the repairs will be done by another person and that they will help vacuum and clean.

Me, him, and another person (also 16m, let's call him John) have been friends ever since elementary school, and none of us really have any social skills so we were all we had for around 8 years. After moving, he became distant towards me and John, and blew us off whenever we wanted to talk or play video games together, the three of us. It's been about a month since he moved and Nate had just been getting further and further from us. Yesterday, he texted me, saying a snide comment about something I said in the group chat. I asked him when he was going to snap out of it and talk to us instead of ghosting us all the time. There was back and forth arguments until I told him,

""just tell me if you even want to talk anymore. I'm tired of this being one sided, and you not giving me a solid answer."" 

That wasnt exactly what I said, but it has the main idea. Since I wrote that about 12 hrs ago, he hasn't responded, and at the time, I didnt think I was unreasonable, but the more I think about it, the more I think I'm the wrong.

789,"Background Info:
So, my sister (let’s call her Amy) is in university and lives in a city out of town. She is renting the middle and upper floor of a house with two of her friends in college. There are other students renting the basement, but they aren’t with my sister and her friends so they weren’t paying together. 

Here’s where the problem starts:
Their landlord (let’s call her Justine) apparently had them sign a contract that required them to pay for the electricity bill of the whole building (upper, middle, and bottom floors).
The people living in the ground floor (also university students) were apparently offered to rent the place without having to pay for the electricity, because guess what? It’s already being paid for by other tenants.

Of course, my parents went ballistic when they heard of this because we aren’t the richest family and money wasn’t something to be spent sparingly. They say that regardless of the signed contract, they shouldn’t be paying for other people’s bills.

One of my sister’s friends talked to an advisor and said that they are legally in the wrong and that, before they go to ORT, they should resolve things with the landlord privately because it would cost a lot of money and time with all the court sessions.

My parents did not think this was a good advice at all.

Now, I’ve been to my sister’s place, and I saw that they didn’t have much stuff because they’re trying to be frugal. It was almost empty compared to our house. The ones in the basement, obviously aren’t because they’re not the ones paying.

What should we do?

TL;DR: My sister and her friends signed a contract that made them pay for the electricity bill of the tenants in the basement.",03Jan2020,2

I got a text from Andra yesterday and she was asking how my Christmas was. Yadda yadda, then we talk about making plans to get together for dinner and drinks, and she tells me she can't wait to give me my Christmas present. I suddenly realize I didn't get her anything and have no clue what to get!

795,"I'm 37 (f). My stepdad has been in my life since I was 16. We had a really bad realationship when he and my mom got together. I hated his guts untill I moved out from home.
He has a son, my stepbrother, who's 6 months younger than me, who I don't have a close realationship with, as he lives on the other side of the country.
I've grown to love my stepdad though, especially because he is the absolute BEST granddad to my daughter.
Right before christmas I gave him a small keychain that said ""thanks for being the dad you didn't have to be"". Just because I have never really told him how much I actually care and appreciate him. He took me aside and told me, that he had wanted to adopt me for a long time. Because if he should die, he wants me to inherit as well as his son. I was caught off guard and said I had to think it over, but that I was very touched by the sentiment.
I really want him to adopt me. Both from a purely financial point (my mom is quite a bit younger and I wouldn't inherit nearly anything from her), but also because he is more dad to me, than my real dad has ever been.

But! 
I have a real dad. He's in a sorry state, depressive,  never had A job, lives in a 1 room appartment where he sits and smokes all day. But he is my dad though and I make an effort to see him every couple of months, because he really wants a realationship with my daughter (his only grandchild) and be the kind of ""father"" that he never was to me. I'm afraid it will crush him if he somehow finds out that my stepdad has adopted me.
Same goes for my stepbrother. He and I aren't close, but he doesn't have children, and he and my daughter are very close. I'm afraid of his reaction. Me being adopted would mean that he would share the inheritance (and there is quite a huge amount of money). I have never ever asked for money or taken anything for granted, whereas my stepbrother imported a wife, bought and renovated an appartment in the middle of the capital, all for his fathers money. So having to share would not sit nicely with him.

What to do?

799,"I'll admit that I have been the cause of most of my own problems. Anxiety, procrastination and poor time management have caused me to miss a lot of important career and personal development milestones. A bright mind in high school, I got into a top tier university and immediately began to flounder as I struggled to meet deadlines or remain focused on any subject for very long. It ended up taking me almost eight years to complete a four-year degree in History, which was the only subject which I consistently enjoyed studying, but honestly I have very little interest in pursuing as a career in teaching or academia. Now I'm back at home, living with my parents, looking at my looming 30s and wondering if I'm ever going to get myself out of this hole.

My greatest strength is my skill at writing. It's something that I've been cultivating for a long time and been consistently praised for--even in rejection letters I have been told that my writing is phenomenal, but I'm not a good fit for such-and-such reasons, etc.

Unfortunately, the most valuable secondary skills for writing are exactly the ones I lack most. Time management, consistent work ethic, self-motivation are all things which I have tried and failed to cultivate, again and again and again and again. I can do good work when someone tells me exactly what to do and how to do it, but it seems to me that any idiot can do that, and they don't need ""Exceptional written communication skills"" on their resume to do it. I've had a handful of marketing and copy writing internships in the past, and felt like a complete failure in all of them, as I was once again unable to complete my assignments on time, and felt creatively empty doing it. I hate marketing. It makes me feel like a con man.

So now I'm stuck. Marketing is the biggest game in professional writing, but I don't like it and I'm not good at it. Everything else seems too nebulous and inaccessible; I hardly even know where to start to look. I've tried writing novels and short stories on my own time, but again my struggles with motivation and time management held me back, and now I've got a dozen half-finished rough drafts and nothing to show for any of it. Even if I did, making a career as a self-published author is about as big a pipe dream as any. I just want something that I can do good work in and feel good about. More importantly, I want money, so I can finally move out of my childhood bedroom and get started on my life.

What do I do? Where do I start? I'm sorry if the question is too ambiguous, but I've been feeling very ambiguous for a very long time, and it's eating me alive.",03Jan2020,2

A few months ago, everything just started to feel like it was falling apart. Honestly, it might have been longer but this was as far back as I can remember really feeling not like myself.

My uncle died. The people who I consider to be my friends rarely contact me. A paper that I was working on to get published, got withdrawn. While my grades turned out okay, I felt that I mismanaged my time by putting in so much effort to that paper and ended up hurting myself in my finals. I had a boyfriend at the time, but we broke up on NYE and while I was feeling this way before, I just feel like a complete failure now.

I have work that I need to do for my thesis advisor but I don't feel motivated to do anything. I don't want to eat, watch TV, do work, anything. I feel as if I'm just going through the motions of living and not actually living. My ex-boyfriend and I are trying to remain friends for now and he's encouraging me to keep going and has been saying that I have the potential to do great things and everything, but I just feel like I'm nothing. I usually am, what I consider to be, very strong and lately I've felt like I've lost control of my life. I'm making simple mistakes at work and feel like I'm stepping on eggshells all the time, no matter the situation.

I am aware that I have some underlying issues and am working on finding and receiving help. 

But my question is, should I take a break? 

I don't want to wait much longer to tell my thesis advisor if I do because I would rather not hurt that connection. My undergraduate research professor put in such a great word for me and I don't want to let him down. But I feel like I'm drowning.

I think I should continue getting my MS (Master's of Science; classes with thesis). However, maybe it's time to switch to ME (Master's of Engineering; only classes) and just focus on getting a job? I'm not sure and would really like some insight to this matter. I don't really have a large amount of people that I could speak to and so I decided that posting here may be the best choice.

811,"Earlier today, I (17M) was going through our giant stack of mail on the counter after finding something from November of 2019 addressed to me at the top of the stack, so I investigated for more things addressed to me. 

(Side note: mail is very important for me right now as I'm waiting for letters from colleges at the moment)

After finding about 10 things addressed to me, I saw a yellow envelope addressed to my mom (36F) with a ""FINAL ATTEMPT"" notice on the front. 

This made me fairly uneasy due to my mom's history with credit and collections (having filed for bankruptcy only a few years ago).

The letter was from a PO box, which after a quick search, I found was from a Payday loan company. 

This has created an extremely anxious situation because of a few realizations:

A) My mom very rarely opens her mail, therefore only making her situation worse

B) She has fallen back into borrowing money, which I thought she had stopped

830,"I turned 16 last month, and in the mail half hour ago I received some papers to fill out asking that, if I ever die I can choose to donate my organs if they’re still useable.

My first instinct was automatically yes, because I’ve read how much people need organs and even though I don’t really want my body touched when I die, it’s something that if I can help people then I will help people.

My parents aren’t those kinds of people tho, especially my mother. I told her about it and she got all defensive, telling me not to and that she’s against it. Apparently she doesn’t believe in it and “it’s against her religion” (Roman Catholic) which is largely hypocritical of her because she only uses that excuse when it benefits her. When it doesn’t (for example she’s a huge smoker and therefore putting something that could kill you inside your lungs I’m pretty sure is very much not allowed) she really doesn’t care about it.

I know ultimately it’s my decision, but she starts getting all emotional, I think because if we have to start talking about what we’re gonna do when we die, she has to come with the realization that some day I will die.

I want to donate to people in need, but I also want to respect her wishes even if it’s my own body.

834,"So it's been a year and a half since I've graduated from high school, and this girl whom was a grade lower than me makes me sure that she had a crush on me. I want to reconnect with her again because she seemed like a nice person and I wanted to get to know her better, I also lowkey liked her back, but at the time I had other things in mind and I was busy with school.

We've only had one long conversation but I didn't talk to her a lot, it was more like saying hi in the hallways. The reason why I think she had a crush on me was because of multiple things. One time in class she asked me if she could follow me on Instagram, and we ended up following each other. Another time I was walking home and she came up from behind and said hi, as we were walking home we were having a long conversation about what we wanted to in college and some other minor things I don't remember. After like a month later I was walking home and as I was crossing the street she came out of nowhere and ran up to me and asked me if I could walk her to the train station, but I stupidly enough said that I had to pick up my little brother from school even though unknowingly my mom had already picked him up, it took me a minute later to notice the fuck up I just made. Then on my birthday she posted on my Facebook wall. And that was the last time I had talked to her or interacted with her, it's making me think that she gave up on me or thought I didn't like her back. A few times she would say hi and smile at me in the hallways as well. Most of this happened when I was in grade 11 cause that was when I met her, idk if this matters cause I didn't have any classes with her in grade 12.

Is it weird for me to try to reconnect with her again via social media? I have zero expectations and I would be pretty happy if at least we become friends. I have her as friends on Facebook and I also follow her on Instagram, we always like each other's posts too. I'm thinking of sending a simple message like ""hey remember me?"" or somethin along those lines. What do you guys think? Should I do it?

I'm a 21 years old female from Belgium and I'm currently studying Biomedicine in uni. I was a high school dropout and fell into depression over and over. (I was diagnosed with PTSD) I even did a suicide attempt before being taken care of by a psychiatrist.

(Sorry for my bad English)",03Jan2020,1
836,"I’ve been posting quite a bit about my mother, and I figured there’s always more and more to post about, so thats what I’m doing.

My mom makes a big fuss over a lot of things that I do and say, most of which there’s no point in her getting so mad at me for and I don’t understand what her problem is. I’ll share a couple examples below:

1. I had just met a black man who had worked for my dad the other day. He was very, very polite and kind, far more than probably anyone I had ever met. I decided to tell my mom about him, and I said I met Jim and he was a good person and very polite. As soon as she heard me say the words “good person” and “polite”, she started labeling my compliment as racist, and she lectured me for about half an hour and then made me read some online resource. Apparently, it’s racist to call a black person polite. She said I shouldn’t be surprised that black people can be polite, which I was confused about. If anything, I was surprised that any human being is as polite as that man, regardless of whether he’s black or white.

2. I was talking to my aunt the other day and she asked us what it is that my sister specializes in for her social work intern. Knowing nothing about the health or social work area, I didn’t know. My aunt brought up some fancy terms, I think one of them was pediatrician and there were a couple others, I really have no idea. My mom, who is a nurse with a degree in public health, wasn’t there. The next morning I was talking to my mom, and I brought up how aunt was wondering what my sister was specializing in. I told my mom i was unsure but thought it might be pediatrics or gynecology, which I had no idea what either were, and still only have the faintest idea. My mom got so pissed off at me when I said “gynecology”. She said I was making fun of it, I should show it more respect, and that it is a fully competent and good field of health, all the while I still don’t know what it means. I told her I didn’t know what and means and still don’t, and she said that in all her years of nursing she’s never met anyone who doesn’t know what it is and said I was lying about not knowing it. She accused my school, an all-boys private school my parents wanted me to go to, of teaching kids that gynecology was stupid, which I think gave me a little hint as to what gynecology is, because my mother is an avid prolifer whereas my high school is an all-boys Catholic high school. Regardless, she got pissed over me saying that, for whatever reason.

3. I was driving my mom home one day in the car, and she had asked me what I want to do after high school. I told her that I’m not entirely sure, but somehow I want to go to college and then after get a blue-collar job. As soon as I said “blue-collar”, she got pissed off at me once again. She said that the phrase “blue-collar” is derogatory, and I should show more respect to people in skilled trades. She spent a half hour lecturing me on why I shouldn’t have said “blue collar” and why it is am insult. I think part of her also got upset because, with my sister in social work and brother in biomedical engineering, she wanted me to follow suit and get a white collar job.

Along with going after everything I say, I find that my mother has created a narrative that I hate her and that I show her no respect. I believe she sees all the conflict between me and her, which is nearly always caused by her finding some sort of fault in what I say, like I just gave some examples of. I know I probably shouldn’t make her nitpicking and ridiculing turn into conflict, but it always does. In each of these examples above, I’ve asked her what’s wrong and told her I think she’s overreacting... and she doesn’t take that well at all. She says that what I said is rude, disrespectful, and hateful... and I end up just giving up. I apologize even though I can’t really mean it because I don’t really understand what I’m really apologizing for. She then goes on crying and pinning it all on me. I feel terrible for what I’ve done, but I really don’t understand. I wish I did, but I don’t, and I think she may be the problem.

I also feel as though she doesn’t trust me, and I think that’s true for all of my siblings. My father even admits that my mother doesn’t trust anyone. My father says she trusts us to have good intentions, but from my experience, I don’t believe that either. From reading my texts over my shoulder to always asking me what I’m doing on my phone to tracking where I am on my phone, I don’t believe she trusts me at all.

I’ve learned not to engage in political discussions with her, because we disagree on nearly everything, and she calls all of my political views hateful, which leads to arguments and fights. I’ll shut up, and I have, but she always says stuff that in my head I struggle to not laugh at (I know I need to work on that). She told my father that if he voted for a certain political candidate she’d divorce him, and she told me something similar, except of course not a divorce... yet she puts her favorite political stickers in public view in our kitchen and her and my brother constantly talk politics and blast the debates when they’re on or whatever. I feel like it’s hypocritical, but she’s my mom, so I can’t do anything but shut up, and so I do.

It’s come to a point where I try to avoid her. I don’t want to have to, but I don’t see any other option. If I’m around her and I talk chances are she’ll find something I say to fight about, and if I’m around her and I don’t say anything, she accuses me of giving her the silent treatment. 

There was one time, a couple weeks ago, when I was sleeping in the car on the way home, and when we got home we went in side. I said “hi” to my sister who I hadn’t seen yet that day. My mom who was going back out, this time to the store, yelled at me for giving her the “silent treatment” and talking to my sister but not her. For the record, I had talked to my mom that morning, and it ended with my example on the list above where she got upset because I said “gynecology”. I decided I’d be better being quiet for a few minutes, but then fell asleep on the way there and way back. She yelled at me and started crying heavily and slammed the door because of this.

In conclusion, I really don’t know what to do. I need as much advice as y’all can give me, please. Thank you very much! Let me know if y’all need clarification or anything. Thank you.",03Jan2020,0

840,"I started to post this in r/learnart, but I realized that this question could be applicable to nearly anything in life one is trying to accomplish. 

The question itself is relatively straightforward. When you're trying to become good at something you're passionate about, how do you accept that in most cases it takes time (years)? 

In my own case, I mean art. I decided a few years ago that I was going to become serious about learning it, and since then my main focus has been to improve. I admittedly gave up for a while because I felt lost, but in the past few months I've gotten back on track, and I'm feeling much better about it after seeing that I'm definitely better than when I started. 

That brings us to the present. I'm frustrated that I can't produce things at the quality that I'd like. Right now, I'm not happy with what I (try to) create. I've accepted that I'm still learning, and still working on improving; working toward becoming something hopefully great in the future. The, for lack of a better word, crappy, things I draw now are only a step on the long road to greatness. I must produce these bad drawings and pieces so that I can improve and produce beautiful things later. I'm not sure how to properly explain it, but I have a goal, a sort of mental picture of how I'd like to be, what I want what I create to look like, and what the process of creating it will look like. I'm continuously working toward that goal. I spend at least two hours practicing every day in an attempt to improve and continue down that road. When I reach that level of skill, I'm certain that from there I will still be working towards improvement, in fact I'll never stop. I don't really think anyone stops trying to improve in any hobby or skill. 

Anyway, all that to say, I'm growing impatient and having a hard time truly accepting that what I'm doing now is necessary in order to improve and achieve what I want. What if I never reach a level where I'm happy with what I've just created? What if I'm forever stuck, continuously trying to reach something that I never will reach? Am I destined to be at this skill level forever, and should I just quit? Great improvement in most cases takes years, what if I waste years and years trying to become great but never do? What will I do with my life then?

843,"Over the past few years I've pulled myself out of a very dark place and made serious improvements to myself, but through all that I have never being able to earn love, not even just love but the most basic forms of affection or interest, and it's completely undermined me and left me feeling hollow and worthless.

Now I know as a 21 year old that I have a lot of life left to live, but that just fills me with more dread, as I see myself in a future where I am isolated, alone, and without the skills necessary to build a healthy adult relationship, which I feel are in part developed through relationships in our late teens and early twenties. As well as that I feel remorse and self-hatred over missing out on the fun ""young-love"" experience I see my friends go through. Not to say that they are all in long-term, happy, committed relationships, but they have experiences, and the ability to at least try, I feel I am worth nothing and will never have the opportunity to develop as an actual person.

I've tried to take a perspective of personal responsibility, I know that no one owes me anything and the only way that I can be loved is to earn it from others, which has driven me to make considerable improvements on myself, but after all that (losing 4 stone, developing my personal interested and social skills, expanding my social group as much as possible ect.) I feel like I am still at step 0, still completely and totally incapable of love. 

Now friends have told me that of course I'm worthy of love, everyone is, but just because someone deserves love doesn't mean they will ever earn it, its up to them to be good enough. and despite my best efforts, always trying to be the best version of myself, always trying to look my best and feel my best and generally be a fun socialable person, I haven't had any kind of success.

845,"First of all hello! A week ago I went to a birthday party along with a couple of friends. Three of us live in a slightly remote location, so we ordered a taxi. One of us is located on the other side of the neighborhood, so we decided we would drop her first. When we got in the taxi, she gave me a 20 euro banknote, stating that she didn't have less, so I gave her my banknote of 10 euro. All well and good, but it was pretty early in the morning, so there was no traffic of any sort and we reached the destination pretty quickly. It turned out that with she essentially paid for the whole route. It makes me feel pretty bad for her and even if it is not that much money, I owe her. Chances are we aren't gonna meet in the next 1-2 months probably, and even if we did, it would be terribly rude to just hand the money over to her. So in such a scenario, what do you think is the best possible solution to first of all, tell her I owe her, and second - how to return the money without being a jerk?

We went to the doctor and she agreed to refer me to a psychiatrist and therapist and had prescribed me anti-anxiety and depression meds. I was still really angry when we were at the appointment though because the entire time my parent decided they would talk for me and decide what was wrong with me and list off all my negative traits so I sat there and just took it. Once we got the prescribed medication my parent told me that I would not be taking the pills yet until she deemed it appropriate and the psychiatrist said so definitively. Then she proceeded to tell me that she was going to use my prescriptions for the entire month and gave me a sob story about how she was losing sleep and these would help her because she had used them when she was pregnant with me and they worked. I tried to explain that they are used to balance chemicals in your brain so that it would help with mood swings and in TURN aid sleep and bad habits. she refused to listen and told me to shut up and just let her do whatever. This made me very stressed and anxious and later that day I had a breakdown because she was upset that I told her to seriously get assessed before just taking some random medication and that I was worried about her.

853," 

Sooooo lets all wind down because we're about to get intimate. So my left testically has a mild pain to it and a bit sensitive. This started around noon yesterday. Its not really painful its just mildly annoying to walk around with. There's no deformation and if there's a swelling its very minimal. It doesnt look any bigger than usual, no discoloration nada. No other symptoms either, say symptoms that would accompany testicular torsion. Its more along the lines of a sprain and it hasn't really gotten worse in over 24 hours so I guess the question is, have you guys experienced something like this before?

&amp;#x200B;

If it was torsion I would be in much more pain, especially 24+ hours later and none of the symptoms that go with it are produced so that can be ruled out. I was also out in -3C exercising yesterday and it started an hour or so after that so could it be from the cold? The other thing is, is that back when I was a teen I had something similar happen but it was more painful, did go to the doctor, but they found nothing wrong with it and the pain went away a couple days after that. So yeah that's basically the question, have you guys experienced something like this, and if yes, did you find anything that helped make it go away?

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to go look at it but forgot, until I remembered just a few minutes ago. The most recent post was in the suicide watch subreddit and now I am quite concerned.

I know he has been having a hard time lately, for reasons I won't go in to, but me and all our friends have been supporting him the best we can. I am really quite worried about him. We live together and will both be returning back to the house we share next week, so this will help his mood as his parent's house isn't the best place for him.

857,"Hi. I am a 14-year-old girl. I just got out of a relationship where we never talked. We were much better as friends, and we still are. However, a girl who is a friend of a friend (meaning I've never met them in person, just facetime and such), who lives a long 17 hour drive away, is getting really close to me. She is soo perfect for me. BUT. she lives really far away and I am one hour ahead of her. I am worried of being in another relationship where we don't talk, even though that hasn't been and issue yet. Another issue is that I am a person who enjoys to be close to their s.o. a lot, and the fact that I would probably not even meet her in person, until we're older, is hard. especcially since I know that a lot of ""kid"" relationships don't work and are silly.

so back in august 2018 i had ordered something from a company as a christmas present. on their site they had an estimated 6-12 weeks for shipping so i figured it would come a little after christmas anyways. during this time they were very friendly and communicated with us thoroughly on the status of what i ordered. however, once christmas came and went and i still didn’t have what i ordered i got a little worried. around this time i emailed them and they said to expect it around may, so i just accepted that it would take a little while longer. i went on vacation and came back mid july and saw that i still hadn’t received my order, so i messaged them on their instagram account (they stopped replying to emails and phone calls). the owner sent me a long response about how he had just went through chemo and was trying his hardest but it made him really sick so he wasn’t at his best. obviously i believed him and accepted his offer for another 8-10 days until it shipped. 

it is not january 2020 (nearly 16 months after the original order) and i haven’t received anything. they don’t respond to messages on their social media, phone calls, or email. i just want to know what i can do to get my $200 back.",03Jan2020,2

So it comes as a surprise to me that Nicole keeps setting me up with overweight girls. I'm talking overweight in the sense that they're visibly overweight even with clothes on. On the fourth time, I really wanted to just get up and leave the date mid way through because of how pissed I was.

I pulled up Nicole and asked her straight why she is setting me up with fat girls. She got angry at me and said I'm a ""shallow asshole"", now some of my friend circle has taken her side

The way this whole doordash fiasco is set up as my friend's account, his brother putting in the work, and me at the end with fast pay to my bank account so he can get his money back immediately( I get the money he makes and venmo it to him, he gives me like 5 to 13 bucks every time he gets payed which is like 2 to 4 times a week).

i was born into a family of four: my mom, dad, brother, and sister. i remember some memories of him. i remember when he would throw me the biggest parties (he got 2 bouncy houses), but i also remember some disturbing memories like when he would smash plates and get angry. i have pictures of him and our family back then. my mom speaks good about him every time he’s brought up. she says things like “he loved all of you equally” or “he would always spoil you guys” (my sister, brother, and i have different dads. my sister has a good relationship with hers, my brothers dad recently reached out to my mom and wants to have a bond with my brother, but that’s a whole different situation)

i feel kind of left out now, my dad left when my younger sister was about a year old. (we are from the same dad) whenever my little sister brings him up, i tell her some stories, the good ones only. i know he had a business after my name like “[my name][blank]service” and i’ve tried looking it up, but no results. i remember memories from my childhood after my dad was gone like when i asked my mom where he was and she would say “he’s coming on christmas” and he obviously never came. i stopped asking after awhile. the thought never leaves my head, i have come up with some conclusions of my own. one was that he’s in jail (the cops showed up to my house a lot) and the other is that he got overwhelmed and left. i think it’s the first, he was known for being violent.

He says he doesn’t even know why he’s drawn to me but also says he finds me so attractive. My eyes, my nose, my lips are perfect he says.

The thing is,  I don't get it like at all.. I don’t even get jealous when he meets his female model friends and stuff, but I genuinely do not understand why he thinks I’m attractive.

I guess I’ve never thought I'm attractive or even pretty. So i don’t even know how to respond when he says those kind of things to me. I don't seem like I believe what he’s been saying like how come he thinks I’m pretty when all he sees are these faces literally straight outta  magazines? 

I think he started realizing the fact I don't believe him at all because he started adding “you really should know how cool you are, how pretty you are” after paying a compliment.
and I don’t think I could find a way of improving my self-esteem, I’m not even sure if it’s a matter of low self esteem because, It’s more like a “I just don't get it” thing.

He's been sober for the past 6 years and has been creating this family mentality but all the while, he still retains his mentally abusive attitude towards me. In all the years he's been sober, he's never ONCE apologized for it. I have PTSD and anxiety (diagnosed by an actual doctor) from this and my father labels me as ""retarded"" and I should easily get over it. 

My parents are well off and make more than enough to provide. He constantly uses money as his backbone to say ""he owns me and everything I have is because of him."" 

I [21M] have no job and currently attend college for mechanical engineering while they pay for it. I do have a savings account from previous jobs but not enough to pay for college. I pay for textbooks. My grades have been above average as I've been getting mostly A's and B's. 

Thing is, whenever I get a B, my father becomes infuriated saying I should have done better and he's disappointed that I should have tried better. He then goes on a 30 minute rant saying things like ""Well maybe if you actually cared about what money I've spent on you, then youd actually put appreciate all that I've done for you"" but engineering is hard. I do my absolute best to keep them up. He thinks that engineering is easy but he's a teacher, he's never been through any of the courses I've taken and I'm the first in my family to pursue engineering. He had one friend that said his son did engineering while his son said it was the easiest thing in the world. He uses just that one input as fact.

He also makes me constantly look for a job while I'm in school. When I had a job, my grades mostly averaged in B's but when I got laid off, my grades  currently are straight A's. 

Every morning, he yells at me saying that I must be doing something wrong to not get a job and how he's disappointed in me. I've applied to over 40 jobs with 5 interviews but all declined saying that my school schedule didnt work with them. He insists that it must be my appearance (asian, man bun and fit) and that getting a minimum wage job is easy. He uses my PTSD and Anxiety as leverage as well.

Everytime he argues with me, he turns into the victim when I state facts towards him and gets my entire family to label me as a disrespectful asshole with no appreciation towards anything. My younger brother and sister, who I used to do anything for, have now taken his mentality and are starting to join his side. I'm alone and have no support except for my girlfriend and grandparents.

I asked for time, staff and resources to make this project manageable, the first thing I got was a project manager that only keeps adding requirements to the system even after I explained that building on a broken system will only make us work twice in the long run (he is not even a developer, he only asks for stuff), cool now I'm not even the manager of my own project. 

Second thing I get, a new developer! wow!

So now I'm tasked with taking someone under my wing (older than me btw), teach him basic tools that we use because they used literally no filters, work on new requirements that keep pilling up on a bad legacy system that I know will bite everyone's ass in the future, and keep getting any of my suggestions ghosted. 

I know these type of situations are commonplace in the developing industry and some people just put up with it, but I'm so done.",03Jan2020,1
895,"So hey everyone, this whole Love thing has been bothering since i was way younger, like around 10 11 years old. And till now, I still don’t think i’ve made any progress in understanding it. It just gets more confused to me. 

I have never be close to my family members. I don’t feel any special connection between them and me. And I don’t think this is normal. I mean my family love me. Every time i heard my parents tell me they love me, i feel so guilty when i said I LOVE YOU back, because tbh I don’t feel anything, and i am a liar. 

I left my family side to go live with my aunt in US when i was 14 yrs old because they want me to have a better education. And it’s been 6 yrs now but i have never miss them for once. Ever year when i go back to visit them or they fly over to visit me, there are not much extreme emotion i experience. And I feel very confused and guilty about that. Like I don’t have any things to give back to them while they give me so much love. And i feel so bad about that. Every convo between them and me is awkward and end up my parents talking and asking, i try my best to listen and answer, while showing my interest in what they talk. And it’s bad 🤧 like even a animals love their family members. But i am not, what am i then?

So the problem not only appear in the relationship between me and my family only. It’s also appear in my social life.

As a 20yrs old female, i have never in my life have a crush or have interest on someone. Like when i see someone like really attractive, it’s more like damn, she/he is so hot! for like 5s then i go back to mind my business and that person just totally disappear. And people’s names and faces seems not to retain in my head for so long ( which is quite weird to me all the time since my memory on any other things is quite good). And that’s make me have a hard time keeping in track with my social life too. I mean i adapt to the environment i am in quick and literally could talk to any random person but keep the relationship long is hard for me. 

I know a lots of people but i think they are more like acquaintances to me more than friends. I only have like 2 close friends that i once in a while will hang out and text and share our thoughts. But somehow, it’s more like a counselor session to me lol :D which is sad when i thought about it. 
I feel like i am not normal person. I don’t have all the emotions that a normal person would have toward their family and friends. I am just a cold hearted and selfish person. I only love myself. I sometimes question do i have depression or something but then i feel totally fine and normal like I always feel since young. So this whole things just really confusing.


Have you ever experienced the same things as i did? Any advice? 
Ps: Anyway sorry for venting too much lol. And i don’t even know if there is an actual advice for this type of problem. But thank you so much if you do read my post ♡ॢ₍⸍⸌̣ʷ̣̫⸍̣⸌₎",03Jan2020,0

It was agreed upon that my friends would have to pay for their own food and entertainment but we would pay for the car rental and hotels. Is it wrong of me to not want to go on another trip with them since they didn’t assist with gas money and had my mom pay for most of their food? This trip was planned back in august.

897,"So recently, my mom got a new boyfriend. He builds bridges for a living, which means he has to eat a crap ton of food or else he'll be deathly skinny. So every other day we're ordering from some place like Pizza Hut or Subway. I try to stay away from the food since I'm skinny right now and kinda want to stay like that, but I always give in. I can't explain how much I want to move out and start a life of my own. They won't buy anything healthy, so it's this or nothing. I really don't want to gain weight, it's an intense fear I have but it's impossible to stay away from the food. How should I deal with this?",03Jan2020,1
899,"So this kinda ties in to two things

1.im too Embarrassed to exercise (I don't like people knowing that I exercise)

2. Too afraid to tell people I want to eat more healthy

Let me get this straight out of the way here, if I lived alone and had a job I wouldn't have any of these problems, the thing is I still live with my parents (not old enough to move alone) so I can't control my diet) and I exercise in my room, usually getting injured because I don't have proper equipment (I have a wood floor so I get splinters everytime I try to do ground exercises, especially planks and plank jacks) but I'm too scared to ask my parents to start buying more healthy food, doesn't help I literally can't resist pizza that they buy every Friday, I would just not eat but that's not an option, I can stick to a healthy food schedule (gone to more healthy relatives and had no problem resisting unhealthy food for a month, but can't do that at home because all my parents buy is junk because that's all my younger siblings eat, I've opened up to my aunt about it (who lives with us) and she subtly started popping in healthy groceries which I'm ever so thankful for. But at the root of this problem is no one but me, if it weren't for my anxiety I could have this problem down in minutes, however I get this feeling that I can't describe whenever I want to talk about being more healthy, not sure what the emotion is but some thoughts I have are ""That's ridiculous, they would laugh if I told them I wanted to be healthier"" ""What would they even think of me if I asked for a exercising mat?"" And whenever I want to bring it up it just feels like a mix between feeling like boasting and some other emotion, it digs into my skin every single time I feel it and I have no idea how to address it, mainly because I don't even know what the emotion is, if anyone who has gone through a similar problem or has any help I would deeply appreciate your help.",03Jan2020,15

908,"I (21F) have been friends with Maira (21F) (obviously not her real name) since we were in kinder garden, but we became really close in our last year of high school, after that she went to study in a university overseas. Thankfully after another few months, I also had the opportunity to study in another country. Therefore, we were living in different countries, yet for me, it felt like our friendship never changed, we still talked everyday, she helped and listened to the problems I had and I did the same with her.

But months ago, I started to go to therapy, because I am really insecure and I felt like I needed someone else to talk to. After a few sessions I realized, that I am the one who is always after people so they can talk to me, I specially felt this with another friend (who is not Maira), but it made me realize that this person did not talked to me or had any interest in me, unless I initiated conversation, and even then, this friend always talked about herself and did not had any interest in what was going on with me. 

 So, I told all of this to Maira, I said to her that i felt like I was forcefully continuing a friendship that didn't work anymore, that I felt like I made more of an effort to maintain this friendship with this other friend, and that i now knew that not everyone thinks the same way I do, but that at the same time it really hurt, that this other friend didn't talk to me at all. After we had this conversation, Maira said that I was right in the situation with this other friend, but right after that, Maira didn't talk to me for 3 weeks (even after I texted her to ask if everything was okay). I was angry and sad, because I had just told her that it hurt when friends just stopped talking to me with no explanation. Later, she texted me back and told me that she had had a ""crazy moment"".

A ""crazy moment"" is something that she and I made up, when she or I just stop talking to anyone because we feel sad (but we used to say that it was because we didn't feel like it), and it has happened since we were in high school, so it's very common that we don't talk to each other for a few weeks. But after going to therapy I realized that this is not something normal, and the fact that she abruptly stopped responding to me, when I told her that it hurt when somebody did that, sucked. Ofc, i told her this, I explained that she had to realize that these ""moments"" are not normal, and that if she had a problem she could talk to me and i would listen, instead of her just disappearing. She again said, that I was right and the next time she felt like she was going to go on a ""crazy moment"" she would let me know beforehand. 

Anyway, the last few weeks, she started by being very evasive, and then she didn't talked to me at all (again), and today, she texted me to tell me that she did not wanted to talk to people for those weeks, and that she is back to normal. I feel confused because i'm tired of waiting for her to talk to me and then getting worried about whether something is wrong with her. I am done with the ""crazy moments"". 

 I don´t know what to tell her, because I already explained to her that I was tired of these moments, i'm tired of asking what is wrong with her and she never explaining or downsizing her issues. I also feel like like this is a sign that she doesn't want to continue being friends with me.

So I don´t know if I should continue conversations with her as if nothing happened like she is doing or should i say something else? I just don't know what to do. I would really appreciate any kind of advice.

Ps: i also need a mini advice on how to find out if he likes me too, because sometimes it does seem like it ( he texts first, suggest we go out for lunch or dinner...) and sometimes not at all.

911,"Hi there. To preface, I work in a small, non-franchised gym in a small town. I make $9.50 an hour, 20 hours a week, to stand at the front ""desk"" (a podium with a slow ass pre-2010 computer on it), clean equipment and machines about once an hour, and just generally watch the gym for security and safety. I do all of these things as my boss would like me to and more, but recently she's been complaining that all I do is stand around and that there's plenty of things for me to ""keep busy"" with. The problem is that my duties realistically only take me about an hour to complete every day, and I think she's being unrealistic as to what needs done because I go far beyond my duties.

Every day I fully clean the only 2 bathrooms we have, including the showers, I vacuum the carpeted area, I spot-clean the floors (every other day I mop), I wipe down all the treadmills/ellipticals/machines/weights/etc. hourly, a few times a week I clean the mirrors and windows; and on top of that, my coworker on morning shift ALSO does all these things EVERY DAY. This place is damn near spotless at all times, and yet we keep getting texts that we aren't doing enough.

Additionally, I just painted a whole mural for my boss *for no additional pay* just so I could have something to do. The mural only took me two days and despite posting about it on Facebook, she hasn't even thanked me or tagged my art page to help promote me. 

Really I'm just complaining here, but seriously, what can I do to make me look busy? Sometimes I go in the one room without cameras for a bit but I can't do that the whole time. I do my job well, but nothing I do is enough, despite making a half-step up from minimum wage.",03Jan2020,2

920,"As time progresses people change &amp; I've changed. The friends I was close with in highschool have now become less desirable to spend time with. I'm constantly trying to learn more to grow as a person, to improve myself. But I feel like my friends hold me back.

I graduated highschool back in 2014. Meanwhile some of my friends from high school still think we're in highschool years later...

To apply some backstory, I've known these friends since middle school. We used to be really close and always spending time together. Now my time spent with these friends isn't so fun anymore...

Nowadays I'm quite busy working on myself. I don't enjoy hanging out with friends as often because I'm trying to focus on saving money to put towards investments. Investments in financial opportunities, traveling, education, etc.

I used to enjoy my time with friends but it seems like they just aren't keeping up with the same pace as me in terms of personal growth. I know everyone is different, everyone has different aspirations in life and our goals and pursuits will differ as individuals. However, it seems like my close friends since middle school has chosen to just to ""LDAR"". A good example of this is the fact that they choose not to get their licenses and don't own their own vehicles even though they are in their early 20s. So a night out for drinks includes me having to pick everyone up and driving them home late at night. It's become a inconvenience for me and they never offer to give me gas money. Even when we go out (because they don't work either) they show up with hardly any cash. When I buy us a round, it's never reciprocated and when I order food and drinks, sometimes I feel guilty to be the only one having money. I even try to go to cheap places to eat or to hang out because I know money is more than likely tight for them.

None of this really got to me until I realized there were new activities in my life that I wanted to explore but felt it would be better trying out with friends. When I pitch these new ideas to friends, none of them seem interested. To them they are content with spending their weekends hanging around at the same old bars &amp; playing video games all day &amp; night. Even if they were open to new ideas, none of them could realistically afford it. The last trip I went on was to spend the weekend in NYC. I ended bringing one of these friends along despite the fact they couldn't pay their own way. I ended up paying for everything, making the trip much more expensive than I had originally planned for.

It made me realize that maybe these old friends, are holding me back. Which makes me feel guilty but despite my numerous attempts to try &amp; convince them to look for work and get their licenses they just don't seem to have any ambition to try.

​I've reached a point in these relationships where I feel like my only option is to simply give up on these people I use to think of as my best friends and try to move on.

923,"I know this is my first post on reddit, because i dont use reddit but it seems this is one of the only places i can get advice from. 

I am a 15 year old German Male from Southwest Germany and have recently began interest in Astronomy (as well as Astrophotography). I have a quite decent pair of binoculars that I often watch planets and stars with, sometimes photographing them with my phone (I have a camera, but i need to search it). Although I have a case of light pollution (I live on a Class 4 area on the Bortle scale) I can see good outside. 

Okay, let me get to the point. 
I can't last forever with only a pair of binoculars, so I plan on getting a small telescope. 
Not a big &amp; expensive one, just one that I can watch planets and maybe even Nebula/galaxies with better. In my case I don't work and earn money so i'd have to ask my mother for help. 

That's where the problem is. 

Its hard to say, but my mom fell into the downward spiral of flat earth. We all heard of it. Flat earth, moon landing hoaxes, whatever. I don't want to speak to my mother about it because she's already so deep in the whole thing in. 

I wish she hadn't fallen into it, because I'm sure she would also have a passion about space. At the time she started falling into it, I was too young to look for myself so my only reliable source of news was her; my mother. As confession, yes. I did believe in flat earth for a time before I found she was looking at terribly inaccurate things. I knew some things seemed off but I couldn't research at the time. Me, my mother and the family do love her alot. Its just that one thing. 

I got distracted again.. 

I'm unsure if, when I would ask/get a telescope, that my mother would know that I don't believe in her things anymore. I think I only have 2 options.. 

1. Convince and show her that her sources are not correct

This is very hard, since she's been doing this for about 6 or so years. I do have to get over it at one point, maybe she'll even find out herself at some time... 

2. Tell her that even though they're all ""fake"", I like to look at how pretty they are. 

When I plan to look at stuff like the Moon and Venus, my thought is that she'll assume that I rather want to look at them because I dont believe her stuff at all. 

I really love my mother and quite possibly she'll understand me wanting to look at Sky objects, even though she said its ""unnecessary"". 

Would anyone of these options be good? I don't want my mother to have a bad thought about me thinking I don't like her. 

And I don't want to leave astronomy, its really astonishing to me. 

I'll stick to my Binoculars for now... Everyone says the first time you look at planets through a telescope are the most rememberable and joyful experiences of your life. Maybe an emergency lie is needed... 

Thank you.",03Jan2020,2

I’m also slightly too short to see over the car so I have to use a seat pad like a little old lady.

The next day I went to drop off the presents she forgot to give my mom to my moms house, and I tried calling him to tell him but my phone is sorta messed up so I ended up just calling him from my sisters phone when I got there (my parents don’t live very far apart). As I told him where I was I also asked if I could go to my boyfriends afterward, to which he replied “did you really just try asking me that? Hell no.” Fast forward to later that evening. I had had an anxiety attack in my room (I have depression and anxiety and I haven’t been very consistent with my meds this past week since I’ve been busy), and then he called me to help move mattresses in the spare room we have. I can admit that I was kind of being a shithead because I was fresh out of crying, and I really didn’t want to do this. He continued to get madder at me as the process went on, and eventually after a comment I made (i believe it was after I said it was ridiculous to change the fitted sheet AGAIn because no one is ever in the room and it doesn’t matter what’s on the bed) he grounded me for a week because my attitude was “pissing him off”. I didn’t say anything back, but after finishing making the bed he told me to put the old mattress from the guest room into my room. I asked him why, because I sleep on a couch in my room and haven’t slept in a bed in months. He argued and just kept saying “because I said so.” So I moved the bed, and then I moved a few bags I had in the hallway to my room. As I was in there he shouted for me, and then went “what the fuck is that?” To some stain on the ground. I genuinely didn’t know what it was from, but he was mad anyway (he constantly blames me for things even if I don’t do them) he made me clean the stain up. This wasn’t a problem, the problem came after I sprayed a stain remover and went back to my room (you’re supposed to let it sit for 5 minutes). In my room I started to cry again because he had called me a moron and yelled at me, and tonight had already been taxing for me. When he saw that I had let the stain remover sit he yelled at me to come out and asked why I hadn’t cleaned it up and I replied w “you have to let it soak”. When I said this he saw I was crying and went “why the fuck are you crying?” And I told him that I had had an anxiety attack like 10 minutes before all the arguing (there were more little things that happened but this is already extremely long). He called me a “fucking drama queen” which he has done multiple times before, and I freaked out. I packed a bag and decided to go to my moms because I was so done with being in the house, and without telling my dad I left. When I got to my moms I told her to text my dad that I was there (at some point in the evening he took my phone) and then told her what happened because I was still crying. She always talks about how she wants me to live with her, and didn’t say anything while I was crying but earlier in the evening when I dropped the presents off she had said she wants me there. I have lived with my dad for 6 years and it’s been decent. When it’s good it’s fine being there but once something happens it gets really bad. Multiple people have told me they think I should move to my moms, and some have mentioned that It seems like I get neglected in different ways. I don’t live with my mom anymore because I previously did and it ended with me trying to kill myself. We have a great relationship now, but we used to constantly fight. I also have a stepdad, and he and I have butted heads before. I love all 3 of my parents, but it seems like no matter where I turn there ends up being problems. There’s a lot I haven’t added here since it’s such a long story, but I don’t know if I should move in with my mom or stay with my dad. I can’t move out because I don’t have a job or enough savings right now since I’m in college and it’s hard to maintain a job and my grades (especially with my poor mental health, it’s hard for me to deal with too many things at once.) with my dad I have more freedom, but the rules change all the time and he is very controlling. At my moms it would be more of a family unit because my sister and brother are Also there, and I’m not sure if I can live in that situation. I have been more or less on my own for 6 years, because my dad stays out a lot and I’m accustomed to taking care of myself (at certain points in time I have bought my own groceries, I buy my own clothes, I buy a lot of my own things. For the most part my dad only covers the bills. I buy my own gas, but he helps pay for my insurance and phone bill.) I’m at a loss because after I left last night I’m not sure if he’ll even want me back. I need help.

940,"I live at home with my parents and 16 year old younger brother. I have wanted to move out for some time now, but not due to any ill will toward my family. My house is just quite a loud environment sometimes (my parents are shouty people) and I often can't really do much schoolwork or anything else in my room past around 8 or 9 since my parents go to bed early and the walls are quite thin. I can also never really have friends or my girlfriend stay over and would like to try living independently. I pay 250 a month rent to my parents.

I could never move out before because I didn't get enough hours in my old job. However, I've gotten a new job that works well with my university timetable and has steady hours. A good friend of mine who I've known for many years lives about 20 minute walk away and his roommate is moving out so there's a vacancy. The rent is 450 a month which is quite cheap for my city, and I'm now making around 1000 a month. It's equidistant from my university and house, just in a different direction so transport to uni and work won't be an issue. On top of that, my friend and I are pretty quiet people and get along well so it solves the noise issue. 

It seems like a no brainer but I'm sure there are many surprise costs to living independently, and since I have no experience living elsewhere I'm concerned that there might be important things I'm not taking into account when I consider it that might take me by surprise. I am somewhat nervous about doing this when I've only been in my new job for two months, but I had my first performance review the other day and did very well, so I'm not super concerned about it. I thankfully also have an inheritance that covers my university costs so the remainder of my wages I have after rent are what I have to live on for the month.

And here is my mom demanding I treat her with respect, and ever since then I just can't bring myself to even talk to her.

She was born with cancer, is allergic to the sun, has bad luck in life and is innocent since always, because her parents have never loved or cared about her, all they ever did was abuse mentally + physically and talk bad for no reason, her father is actually not really her father, because she had a blood test and the result was that her mother was with her ""uncle"", her younger brother stole her Nintendo Switch and never gave it back, she never got money support from her parents that she needed for school / university + not even lunch, the whole ""family"" are bunch of irresponsible rude people, the only good thing that she had in life was her dear late Grandmother who took care of and raised her to be an honest, good and heartwarming person.

I always liked her, because she is a wonderful, interesting, smart, talented etc. person and I did everything I could to help so that she has a better life that she deserves like to help her mentally, gift her a good bed so that she no longer has back pain, laptop so that she has it for university, cell phone so that she does not become alone and can talk with me, switch so that she has fun, a pet that gives her joy, etc. etc. etc. I know it would sound like a scam at first sight, but for me it's not, because no one really got to know her that well, but i really know and talk to her almost everyday and that it's not a waste so i'm the one who helped out and bought all the stuff that she needed in life and that i really don't care about money or that she never would dare to ask me about doing all that in the first place, but it showed how grateful she really is with tears of joy, because of my kindness. I also took good care (for a short time) of her late Grandmother, paid for a proper grave and promised her before that that i will take care of and protect her Granddaughter so that she doesn't have to worry anymore which made her happy and feel at ease until the end.

The woman I love should have a happy life and if she dies, then everything was for nothing and she really means everything to me and I want her to live so I only believe that I can help her and that she needs me, we have even made future plans so we can live somewhere peaceful and be forever happy together, but right now I just don't know where to start, she was really (/always) depressed (because her life was already bad enough thanks to her family) + suicidal since the accident which was 2 months until the trauma amnesia started, now she can't recognize me anymore and it's really hard for me to accept the truth, so i would really appreciate everyone's help!",03Jan2020,1

951,"**TL;DR** \- I don't know if I should keep trying to make it in law school or see this as an appropriate time to quit already.

I made the decision to study for law school because of the secure pay, the 3 year studying which seemed nicer than 8 years of residency, and also because I'd love to help someone get justice. I also don't suck entirely at writing and public speaking and other than that there's nothing particularly special on my plate. This decision was made last April. Spent hundreds on books, courses from Princeton, Khan Academy, and even got in touch with a lawyer I actually like. Made plans that I could easily study 720 hours within 90 days if I did this as a full time 'job'. Every day I woke up anticipating today I'd make progress and finally get some shit done.

It's the next year. I still can't score above a 138. I'm beyond embarrassed. I adjusted my entire routine,  I stopped going out, eating out- I've pretty much been a house hermit the past 10 months- and not a single significant step made ahead in my prep tests. My Logical/Reading comprehension is still on a basic level, and according to Khan academy my Analytical is on 'medium' which is pure concentrated bs because that's the section I'm most terrified of and hope I don't get that as the 5th ungraded part on the exam.

My test is on January 13. My parents paid $200. I had no idea I would disappoint myself and them this bad. My second test is on February 22. That's 50 days from now and if I study 15 hours a day that's 760 hours total and I've got to grasp something in all that time right? I still never got used sitting for more than 2 hours straight, how would I possibly sit through 15 hours in a day? I can't!

But I had ten months. I worked my ass off and all I've done is come home crying from the library because legal terminology still reads to me like a foreign language. Every word I didn't understand I jotted it down and ended up with over 300+ index cards. I'm still scoring like someone that just opened up an LSAT book for the first time in their life would.  I feel like my effort has betrayed me and even worse I feel stupid. Like I gave myself too much credit to actually think I could pull this off.

I'm still studying as much as I can and I have not slept last night because of my stress. I don't even want January 13 to come!! Not to be dramatic but it feels like I'm on death row or something. Do I keep trying, or did I pretty much show what I was made of (or not made of in my case) in the last 10 months?

What really upsets me the most is that despite all the tension this would've been the escape window for me. If I got a decent score, I could've gone to reputable college at least if I can't get into a good law school, I could've relaxed for the next three years and devoted myself to just studying because I'd have faith that I have the brains to make the income I want to make and provide for myself and family. I liked the security that fantasy gave me. I suck at law, but I suck at everything else even more.

What made me exuberant about waking up was getting a good score so I go somewhere, finally make friends, maybe be with someone, finally be a normal college kid and make the best of it. I thought in return for my 10 months of solitude I'd eventually have my 'reward' so to speak. I was sure a good score on this test was possible, and I was sure it was going to solve a myriad of problems in my life that cause me to be unhappy (Lack of friends, poor, dependent, not seeing anyone, feeling like I have no purpose, not feeling smart, low self esteem, etc)

In my native country education has always been the way out of poverty and even with all the resources, time, and environment I had in America, I feel like I still miraculously failed. And I don't know what happens next and at this point I'm not even sure I want to know.

I literally have no idea what I'm going to do for a living or when or how or where if it isn't this. And with extended family back home who have to sit through blackouts from time to time *just* *because* they were born there, I have this pressure of having to make some money, something out of myself before anything dire happens to them, before the little ones grow up entirely in that mess.",03Jan2020,1

953,"Using a throwaway just to make sure she doesn't go after me.Here's the story... I don't write professionally. I ""direct"" for fun as a hobby. Basically, i use a simulation game to write stories. I come up with the characters, plot, direct, take pictures and edit them. I've done it since i was a tween, and have been doing it as a hobby for years. Well, around 2 years ago, i had a friend come up to me in my private messages. She told me: ""Hey, can i write scripts for your posts?"" Now mind you, i don't profit from these posts, i do them for fun. I post them to social media and get a few likes, barely having any readers.

I accepted it because we were friends already and thought it was going to be more fun like that. I didn't use scripts before, i simply went with it. SO yeah, it wasn't something i needed, just some fun to do with a friend. Of course, i ALWAYS gave her credit for the scripts. I tagged her in the posts, made posts mentioning her saying how amazing she was etc. She was always happy to write and said she enjoyed too. Since i had very few readers. i'd discuss the story with ALL of them, including her.

Well, for now, let's call that friend ""Alison""

After that, a mutual friend turned her against me, and she's saying all kinds of nonsense about me.

She said she ""needed some time"" To avoid any trouble with Alison, i told her i was no longer using her scripts, and offered to give her even more credit in case she felt it wasn't enough. Her? She hit me with ""You never gave me credit!"" To see how unstable her arguments were. I showed her screenshots of multiple times i gave her credit (And didn't even show her all of them). After that she said. ""That wasn't enough! I wrote your WHOLE story!!!"" Absolute nonsense. The story is mine. I can prove it's all written by me. I told her that. 

I thought we were done there... No. She then tried to threaten me, saying i would either remove the posts ""she wrote"" and tell everyone she wrote it or she would ""expose me"" (Which could mean anything, since she was a personal friend). Of course i didn't give in, but i already wasn't feeling the game so i ended up deleting the posts because i wanted to edit the story again.

I wasn't feeling the game already, and that was the last straw. As of now, i'm out of the community, and haven't made a post since. But i don't feel it's right. That story is heartfelt. I put a piece of myself in every character, i spent ages working on everything and planning things out. I love the characters, and i don't want to leave them behind because of that.

962,"Just need to rant. I had a great 4 month relationship. But the girl I was dating constantly got super upset over little things.  She usually always apologized and begged me to not leave her. When I was considering leaving she begged me to give her a break. That she can’t control her anxiety.

So the final straw was when I was watching the show friends. It was about the episode Ross and Rachel break up. By the way her name was also Rachel and my name starts with an r. On FaceTime after I said cheaters were terrible people, she said cheating is terrible but she doesn’t think cheating makes someone bad. This shocked me at first. I had an intense initial reaction where I was like why are you saying this? “How could they not be bad people? You’ve said the opposite before. Have you ever cheated/are you going to cheat one day? If not how can you defend them”. This got her pissed. She asked if I trust her and I said I trust her completely but I’m just confused why she’d talk about cheaters like this. She cooled  down a bit but kept going on about cheaters not necessarily being bad people but when I calmly explained why I disagree she hung up. This was the only time I had an intense reaction, but I did not insult her or yell at her. 

The next day she called to break up. She thought our relationship was going to be toxic because she assumed I hadn’t moved on from being cheated on and now she was saying hadn’t moved on from her abusive relationship last year. But our relationship was never toxic. It was healthier by the week. She even had stopped getting constantly upset for little things. There was only one more thing that happened in the last month. A couple days ago before the break up my hand was barely a little red. I jokingly asked if I could wear her headband. She asked if I could wash my hands first. I said “okay never mind I don’t want to wear it”. So she was like I just don’t want it to get stained. All I did was rub my hand on her arm and say “theres nothing that’s gonna stain it”. I didn’t see a problem with this?  I didn’t care, i didn’t wanna wear it, all I was saying was it wouldn’t have stained. This seemed like such a minuscule topic, I wasn’t even upset or pressuring her to let me wear her headband with my red hand. But she viewed it as a sign of disrespect. Asking why I can’t just say okay, and respect her feelings. I do respect her feelings, I just didn’t think showing her it wouldn’t have stained was a big deal. 

She blocked me after the break up. We dated for 4 months. I just wanted her to not end it on the phone for 20 seconds. When I messaged on Facebook that it wasn’t mature to not do it face to face, she unblocked me and called and said I wasn’t respecting her boundaries and giving her space. I’m fine giving her space but I explained I deserved respect too and to be broken up in person before giving her space. But she said I was too disrespectful for basically “not giving her space” and that I didn’t deserve to be faced in person. Keep in mind it was only a couple texts on Facebook explaining it wasn’t mature. I didn’t spam her with texts, I just wanted to be broken up with person so I can get closure. 


Our relationship was great before this. We always supported each other. I never raised my voice at her.  We spent a lot of time together and both wanted a long term relationship. This wasn’t a simple 4 month relationship we both felt this was extremely special and that it was both of our best relationship we’ve been in. There were so many amazing adventures that I could talk about it. The worst thing I did was get too intense and ask if she’d cheat on me over FaceTime. She’s treating me like I didn’t matter to her. She’s saying I didn’t respect her by “begging” during the phone call when all I was begging for was for her to at least hear me out and end it in person. She was the one who begged me to not leave her when I was thinking about doing it 2 months ago.  Why did she treat me like this at the end? I’ve been a great boyfriend. Was always patient with her even when she’d get angry over non-personal disagreements. I never disregarded her feelings even if it seemed silly. I’d do my best to make sure she felt okay about it and every week our relationship was better. We went on constant adventures. I waited outside her work for an hour to cheer her up with flowers and chocolate when she was having a bad anxiety day. I was always there for her. On her birthday I drove to her with a bunch of her favorite things even though I was low on money. I had been eating less to save money because she deserved it. Every morning I made sure she woke up with a text letting her know she’s great. I did this because her anxiety made her constantly feel like she’s not doing enough. I bought a comforter for my bed for when she’s over because she wasn’t too comfy. I’d sleep on the couch when she was over because she slept better alone and I wanted her to get a good nights rest. For Christmas I saved up to buy her a gift that blew her mind. I spent 4 hours decorating my room to make it really Christmasy, bunch of fake snow everywhere (that I still haven’t finished cleaning) because I wanted to surprise her. It was the first time I bought a Christmas gift because I never celebrated it before. A couple days before the break up she had included a letter in her Christmas gift to me about she loved me a lot and  was super excited for her future together. How did it go from this to her refusing to break up with me in person? I’ve never been toxic to her. She always said she loved how patient I was with her.


I decided to cut my losses and give it up near the end of the day she broke up with me. I wanted to start 2020 fresh. This was on New Year’s Eve. I gathered all her stuff she left here. Wrote her a goodbye letter that was about how I’ll miss her but I wish her the best. Put it in with her stuff. I drove by and placed her stuff on the pavement. I didn’t knock or anything as she already said she doesn’t wanna talk to me. When I got back, I used my friends phone to leave her a long message that her stuff is on the pavement and that I’m giving her the space she wants, and that I’m still confused why this ended us. I explained why it was hard to give her space when I was broken up with by a 20 second phone call. I told her she’ll be a great nurse and that I won’t let this bring me down and I’ll move on too.

Doing that gave me a bit of closure. But I’m still confused and hurt. I’ll respect her decision and not come into contact again. But why did she treat me like this at the end? She was the one to first say she loves me. Always got sad when she had meltdowns saying she’s afraid I’ll leave her. I always assured her I don’t judge her for her anxiety. That I know who she is on the inside. But the one time I get intense about a subject I’m passionate about, she starts treating me like I’m evil. It’s just so confusing. She’s 20 and I’m 22. She was on her pms when she broke up with me so I wonder if that impacted how harsh she treated me. Obviously I know there’s no future with us. She probably won’t contact me again, and even if she did how can I forgive not being respected enough to be dumped in person. But I’m afraid to start a relationship again. This was like a fairy tale relationship. And I’m still in shock from she went one day from loving me deeply to treating me so coldly.

One more thing that is causing me some mental turmoil and I know it’s stupid. But she was beautiful. And I was out of shape when we started dating because I had stopped working outing and turned to eating after a terrible knee injury. But even though she was out of my league she still wanted me. It made feel so loved. I’m back to working out and will be in shape again. But some stupid part of my brain is saying it won’t be the same whenever I start dating while looking fit again. Because what if they wouldn’t have liked me If I was out of shape? She was out of my league and still loved me and wanted me because of who I was in the inside. It’s 99.9 percent likely that the next girl I date once fit wouldn’t have wanted to date me while I looked like this. Can someone convinced me that this thought process is stupid?

But how do you cut toxic people out if they’re your own family? Particularly if they depend on you like my granny does. I wish I could leave and get away but I can’t. I’m 23, I want to start living my life but I feel like I’m trapped.",03Jan2020,3
971,"I'm really sorry if this has been asked many times before.

I'm a 17 year old student who over the christmas break just has been having the roughest time in my entire life, as it seems. So much stress and so much sadness. I csnt even bring myself to cry anymore, it's all just empty silent sadness. A lot has happened and I have so much on my mind at all times recently. 

All I want to do, and what I've actually done the past few days is just, do nothing. Just do none of my responsibilities. Of course, I do have them. I'm a beginner artist who is trying to improve before I have to submit a portfolio to my dream college, I have my actual school and homework and study and all that, and I recently got a high maintenance pet. Along with the guilt and just anger at myself for not doing this just builds up during the day along with small little situations just ruining my day just all build up and I have no idea what to do. I csnt even bring myself to go to sleep. I just sit on my phone texting friends, hoping my mood improves.

My question is, are there any natural remedies, habits, tricks, whatever to lower the occurrence of these thoughts? I've been diagnosed with general anxiety and OCD, if that helps with the answer. I will be seeing a professional at the end of the month and during that wait I dont want my situation to get worse.

I need your help! I came back from France last week and had a stopover in Seattle to go to Vancouver where I live. A security officer couldn't read my passport so I told him the chip might be defective. He said that it was ok for this time but next time he wouldn't let me in. 
Problem is: I booked before knowing that, 2 flight tickets for my girlfriend and I to go to NY from the 17th to the 21st of February. 
I called my French consulate in Vancouver to make a new passport but it can take up to 7 weeks to receive it which could be potentially too late. I don't really know what to do right now. 
Does someone know if they will kick me out because the chip of my passport is defective ? Must have been kept too close to my phone somehow. I have the ESTA visa valid for 2 years.

986,"Hey guys so I’ve recently got an internship style job at a company that a family friend owns. For context I’m currently about to start my 2nd semester of college for mech engineering. 

I’ve honestly been feeling super useless there and I feel like I have no real purpose being there. I’m super grateful for having been given such an amazing opportunity but I feel like I was kind of thrust into the position with no real idea what I’m supposed to be doing. On my first day my boss gave me a general outline on what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m supposed to be helping with IT and ironing out issues that arise with computers in the office as well as helping collect tax documents and some accounting. 

The list of tasks my boss (family friend) gave me were pretty basic and I completed them very quickly on my 1st week then on my 2nd week when pretty much the whole the office was on vacation I just kind of sat around with nothing to do. I feel like I’m a burden on all the other employees since I don’t know almost anything that they know. I started at the company December 18th so I’ve only been in the company now 3 weeks. The last two weeks that I worked were very slow as no one was in the office because of the holidays and because my list of tasks were very simple. I tried asking if anyone needed help with stuff but it ended up just being a futile attempt as either they didn’t need any help, I didn’t have the proper accounts made for me to access the software or that they didn’t have anything that I could do. So I got a list of somewhat random items for me to complete which included collecting forms, connecting printers, etc. I didn’t really have anyone to help or much to do after completing the tasks I could (some of the tasks are taking time because people were on vacation and i couldn’t complete them because of that) so I ended up sitting there trying to learn whatever in order to look busy. I ended up making a report of what I got done that week which I forwarded to my boss, he said it looked good and didn’t mention anything else. 

I used to work in a restaurant so I’m very used to knowing what exactly needs to get done because my boss would tell me to exactly what to do, when to clock out, what tasks to switch out etc. but now I feel very lost and quite frankly super anxious because I feel like I’m disappointing everyone and that I’m going to get fired. 

I had a chat today with one of the guys in the accounting department and he said that he needed some help with some stuff in accounting, something which my boss had mentioned to me yesterday I said that I’d be more than happy to help. He ended up saying that it required dedication, motivation and hard work and I said that I am up to the challenge I’m not sure if I interpreted his tone right but it seemed to me like he was saying that I needed to do something because I wasn’t doing anything the last two weeks. I’m about to start my semester next week Monday and I will only be in the office around 12 hours a week and I feel like I’m not providing any benefit to the company and have been feeling super anxious because I don’t want to lose this amazing opportunity. I don’t know what to do in the office, I don’t know when to clock out because I feel like if I clock out before everyone else they will think I’m lazy and just skipping work. Is this what office environments are like or am I doing something wrong. Any advice on what to do? Thanks!",03Jan2020,1
988,"So I have little sister that is pretty much the definition of a brat. She can treat me like crap, give me a bad attitude, and mock me whenever she wants and only gets away with an empty warning.

She gets whatever she wants regardless of price, like she wants a new phone and a new smart watch, even if those work completely fine.

991,"I'll start off by saying I've been to a doctor already before writing this post. With that, I'll explain the story.

So early 2019 I started gymming and was doing tricep extensions incorrectly(wrong ROM). I continued doing it despite the sharp pain for quite a bit; I thought my form was fine and that something was just a tiny off and that I'll see how it goes. It resulted in both elbows feeling weak for a bit. After a while, my left elbow only really hurt when lifting up my school bag to put on my left shoulder, but my right would continue to be in a cycle of heal and then get worse.

With being in my last year of high school, I couldn't really afford not doing homework like math exercises and such, so, despite my elbow hurting when writing sometimes, I had to get through it. That and I remember my elbows hurting when laying down in bed. Because of this I saw a doctor and he said I had tennis elbow, and he told me to just rest. I did, but it still persisted. I went again, and he told me to get a scan of it. When I got the scan, the woman doing it said that there isn't really much affected, just a few tears and spurs that shouldn't really be hurting and should heal up quick. Keep in mind that my elbow pain would legitimately be a battle for the whole year. I went back to the doctor and he said there's not much he can do but give me anti-inflammatory tablets. I took them a few times but it didn't do too much.

This brings me to the present time. It's almost a whole year later and my right elbow is still fucked. My left elbow is fine and only really is in pain when pulling things up like the school bag thing; and even that is on occassion now. My right, however, even while writing this continues to be in pain. I've found that if I keep my elbow resting on my thigh while writing or typing on a desk that is level to my knees helps there be less pain. It's holidays now, I'm out of school, not going to university for this year at least, and I have a security training course soon. I normally stay at home learning japanese at home and use my computer a lot now but pain still persists.

Which comes to me asking for advice now. Should I go to a different doctor? Still wait for it to heal? I'm really lost on the whole ideal, and if it's permanent damage I don't know what I'll do. I really want to go back to gymming as it gives me so much more discipline but I don't want to stress my tendon anymore. (I've gymmed last year sometimes while my elbow tendon hurt and, surprisingly, it wasn't in pain all too much; just a small itch when I'd involve the joint or do tricep exercises) 

Thank you to anyone who gives advice. It's been a pretty big tax on my life but I hope I can just look at it in the past soon.",03Jan2020,2
992,"I dated my ex girlfriend for 2 years, from 14-16 years old. She left me because she claimed she wanted to find herself and be single. She also tried saying I didn’t give her enough attention since I never stayed up or out late with her much since I like going to bed early(11pm). A week later she had a new boyfriend and that pissed me off I just don’t understand how she moved on that quick. 

We’ve talked off and on since the break up we’re 19 now. We started talking seriously again in 2019. I’ll admit I still had feelings for her at the time, but lost all interest in here a few months ago. She treats me terrible, she calls me out my name, and it takes over 12 hours to get a text back from her most the time. She also said she loves me and wants me back, but also still loves her ex. 

So I decided to just stop talking to her. I was going to bed crying every night because of her. Wishing she love me the way I love her and things could back to how they use to be in high school. I blocked her on everything including her number. She made a new Snapchat and I blocked it. She changed her number at least 5 times or more so she could text me and she still doing.

He has a close group of friends who are all pretty much terrible people. The only thing my brother really does/has done for the past two years is go out to bars, get blackout drunk, and start fights with people. He does this like 4-5 days out of the week. In addition to this, he’s also clearly got some mental health issues (namely anxiety and depression). He’s never been diagnosed, but as someone who also has anxiety and depression, I’d bet every cent to my name on it. He’s got a lot of rage in him, and he has a history of taking it out on my father when he’s drunk. I’ve had to physically restrain him from hitting my dad a few times now. So that’s what my parents have been dealing with for a few years now.

Yesterday, he came home at 3:00 AM absolutely shitfaced and started talking to me about how depressed he is, how he hates himself, and how he wants to kill himself. He also told me that he’s recently got into doing coke when he drinks, which I figured but didn’t really know the extent of until now. Apparently he started doing coke more regularly back in September or so. He went on a 2 day long booze and blow bender some time in October, not long after that he and his friend got into a drunk driving accident that by all means should have left both of them dead (thankfully, nobody other than the car was hurt). He held down a job for most of November but quit it to go drink and do blow with his friends. Now I find out last night that he’s been snorting coke pretty much every day of the past month. He went out and did an 8-ball to himself last weekend. And to top it off, he also smoked crack for the first time recently. He’s lost 12 pounds in the past month, despite being already underweight. So needless to say, he’s kinda spiraling out of control. 

I (20M) go to school 3 hours away from home, so I’m not there most of the time and only hear specific things from my parents about his behavior. Whenever I come home, I normally am able to piece together what’s happened based off what my parents and my brother tell me. He seems to get worse and worse every time I come home to visit. 

How do my parents and I help him? In the past, he’s refused to see a therapist or a psychiatrist. My parents love us, but I think that they don’t fully grasp the extent to which my brother is spiraling out of control. My brother is largely uncooperative in their attempts to help him. I don’t know what the fuck I’m supposed to do.

As said two years went by we fell in love with each other and last year we decided to meet up to see if we'd feel the same way irl.

Well suffice to say, taking it offline was better than we could have expected.

The problem is that she (18f) is from a conservative Pakistani Muslim family. Her mother (her father died when she was young) Is a good person. She doesn't beat her children and she genuinely wants the best for them. The problem is, that to her this means that I (20m and white Atheist) am a disaster for her daughter and would be a great shame for the entire family.

Those of you who are Pakistani will understand, to those of you who are not believe me when I say honesty is not an option for many years yet.

Which brings us to the meat of the matter. My girlfriend lives in Canada, I live across the border. I have a pretty good full time job so flying back and forth, renting a nice place isn't a problem. The last time we met, we used the sleepover excuse. The whole thing required an elaborate setup of fake people her mother could call and verify with etc and it gave us one and a half day together.

This excuse won't work a second time and we'd really like more than a day and a half. We're not really very experienced liars either of us, I grew up a boring kid, my girlfriend doesn't have much of a history of sneaking out for anything either.

So I come to you Reddit. What lie can we create to give my girlfriend a few days out of the house without too much parental supervision?

Is there an excuse that could prevent requiring setting up fake parents for her to call?

Is there a genius variation of the sleepover we haven't thought of?

I’m angry at everyone who did a disservice to her...whether they were a bad parent to her, a bad brother, me even, a bad daughter to her.....but i loved my mom regardless...was there for her regardless, despite our fights, we always made up....her heart always overcame everything and that’s what i loved about her. everyone else would abandon her though, throw her out like garbage...her funeral was full of family members who haven’t spoken to her in years...the only “family” she had was me and her “boyfriend”. i started telling the boyfriend and their family how much they meant to me at her funeral, because they really did take her under their wing...when none of her actual family did. however, now that i have her phone.....i see videos that i probably shouldn’t have seen. her doing heroin, her doing drugs, people recording her on the phone while she’s passed out...her cause of death was by asthma attack, but heroin plays a factor to why your lungs would go out quicker than others....and the fact that her “boyfriend” was there, allowing this to happen...i take back everything i said to him. i do realize though without their family, my mom might’ve had a worse life, she had no one else...i was there as much as i could possibly be but that wasn’t enough. she needed stability, love...her journal entry from 10 days before she passed was “life is a constant process of dying” and “i lost my way through life and i’m trying to find it.” it hurts me how depressed she was. she was only 42....she had so much life to live. and although it was an asthma attack, although she died with an empty inhaler in her hand and called 911 herself...at first i questioned if she struggled, wanted to live, was looking around everywhere for something to help her breathe as her house was trashed when i found it...but then i started thinking...maybe she wanted to die towards the end, maybe she just gave up....she had two full inhalers in her purse.....she could’ve used those while she waited for the shitty ambulance, but they were untouched. maybe she just wanted to go...she was so tired...she was a survivor...but how long could someone possibly survive for? i’m dealing with all of this alone...my grieving is everywhere, i’m 19 and people expect me to cry uncontrollably but i’m mostly just angry at everything and numb. i don’t know how to deal with this. i’m angry at her boyfriend, at her doing the drugs when i thought she was finally clean...but also her last search history, literally a day before she died was “how to get over an opioid addiction and dependence”...my mom had a good heart always, never wanted to live this way..always wanted to prove that she was better...but she had issues....i wish she had gotten help. i’m mad that she kept doing this to herself. i’m mad at everything...i don’t know. how should i feel about this? i have no mom....i’m walking into 2020 feeling like nothing matters anymore. people are also moving on so quickly, my grandma (her mom) was so excited about the new years countdown...and i just
questioned myself, “how could you?” she just died four days before....and you’re excited? i don’t know....i also want to move out of my grandmas apartment. my mom never felt welcomed up here..,she always dropped me off downstairs because my grandma would never trust her to go up. not even for holidays, nothing. i need to save. i have a lot on my mind. i feel like i’m using this post to vent at this point and i don’t know if y’all have read up to this point. but what should i do? how should i feel? i’m trying to keep her opioid use a secret too right now, because people in my family would go “i knew it” and throw her out even more like garbage and dismiss her as if wasn’t ever a human being like i remember my mom for. ughhh",03Jan2020,2
1024,"Hi.

I guess I should preface this by saying I'm a gay, 18 year old male.

So, I('ve) suffer(ed) from diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and about 6 months ago, it was exacerbated greatly.

6 months ago, my best friend abandoned me, alongside my group of friends. I'll just call my best friend ""Lewis"" for the sake of this post. Lewis was the greatest person I had ever met, someone with whom I shared a deep, genuine connection. I loved him like a brother, and always will. The group of friends I used to have were also incredible. We'd go for drinks, to parties, gigs, hang out etc all the time. These people, and these activities distracted me from my disorder so much so that for a while, my depression had been greatly relieved. It was great.

However, last March, my psychosis got pretty bad. I'd experience auditory hallucinations and delusions. Sometimes I'd be convinced that my best friend Lewis was working with the Government to put me in prison for hearing the voice of a King of Hell. Sounds crazy, I know, and it is. Whilst convinced, I'd feel threatened, agitated, and I'd be a horrible, withdrawn and different person, but Lewis stuck by me no matter what and always made sure that I was okay. I loved Lewis. Maybe I still do, I don't know.

Anyway, about 6 months ago, I'd become addicted to Xanax. Things got pretty bad, and Lewis cut me off without saying goodbye. Lewis leaving resulted in the extended friendship group also leaving. My life had been thrown into freefall. The same day this happened, I overdosed. I took huge amounts of Xanax (26mg of Alprazolam if I remember corretly) and about 120mg of Codeine Phosphate. Somehow, I survived.

Obviously, after this cataclysmic event, my depression was horrendous. I stayed in bed for about two weeks, my psychotic symptoms worsened etc. It was, by far, the hardest period of my life.

Following advice from family, I sought medical help. I went through therapy for about 3 months, but nothing really worked (not even anti-psychotic medication, Abilify).

My depression has gotten better, but still, after 6 months there isn't a minute that goes by that I am not reminded of Lewis, my past friends, or the times we spent together. I think about how they could be spending time together right now, how Lewis could be happy without me, whilst I am stuck in this perpetual loop of negative thought. The only escape is sleep.

At the start of December, I began taking various drugs, including Clonazepam, Codeine, and Xanax. I hate that my life has gone this low at such a young age, but these substances are the only things that allow me to forget, allow me to be numb to the memories. The only thing I look forward to now, is sleeping, or getting so high that I can't remember why I was getting high in the first place.

I start College this year (University), to study Computer Science, but I'm afraid I won't make it if this continues. I've tried everything, meditation, psychedelics, therapy, medication, but NOTHING will allow me to escape these thoughts. All I want is to hug Lewis again, to share a few beers with my friends again, to be loved again. My dreams are infested. I'll dream about seeing Lewis again, I'll dream about sharing a meal with them again, but then I'll wake up and realise it's not real, and I'll fucking cry so hard it hurts. I can't get it out of my mind, I can't stop thinking about it, no matter how hard I try.

I guess, what I'm really afraid of is the prospect of never having someone in my life whom cares about me in just the same way Lewis did. Afraid of never having a normal friendship group again in which I feel secure.

If the only thing that makes me happy is sleep, why not just enter the longest sleep of my entire life? I don't want to die, but I don't want to be alive in this reality any longer, either, and I'm afraid that the latter desire will soon over-power the first.

Please help me. I don't know what to do. All I want is reassurance. Has anyone else gone through anything like this?",03Jan2020,2
1025,"17, was homeschooled all my life, never had a social circle, girlfriend, job, etc.

I will probably be going to uni by the time i'm 18 or 19, and i've been wanting to finally, for the first time in my life, make some friends and be accepted into/create a social circle.

The problem is that because of the socially secluded environment i grew up in, i am extremely socially awkward and somewhat anxious, and i find it really difficult to actually approach random people.

The ONLY thing that i have going for me in my life is that looks and athleticism wise i am above average, that is literally it. The rest of the areas of my life are really fucking sad to the point where i just want to give up.

1027,"I started thinking about it a while ago, but never really thought it could be a big deal. However, the question has come to mind more than once, so I just wanted to get it out there.

I base this question on a couple stuff about my behaviour, albeit I'm more relaxed some days than others, but mostly body language. I've gotten used to having a shaky leg while sitting, weird/anxious thoughts that I've learnt to identify as intrusive thoughts, eating quickly, and even my shoulders are tense without my knowledge now and then.

An example of that last thing, and what got me thinking of this theory in the first place, happened a normal day at school: I was just walking through the hallway, minding my business and listening to music, all good as far as I know.

Cue a teacher that wanted to talk to me, but since I couldn't hear her, she touched my shoulder. She asked if I was okay, said that it felt really stiff. It wasn't even the only time where I had stiff shoulders without noticing, as I've had people pointing it out more than once, and sometimes helped me correct it.

Still, each time -except for a couple times where I was actually focused on something- I felt as relaxed as I could be. I thought about it many times, to the point where it kinda freaks me out at bit. Should I be worried about it?",03Jan2020,1
1028,"I ran out of money halfway through last semester (school would not offer any assistance), had to withdraw from classes to work in order to survive. That brought me below the SAP requirement for school and the University didn't think needing to eat was a valid excuse for not completing classes, so I do not have any Financial aid. I'm still working my full time trade job, but I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. I work 7 days a week for as long as they want me to work. I don't have any idea what my schedule will be until I'm done for that day. I have some mental/medical problems so require weekly doctor and therapist appointments (which I will lose soon because my Medical care is subject to my full time student status). I'll probably have to quit the job or get fired soon. It's at will employment so they can drop me at any point.

The job is also an hour away from where I live, so sucks up a lot of gas. I don't have enough money to pay for my next month on my apartment and the managers will kick me out soon. Paycheck won't be enough. Even if it was I'm not sure if they'll let me finish out my contract if I'm not taking classes (if they kick me out they'll make me still pay for the contract) I've been trying to find work that's closer, no one is giving me the time of day unless I go for minimum wage, which is not enough to afford housing in the area I live. I don't qualify for subsidized housing. If I do become homeless I'll have to leave my cat with a shelter (assuming they have any openings), which will be a pretty sad goodbye. 

I'll have to start paying off the loans in two months instead of six because of an accounting error on my School's part.

I've struggled with suicidal ideation for a long time, and I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to not follow through. If I lose my cat I will have none. My options are end it now, or be thrust out into the cold with only my car in below zero temps where I'll probably freeze to death in the night in a week or so. 

Of course, I have considered other options, like crime, so I can get arrested and have a place to stay and food to eat. Not that I like that option, and honestly offing myself is more appealing. 

I don't know what to do. I have no-one to turn to, no family, no friends. My religion, which prides itself on helping people, has left me out to dry. Anyone have any advice, good homeless shelters (I live in Idaho), or tips on winter survival?",03Jan2020,3
1029,"I'm 17, almost 18 (M) searching for my first job. I applied to this very promising small company near me, I shopped around and had a conversation on a couple occasions before applying so they're fond of me. I asked for work on the third time shopping and they said they needed it, and to email my application and hours to them, so I did. Yesterday I called asking to check up on my application. The dude that answered said his business partner wasn't there at the moment and said I should expect a call later on that night. Well, said call never came through, probably because they were busy or forgot. So I am wondering what I should say when I call them again today.. I don't wanna sound too pushy and say ""Hello, it's me calling again about the job"" but also don't wanna sound too much like I'm calling for my first time ""I'm checking up on my application status"".

1030,"My grandpa died in the beginning of December, which led to my grandma moving from the Dominican Republic to Florida with my family. They usually would come to visit during the Summer for months at a time and my grandpa died 5 days before they were supposed to come for the holidays.

My grandparents had been married for about 55 years, most of my grandmothers life so this is very difficult for her. They were always alone since they were alone in the Dominican Republic and they were usually alone when they came to visit since my whole family has work and I have school as well as work, but they were alone together if that makes sense. Now, my grandma just feels alone. My grandpa was my grandma’s world so it’s just hard being without her, and it’s hard to ease her into being without my grandpa since my whole family has to work and have things to do.

1034,"This situation needs a heck some context so here it goes. At my school, there’s a program which includes only 15 people, including me. We all have classes together, but split up during 6th period because we have either science or art. As a result, we’re all very close.
During the beginning of the school year, I was depressed because of isolation and a lack of stimulation. I went to the school psychologist and she sent emails to all of my teachers. I’m fine with that, all they did was awkwardly ask “you okay?” 
But my old bio teacher told the science class without telling me. I only know because my friend told me before winter break started. I’m not sure what she said; my friend didn’t tell me. To me, it feels like a huge breech of privacy. Should I confront my teacher? I feel like it’s kinda weird mentioning it now, but it’s really bothering me.",03Jan2020,12
1035,"Hi all! I live in the middle flat in a house. The apartment below mine has 5 people and most of the time they’re fine - not much noise or annoying behaviour. However, one of the really annoying things that they do is put their washing machine on past 11pm. The house all live in isn’t built amazingly well so when their washing machine is on our floor shakes (our bedroom is above this). It’s just gentle shakes - but this continues for 3-4 hours. I’m a light sleeper and the vibrations /movement/noise keeps me up the entire time. We wrote them a nice note months ago to please be mindful of what time they put their washing on as it keeps us awake, but recently it’s been put on quite late. The worst kept us up till 4am a week or so ago. We would have said something then (I was quite angry at that point due to lack of sleep) but they all left for Christmas.

Because there’s 5 people  perhaps not all of them saw the note? Or maybe they forgot? But now that it’s happening again I really don’t know what to do. Is it important enough to go around and say something? Do i write another note? Do I try to ignore it?

I do not really want to go to the hospital (unless it is too dangerous, which I believe it is not) and my parents will not help me with this so I do not what to do.

Is there a good way to sew a cut like this or is it to dangerous to do it by myself?

He was a very secretive man in a lot of pain and very ill, who moved to Washington state for work and a better life. At this moment I have no idea where his body is, we do know that he unfortunately took his own life. He's had a long history of mental illness. My family is expecting me to make most of these arrangements.

My dad only really kept in contact with me, as he wasn't fond of our family. I spoke to him last 2 days ago.

2. We only know that he committed suicide.
3. My family lives in California. We would like to bury him there.

Obviously I want to earn enough of an income to support a family and buy a house eventually but I don’t know what road I should take to get there. I’ve been on the fence for a while about joining the military or doing a trade but every time I feel like I’ve finally found what it is I want to do there’s something holding me back. I feel like I would go all in and then regret that choice and wish I had chosen something else a few years down the road. The longer I wait the more anxious I become. I have a gi bill from my fathers service in the military so I could attend a university of my choice without even taking out loans for the first year or two. I know this is already a head start and I’m very appreciative that I have the opportunity. However with that being said, I don’t want to waste that time on something I’m not sure of and nothing I look into stands out to me. I’m jealous of people who have known what they want to do all of their lives and gone for it because I’ve never had that feeling and the longer I wait the more anxiety it gives me.
