0,"I am 17 years old in 11th grade in a very advanced school. This school isn’t right for me as I am not very smart and have gotten a ~1.3 unweighted GPA for the last few quarters, which is the lowest in my grade at the time. I am completely uninterested in school and do not have any plans for my future that require a degree. My entire family, but especially my mom, is pushing for me to get my bachelors. She is threatening to never talk to me again if I do not go but I feel like its a waste of time and money for me and my interests. What should I do?",09Jan2020,1
1,"This is my first proper post so bare with me.
I’m 16, in Year 11 and I have no idea what I’m doing with my life, well, I know what I WANT to be, but don’t know how I can get there. I believe that I’m a pretty creative guy and I dream of writing and directing some of the biggest movies in the future but I know I can’t because my own stupid actions that I can’t get over. 
I have a condition called dyspraxia, which mostly affects motor skills and other thing like concentration and that’s the problem. My GCSEs is in almost 4 months and I’m scared. I’m scared of letting my family down and not going anywhere with my life. I haven’t even applied for college, most of my friends have their interviews this month, I don’t like interviews because things like that scare me, I hate social interactions. One other thing is that I always procrastinate and never get anything done. I’m scared for the future and my life is going to shit. It’s been over a year since I had this “life changing” break up and I’m still not over it and it’s destroying me. 
I know this is a messy post and isn’t structured that well but I need at least some advice, I know my problems isn’t the worst of the worst and I’ll be able to live with it and it’s no where near what other people go through. I’m sorry if I’m over exaggerating.",09Jan2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have trust issues. I would need constant reassurance from these friends that they were in fact my friends and cared about me. So finally, this pushed them away. One friend, let's call him Gage, won't allow me in chats or forgive me for this ordeal: but meanwhile, there was another guy, let's call him Jim, who did the exact same thing as me and the very next day afterwards, Jim is back in their chats and has been forgiven. I have been threatened by Gage and ""Liam"" (who I'll get to in a min) that they would ""expose"" me if I didn't publicly apologize. These people talk about me behind my back and have pushed me away. Now, ""Liam"" tells me that I can confide in him and all that. Well apparently I confide in him TOO much??? and he threatens to ""destroy"" me. Now keep in mind, these were my only two ""real"" friends. Any advice on how to make it up to them or at least get them to forgive me? I really cared about these people and it hurts that they no longer care about me.

I’m a 19 year old in an all boarding school in my last year and don’t really have any family (family basically abused me both physically and verbally went through a couple step moms who made it worse which has left me cynical and paranoid and with no self esteem or self confidence)(people around don’t know cause I don’t tell them as I would not want this circulating back to anyone) who care about me have a couple friends but don’t want to annoy them with this so turning to reddit 

I never feel happy I’m always in a state of misery or unhappiness or in the good moments I feel nothing (the best feeling i get is in the morning and i guess when I study) the main reason for it is a feeling of hopelessness that I get from the fact I’ve never had a girlfriend(I haven’t known many girls but even my friends is similar situations ended up finding someone)or really anyone who loves me without an alterier Motive and the fear I have is nobody ever will

When the girl was alone we would all hangout and have a good time but if he was there he had her isolated in her room. My biggest question is what do I say to her at the funeral?

17,Me and my mom moved out of state for better job opportunities and to see some family that we haven’t seen in years. While my sister and her spouse and kids stayed in the state we moved from and you may think that it’s wrong moving from family but we lived about 2 hours apart when we were in the same state and rarely seen each other maybe once every 2 months just a bite to eat and say goodbyes. When we moved we called and told her she was upset understandably but we made a promise which we kept up with to see them for at least a full day every month and we would do the drive to them. We come down they have friends over and I’m thinking we should be spending family time together these people they see every day like they made a thing where they go to each others houses every night for dinner. There friends  lived 5 minutes away tops then they sold that house and moved into a house right down the road and bought a golf cart and drive to there house now all the time. I forgot to not we moved back because of how upset she was now we are homeless staying with my moms friend just because of us having no jobs for a bit because of moving back.  All we want to do is see my sister once a week just do something together but she always talks about them or they are over. We went over one day supposed to do something together and what do you know the door opens and they come in totally ignore me and my mom just look at them you guy wanna do something got any plans my sister says no we’re free me and my mom say a quick bye to my nieces and leave. I forgot to mention also when we came down and visted after doing a 10 hour drive to them when we moved to the other state they told there friends we would be here what happens they get a text asking if they can come to dinner with us and my sister made us decide I mean if we turn it down we will sound like jerks but it’s obvious they should let’s us spend time with them even my 5 year old niece said that uncle blank and nanny here to spend time with us we should be with them I’m not making that up what happens they come and talk over us mainly the girl and make it impossible to even talk to my sister or her husband.

21,"I woke up today to a sulfur like smell in my apartment. I trouble shooted all the regular stuff. Took out the trash, cleaned the couple of dishes in my sink, ran the garbage disposal, checked the fridge, pilot lights etc. I aired out the house and it went away, so I closed all the windows and a couple hours later the smell was back in full force.

Apartment maintenance suggested I try and turn on the stove and oven to see if the smell goes away. I told them in no certain terms am I lighting my stove when I think I smell gas lol. So they came over and turned it on themselves and we didn't blow up (yay!). They pulled the stove from the wall and did the bubble test. They didn't say anything about the bubble test but they did say:

""They do smell something faint inside the oven""

And:

""My gas valve is stuck open""

And then they left, reassuring me that if I have a gas leak, my carbon monoxide detector will go off, and that as long as I crack a window open I'd be fine even if there was a leak. They said they will let their manager know and he might want to come by to double check tomorrow. 

My natural gas detector alarm will arrive on Friday. In the mean time, will my carbon monoxide detector actually tell me if there is a gas leak? My bed is on the ground, is it still safe to sleep in my apartment?

Tldr: smelled sulfur in apartment. Maintenance said they smell something faint in the oven and my gas valve is stuck open. Reassured me my carbon monoxide detector will alert me to a leak and that if I crack a window open I'll be safe even if there is a leak.",09Jan2020,1
23,"I [19F] am a second semester sophomore in college and I still haven’t found my group, I haven’t even found my person, or a solid, loyal friend. 

I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m actively trying every day to make new friends and to get closer to the ones I already have made, but it never seems to work. 

I’m involved in my university, I’m nice to everyone I meet, I show people I care about them and their interests, I ask people to lunch or to go hang out or study, and overall I would like to say I could be a really great best friend, but I never seem to be good enough for anyone. 

I’m really really trying to make those connections but it just always seems to not work out.
It’s so hard for me to accept this, and I’m trying to keep a positive outlook, but it just hurts because it feels like everyone is either too busy with different friends or simply uninterested.

I know I’m a nice person, and I know I’m trying, so I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. Also I’m sorry if I sound like a whiny child right now, I would really appreciate some advice or kind words. 

TLDR: I feel like I’m doing everything possible to make friends but I still haven’t found a good one and it’s wearing me down",09Jan2020,1
24,"Okay, so, there is this guy I've been texting for months now. He's amazing, he's funny, he's smart. We talk about all kinds of things, from how each of our days went to our childhoods to things we want out of life. It's confidante level at this point. Nothing is awkward and I always feel like I can be a hundred percent honest with him. He makes me feel really comfortable and accepted. We've grown into really close friends over a relatively short period of time, and his friendship means the world to me. That's an established fact.

We do have a somewhat flirty relationship. He was the one who initiated the flirting, but I was more than happy to keep it going. There's a lot of chemistry there. And I've kind of tested the limits of that a bit and he never rebuffed my advances. Ever. Even when it should have been awkward, it wasn't. And, the more we talked and flirted, the more I caught feelings for him.

We don't ever hang out at his place or mine, but we hang out pretty constantly. And we text frequently. So, of course, using our preferred method of communication, I decided to tell him that I had caught feelings for him. I figured it was better to tell him than to not, and I know all traditional wisdom tells you not to communicate that over text. It's not as personal, you should write it or say it out loud, all of that. I had a note written, a plan laid out, and then, in a moment of bravery, I abandoned the plan and just texted him. And, in spite of conventional wisdom, in spite of the fact that I'd only ever even asked one person out successfully in my life, in spite of my fears and doubts, everything seemed to be going fine afterwards. That would not last.

Lo and behold, I'm texting him a few days later, affectionately as usual, maybe a little more so with the knowledge that he didn't immediately rebuff my attraction for him, and his GIRLFRIEND texts me. A girlfriend I thought he had separated from a long time ago. She tells me that she's his girlfriend and that I need to stop, in so many words. So, not only did she see texts, affectionate texts, that I meant only to be for the person I was sending them to, probably including the ones where I told him I have feelings for him, but I come to find out that my close friend, who I just confessed having feelings for, is in a relationship that I thought had ended a while ago.

What gives? Honestly? I don't understand why he hid this from me. We talk about literally everything else under the sun. I mean, I wouldn't have even remotely considered telling him I have feelings for him if I knew he was in a relationship. I wouldn't have had a hard time giving him relationship advice and being his close friend if I had known that he was still in this relationship. And now I'm worried about him because he's in a situation with this girl who's given him trouble in the past, who had been jealous of him texting me as a friend in the first place, who I thought was his ex, but who, apparently, still lives with him. And I've made it worse. Inadvertently, but I have.

Honestly, I'm so baffled as to how yesterday, I'm just going along, minding my own business, doing normal human things, going to work, talking to my friends, catching feelings for one of them, and today, I'm on the 2020 version of Maury. This is probably the last thing I expected out what was supposed to be a typical Wednesday. I'm pretty caught off guard and not sure what I should be feeling.

So my questions, because this got removed from a different sub for not having specific questions...what do I do? What am I supposed to think about all of this? Honestly, how am I supposed to begin to process my emotions about something I thought was going really well for so long?

Thanks in advance, y'all.",09Jan2020,1

Now some background, this particular friend would only call to tell me something about herself (new car new job etc) and it was only about herself her accomplishments and it would come off as bragging to me (she’s also definitely has only child syndrome lol). Now I’m happy for her and I wish her the best in life but I simply don’t want to be friends anymore.


She just showed up at my house and I told my mom to tell her I’m not here. Petty I know but I hate confrontation. And also the fact that she still shows up like that out of no where I find to be creepy. So I thought distancing myself may give her the hint that I no longer want to be friends but clearly that hasn’t worked.

I’m aware this may seem odd due to how new my account is however I’m afraid people I know irl who look at my account may find stuff about me they’ve never known or something.

I’m worried about losing my friends especially my close ones I just generally feel without them I would just crumble and fall into a mess. For a bit of background information for the past several months I feel like everyone hates me and this constant fear of losing my mates because of these thoughts/voices I get in my head followed my a small migraine which tell me I’m worthless and that everyone you know and love hates you and are completely fake and other stuff these voices tell me. Which makes me incredibly angry towards myself I feel like I can’t do anything right and with this anger I lash out and I have at my parents and several teachers. I’m angry at my family for the situation we’re in and I don’t know why like we have little money and my family is constantly angry at me every time I’m upset and want to be left alone but I feel like they don’t get that, my dad has depression and anxiety along with a few others and he had a car accident a few weeks ago which hasn’t done anything but made everything worse, my grandparents (especially my fathers side) don’t seem to care about me or anything like they can’t seem to give me space when I need it. I’m failing on everything and believe I have little to no future it’s gotten to a point where I just don’t want to be who I am anymore and have done stuff such as harmed myself before and “had those thoughts” I feel worthless I honestly don’t know who to trust anymore, it’s why my friends are so important to me I feel like they’re slowly walking away from me because of these thoughts I’ve been getting. I can just tell in their response and body language they’re bored of me or something and it’s why I question everyone I’m “close with” especially this one girl who’ve I’ve been friends with for several years but I feel like recently she’s bored of me or something. I’m awful at being social and hate myself for failing at such a simple task I just don’t know anymore.
My friends are really the only people who truly help and I just don’t know how to fix it.

40,"THIS IS A LONG POST. COVERS my 8th-12th GRADE EXPERIENCES.


Hi! I’m in high school and play a wide range of clarinets. Most importantly I play B flat clarinet and E Flat clarinet. Clarinet is the instrument squidward plays.

This girl in question, I’ll call Juliet is part of a friend group with three other girls, two of which (Sammie and Avery (fake names)) also play clarinet. Avery has been the chillest of the three since the day I met all three in eighth grade. I won’t talk about her much.

Juliet and Sammie though, we are constantly going back and forth through awkward moments. In eighth grade, I didn’t know them at all since i moved into a new school (their school). I’ve been in their grade till my senior year (this year). 

Many events have happened between Me, Juliet and Sammie. From day 1 (in 8th grade band), they didn’t seem very friendly to me. I even remember being the target of giggles. And so, ever since the first day our relationship together has been a blur. I never initiated any beef between us on my knowledge (or I could have passively but they’ve never said anything). It got to the point I felt like I was being bullied and even went on to call them ‘perished pickles’ on my English blog, something they found out about in high school. Sorry for the incoherent paragraph, but it’s been a couple years so it’s not very clear. They haven’t told me anything and when I ask them what’s wrong they brush it off.

High school came, and all of us enrolled into marching band. An upperclassmen was section leader both times for our first two years, but then our third year, Sammie became section leader (I was unable to due to mountain biking commitments, but I was ready to take the position). She made us do physical punishment for being late or talking on the field..This quickly led me to quit marching band and not do it for my senior year.

Juliet in the other hand was happy Sammie was section leader. Yet when talking to me in marching band or in class, I’d always get the ‘eww stop’ ‘what are you doing’ ‘sToP lOoKiNg aT mE’. It got so bad that I didn’t even know why she was behaving this way, and I cried myself on the way back from marching band state in the band bus.

Our relationship to this day is still not good. Whenever I ask a question to Sammie who sits in front of me in band class present day, she always answers with a kind of ‘wHaT’ so-over-it tone. 

Juliet has asked me to leave her alone multiple times so I try not to talk to her but it’s impossible to do that when she’s giggling at me and my date with her friends during school dances, and is IN MY SECTION playing clarinet WITH ME. Many have told me to just tolerate it, they are insecure etc but I can’t do that. I feel like she’s constantly on my back despite trying to ‘stay away from me’.


It got so bad that I spoke with her through group me a couple months earlier (from today) and she calmed down a bit but now she’s back to normal. She refuses to compromise her behavior with something I can tolerate.

We’ve gotten (me Sammie Juliet and avery) to the most elite concert band group in the school by auditioning in. At this point of such a high playing level, not being able to communicate to one another because I make her ‘uncomfortable’ is extremely uncomfortable to me. We need to speak to each other or we don’t sound good which although doesn’t take a toll on our grade, makes our band director (BD) mad. I’m actually scared of bringing it up to my BD because I don’t want to get in trouble because of what she might say (me annoying her) I feel like I’m in a position where I can’t safely argue how I feel.

Juliet and both Sammie currently have a sassy attitude towards me even though I don’t have a sassy attitude back. I’ve been told to ignore them by friends but it’s impossible. 

I have ADHD so sometimes if I do act weird I can’t help it. It’s of nature who I am.


I cry myself to sleep sometimes because they keep doing this. But I don’t want to report it.
NOTE: I don’t think of suicide... that’s over the top. 

Now with all this said. I don’t know what to do. Juliet blocked me on Instagram, I can’t talk to her as she refuses to speak to me.


Does anyone have any advice on what I can to do to improve the situation please? I’ve tried talking together online because she refuses in person and that doesn’t work.

41,"Last summer I moved into a low-income housing apartment complex. We went from living in a very nice house provided by a family member, to a crappy low-income apartment. And of course low-income housing means low-quality housing. And with me residing in Indiana, one of the states in the U.S. with the worst smoking problems, there are no policies for smoking in my apartment complex??? Despite the fact this is technically public housing for folks with disabilities, families with really young kids, and the elderly?

So my cat and I had a really negative change environmentally. Kiwi is a rescue cat and suffers from FHV (Feline Herpes Virus), and flare-ups can be very expensive and deadly.

The neighbors upstairs and in the surrounding area smoke like fucking furnaces. Cigarettes are regularly tossed on the bush on our patio from the people above. Cigs litter the entirety of the grassy patches. People smoke on the stairwell a few yards from my apartment. The insulation is very poor and I can smell the smoke seeping from the windows, ceiling, and doors. The trash is so terrible that I'm too scared to take my cat for walks in her harness.

I think my cat's herpes is being triggered by the secondhand smoke we are being flooded with. Her eyes are watering and bright pink around the rims, she just began to cough really bad today, and she's sneezing a lot.

I feel absolutely sick and I don't know what I can do. I can't afford the best treatments for her and I don't know how I'd approach the apartment owners. 

Is there anything I can do about this situation? Thank you so much.",09Jan2020,1

Throwaway first obvious reasons, I was going out with a girl who I still love very much, despite some complications during our relationship we were very close to each other.

Another girl enters the picture she’s a friend of both of us and my then GF usually stays with her due to the family problems involving her mom.

But she always ends up going back to her mom for some unspecified reason. 

I later found out that the GF was involved with doing relations with her 12 year old brother.

It came as a complete shock to me.

What I don’t understand is that if she really did do it wouldn’t she have been removed from the home if that happened? It also made sense why she always went back home when she was at our mutual friends house.

When I asked her about it she said her brother started it and if she did it she would have gone to jail due to how old she is or have been removed from the house.

44,"we are a friend group of 4 and we all live together at school. one of them (let's called her J) recently got back together with her ex a few months ago. ever since then, she's being sneaking him around our apartment and always asking us when we're coming back/when we're leaving etc. besides that, their history was that that they would always break up for 2 days and then get back together. obviously our friend group told her multiple times that there's no point in that relationship bc she always complains about him but then never makes a definite move to end it. 

anyways so her always asking me where i was/what time i was coming back was starting to bother me, and i thought i was the only one but i talked to my other friends ( let's call them Y &amp; G) and they felt the same way, although they weren't home as often as me. the whole situation with J and her bf was sus to me and even though she told us she was just ""hanging out with him"" not really dating, i found a receipt in the kitchen where her bf bought condoms, so I knew there was something she wasn't telling us. 

over thanksgiving break, she told me she broke up with him ""for good"" bc he didn't respond to her for like 4 hours, (which to me was kinda sus but whatever), and being a good friend i told her she didn't need him and she should try a new hobby or get out of the apartment so she wouldn't be bored. she told me the reason she kept hanging out with him was bc she was bored and had nothing else to do, so naturally i told her it wasn't fair to her or him to only keep the relationship going bc she was bored. and i strictly told her if she got back together with him again, i would be upset with her, and she said there was no chance of her getting back together. so there i was actually proud of her for stepping up and being an adult about this relationship. i shit you not, literally 2 days after, we were in the kitchen and she jokingly said ""guess who's coming over?"" and i got mad at her and asked her what he said that was so powerful that she started it back up again and she was like ""oh i don’t remember"" so already i knew the same problem was resurfacing. at this point i was visibly frustrated and upset with her bc she can't take anything seriously,  and even asking her about her relationship she would just joke about it. so i started ignoring her bc i really didn't want to deal with her or talk to her.

so a couple weeks after i started ignoring her, she privately asked my two other friends ( Y &amp; G) why i was mad at her. Y was on my side so she simply told J to just talk to me about it, but J said if I had a problem with her i should bring it up myself (even though i literally told her why i would be upset with her. However when she asked G, she told G that i was talking shit about G and her girlfriend, so G threw me under the bus, saying I was talking shit about J and her relationship, and then they bought began to tell each other things that I apparently talked shit about them. Y knew bc BOTH G and J were talking to Y trying to get Y to turn against me, but Y is a real friend and she had my back, and she even told both of them that I wasn't talking shit and in fact G and J, had both talked shit about each other to both Y and me. 

so now, G and J don't know that I know about their scheme and they both called me out in our group chat, but I haven't responded because im so frustrated that they both think they can get away with this like?? Y has my back and this semester J isn't going to be living with us, so its just going to be me and Y against G. However I am really upset, and angry that J and G threw me under the bus,  and that J is trying to get people to go against me, trying to pretend that she doesn't know why I'm upset with her when i clearly told her. My other friends have told me to simply not entertain their accusations and ignore them. I'm a forgiving and nice person, but this time I really just want to go off and explode, but i don't know what I should do, or what the best approach is. 

TL:DR: 2 of my friends threw me under the bus to protect themselves and now are trying to start drama between me and them, unsure how to approach this",09Jan2020,1
45,"We’re both 16 and she’s attempted suicide before when she was 14. I’m terrified. She has depression and she has dark times but this is one of those times where it’s really scary for me and it just seems like there’s a wall around her blocking me from helping her.

her Mom is the main factor in why she feels this way a lot. Today she got in trouble for literally not answering her Mom’s phone call. I was there when she was getting yelled at, it wasn’t her fault at all and it’s ridiculous.

she Didn’t text me for about an hour and randomly sent me this,

“yk how people say like killing your self is bad because your not thinking of other people but i don’t get it because i genuinely don’t see myself being happy while being a adult and like right now laying in bed sleeping and just yk dying makes me happy but like people don’t see it like that it’s just selfish to them. but people always say they want to see me happy. i’d be happy. and people say to not put their happiness before their own. I wouldn’t be doing that”

I told her I didn’t know what to say and I said I love you.. I said I couldn’t imagine my life without her and that I could never imagine what she goes through in her own mind. We then chatted a bit and she told me she was numb to everything and she didn’t care about anything. I told her I would give her some time to do her own thing and now here I am.

I know there isn’t much I can do... and people always say if it happens then it isn’t your fault and that it was gonna happen regardless. Thats true and all but that doesn’t take away any of the pain I would go through if she were to take her own life. It hurts so bad to even think about it. If it happened for real I don’t know what I would do at all..

Please help me",09Jan2020,1
46,"Very brief context: I'm  (23F) in a professional house share with 11 other strangers. We all have our own separate tenancies and our own bedrooms with lockable doors and we share kitchens and bathrooms. I have run into several other tenants in the kitchen etc and exchanged a few words but other than that, none of us really know each other and we are not friends. 

At the time of writing it is about midnight and this happened about half an hour ago. I was sitting on my bed (which faces the door) with the lights on and watching TV on my laptop. I heard someone press lightly on my door (which I leave on the latch when I'm at home and awake in my room as otherwise my door would lock behind me when I go to the kitchen etc) and then after a couple of seconds someoen attempted to open my door. I couldn't see who it was as my light was on and the hallway was dark. The door remained ajar for a few moments before whoever it was (presumably seeing me straring at the door) closed it again and left. No words were exchanged. 

The 2 shared bathrooms on my floor are next to my room so it's normal for people to walk past, however there are only 3 other people on my floor and all of the other bedroom doors are on the other side of the corridor - my point being, it is very unlikely for one of the other people here to have mistaken my door for theirs as there is no other door next to mine and the other rooms are on the other side of the hallway. 

 I know I probably sound paranoid but I just can't think of any reason anyone would have for attemting to enter my door at 11:30pm at night. Like I said, I don't know any of these people. 

I'm trying to tell myself that someone just got the wrong door, but I know that if I was in that situation Id burst through the door, realise it wasn't mine and go ""oh shit sorry!"". The way the whole thing happened so slowly and deliberately kinda freaks me out a bit. 

The way someone pressed on the door before opening it feels to me like someone was testing to see if it was open or not. 

Idk if I'm jsut being paranoid. What do I do?should I email my landlord and let them know or will they just think I'm crazy?

53,"Hi.

I've been talking to a girl from my class for like a month, in that period we hanged out a lot, and we even spent new year together.  
It was obvious that she liked me, and I liked her too, so eventually, one day we decided to cook brownies in my house, and we ended up in my bed, making out. It was all good, I took her to her house and went back to mine. (This was this Saturday) And on Sunday she texted me and told me that she just wanted to be friends and didn't want to be with anyone. I understood it, and told her that I didn't mind.  
The next day, on Monday I texted her, and her responses were pretty cold, so eventually I didn't even responded. The conversation went like this:

Me 5:41 AM: Good day  
Her 2:14 PM: Hii  
Me 3:42 PM: How are you? What are you doing?  
Her 5:58 PM: Fine, im with a friend. How about you?  
Me 6:55 PM: Pretty well, I was kinda bored so I took a walk, i'm going home now. The day is really nice, but the wind is fucking it up  
Her: 10:37 PM: I don't know, I haven't gone out today.  
(It's translated, we speak spanish, so it was not exactly like this)

Today, I texted her if she wanted to go out to dinner, and she said that she doesn't want to, but appreciates the invitation. What should I do? Should I just stop texting her?",09Jan2020,1

62,"So one year I went to this overnight camp for like 5 nights and some people were snoring in the cabin. I was like ""no big deal"" so I put some earplugs in. After that, I couldn't go to sleep. I had never been to an overnight camp before so I was extremely worried. I slept for about 10 minutes at a time each night with an hour in between each rest because I couldn't go to sleep. My parents ended picking me up the day after the incident. I had been ""traumatized"" by it ever since. By ""traumatized"" I mean that every time someone would bring up the words ""camp"" or ""overnight"" I would start stressing out about it in my head. Sometimes it would just come randomly. My second experience with staying overnight is when my mom booked me a trip to an overnight church camp for 2 nights. My mother had told me it was 2 nights but somehow I ended up thinking it was one for the whole first day of the trip and before. (I signed up for this trip voluntarily). So I thought to myself ""Oh, this will be fine (insert my name) I did it before when I was like 10 (I was 12 at the time) you would've grown out of it by now."". I didn't, I was constantly scared after the first night and cried at random times whenever I thought about home. I ended up getting through it I was with other people my age and we stayed up until like 2 every morning playing card games and reading. My next experience with being away from home was when I went to a new school. Every year we have an overnight camp at the beginning of the year. I just started going there and it was my first year there and I only knew 1 person. The camp was for 3 or 5 nights and my friend and his friends were fine being away from home. But I wasn't. I had to fake an ear problem because I had had one a week before and kept continuing it so I could skip camp. I did end up skipping camp but it did take a lot of convincing. I just got done with my first semester at my school and I am already stressing about camp for school.

This evening I went to the grocery store and after I had gotten into my car and was ready to back up I noted a guy standing behind my car. He saw my backup lights but refused to get out of the way. He walked back and forth for a minute then moved. I moved my car a little then had to stop again because, lo and behold, he reappeared. I was stuck. He then turned with his phone in hand and snapped a photo of the back of my car. Startled at this and honestly a bit frightened I continued to back up as he had walked out of view. Before I could get out of the space entirely he walked along the driver side of my car and took a photo of my face while giving me a knowing smile and casually walked off toward his bicycle.

 I can't transfare to a different course as my country only allows student loans of up to 4 years of study - I'm half way through the first year, but it's already paid for so it counts as one year done to the government.

Second semester has just started and I have made a pretty drastic decision to switch to online courses and withdraw from residence so I can live at home while still pursuing my education. First semester was a disaster for me and I had various mental health issues that led to my grades suffering greatly. Many days I would stay in bed for hours and skip classes on a regular basis.

tl;dr: My ex found extremely suspicious stuff on phone that gave her perfect reasons to believe I was unfaithful.  Cut me off completely.  Can't talk to her at all or the police will charge me with harassment.

She was pretty firm about breaking up as thoroughly as possible.  She went through my phone while I slept, found evidence of my infidelity, then kicked me out of her house and went to a friends house herself.  

She went through my phone pretty completely.  She found porn (she wasn't really cool with it and I was breaking her trust with that) but I know the thing that really sent her over the edge was that I had dating app signups registered to my phone.  

The accounts registered to my phone didn't use any my pictures or identity in any way, and they were usually location-spoofed to other continents. They were mainly for short-term goofing off (see what kind of pickup lines attractive people can get away with, that kind of stuff) but I'm not sure she got that far into them.  I believe she saw that I was registered and that was enough for her, and I don't really blame her, but she was so quick to cut me off that I never had a chance to explain.  By the way, I am absolutely ashamed that I did this kind of thing in retrospect.

Another big problem is that I also had a throwaway account that I used to participate in an embarrassing fetish I have that I don't really want to talk about here.  All I will say is that my participation in it was absolutely anonymous, all text and very superficial.  It would have been like if my secret fetish was to be transformed into a horse or something, I guess.  I felt betrayed that she learned about it through snooping.  I might have told her about it sometime but the choice is out of my hands now.  I know why she snooped, I forgive her for it.  I also realize that this may, in her mind, constitute cheating, but I have good reason to believe that she believes I was actually out having sex with other people behind her back.  I am sure of this.

I was able to fire off a couple texts before she blocked me completely and then we were absolutely no contact.

Maybe a week in, she unblocked me on Discord (I discovered this by accident because I had been sending her messages she'd never receive) but she didn't respond to any of them.  They were mundane things like ""I miss you"" but when I told her she was my favorite, she blocked me again and replied ""what an honor"".

Another week goes by and I'm not doing well.  I'm talking to any friend who will suffer listening to me but it's the holidays and they're all pretty busy.  On the 26th, I snapped and sent her an e-mail (it's easy to check if you're blocked on g-mail, so she hadn't blocked me there for whatever reason) that asked if she would please talk to me so we could at least have something resembling a goodbye.  She didn't respond to that either for 24 hours and I e-mailed her two more times over the next two days.  Nothing threatening, violent or especially emotional, just short e-mails that asked if she had gotten my e-mail (stupid thing to do, in retrospect).

Actually, in retrospect I probably burned up most of the possibility of reconciliation every time I reached out to her when she was living through the shock of my cheating.  

Either way, I sent my final e-mail sometime in the morning around 11am.  I had the day off so I took a nap in the afternoon and woke up to police at my door.  They told me that they were there because my ex wanted to stop hearing from me and that she was concerned that I was suicidal.  I was pretty taken aback so I just kind of mumbled my way out of the conversation, promising that I wouldn't contact her and that I wasn't suicidal.  They said ok and left.  

From this point, I felt that contacting her in any way would be a criminal act, but what was more is that it was the loudest and clearest signal to fuck off I have ever heard in my life.

I know that I will be told that I need to let it go and move on with my life, and I know that is probably the best advice in most situations similar to mine.  The trust we had has been smashed and buried.  The police are involved.  She wants nothing to do with me.

But we still love each other.  We miss each other.  We're apart for a stupid reason.  We had been having trouble over the past few years but things were improving.  I don't mean that I was willing to let her pick a movie once in a while or that I remembered to wash my hands or anything trivial.  I mean I was making serious plans to move in with her.  I was saving as much money as I could so that a life together was possible.  I was twisting and breaking my routine to fit more of her into it, even when it wasn't fun for me.  Skipping work to hang out with her, doing couples counseling, spending twice as much time together, being more open about my feelings and more receptive to hers.  We weren't growing apart.  She was my best friend and I miss her so much.

Anyway, I really didn't expect this to be this long, but I wanted to be thorough and I wanted anyone offering me advice to understand how the circumstances are a little different than just a regular breakup.",09Jan2020,1

83,"I need some help. I’m head over heels for a girl at my school and she knows it. I’m getting some mixed signals as to whether she feels the same way. She’s the sweetest, kindest, best person I’ve ever met and I’m having trouble discerning whether she likes me or not.

Signs She Might “Like” Me
-Whenever I make a self-deprecating joke, she puts her hands on her hips and says “I disagree” in a very flirtatious manner. Or, a manner which a wishful thinker like myself would interpret as flirtatious.
-She once remarked that she doesn’t think I’ll stay single for long.
-She has said that she’s connected with me faster than she’s ever connected with someone (she’s an exchange student from Moldova).
-She approached me when we first met, not the other way around.
-She gave me a very heartfelt Christmas present: a handmade ornament with her name and the year, some Moldovan gear, and a book I’d been looking at.

Signs She Might Not:
-She once told me to give her space, in a rather annoyed tone of voice. (For context, I have autism, don’t smell very good, and speak about ten decibels louder than the average human, so I really don’t blame her.) I still don’t know if she meant physical or emotional space.
-She has always referred to me as a friend and she says she doesn’t want to date until she gets older. Now, I have no problem waiting, but I’m afraid it might just be an excuse to not date me? I don’t know.",09Jan2020,1
84,"So just a little background:

I'm a 21 year old black male. I love biking, mountain biking specifically but i use a road bike to commute places. I live in portland, oregon so there are plenty of bikers around and its a great bike friendly town but i work at dick's sporting goods as a bike mechanic and i fucking hate it there. The management is SO corporate and being in there just makes my eyes hurt from how bright everything is. I'm currently and have previously been in contact with an amazing bike shop that I believe would turn my life around in an amazing way.

I've already pretty much got an interview in february when their interviewing ""season"" begins. a few months ago i went in and talked to the hiring manager and he seemed to like me a lot, in fact he went out of his way to mention that they're going to be hiring very soon and that i should drop my resume off asap so i did that the following week but i never heard back from them. Come to find out, it wasn't because they didn't wanna hire me, it was because they couldn't yet and had to wait til feb to even begin. 

Since then, i've been in and out of the shop about 4 maybe 5 times to talk to the guy i talked to the first time about the job (the hiring manager) but i missed him almost everytime until a few days ago i caught him and we talked for a while about updating my resume because a few things changed and he told me i'd be hearing back from them in february, which is awesome as that's not very far away! I've been doing my best to keep showing up once in a while, not specifically to talk about getting the job but just to talk about bikes and random outdoor related stuff. I've learned the named of a few people there, have gotten pretty close with the hiring manager and i've done just about everything that I can think about to give myself the best odds of getting the job. 

tl;dr: me, a young guy that works as a bike mechanic at dick's sporting goods hates his job and wants to get this much better one. I've given them my resume, talked to the manager plenty of times and he gave me a date that i'd be hearing back from them in feb.

**Main question:** is there absolutely ANYTHING i can do to make myself look like an even better fit for the job?",09Jan2020,1

Hi guys. 

I’m gonna make this as short and sweet as possible. 

My bf and I are currently long distance and have been our entire relationship(11 months) and we are already having so many issues. 

Why don’t you just break up then? You’re probably asking right now. 

The reason I am holding back is because I have another trip planned to meet him in the next month. The plane ticket and hotel have already been paid for. I have been trying to wait it out for as long as possible and just bite my tongue, but I’ve been so miserable. I’ve spent almost $400 on a plane ticket so I’m not sure what to do. 

The reason I want to break up is because he treats me with little respect and has called me a cunt before. Which really sticks in my mind even though he has apologized. 

He is controlling and jealous and is always asking who I’m texting, what I’m doing, why I take so long to reply, wants me to tell him every single time a guy messages me on social media. Wants to know all of my social media so he can follow me and keep dibs on me. 

I have a very private Facebook account and he would tell me to change my settings to see who I was friends with. And when I told him I wasn’t comfortable doing so, he accused me and blamed me for hiding people. 

Is constantly making rude jokes or being excessively rude. Rarely compliments me or makes me feel good about myself. 

He sets double standards. 

I have to watch my every joke/sentence around him in fear that I might anger or upset him. He gets mad super easily. 

He blames all of these problems on his past relationships and how he was cheated on and yadda yadda yadda. 

I just need reassurance. I don’t see hope in the relationship. I don’t see us making things work. When we do get along, it’s great. But we fight more than we get along. Which is why I’ve been questioning what I should do. 

There are also so many other details and situations that could be included. Like how he tells me what to do with my hair and body. 

Please help me

87,"So I'm gonna try to keep this brief, sorry if this ends up long but I needed some advice, and apparently Reddit has a advice subreddit, so here I am. I'm a black teen (stating this because parents are different especially when it comes to race, sorry if I upset anyone stating this) and I've recently decided I wanna start to grow out my hair a bit more, my friends told me that I should consider getting braids since they help grow your hair faster and its a pretty neat hairstyle. But when it comes to things like these my parents always say no, before I wanted to get dreads since a handful of my friends had the style and also many rappers I listen to have it, and overall dreads are pretty dope in general. But my parents didn't agree with that sort of hairstyle, so much that my church pastor got involved and literally pulled me over after church to talk about the way I style my hair saying if I keep on doing that I'm gonna end up looking like a Fetish Priest. A fetish priest is basically a crazy person and most originate in West Africa, and apparently mediate between the living or dead or some shit, (sorry about my language) but I don't get how having a certain hairstyle makes you something like that. I get it that having a hairstyle like tht could affiliate me with stuff I'm not, especially to higher authority and what not and could even cost me a Job, but I just kinda find it stupid how they're stereotyping hairstyles like that, they even think all rappers take drugs/have drugs issues and are crazy. And apparently if you have a hairstyle like that it means you do drugs which is kinda fucked to put it that way. Anyway, my school has a cosmetics room and its pretty neat, you can get a haircut, dreads twisted and braids done there, I talked to the teacher there and she said I can come in tomorrow or Friday. But the thing is, I don't know if my parents would approve or not if I got that hairstyle, the braids I'm looking to get are box braids, mine would be small since my hair isn't too big but it'll grow eventually. Now enough story and onto the Advice, Should I ask my mom tomorrow if I can get my hair braided? Now that I think about it, I feel like there's a chance that she wouldn't mind, but there's also a chance that she would mind, I really just wanna go get it done and then come back home, but I have Church on Sunday so I wouldn't be able to hide it completely. There are adults who have braids and even dreads who go to my church. But not only that, in the event that I did go and get it done and come back, my mom could always unbraid it. I just really wanna get the hairstyle, it's not even that bad and where I come from, many kids my age have it. But even if e and my parents don't get along, I still respect them no matter how hard it is. Please give me your advice below and I'm really sorry this was longer than intended, I just wanted to go full out.",09Jan2020,1
89,"I'm a M23 who has been practically single my whole life. I'm average looking with a good sense of style and good friends im not overweight and i am fit. I have my head screwed on I've almost finished my degree and I'm working part time. I also live out of home. I do suffer with some anxiety. I lost my virginity when I was 20 from a girl of tinder and then slept with a few girls after that. I finally managed to find someone that I connected with last year. However she had many issues which I knew but I dated her for the reason of being with someone. While it was a good experience I shouldn't have dated her. She ended up cheating on me. Fast forward 6 months and I can't get laid or get a date. Until 2 months ago I ended up meeting up with 3 different girls and I ended up sleeping with all of them. The first girl I wasn't interested in anymore the second girl we almost got in a relationship but it was very rushed and I was very needy. The third girl we went on 3 dates and on the third date I asked her what she was looking for and she told me she wasn't sure and she was going on holiday for 8 months. I said to her I don't want to get attached to you if you aren't looking for a relationship and I told her Its best not to see each other she suggested friends but I don't want to get attached to someone I've already slept with and romanticized. Am I the problem in that situation?should I have been friends with her? 
Fast forward 1 week since then and I have deleted all dating apps as I believe that my problems stem from my neediness but Its because I crave emotional and physical intimacy with someone that I love which I don't have. Yet I can't seem to find someone that wants to date me as much as I want to date them

91,"background: i am currently in a non-honors science course(i was supposed to be honors but my schedule was messed up) and the class itself is called Living Environment. it is quite a easy class for me as i find the material really repetitive from my class last year. my class usually have 4-9 students with high marks and the rest with average and lower marks. 

the kid next to me in this class is one of my closest friends boy friend. in my opinion, he is quite annoying sometimes but alright other times. the problem is he has been copying all my classwork during class and on the last test he was clearly cheating off of me. we had a test just yesterday and i wasn’t 100% sure whether he was cheating yesterday. i know he was cheating on the last test since he was VERY CLEARLY looking at my paper and moved my folder divider thing that covers my space. not to mention every time i flipped a page he would to and if i glanced at his page he’d always be on the same page as me. and yesterday’s test was Part B to Part A of the test that we already took. Part A was taken on a day i wasn’t here. Part B was taken yesterday. he received a much lower score on Part A(the one i wasn’t here for) and then on Part B we received the same grade. 

the problem is that obviously he’s my friends boyfriend and i kind of feel shitty being a “snitch.” the thing is that i personally feel like he’s bothering me and making me feel very rushed as i don’t like the idea of someone cheating off of me and talking to me purely because i get higher grades. and yesterday i received a grade in the lower 90s when i usually get high 90s and although this may seem insignificant it brought down my grade since a lower grade compared to my usual ones brought it down and it scares me because i associate my worth with my grades and i do not want him to continuously negatively affect me. i know i may sound over dramatic and seem like a weird person but i just truly hate this because when i was more of a nerd and shy in elementary school everyone would use me for my “smarts” and it just brings back bad feelings. 

now the problem is i don’t want to be a snitch, my friend would probably think i’m over dramatic and say i’m stupid, and also i don’t necessarily want him to get in trouble by my teacher i just want to be able to take my stupid tests in peace and not try and rush through it so he can’t cheat off of me. 

advice and opinions please?",09Jan2020,1
92,"So I’ve been seeing this girl for about a month now. Let’s call her Laura. We met on Tinder and immediately decided to go out for coffee. Nothing too lavish. 

First of all let me say this girl is wonderful. I was smitten from the moment I laid eyes on her. Beautiful blonde hair , eyes you could get lost in forever, a singing voice that the birds envy, you know the rest of the sappy cliches. To top it all off, she has a wonderful sense of humor and is just the sweetest person you will ever meet. And she likes me back! We finished our coffee and decided we wanted to go see a movie. It was clear that both of us didn’t want the night to end as soon as it did. 

I went home for Christmas break and we spent the next few weeks texting back and forth, every day and night. Upon returning, she invited me over to her cousins’ place. We played cards, she made spaghetti, and we watched OUAT (her favorite) until 2 in the morning. 

But here’s the trouble. 

Up until today, she helped pay the rent on her cousins’ place. She texted me earlier today though, saying that she was moving into a camper and that all she needed was land to put it on. Currently she works behind the counter at a gas station and struggles to make ends meet. 

As a near-broke college boy myself, I feel what she’s feeling. I’m in my last semester and currently training to become a teacher. As we all know, teachers don’t get paid a whole lot, especially here in the state of Texas. And public-school teaching is not my endgame. I just want to save up enough money to put myself through grad school and eventually become a professor of history at some fancy-pants university. Gone be a rough few years but I think I’m equipped for it. 

Unfortunately, I don’t know if Laura has any ambition beyond working at a gas station and living in a camper for the rest of her days. Ive asked her what she wants to do before, and she vaguely states that she wants to work with kids. Who knows what that means? 

I want to spend all the time in the world with this woman, but I don’t know what’s in store for us down the line. I can’t support her, not on a salary like I’m counting on for the next few years. I’ll barely be able to support myself. The last thing I want to do is hurt her though. 

I have to make a decision on where I want to work and live by the end of this semester. I start a real job next fall.

And kids relentlessly call me stupid but then will praise my intelligence when they want answers to tests from me.

I became friends will x at the beginning of the school year because I share 5 (now 4)classes with her. At the beginning, she was pretty cool, but she had this constant want to influenced me to strive to be popular which isn't inherently bad but just a small thing. Over time she has had a lot of crushes, flirting with them even though she had a bf at the time, including flirting with my crush who she knew was my crush. but when I was telling her I was going to ask him out she said don't because it will ”ruin the friend group.”She CONSTANTLY talks bad about everyone she knew including close friends and me. She would instigate or antagonize lots of arguments often taking them too far and degrading peoples opinions in the process. even more recently she has been making fun of my opinions ( food, music, and other insignificant things) and physical appearance such as clothing or make up and occasionally weight ( which is a no no topic for me)

I have been friends with Z for 4 years, he knows a lot of sensitive things about me and will mention them out loud to others or in conversation.

He had a crush on me for 3 years (never officially confessed his feelings but tells everyone he knows), and when he found out I like this dude he tried to get him a gf so he wouldn't go out with me, z has now forgiven my bf for dating me but has not forgiven me for dating my bf He often talked and still talks about me as if I was an object that could be manipulated or a misbehaving pet when talking to friends ( I found out from a good friend I have). The reason he stopped having a crush on me was because I had ”changed into a concited piece of shit” and was ”vsco because I had airpods, a kanken backpack, and wore overalls” ( I have fake airpods that are bright pastel pink, and I have never worn overalls in it life. I wear black almost everyday and have never worn a baggy t shirt or even shown my legs at school) x also makes fun of me constantly for being vsco, in a negative way, it’s meant to be an insult.

Right now z has a crush on x. Z has stopped talking to me. but he is still making fun of me and constantly talking bad about me. X mocks me to my face and makes me feel like I'm insignificant. How do I get this to stop

P.s this is high school, it's very petty and has its of drama

I have an eating disorder and knowing I can put this sweater on to cover my body if I need gives me a great deal of relief. But I know it would probably make her very happy if I let her borrow it for a while, and I want her to be happy. The thought of parting with it just gives me anxiety and I’m not sure what to do.

112,"So about a month and nearly 2 weeks ago, I got a girlfriend. We talked over Messenger for a week before meeting face to face for the first time. It went really well and we had 2 or so more dates where we just gossiped about random things.

I live with my dad as ever since my grandmother and recently, his dog passed away and I wanted to stay close to him. He eventually did find out I had a girlfriend and asked me if she was nice and I said yes. So some days later, he told me over text “You can bring her over as long as you tell me so I know ahead of time”. So I tell him I’m gonna bring her over to stay the night one day and he was fine with it. I put on a movie and we had quiet sex. Everything went fine till recently.

Christmas Eve, me and my dad both got $50 Golden Corral gift cards. I used mine to take her out to eat as it was Christmas Eve. We went a second time some time later for a random date night and I saw someone I knew family wise and he told me to tell my dad hi so I did. Later on, that same family member told my dad my girlfriend is chubby. Keep in mind, she’s 5’6 and 150 pounds and he ripped into her to me saying saying I can do better than that. This immediately pisses me off cause she is not chubby or even overweight.

My dad also threw up to me the time she came over to our house that night and tried to say he heard us having sex. Then changed it to “she was sprawled on the bed naked not even covered up”. That’s not even true cause after sex, she put on some shorts and we watched movies for the night. Let’s get to recent events, I came by in the middle of being with her to give him a sleeping pill cause he somehow “misplaced” it. While giving it to him, he asked me if I was going to stay the night with her and I didn’t think about it, but thought what the hell, why not? He even text me while I was over there if I was going to stay Wednesday which I said no cause I had to work the next night.

So I come home at noon and he acted like I stabbed him in the back. Kept saying how disappointed he was in me and how I don’t stay the night over at her own house. Kept throwing around the chubby comments and literally felt like shit afterwards. He seems to think she wants me to get her pregnant and will ruin my life even though the sex was with a condom always. I’m 27 too by the way, so I know this shit already and I’m only older than her by 4 months. He even said I should treat girls with the 3 F’s (Find her, Fuck her, Forget her)

Sorry for the long post, just wanted to give some backstory. He has already expressed he don’t want to meet her and I’m tired of the shitburgers I have to eat over stuff he suggested or even told me to do beforehand.

118,"background: i am currently in a non-honors science course(i was supposed to be honors but my schedule was messed up) and the class itself is called Living Environment. it is quite a easy class for me as i find the material really repetitive from my class last year. my class usually have 4-9 students with high marks and the rest with average and lower marks. 

the kid next to me in this class is one of my closest friends boy friend. in my opinion, he is quite annoying sometimes but alright other times. the problem is he has been copying all my classwork during class and on the last test he was clearly cheating off of me. we had a test just yesterday and i wasn’t 100% sure whether he was cheating yesterday. i know he was cheating on the last test since he was VERY CLEARLY looking at my paper and moved my folder divider thing that covers my space. not to mention every time i flipped a page he would to and if i glanced at his page he’d always be on the same page as me. and yesterday’s test was Part B to Part A of the test that we already took. Part A was taken on a day i wasn’t here. Part B was taken yesterday. he received a much lower score on Part A(the one i wasn’t here for) and then on Part B we received the same grade. 

the problem is that obviously he’s my friends boyfriend and i kind of feel shitty being a “snitch.” the thing is that i personally feel like he’s bothering me and making me feel very rushed as i don’t like the idea of someone cheating off of me and talking to me purely because i get higher grades. and yesterday i received a grade in the lower 90s when i usually get high 90s and although this may seem insignificant it brought down my grade since a lower grade compared to my usual ones brought it down and it scares me because i associate my worth with my grades and i do not want him to continuously negatively affect me. i know i may sound over dramatic and seem like a weird person but i just truly hate this because when i was more of a nerd and shy in elementary school everyone would use me for my “smarts” and it just brings back bad feelings. 

now the problem is i don’t want to be a snitch, my friend would probably think i’m over dramatic and say i’m stupid, and also i don’t necessarily want him to get in trouble by my teacher i just want to be able to take my stupid tests in peace and not try and rush through it so he can’t cheat off of me.

This whole post started with watching some Dr Phil if you would believe it and the ways people have messed up their lives, while I see myself in them and their inability to cope with their problems, I don't want to blame others. I don't want to look up one day and see someone who wasn't able to solve my own problems. I live with my parents and they've always been there for me. I try to hold down a job, I've had fairly good jobs in the past but left because of anxiety and drama in the workplace. I live in a small town, maybe thats an excuse, but I can't seem to find a place to work without people bringing up the past and inserting themselves into my life. I want a simple existence, my father has MS and I have to be around to care for him eventually. I'm 100% okay with that, it just adds so much pressure to my life to go ahead and get a start to stop relying on them. They pay for my doctors appointments and medication, food, and my car insurance. They even give me spending money from time to time for the things I need or want. My mother has mental health issues as well, and our dynamic over the years has gotten increasingly unhealthy as I try to find myself and she works through what she's been going through the past 30+ years. She has bipolar and will go from being my friend one moment to my own worst enemy. She insults me, and then the next day she'll apologize and tell me she loves me. I can only take so much.

My mother told me the otherday she wanted to kill herself because of me, over a misunderstanding about a protein shake that was thrown out. I asked her to stop speaking that way to me because I'm her son and it was making me anxious. She exploded and told me it was my own fault and that I'm worthless. I haven't spoken to her in 4 days, even when she tries to apologize I ignore her. I realize that's not the healthiest way of dealing with it but I'm ready to give up. My father tells me to just say ""okay"" when she's manic as that's what he does. I've been saying ""okay"" the past few years and I try and try to keep going but I'm tired of just saying okay.

127,"So there is a kid at my high school (junior) who has, for the last year, attempted to essentially bully me into hitting him. This kid has been nonstop trying to get me to fight him for well over a year now and I have told him hundreds of times that I will fight back if he comes at me however I won't be the one to start it. He seems to not understand this concept and continues to attempt to annoy me into throwing the first punch. Any advice?

Background info: I am not worried about actually fighting him. Despite him being older, I am in FAR better physical condition. He is very fat and shorter than myself (which is sad considering I'm only 5ft 7). Over the past year and a half I have lifted every day, and currently bench 220 as a sophomore (which is on par with the seniors wrestling at my school). I have good and visible muscle and box in my basement gym every day after I lift. The issue is I am a straight A student (and have been throughout my entire school career) and have a good reputation with the teachers. I am beginning to see all my hard work pay off and don't want to mess up my future over something as stupid as this, considering I don't even know what his reasoning for wanting to fight me is. It is clear he doesn't have a very good future to look forward to, as he has been talked to by the police on multiple occasions for beginning fights with very weak individuals who wouldn't defend themselves. He was told that the next time he gets in a fight he will be sent to juvenile detention. I also haven't talked to this kid (outside of the hallway when he is trying to start fights) for well over said year.

130,"I (17M) have known this person (18F) for about a year now. We met in school last year, got to know each other during some shared classes, and kept in touch after she graduated. I never considered her a close friend but she was a fine person to hang out with at school. I don't have many friends, so I enjoyed the company.

A few weeks ago we hung out outside of school for the first time. While we were hanging out I had an alright time, but afterwards I just felt really strange, I don't quite know how to put it. Something about our time rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't mention anything to her. Earlier today, she called me and we just chatted on the phone for 30 minutes. I pretended like I was having a good time talking to her but I was reminded of how I felt after we see hanging out, and I felt the same way.

I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it. I never got the feeling when we hung out at school, but it's really bothering me now. I think it comes from a couple of things. I never considered her to be a friend I would maintain a relationship with after school, I never considered us that close, but she seems to want that. She seems really invested in maintaining our relationship and I pretended like I was too, so I kind of feel like I'm in too deep now.

We also have some interests in common but our personalities don't really mesh. I have an unfortunate tendency to adopt the personality traits of the people I'm around, and I also tend to construct a certain persona around different people (I have Asperger's and this has pretty much always been my coping mechanism for fitting it, and I only know two people who I feel completely genuine and comfortable around) and I just don't like who I become when I'm around her. She's not a bad influence or anything, she just has some (to me) obnoxious tendencies and is way too invested in drama. Generally I'm a chill, soft-spoken, and (I like to think) academic type, but oftentimes loud, extroverted people like her bring out a loud and extroverted personality which I really despise in me. It's also pretty exhausting. I guess I just don't want to have a long term friendship with someone I have to pretend around. Typing this out has actually made me more sure what it is that bothers me about spending time with her.


I don't know how comfortable I feel with telling her all this, as it's essentially admitting that I lied to her, and I don't know if she'll believe me anyway. A couple months ago she told me has psychosis, and for a few days afterwards she thought that I was disturbed by it or viewed her differently (I wasn't and I don't, it's not my business what other people suffer from and I'm not one to judge). I'm worried now that if I tell her I don't really want to be her friend, she might think I'm lying about why. I'm also debating just holding out until I graduate this year and then either telling her, ghosting her, or blocking her number then, I'm less likely to do the latter two as I feel like she's owed some sort of explanation. I just don't know if I have the energy to keep this up until graduation, especially as this is my last semester of high school and I've got a lot going on that needs my attention more. Part of me wants to just stop talking to her, by either ghosting or blocking her, now, but I still might run into her while I'm still going to this school and I don't want anything to become awkward. But I'd be willing to take the chance and bear with it if it's my best option.

It's not about the fact that she's a girl, either (the only two people I'm comfortable around are both girls), just wanted to make that clear. I think it just comes down to the fact that I don't like who I act like around her or her personality in general. If anyone has any advice on how I could break it to her and when I should do it, it would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr befriended someone last year and didn't see it going anywhere, now she seems to think we're really good friends when I don't want us to be. The persona I put up around her is exhausting and I just don't think we're truly that compatible as friends.

I tried breaking it off November but he made it so hard for me to put my foot down, he came to my house crying and was texting my mom. And the few days that I was single I started texting my friend and I caught STRONG feelings feelings for him, and we’ve been talking since. But then I went back to my boyfriend (I’m stupid Ik). But idk how to be firm with him. He’s very sensitive. And idk if I should wait till after the trip or do it before? Or even how to talk with him about.",09Jan2020,1
137,"So at the beginning of December i had blood drawn so the doctors can find out what’s wrong with me and the nurse said that we’d get the results in a month. A day or two after that i started taking aspirin everytime i had a headache or pain(many times a day) but a week or two ago i read that once daily aspirin can thin blood and can cause certain symptoms(i already had them, they just got worse with the addition of cold hands/feet, bleeding for way longer times than normal and fainting a few times ). I told my mom and she said we’d have to wait for the results to get back. I told her the effects of the 7-10 daily aspirin that i had taken after the blood drawing but she paid no attention. Two days ago we got the results and the doctor said i was fine and that my blood count was normal but me and a group of friends did an experiment to test it and we got the results i expected

Before the blood test, i had accidentally cut my hand and it bled for about 10 minutes so we cut our left hands(not very deeply so no serious damage or scars would happen) and my friends bled for about 1.5-2 minutes while my hand bled for about 5 and bled through a few wraps of bandages. I told my mom that my blood is thinner than it used to be but she still doesn’t listen. How can i convince her? 

Also, i did stop taking any aspirin pr medicine like aspirin",09Jan2020,1
139,"Context : 
I'm (F24) my husband is (M24). We've been together for 4+years.
We have 2 kids (M8) and (F1½), the boy is biologically mine but raised by my husband.
My husband has only 1 Brother, just them and their Mom and Dad.

History:
When we first started living together we went to live with the in-laws, just for a few months while we were looking for an apartment to rent.
At the time we only had (M8).
At this apartment we were living the three of us + his mom and his dad, his brother would come and stay every other weekend since he works in another town.

We've always been protective and careful with our son, he only gets babysitted by my mom only person we really trust, therefore We never left him alone under any circumstances with my husband's brother: Jay.

After a month living there one afternoon I was putting away laundry and I noticed I had less panties I remembered, started searching for them and didn't find them, thought I would ask my hub when he got back from work.
I went to the bedroom my mother inlaw and Jay shared and I found my panties on his drawer next to his bed, started opening the drawers and found 4 of them they were stiff and obviously covered in semen.
My husband gets home I talk bout it with him, He exploded in anger, broke a frame and kept punching the walls screaming and crying, he finally lies in bed still crying and barely getting the words out of his mouth says : ""he rape me, he is a sick pervert"". I didn't know what to do, Jay did this to him when he was 6 to 11 years old, they shared a room, and my husband never told anybody, I noticed his relationship with his brother was a lil distant but never imagined this was the reason, Jay always referred to my husband as a troubled kid. That night we talked to his mom, she didn't belive anything, my panties or my husband abuse. We decided to leave the next day, after that years went by and we are at our own home and didn't saw his brother ever again.

The thing is, his dad is a very sexual person, always doing sex jokes or talking about woman if he finds them attractive, it's really gross and my husband is ashamed of it, his dad showed him sex stuff at a very young age, and they exposed my husband to a very unsafe space for a kid.
My husband has dealed with all that trauma from his past now since we've been parenting. 

A few weeks from now, I knew my father in law was a suggested profile on insta, since I have his number in my phone. I don't follow him, but just out of curiosity I saw who he followed, what a surprise a lot of teen girls, and porn actresses. 
That was a month before me and my hub realized he changed his name to a fake one on his Facebook and Instagram, and also noticed he no longer follows any teen girl, he started to talk about this with my hub he said he suspects its because of some gross shit. 
He used to be always telling my husband on the street pointing out the hot woman around and sending him photos of sexy woman n stuff, my husband told him to have respect and stop it, he did. 
The thing is while we were talking about the whole name change, my husband confessed two this, 1.- he is always alert in case his dad looks at my body and he has, my butt and my boobs, I have even caught him looking, grosses me out and I stay in a different room.
2.- Months ago my Hub used his dad's phone and the last thing searched and opened was ""uncle and niece sex stories"".
My husband says all he can do is Never ever leave any of our child alone with him, but for me is taking away my sleep I can't stop thinking about it, we have our lil girl she is almost 2 years old and when he comes to see her all I can do is be alert all the time it's killing me, I don't know what hoes throw his mind.

What should we do?, I'm so scared and grossed out.

Oh and plus he even checked out my mom and talk about her legs and is really creppy and gross with her.

141,"I have distant myself from my group of friends since 2015. They still contact each other. I five simply outgrown the relationships and don’t have a connection with them anymore (but I don’t think I ever really did). One of them use to constantly call me and show up at my house randomly because I wouldn’t answer her. Now some background, this particular friend would only call to tell me something about herself (new car new job etc) and it was only about herself her accomplishments and it would come off as bragging to me (she’s also definitely has only child syndrome lol). Now I’m happy for her and I wish her the best in life but I simply don’t want to be friends anymore.


She just showed up at my house and I told my mom to tell her I’m not here. Petty I know but I hate confrontation. And also the fact that she still shows up like that out of no where I find to be creepy. So I thought distancing myself may give her the hint that I no longer want to be friends but clearly that hasn’t worked. It’s been 5 years now and she still tries to contact me here and there (we’re both 27). So my question is how would you handle such a situation?",09Jan2020,1
142,"We had a weird relationship in the past, we would hang out almost every night and stay out until the dawn, we talked a lot and knew everything about each other. We kissed once but as time passed by we started seeing each other less and less but remained friends on whatsapp, she eventually found a boyfriend and we stopped talking. That was like 2 and a half years ago. I went to study abroad and I came back to my home town few weeks ago, she found out and long story short she sent me a message and we went out later that night. We went for a walk and took a seat on the beach. All the time she was giving me compliments and gave me (at least in my opinion) hints. Telling about how we should’ve hooked up before, how I’m the only person she could really talk to and for me it felt like we never stopped hanging out. I laid down and she laid next to me and hugged me, every now and then she would pinch me with her long nails, choke me in a sexual way, and blow in my ear. I looked her in the eyes and got closer to her wanting to kiss her but she moved her head. After that I stopped trying to kiss her because I didn’t want to push her or anything. After that we talked a bit and went home. Does anyone know what should I do or what had happened?

143,"Hello everyone I hope you can help me. So I was using this dating app (which everyone is 18 plus) and this is the following conversation

Her: you are very cute
Me: I’m i? 
Her: is that wrong to say?
Me: no It just caught me by surprise. 
Her: it’s cool where you live?
Me:  I state the city.
Her: she states her city.
Me: oh cool you are about 10 minutes from me.
Her: I’m going to log off because I won’t have WiFi and we should text?
Me: without thinking I give her my number
Her: does not reply again.


My first red flag was when she said if my city was in the Texas and anyone with common knowledge would know that information. Second red flag was when she stated that she was logging off the app and wouldn’t have WiFi but could text her and I thought to myself why can’t use data to use the app. So I didn’t get text from her the rest of the night and the next day in the evening. They take our phones away and I don’t get to see it after work. When I got my phone I had a message from unknown number. It first started by calling me not by my real name. Not even closed. Saying that it was the girls father and that he was very upset that I was sending private pictures to her and that she was a minor and that it was child pornography and that he wanted to talk to me man to man and if I didn’t respond in 10 minutes he was going to turn in the evidence to the police. Which I didn’t reply since I didn’t have my phone. I block all the numbers and deleted all my profiles but now I’m scared as any accusation like that can hurt someone career. I didn’t send her anything at all. Besides the stated above conversation. I’m thinking I’m being harassed for money or something. But since I never called back or texted back and deleted everything I’m at a lost. When I gave her my number the red flags rang in my head and told her I gave her the wrong number and change two numbers but still no reply until I got the dad message. I need help.",09Jan2020,1

145,"So I live on Long Island and I’ve grown up here for 19 years of my life. I’m currently in college as a nursing major and honestly doing pretty well academically. I’m a commuter student, which makes maintaining my friendships and relationship relatively easy.

However, my family has recently sold our house and now moved into 2 bedroom apartment, which just barely fits all of us (mom and my sister sleep in the same bed). We’re here for the rest of the year, and my mother and sister will soon move to another state with my father. They’ve given me the option to stay, for which I am EXTREMELY grateful for. I’d continue to commute to school and work my job, then pay for groceries, and eventually pay full rent, which would be difficult but manageable for sure. I’d struggle initially but it’s bound to happen eventually I’m not afraid of the responsibility. I just don’t know if I should move with them or stay...

My girlfriend, life long friends, and school is here. Dealing with not living where I once did is definitely difficult because it’s been very hard on my parents financially and emotionally, and they so badly want me to join them in moving away. But I’d be abandoning everything I grew up with. I don’t want to come off as weak or entitled, but it’s killing me and everyone I ever ask for advice just gives me a biased opinion..",09Jan2020,1

today we were on xbox together with one of his friends. in the middle of the game he just asked if i was a liberal and i said yes. then his other friend just says that he supports trump. i said ok, i respect ur opinion but let’s have a friendly debate. then i brought up a couple points and before i knew it they were yelling at me and calling me a libtard and shit. i then realized i didn’t wanna talk about it anymore. so i said that. but they didn’t care. they kept talking about it and eventually i was yelling at them too to shut up. i didn’t want to talk about it, but they wouldn’t stop. they said, we will stop if you give us one good reason why trump is bad. i knew they weren’t gonna listen to anything i said, so i just unplugged my headset.

i don’t know i just want to be done with this friendship. it’s just not working out. but i don’t know how to do it. he isn’t gonna take it lightly. i’ve told him secrets that he will definitely use against me for sure. i’m just afraid - i have him in three periods at school. help",09Jan2020,1
147,"So about a year ago my friendship with my best friend started to struggle. It’s a complicated situation but I’ll try and break it down a little. So I’ll call my best friend B, her and I met at the middle of our junior year of high school (March or so 2018). We hit it off right away and even though we had different lifestyles we were super close friends. About August of that year I begin to meet her friend group more, her best friend since freshman year will be named K. K was one of her only friends that still included her in everything because B dated a boy in the friend group that was the main person, what he said went. So of course B and K got more close, and the three of us actually started to become decent friends. 

Now here is where it gets complicated, K was involved with drama, but she was very easily manipulated. In drama there was a main girl that we will call S, she controlled K with most everything and S hated me because of reasons I still don’t know, I asked in person and she literally walked away. I suspect that it’s because I was dating her ex best friend, he realized how horrible of a person she was and in turn she made his life hell. Well anyway, S knew that K was good friends with B. S knew that B was my best friend, so S decided to threaten K to not be my friend anymore. Shortly after (February 2019 or so) K blocked me on social media and it was obvious S was behind it, which made B very uncomfortable. At about March B stopped talking to me and basically ghosted me. Whenever I’d see her she’d look embarrassed and walk away. In May I confronted S because at this point she’s making up rumors about me and this is ridiculous. She walks away from me after denying having anything to do with B not talking to me anymore, and an hour later I check and B blocked me on social media as well. That’s just too coincidental. 

Well time goes past and now B and I go to the same community college in our city, we live and work near each other, and I miss her like crazy. S isn’t as close of friends with K anymore, and K and B aren’t very close anymore either. I’ve seen B grow as a person and get happier and she’s gotten a better job, employee of the month, lost weight, made good friends, and I’m just overall really happy for her. I want to reach out but I’ve reached out in the past with no answer, that was also when that whole situation was still strong though. I was thinking of sending her a card and a gift for her birthday (March) just saying I miss her and I hope she’s well. I’ve tried to just move on but even my therapist agrees that this is a shitty situation and this was just so “high school”. She even said that it may be good to reach out. But I’m wondering how, what should I do? I miss her like crazy",09Jan2020,1
148,"Hello everyone! I know this is the textbook definition of a first world problem, but, I feel like trying my chance of getting an advice here. TL;DR at the bottom

So recently I am slowly getting my life together: got a job, survived a hard semester, and deployed my first project.  
And as I progressed, I figured I wanted to build a community mostly based on a discord server styled as a ""nerd guild"", one that starts with around the users/supporters of my projects, and extend into a whole community of people collaborating with and helping each other online(mostly coding, art, and music since they are what I do/like), playing games together, and making new friends. I envisioned it to be a hub for people to come together and hang out, having voice chat parties, and playing/streaming video games every night.

Then I figured, such a community usually only exist as a discord server based on top of a medium sized youtube channel with maybe 10k-300k subscribers. And even my friend whom I streamed with agrees ""yea that's the usual way to go about it"".

So I figured, ""might as well give it a try! If I succeed I can get extra income as well!"" And I even have idea for contents, (very)basic knowledge of video editing, and can design my own insert graphics. I mean, which 00s kid doesn't have a youtuber dream? Alas I know, the chances I become even moderately famous is very low, not negligible, but not high.

The point is:  
""the most important aspect of being a youtuber, is passion, without it, your viewers will know you are half ass-ing it, and you will burn out being bored"" - every famous youtuber ever  
While I do have, to a degree, the willingness to work hard and receive criticism, and I know most people will succeed if they do put in extra hard work surviving the dormant period. I have no confident in my passion, I already know I will do a tactical withdraw once I can't get famous for like maybe 1.5-2 years and I figured I will earn more money + be happier if I eventually get a job/start a business in my favorite trade.

""Know your enemy and know yourself, and you need not fear the results of a hundred battle"" - Sun Tzu  
Thing is I just don't want to fight a battle without knowing my opponent or how to win, wasting time, money, and energy and gaining nothing  
Yet, I still yearn for building a community as described in the second paragraph

I want to know what to do.

And if you read all the way until here, thank you for your attention. &lt;3

TL;DR: I want to build a community so I can have companion and am contemplating starting a youtube channel, but I think I might be reversing the order of operation or waste resources not succeed at being a youtuber, what should I do?",09Jan2020,1
149,"I have no marketable skills I flunked out of college years ago because I am worthless trash who couldn't get their act together. I had always saw it as a blessing because my dad was dying and my mother couldn't afford to pay her bills. 

so I started working which wasn't easy as it took my mother pulling every string she could to get me a job as a janitor working full time for minimum wage. I did the job well enough that a supervisor at the factory offered me a job since I always went the extra mile and I started operating a forklift for 12$ an hour. two years later the factory shut down and I was laid off. I bounced around a few jobs over the past year or so being laid off.

As time goes on its become more apparent that my mother and I are barely making our bills and I honestly don't see her living a lot longer so when she passes away I'll never be able to make the payments. she owns the house but its worthless the floors are caving in. we already sealed a few rooms off

I can't go back to school because I don't make enough to pay to go part time and I can't make enough money from a part time job to go to school full time. I can't go into the military my mental health history is thick enough to be mistaken for a phone book.

What I do have going for me. I have freedom; other than my mother I have no family left. I have a willingness to learn and as grim as I made my post sound I have hope that I will make it.

He frequently shoplifts Delsym Cough Medicine from the store he works currently works at. When he’s not doing that he’s on acid and molly every other day. He takes extremely high amounts at once. He sent me a picture with 15 tabs on his mouth. There’s not a day where he doesn’t blow his money on drugs. It’s really sad considering he has a baby a few months from being born. He’s only 18. I told him straight up over the phone a couple days ago telling him he has a problem but he laughed it off and said i know.

""Teresa shook my hand. I can't believe it!""

""Michaela has probably come to this library before. Oh my God, maybe she's even sat in this seat. I wonder what kinds of books she's into.""

When I was 16, I took this too far. A girl had given a presentation and at the end of class I told her how beautiful her delivery and prose were.

155,"Yes, the title is confusing and I'm really sorry for any of my bad english, but here we go.

It's been some good 5-6 months. I have this friend of mine, let's call her ""Gab"". She is a very interesting person and was struggling with some life scars that she had, and for some time me and my other friend ""Jame"" (Male) helped her too.

""Jame"" was one of my bros, we do everything together, and for self-esteem issues I think he is a better version of me.

Back to the story, some time back, like some 3-3,5 moths ago both of us talked to each other and we discovered that both of us liked her, but she was in relationship with a common friend. We could not talk about our feelings to her, but we did it anyway. We scheduled two different moments to talk to her about it, and she was super cool about it. Both of us continued the friendship and kept going, ignoring it.

Some time back, we were at a party, the three of us, Jame, me and Gab. It was a pool party and when we were there, Gab said she forgot her bra and went back to her house to pick it up. When I said ""Can I come with you?"" She said ""No need for, Jame is already coming with me"". At that point, I suspected something, but did not call out, just ignored it.

Later that evening, when we all were at our homes, we started talking and she said that she liked ""Jame"" and didn't know what to do. I was freaking out, totally. Didn't know how to handle the situation and regret it, cause she was there for me when I opened up and I wasn't.

Some time after, like 5-6 days, I initiated a conversation and it ended up being a totally mess, she said I was selfish and wasted all her sadness and angriness at me. I told that I was sorry and really calmed up things, but was really hurt by what she told me. I tried being cool about it, but I just couldn't and bring it back, being the most polite and nice about it, giving her space and all. She just said ""it's okay, you don't need to feel that anymore"", and I just said to myself that it's okay.

Today we do not talk for almost a week, I do not know what to do, I told her I was dealing with some problems and if she wanted to talk to me, it was just to call and I would be there, but she does not.

I'm really regretting it and blaming myself. It's a problem that's obviously little than the stories that I see on this subreddit, but I really need some help. I don't know if I am the problem of the story or if nothing is wrong. I don't want to hurt her, and probably already did it. But at the same time, I regret doing this, because I'm just making her innocent, not a mature person.

Do I keep the distance? Do I talk to her? I don't know.",09Jan2020,1

157,"Okay, so, sophomore year of high school, I started dating my current girlfriend. We dated for 10 months, and she was my first everything. First date, first kiss, first actual love. As was I am her first everything too. 

After 10 months had passed, her best friend forced her to break up with me at the end of July, and my best friend and I knew all along. But I moved on.

The new school year started, and After 3 months, I tried patching things up with the friend that split us up. She told me that she never did that, and that she was trying to talk sense into my gf that I had always been there for her, so I believed her.

Well, the next day, I asked my gf (ex at the time of course) what really happened, and she told me everything. She told me that her friend forced her to break up with me, put thoughts into her head, etc. she told me that she never stopped loving me, and if she could take it all back, she would

We got back together and we’ve currently been together for 2 months. And without that friend in the picture, it’s been sooo much better. I’m the happiest I have ever been. However, I constantly worry about our future, because she is really good at volleyball. We are both Juniors now, and she plays for a select team in a big city and she’s getting letters from colleges that really want her.

I worry a lot that she’s going to go somewhere far away and that’ll be the end of us. And I don’t want to lose her again. I’m worried that at the end of high school, it’ll be the end of us. I have bad anxiety (not diagnosed or claimed by a doctor or anything like that, I just know. I get it hereditarily and from my birth dad leaving us at a young age) and I’ve broken down to her a couple times about our future, and each time she gets weird and it hurts us for a day or two

I broke down to her 3 days ago and the next day hurt, because I feel like I scared her a little by that question, and she was just a little distant the next day. I don’t ever want to ask her a question like that again until that time gets here, so I need to know other ways to make sure I don’t do that to her again. Talk to friends, kinda bottle it up, etc? I could use some advice, even though I kinda know what I need to do. Cause maybe someone here has better advice

Long story short, found my first love sophomore year. Her crazy friend forced us to break up after 10 months. 3 months later we got back together and she’s amazing at volleyball.

He stalked us for about 2 months after we sold

Anyways they still owe us around 6,000! And it’s supposed to be due by now! Should we charge interest? Should we get a lawyer involved if they don’t pay? I’m not sure what to do at this point! There’s alot more info so if anyone has any ideas to help I can explain the full story:)",09Jan2020,1
160,"Hey so Im a 27 year old guy. If I were gay I would be considered a bear, that's the kind of body I have, fat bearded guy. So personally in my day to day I don't really mind being a big guy. I like food and I'm not super interested in sports and stuff so it's fine. I have a nice beard I keep well groomed, nice hair cut, keep myself clean, I'm just big. On the other hand, I know this is not the body type that many find attractive. I'm only human, I have wants and desires but one of the things holding me back from really looking for any of that is my body. I feel like there is just no use in trying. I know I am not what someone wants so why bother? I could lose weight but I guess I feel like I'd be doing it to fit some standard and that it would be kind of fake.

163,"First im sorry for bad formatting as im on mobile.

My friend has been worried about her relationship recently and dont get me wrong her girlfriend is great too its just her mom doesnt agree with the fact her daughter is in a lesbian relationship(At least thats the only reason i can think of) so she has done everything in her power to make it where they can see each other as least as possible so if they wanna see each other it has to be in secret and well one time when they were supposed to meet my friend said she seemed off and didnt wanna talk to her at all really and just asked her other friend why she brought her to the bathroom and left. Also I realized my friend was sad when i saw them earlier that day before she talked to me about it( she told me probably 10 mins or less later what was wrong she was really happy that morning though so I was a little suprised to see her upset too) but i didnt stop her because she just gave me a small smile and kept walking I thought maybe she wants to be alone or didnt want me to say anything in front of someone else but I regret not say anything and feel as i should apologize for that but not only that but a week maybe two i had a bad feeling that something was going to happen to her and suddenly i just started crying and had this bad feeling for my friend so i need some advice should i tell my friend that im sorry for not asking her what was wrong earlier and tell her that i had a feeling that something bad was gonna happen im not 100% sure if its towards her but... With everything thats happening it seems that way. Sorry if this doesnt make much sense but I just really need some advice.",09Jan2020,1
164,"I’ve had this friend with benefits for a while. We are really close and I’ve offered him advice in the past and been there for him as well in the past. He is Persian and his grandma went to Iran for a surgery. She has to stay there for a week longer so doctors can monitor her. We live in the US so obviously there is this looming World War III that may cause his grandma to be stuck in Iran. She can’t fly home any sooner and he’s very close to his family so obviously very worried. He hasn’t told anyone about this and not everyone in his family knows. I offered support when he told me but honestly didn’t know exactly what to say. 

I hung out with him today and I can tell when there is something on his mind (I’m a highly empathetic person and can tell when something is up and also just know him very well). He’s very strong willed and independent, and I don’t want to be too eager to offer support and over step a boundary or wall he has, but I also want to be there for him and I feel like he wants it. I don’t know what to say or how to support him because I’ve never had to deal with anything like that. All I know is I have this gut feeling that he wants someone there for him and I’ve been one of the few people he can tell anything too (overall he feels comfortable talking to me about things he normally never mentions or only his best friend knows). I really care about him and wish I could say something to make him worry less.

165,"I’ve always been attracted to females. I’ve always gravitated towards girls whether it be platonic, romantically, or sexually. I recently got out of a long abusive relationship with a woman I thought I was going to marry. Now that I’m out of it for good, I’m noticing I’m starting to feel...attracted to men??? I think?? I served a guy at my job a few shifts ago (he works in the restaurant near the cafe I work in) and I’ve seen him before, never felt anything towards him, but this time I actually felt my heart racing as I was talking to him and I think i was actually blushing, which hasn’t happened in a while, and definitely hasn’t happened with a guy. I’m still easily finding myself attracted to random women, but now occasionally I see men that I am also attracted to??

171,"My mom isn’t abusive and she isn’t giving me trauma. But I do feel like she’s doing things that are going to mess me up. I have an insane amount of anxiety but she just refers to me as awkward when she’s talking about me.

I’ve been trying to meet her expectations of me, getting good grades, spending more time on studying, less on games, becoming involved, etc. but she never really gave me much to work with. Don’t get me wrong, we’re not poor, we’re not struggling, just average middle class. But she has this huge deal about me spending money. I have a couple jobs but whenever I get checks I never see any of it, I’ve been told it’s in an account waiting for me, but then she’ll spend it on gifts for family and say it’s from both of us.

Today really pushed me to type this out. I play tennis at a local club and it’s one of the hobbies that I have along with mild gaming (League and other generally less violent games) that just let me relax or at least meet people. Well apparently me signing up for one session at this club spends too much of her money, and it isn’t worth it if I’m not playing tournaments. She compares me to kids there who are seriously trying to go pro and ha be private sessions and 3-4 lessons in groups a week. To me. 1 group session each week and the free practice that comes with signing up. Not exactly equal.

So I try to argue I figure she’ll realize this isn’t really fair and will let me go with it. Apparently I need to exercise more and become absolutely ripped if I want to continue to play. I’m not exactly massive but I have muscle from sports I play, and I’m right around average weight for my age and height. My dad, who knows she’ll say something to annoy me and I’ll get ticked off (he often agrees she goes too far but will say it’s stress from work) walks down to make sure it’s civil.

I’m making my case, she’s bringing up kids who she thinks exercise and play tournaments, all the kids trying to go pro and that dedicate any hour not spent in school or sleeping at the club, and trying to tell me to be like them. I argue that comparing me to them means we need to compare everything. These guys aren’t the brightest and they definitely don’t have jobs and as much schoolwork that I do from my advanced classes. She isn’t taking it and brings up the money again.

At this point I lost it, I had a test to study for, I was getting really tired of this and wanted to end it quickly. I raised my voice, my dad perks up like he just woke up, and started listing off all the expensive shoes and clothing that kids at my school bought all the time, all the kids flexing parents’ credit cards, and try to plead: I don’t get what I don’t need (with the exception of Christmas gifts) I don’t ask her for money unless I’m out with friends, and their grades are definitely not where mine are. 

Apparently me saying anything back to her counts as disrespect and my dad is called in to the conversation, who takes her side and tells her it’s pointless to argue with me and to just let us settle this

Now as much as I like my dad because he settles arguments and actually addresses problems, I’ve always been unsure of him. This is one of the things my mom does that definitely messes me up. Whenever I get angry at her and say I’ll just talk to my dad or my grandparents, she’ll casually mention that they hate talking to me and consider me pointless to spend time on. Whenever she tries to act all buddy-buddy with me, I bring it up and she just tries to deny it because she needs something from me, and just acts like I’m making it up. 

So I bring it up. I bring up the shoes I wanted to buy (under $60 per her request) and argue that it tennis is such a waste why does she have 20 pairs of expensive shoes from well known brands and I’m stuck with slowly wearing New Balance and a pair of Nikes that I’m told need to last me the year? My dad says a year is reasonable, and I agree, but point out that my argument is the money. He nods, doesn’t say anything, and my mom just angrily opens her laptop, starts to pretend type. She does that a lot. Want to know how I know it’s fake? She wears glasses, the screen isn’t on in the reflection. She tells my dad to send me to my room like I’m still a child and then I say it. “If you always say he hates talking to me so much, why do you make him deal with this?”

My dad looks like he got slapped, but doesn’t say anything. Just looks at my mom then looks at me. I’m basically tearing up at this point because my dad, the one I look up to, the one I want to make proud more than my mom, more than myself, doesn’t say anything. He just begins to list off my arguments and finds a compromise. We’ll find a tournament to play, we’ll buy your shoes, let’s just go to sleep. My mom looks satisfied and just turns away, my dad walks away back to his room.

And I just stare at the back of my moms head with total hate. 

I love my dad, but I can’t stand my mom. I’m sure she’s nice to her colleagues and her friends seem to like her. But, I’m not sure if I have the right to say this, I don’t think she’s a good parent. She’s treated me as an employee, giving me what I need making sure I’m doing ok, but not giving me more than that. Whenever I go to her with an issue she sticks it on something that must be wrong with me. She never listens to me, zones out, then just says yeah sure to whatever I was saying. She claims we never talk but doesn’t even know my favorite color after more than 15 years of raising me. She claims I go to parties too much but I barely go to any because I know if I bring them up she’ll say no. She complains I waste her money on things that nothing will come out of, meanwhile she spends $$$ on perfumes and her own shitty tennis gear for the sake of her own socializing so she doesn’t feel lonely. I used to be overweight and have terrible acne and whenever I got in the car after hanging out with friends, she’d start with “so did they point out how bad you look or should I?”

Everything about her being a mother is wrong. She doesn’t care and she plays favorites with me and my sister based on her mood. My sister is too young to get it but her older brother is the test child and I’m not even sure if one trial will be enough. My mom basically gave up on me at 12, and then spends any alone time we have assuring me that my dad and grandfather (a man I respect more than just about anyone) consider me a failure before I even enter college. I’ve overheard conversations where they warn her that I won’t take care of her when she’s old, but she says that she can either force me or just go to my sister who she’s sure will be more successful 

I’m sorry for such a long tangent but I’ve just about had it. My mother has made my life a living hell, I’m sure many have it worse and I’m not even trying to compare but I guess I have own type of problems. She’s made me into who I am today. Someone who tries too hard to be liked, tries to grasp onto any chance of being friends with someone but then annoys them with how overbearing I am because of how she treats me. I have friends but I’m often anxious that I annoy them. I have the feeling any conversation that someone happens to glance at me during it about me and any laughs I hear go instantly to my head.

I hate the idea that part of me is her. I know this isn’t as bad as abuse or trauma but I just don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t know where I can go if I run, and the only reason I haven’t it because my dad pulled me aside and said I can come to him anytime when my mom finished telling me to never talk to her again. I can’t wait for college but I’m also scared for my sister.

Forget making me weird, my mom made me socially crippled with hoe anxious her remarks on me make me but I’ve been able to piece together enough composure to seem alright. Then someone gets a bit close to me, I open up, and they’re scared away. I have a couple close friends here and there but no one person I can really talk to. So here I am ranting away to the internet. 

Once again sorry for such a long rant just the more I type the more I feel myself able to move on, or at least forget about this for tonight",09Jan2020,1

173,"So on new year's me and a friend who I've been mostly interested in and he has interest in me had unprotected sex. He did pull out the 2/3 times he came and we had a lot to drink. 

Anyways over 5 days later I tried to get an appointment to see if i didn't catch anything (even though I've had sex with this friend before and I got tested the first time I did it with him) 

I couldn't see a doctor but I got to speak to an after hour nurse who was more worried about me might be get pregnant because I had unprotected sex around 14 days after my period ( I knew it started somewhere around 16th December). Like i was a bit worried about getting pregnant but since I didn't before I wasn't too worried about it until I spoke to this doctor.

Since then I've been worrying about if i am pregnant, it's only been 7 days and I'm suppose to start my period next week. I was gonna take a test today but my friend suggested to take it next week and another one a week or 2 after. I've been becoming so paranoid that I started watching a bunch of symptoms video. I'm not showing any but sometimes when I think I am I also think it's because of the thing I'm doing (like if I'm feeling a bit of pain on my pelvis while I'm working out in the gym or feeling like going to the toilet when I ate and drunk a lot). 

It doesn't help that I have been working out at the gym 2 hours a day, drinking a lot of coffee and even made a little mix of an alcoholic drink this evening...

I need to stop worrying about this because I might not even be pregnant but im freaking out about the symptoms and the what ifs. Does anyone have any advice?

179,"So I'm extremely bad at math to the point where it has made a lot of my life miserable. It's not like ""oh haha i struggle with algebra sometimes XD"" no it's I can barely do addition in my head and I can barely do algebra and geometry and fuck anything past that. I had the best damn tutors and teachers and I was still nearly failing my math classes in HS. It made me feel suicidal because not many people know what it's like to be perpetually bad at a core subject in education throughout your entire life. I felt stupid and since math is required for full schooling it appears that it doesn't fucking matter that I'm amazing at writing and history and stuff, no can get degree unless I pass fucking math.

So I failed my algebra classes twice in college. Finally passed. Last class I had to take was Stats. Thought I would understand it hopefully better. Nope. Absolutely nothing stuck. Got an F once again. The problem is that if I could focus all of my time on my math class then yeah id probably be able to pass at the minimum. But not only do I have other classes (obviously) what hurts is all the extra classes that I have to take *to make up for* the credits I didn't get when I failed my math classes.

My major has literally nothing to do with math.

Doesn't matter I got As and B+s in all my other classes. Doesn't matter that it's my last year. I'm not gonna be able to graduate because a subject completely unrelated to my degree is keeping me from succeeding. I hate myself and I hate my life.

181,"The title pretty much says it all. My (28F) mom (64F) passed away at the end of November after a month long ICU stay. Her time in the hospital was traumatic for a lot of reasons, and her time at home in hospice care for the last night was unbearable. She was in a great deal of pain and was unable to talk, but she seemed afraid and had a lot of trouble breathing. Because she needed morphine every hour on the hour, my brother, dad, and I took shifts to stay up with her through the night. She passed away on my shift, around 6am. It was not a good death.

Since then, I've been busy with the expected things. End of life arrangements, financial stuff, taking care of my dad, trying to keep my family holding on through the holidays, etc. Now that all that's over, though, and I finally have some time to myself to process and grieve, I can't sleep for the life of me. I'm getting maybe a handful of hours a night, but nothing sustainable. I'm absolutely exhausted, I just can't seem to manage these racing thoughts. They're not just about her and her death, mind you: I'm stressing about money, about my professional life, about my social relationships, about everything, but her death is always there in the background. It's like my brain is on a merry-go-round I can't get off.

This has never been a problem for me before. If anything, I usually sleep far too much and rely on it as a coping mechanism. So I have no skills to handle this. I've tried tea, meditating, no screens in the evening, no caffeine, etc., but nothing is working. At this point I could just cry. Sleeping pills have never worked for me, but I'm seriously considering just drinking til I drop so I can get some rest without that dreadful laying in the dark for hours on end.

She asked me if she could continue trying to pursue him. I said that it was entirely her choice and that I couldn’t decide that for her.

She hadn’t read it for a while so I just assumed she was taking a break from her phone so that she could focus on school. Today, I opened up snap and got a message replying to my story (someone left a Shiner bottle on school property and everyone was joking about it). She opened up my snap and sent me a message saying ‘u/succoth i fucking miss you.’ Almost immediately afterward she called me and we talked for about 15 minutes and she brought her older sister on the phone who was giggling and said Hi to me.

There are two main tables for the guys of the grade, one with all the popular sports guys and one with not so popular sports guys. I’m in the not so popular sports guys group.

While sitting down, one of the people at my table who I had considered a friend started throwing nuts at me and laughing his ass off. Then, a kid sitting next to me started flicking nuts at me and laughing his ass off. Next, the most popular kid in our grade with sports threw some nuts at me and started laughing his ass off.

When the teacher cane over unrelated to the situation, the kid flicking nuts at me that was sitting next to me said “Matchew101 is allergic to peanuts” and starts laughing his ass off as if my allergy is a FUCKING JOKE to him.

Out of all of this, only TWO kids stuck up for me. They’re two of the strongest kids in our grade and asked why the fuck it was so funny to flick shit that I’m allergic to at me.

I’m not the most fit, definitely not one to start a fight. Those two people who stood up for me are almost never around each other and I’m not sure if they’d be able to beat the absolute quantity of people who would be on the most popular sports kids side.

Along with that, I don’t want to be a rat. I don’t know how, maybe it’s just the fact that the people in charge at my school are all shit at keeping secrets, but they’ll find out. And when they do, they’ll hand my ass to me.

I used to consider these people as my friends but I guess they never were.

How can I get through this. How do I stay up and keep moving, because right now, it seems like everything is turning to shit.",09Jan2020,1
192,"My parents, uncle, his wife, and I are in a conversation right now. It is a pretty heated conversation talking mostly about culture and how to keep the flame going in following generations. I just saw my aunt (biological uncle's wife) put her phone under the table and turn on a voice recorder app on her phone. It said it already had 23 mins of recorded material and she just unpaused the recording. And then she turned off the screen and put the phone on the table. No one knows she is recording except me. What do I do? Do I bring this up right now? Or do I bring it up later over text with my uncle (who I trust), or do I bring it up with her over text later? 

I dont know if there's a motive. It seems like my uncle and her are a little hostile. They are cutting each other off in the discussion and saying ""LET ME TALK, LET ME TALK"" etc. I dont know if this signifies deeper issues in their relationship for which she might be recording to get evidence against(?) But I don't know what to do. 

Sorry for any grammar, or spelling issues, I am just typing quickly at the table beside her.

195,"I'm a 25(f) and my boyfriend is (24)
7months ago i moved into a house that i thought would genuinely help my crippling mental health and give me hope and will to live.
I moved into a house with someone i had a fling with many many years ago and done things with years ago.
I wasmy  thinking about it his feelings because i was just trying to find a solution to my depression and mental health. To start living again.
I thought i was doing the right thing for me, trying to help myself. I had no and still dont have any malicious intentions, I just saw it as a escape from the hell i was living in. The last house was disgusting, no one cleaned after themselves, only cares about weed and getting high, it wasn't in a safe environment either, was very worried that someone would break in.
I did speak to my boyfriend about it , and he said its not ideal but if you have to do it then okay.
So I took that as a yes. I was Just so honed in on trying to be in somewhere safe.
When i finally moved in and started to get settled, we spoke and I found out he was very hurt that moved in..
I didnt think i did anything wrong and was trying to do the right thing, so i was confused and tried to defend my decision and how i was just trying to help myself and had no evil hidden motives.
Many months later on and off fights about it, i ask what can i do, I try everything i can think of to my knowledge at the time and it doesnt work, I ask him for any solutions or even to try and have some time to try and think hard on something. I offered to move out to try but he would say no cause he could see it was 'healthy' for me, i knew he was upset so i decided to just go to the boyfriend's house all the time, i asked for if he could come to mine a few times cause I thought it's normal to go over to your partners house and take turns.
He Just tried to hide his pain, he started to crumble mentally, I tried to support him as much as i could, everything i could do or think of.
My therapist said to pick and choose our battles so remembering that I lied about one thing. About giving a small hug to my housemate cause he was in pain about being dumped by GF. I just thought i was just being kind but it was disrespectful to my boyfriend and he couldn't trust me cause of i hesitated on how to answer because of the advice given on how i was supposed to use that and how i like to be honest.
He is So hurt by me and can't trust me, I'm willing to atone and do whatever is needed to have him back, we decided to go on a break yesterday because he just can't do the relationship atm and wants to work out if he can forgive me and can live with it and still be with me.

196,"So I've been talking on private video/voice chat with this girl for the past 5 days (for hours and hours) not doing much else but that, and I love our talks and she's really nice and we get along really well. 
And while we did meet on a dating app she did tell me that she wanted to take things slowly because she would need a lot of time to develop feelings because of her past experience with guys. Which is something I totally understand and respect. And she has repeatedly told me not to get my hopes up, because it'd take a long time for her and she didn't want to end up breaking my hopes/hearth.

Now one of the problems lies in that I believe I'm starting to catch feelings for her/fall in love with her.
Which sounds great, right?
Not when you're me... I am awfully good at sabotaging myself... My last (and first) relationship ended because I essentially wrecked it. 

Now some background info about her:
This girl is slightly obese medically speaking (chubby basically) and has issues with depression (suicidal thoughts, cutting, etc.) and self-esteem and some other psychological ""stuff"" for which she is seeing a therapist, which according to her isn't helping much.
On top of that she has a very stain relationship with her parents/family.

Now I've been trying to help her a little since I've had my own fare share of suicidal thoughts and self-esteem problems in the past, but which I've luckily enough left behind a few years ago.
And I think I've actually managed to help her, especially with her low self-esteem.
But I think she is connecting the things I've told her, that helped me to get out of my depression, with me as a person.

Now I'm starting to deeply care for her, and I fear that if whatever develops between us falls apart (because of the above mentioned self-sabotage), she's gonna fall back to her suicidal thoughts, etc. (Or them getting worse) because of the advice that I've given her being connected to me as a person.


What can I do to prevent her from connecting my advice with me as a person, so that even when I'm gone she doesn't just fall back. 
And also maybe some advice to give to her or advice towards how I should handle the whole situation.

198,"My nephew is 6. He was always a typical boy. Loved wrestling and dirt. It was a shock to us when she told us to now call “Michael” “Michelle”. She told us that last year he told her that he thought he was a girl and she was immediately “supportive”. She told him that he was transexual and that he was a girl on the inside. Micheal/Michelle, according her, has only mentioned feeling like a girl ONCE!  Instead of getting him help. She took him shopping the next day for dresses. He already had really long hair but now it’s in bows. She’s a single mom and she even said “well now I finally have my little girl!”  
The whole process happened in less than a day.  They live out of state so I haven’t had the chance to talk to him, Micheal about anything but she sent everyone pictures of him in a dress

203,"Currently a broke college student. I got a new camera and a laptop that i need to pay off, so money is even tighter. About 2 months ago i discovered that there's a glitch in a chain restaurant i go to pretty often, they have this points card that gives you points for every purchase, then you can trade those points for food. For some reason my card and a few others only count the points you get. So let's say i spend $10, i get 10 points, but if i spend 100 points, it doesn't count it. The points reset to the balance previous to the exchange. So since i discovered it, I've been using it about 3-4 times a week to buy food for me and my best friend, the amount of points i have lets me get about $15 worth of food every time, that saves me a lot of money and i have to worry a bit less about bills at the end of the month. When i do have some extra money though, i do spend it on their restaurants.  Could i get in trouble for this? Should i stop doing it? I don't live in the US btw",09Jan2020,1
204,"I’ve been working for a couple weeks now at a place that seems pretty lax. A lot of sarcasm and messing around and joking goes on. While speaking with a coworker I made a comment asking if another coworkers daughter was sexy just out of curiosity. Beforehand I knew she was underage, 16 maybe 17 not sure, but not thinking much about it at the time. He seemed taken aback by the question and I thought it made it better by my saying something along the lines of well of course it’s illegal but you can still tell if (a 16yo girl) is attractive or not with no ill intent. Somehow he interpreted this as offensive in some manner. I personally don’t see it as so because I thought it was just two guys shooting the shit since it was on our downtime and I thought the dude was chill. Wrong call on my end I guess and definitely a stupid thing to say to someone I don’t know but I feel like we were viben it out for the most part since I’ve been hired. 

I’m not sure where to go from here, my boss called me and said the dude told on me which if you knew the environment it makes zero sense why he would do this. We are both under the age of 25 and this just totally blows my outlook on this dude. It turned me pretty sour towards him. This happened today and I don’t know how I should approach the situation. 

Of course I want to first thing tomorrow walk up to the kid and say you’re a little b*** ass tattle tell. But I know the right thing to do would be to let him know I stepped out of line but at the same time f that dude because he tried to fk me. So I’m thinking I should just engage with him as much as I possibly have to if even at all. Should I try and let my emotions go and be chill with the guy or just say f it because I would really rather not be his friend.

On the other hand both guys I’m talking about have worked together for awhile more than 2 years roughly. It seems they are cool but I’m not sure how buddy buddy they are. The tattle tell seems like he may be more on the older dudes balls then the other way around so I’m wondering what I should do about the older gentleman. I really like the dude and he trained me and I felt like we are pretty chill but of course not as tight as the other guy. Anyways I do not know if the younger dude told the guy with the daughter about what I said. I need to know if I should bring it up and be straight up with him and tell him what I said and that I meant no harm. I’m just speculating but I feel if he would tell the boss he would tell this guy, but at the same time that’s just me guessing, i don’t want to throw myself under the bus but I also don’t want to let this go and not say something to him if he secretly knows something. I really just want the best relationships with my coworkers but this guy that told on me Fd that up in my eyes. 

So really my need for advice would be, should I be the bigger person and recognize i did something wrong (honestly I do not think I did, I mean technically you can tell if high school girls are attractive imo without you thinking of any further actions or whatever) and should I possibly throw myself under the bus because this other dude is super chill and we have talked about some deep shit so I feel like there is no over stepping boundaries with him.

209,"In mid-November, my friend Jake (fake name) started acting really weird. He'd actually been acting weird since he broke up with his girlfriend in August. But anyways, I finally confronted him about being weird after having a few mutual friends tell me that he'd been acting weird toward them too. He doesn't do well with confrontation, so he got very upset and told me that it was just my anxiety that was making me think that he was being weird. He told me that I had to talk to my therapist to figure it out because it was just my anxiety, and said he wouldn't talk to me until I did. That hurt my feelings because he didn't even really listen to what I was saying, and just instantly told me that it was me overreacting and being too anxious. 

Well, I really missed him, so I apologized and asked what I could do to work through the situation with him. He told me that he didn't want to be my friend anymore, and that I wasn't a person who he wanted to put energy towards being in a relationship with. Which really really hurt, because we've been friends for a long time and been through a lot, so I was very sad that a small mistake I made completely blew everything up.

Fast-forward a few months, it's now January. I finally had a chance to meet with my therapist. She agreed with me that it's highly unlikely that it was my anxiety since other people also said he was being weird. She also said that he's being an asshole, and that he's likely going through something that he doesn't feel like sharing and that's why he's acting so weird. 

So, to the thing I need advice about;

Since his whole thing in the beginning was that I needed to talk to my therapist, I'm really tempted to text him and tell him that she said, because he likely probably thought that she'd side with him and say that it was my anxiety because I do have anxiety, it just wasn't the main contributor in this situation.

I know that telling him what she said would probably upset him, but he did originally want to know what she said. It also will likely tank any chances of re-building a friendship with him, but at this point, I doubt he'll ever even be my friend again. 

The other option is to just ask him if he wants me to tell him what my therapist said about the situation. Or just not use the word ""asshole"" when I talk to him? Idk. I know it's petty, but I just...he did ask for it originally...

TL/DR: Should I text the person I'm not friends with anymore and tell him something that will likely upset him?",09Jan2020,1

211,"sorry in advance this is kind of a lot to read

i'm in high school, and my best friend (lets call her sarah) has gotten really close with another person in our friend group, catherine(also a fake name for privacy reasons). i didn't really mind this, as we all hung out and got along well. however, recently, they have been getting super close with each other, and now whenever the three of us hang out, i feel pretty left out because they never include me in their conversations. now whenever they ask to hang out or walk home together, i say no which has just caused me to grow even farther apart from sarah. 

&amp;#x200B;

now whenever sarah hangs out with me or whenever i walk her to her class i feel like she does it with me only because catherine is busy, or she does it out of pity because she feels bad for me. also, she's been pretty closed off from me, and doesn't tell me what's been going on with her anymore (which i get, everyone needs privacy, but it bothers me because she tells catherine but not me). 

&amp;#x200B;

today during lunch, sarah and catherine were talking about grades. i go to a pretty competitive school, so grades are a big part of everyone's stress. i wasn't really listening to their conversation and instead talked with other people in our friend group. in the middle of 5th period, my friend told me that sarah got up and left in the middle of chemistry class without saying anything, and this really worried me. sarah has pretty bad anxiety, and sometimes gets panic attacks, so i assumed she had one. at the end of the day i saw sarah and catherine talking and she looked like she was just crying. i pulled catherine aside and asked her what happened, and she told me that sarah had a panic attack. when i asked her what triggered it, she told me that she thinks that it was because they were talking about grades and it really stressed her out. when i asked her to elaborate, she kind of just brushed me off and told me that sarah has a lot on her plate right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

this situation made me feel upset because i wasn't there for my closest friend when she needed it. also, it made me feel really bad because i just feel like i'm not enough for her.  i try to comfort her whenever stuff like this happens but i guess my words don't really have an effect on her. what should i say to her the next time this happens? and in general, how to i grow closer with her? should i just not try? it feels like she's pretty happy confiding in catherine, so should i just back off and accept what's happening? i just miss hanging out with her. and it's not like we grew apart over several months. all of this happened from late november until now, but catherine and sarah got really close around the beginning of december. and i haven't done anything bad or mean to sarah to cause her to not like me as much anymore.

217,"I understand that an interns job is to make mistakes and learn from them, but I am not that kind of person that can't learn from a mistake without feeling absolutely humiliated. I moved across a my province from a small town into a big city, and I am currently interning at a large creative agency. 

My job is to design, manage social media and a bunch of other random things they have me on. I know my age shouldn't matter but being 25, I am older than a few of their workers that have been there for a year or more. But this particular situation that happened today has me losing sleep and wasting my night thinking about it. I am at an age where I should have known better than to go above what I am being asked to do.

Basically what had happened was a complete rookie mistake on my part. I was asked to go into their server, not delete anything but add a dated empty folder to each of the clients designated folders. I thought I would help them out after I completed my task really quickly (I was basically so bored because they were too busy to teach me or get me to do anything). From what I\\ve learned in my program is that you should always have an organized hard drive, and our school servers were always very well labeled. This one was not, and I thought I would help them out and label each ones according to how I was to make the dated folder. Without even thinking, people (at least one girl I know) was using the server and I had unknowingly changed her folder name - resulting in her file to corrupt. She was particularly angered with me and went to the project manager to explain the situation. The project manager was really nice about it but the girl was clearly flustered even though she got what she needed back. (it's weird tho, maybe they just don't know how to retrieve corrupt files but it's easier to locate a folder than you think). Anyway, I offered to help but she refused it. Since this afternoon, it's been seriously bothering me that maybe I could have messed up other peoples files.

It's such a rookie mistake on my part for not even thinking, and it's actually bothering me so much that I don't even want to go in tomorrow. I want to come up with an excuse and call in sick. I can't sleep. I am not good at failure and I feel so humiliated it's stressing me out so much.

I know it's a learning experience but being from a small town working with these people from a big city, I don't fit in here. I love this city, just not this particular office. I'm not sure if it's everywhere that's like this but it just bothers me so much that I need to let out how I am feeling through here.

218,"I’ve been trying to do this for the past year, but it’s very difficult, since this person is insistent in maintaining a friendship with me.

I’ve only known them for a couple of years and have hung out only about half a dozen times. However, they perceive us to be much closer than we actually are. They message me almost on a daily basis, with memes, stuff that remind them of me, random thoughts and rants. I rarely reply, and when I do, it’s something brief and polite or a simple “like”. 

I met them through a mutual friend and hung out with them on a one-on-one basis a few times afterward. I immediately saw a lot of red flags. They were extremely impulsive. They would show up at my apartment randomly. Sometimes when we would hang out, they would randomly change plans on me, make sudden stops at places and lose track of time to the point where I missed school or had to sleep over at a stranger’s house. Any favor came with strings attached. A lot of passive aggressive comments and criticisms. They would try to manipulate me into doing hw for them. I stopped seeing them for over a year but they kept contact with me on social media. I deleted my page and made a new one so I could start fresh. They found me and have been reaching out to me regularly ever since.

I ignore this person 95% of the time, yet they talk to me as if we are super close. They are pregnant right now and the father isn’t in the picture, and I do feel for them because that’s an awful situation to be in. The other day she posted on social media that she was contemplating suicide, so I reached out out of pity and hung out after that long break. When we hung out, I did support her emotionally, but I also felt uncomfortable at the fact that they were still as impulsive as ever. They were planning to have a one night stand with a boy fresh out of high school who had no idea of her pregnancy. It was 1am and he lived far away, and no matter how much I tried to talk them out of it, they still went — even though they were exhausted. My partner witnessed the red flags again (including the forced closeness and everything having strings attached), which I put aside because I felt bad for them. So I’ve drifted off again. But since then, they’ve sent me a baby registry, asked me to be the godmother, printed out a photo of my partner and I to show her future child her ‘family’. They asked me if it was okay and I didn’t know what to say except “yes”. This is on top of asking to see me once a week and me coming up with an excuse all the time.

I have a tight circle of friends that I have a lot in common with and that I’ve known since high school and early college. They’re people that I truly love to be around and, most importantly, trust. They’re complicated people, but I feel comfortable airing out my disagreements with them. They’re receptive and mature. I hope I don’t give the impression that I’m just not a social person. I would talk to this person about their behavior if I cared enough about maintaining our friendship, but I don’t because she constantly and passionately complains about anyone who tries to offer her advice or guidance and also because I don’t care to maintain our friendship. Like I said, we don’t have a bond really. There’s no shared belief system, background, or interest.

How do I break up with them? Ignoring isn’t working. Blocking seems too harsh, especially with their current mental health. I still haven’t replied to the baby shower invitation they sent to several days ago.",09Jan2020,1
219,"sorry in advance this is kind of a lot to read

throwaway because some of my friends know my main account

&amp;#x200B;

i'm in high school, and my best friend (lets call her sarah) has gotten really close with another person in our friend group, catherine(also a fake name for privacy reasons). i didn't really mind this, as we all hung out and got along well. however, recently, they have been getting super close with each other, and now whenever the three of us hang out, i feel pretty left out because they never include me in their conversations. now whenever they ask to hang out or walk home together, i say no which has just caused me to grow even farther apart from sarah.

now whenever sarah hangs out with me or whenever i walk her to her class i feel like she does it with me only because catherine is busy, or she does it out of pity because she feels bad for me. also, she's been pretty closed off from me, and doesn't tell me what's been going on with her anymore (which i get, everyone needs privacy, but it bothers me because she tells catherine but not me).

today during lunch, sarah and catherine were talking about grades. i go to a pretty competitive school, so grades are a big part of everyone's stress. i wasn't really listening to their conversation and instead talked with other people in our friend group. in the middle of 5th period, my friend told me that sarah got up and left in the middle of chemistry class without saying anything, and this really worried me. sarah has pretty bad anxiety, and sometimes gets panic attacks, so i assumed she had one. at the end of the day i saw sarah and catherine talking and she looked like she was just crying. i pulled catherine aside and asked her what happened, and she told me that sarah had a panic attack. when i asked her what triggered it, she told me that she thinks that it was because they were talking about grades and it really stressed her out. when i asked her to elaborate, she kind of just brushed me off and told me that sarah has a lot on her plate right now.

this situation made me feel upset because i wasn't there for my closest friend when she needed it. also, it made me feel really bad because i just feel like i'm not enough for her. i try to comfort her whenever stuff like this happens but i guess my words don't really have an effect on her. what should i say to her the next time this happens? and in general, how to i grow closer with her? should i just not try? it feels like she's pretty happy confiding in catherine, so should i just back off and accept what's happening? i just miss hanging out with her. and it's not like we grew apart over several months. all of this happened from late november until now, but catherine and sarah got really close around the beginning of december. and i haven't done anything bad or mean to sarah to cause her to not like me as much anymore.

what do i do from here?",09Jan2020,1

My boss is a micro-managing control-freak that will watch us on the cameras from her home and call in if it looks like we don’t have enough to do. She can’t handle when someone makes a mistake despite being new to the job and will consistently degrade them. I have been told to “use my brain” and countless other rude comments. She tries to find things to complain about and will find the stupidest things just so she can do just that - complain.

My other coworker is also a control-freak. She bosses me around like I’m her dog and barks at me about little things. She’ll purposely place prescriptions that need filled out of my sight and then yell at me for not filling it. She tripped and spilled a bottle of pills on the ground and said that it was my fault because “the cap wasn’t on tight enough.” This is just 2 of 100s of things she’s done in 3 months.

So here is the story, I kinda made one bad decision after another, and another.. my life flipped from being great where I had well paid job, I didn't have to worry about money , to be a shithole where I can't pay my rent anymore, and I can barely afford some food.

I left my job couple of months ago, I needed a little break, I had some savings back then so I just rented a room and was planning on searching for a new job after few weeks rest, I was procrastinating like crazy, but when my savings were running low, I managed to find a job, I was so happy, I thought my problems are over, sadly everything went to shit.. my boss didn't pay me for the first month, he told me his clients didn't pay him on time and he is waiting for the payment, but it will happen in a few days and he will pay me extra for the delay, that should be the red flag, I should just run, I would still have few weeks to find new job and could pay the rent, but I trusted him and I waited. We can skip to last friday, I still didn't get money after asking for it every other day, so I just left, knowing that I will never see that money again(another mistake is that I didn't get the contract)..

I've been trying to find a job since friday, but it is so hard to find something quickly that would allow me to pay the rent(I postponed it already but the deadline is monday morning), do you have any suggestion what kind of job can I search for, that will hire me of the bat and will pay at the end of the day?

I get what she's trying to do. Tough love, sure, yadda yadda.

Also, ""Ive never met these kid's parents"" is a valid concern. 

I'm seventeen. I'm numb to it. Not hanging out with anyone on the weekends is expected. I reject offers before I even ask my mom, because I can assume the answer will be no. I can deal with it, and while my younger brother never really asks to hang with his friends (he usually calls them on discord or something) my younger sister asks to go to parties as much as the opportunity presents itself. 

Obviously the answer is usually no (i recall one time the answer was yes, but on the morning of, the answer was changed to no. That was the longest let-down I ever had to hear.) i'm concerned, because while I can handle this, my younger sister is impressionable and gets emotional. I hate hearing her cry.

My husband and I are in our early 30s and have been looking at completing our wills. We stupidly don’t have one yet cause we keep putting it off- but really need to get it done. 

We have been very lucky, worked hard and own a couple of properties, owe very little money on each as well as have a large amount in savings. 

We have not been lucky enough to have children of our own  yet, after suffering multiple miscarriages and failed fertility treatments, it feels like we may never. 

We do have a god child, who is our best friends’ child. We were discussing it and want to leave a large portion of our estate to them in a trust that can only be accessed after a certain age and only to buy property. 

I guess my question is, would you tell the friends or not- should they know it’s at least there? I don’t want to freak them out and if we do have children (which I doubt now but you never know) that changes the ball game massively and would ultimately change what we leave. 

How do you have that conversation if at all?

236,"I'm in high school and taking history class. I have social anxiety, no real friends, and I blush a lot. I notice, this is enough for people to dislike me, but I hide it and always try to seem like I'm normal. Anyways, I'm writing this bc I feel small, weak and rlly passive; I want to change something to make me feel like a part of my class and make my teacher not dislike me.
Ok, to the point, basically why I think he doesn't like me is...

 - he ignores me and I feel left out. Everyday he calls out students' names on the attendance and asks them how their day was. He would call everyone but then all of a sudden he left me out, just skipped me. He kept doing this until one day I came in very assertively and he then acknowledged me.
- We read from the txtbk and he literally calls on everyone to read aloud w the class except me. We read as a class everyday, and with my social anxiety I am glad I don't have to be the center of attention but now I feel kind of offended, like I'm not part of the class.

- After we write a test (with a scantron) he gives it to us back  quickly. He calls someone, they come up, see their mark and sit back down. Well he would call ppl and I'm just waiting like when is he going to call me, and then my name never comes, and he just moves on. Like wth dude I want to know how I did on the test!
I sit at the front of the class and I feel like a pushover. The last time he did that I raised my hand and i asked to go to the washroom, which he pretended not to see even though I'm right in front of him, then he said yes. I just asked this so I wouldn't seem that passive but I didn't ask him about what I got on the test bc I'm shy and awkward, and he clearly skipped me intentionally, so I feel stupid to ask. 

- He stares at me, I don't know why. He just observes my behavior and I am rlly weird even w my robotic movements and i feel he picks up on it. I'm one of those ppl that don't know what to do when someone's looking at me, I just pretend not to see them.

- When I raise my hand he just stares at everyone else but me, pretending not to see me. In that situation I feel dumb. I just think should I just put my hand down and pretend to do something else? Do I pretend like he can't see me and put my hand higher?

- One time he went around the class asking everyone to give an example of something. When he got to me he looked like he didn't want to ask me but he did. I was surprised that he didn't skip me. Still, I was anxious, and came off as really cringe and awkward. So he gave me a dirty look, he looked so annoyed. 

Idk, he just seem like he likes everyone, he's always like ""you guys are my favorite class"" and always joking with them and them with him. But I have no close friends especially in that class and I just want to do something so he won't dislike me.

237,"I don’t hate the people in the school system, or the many people that make sacrifices to educate the world, I hate the system of schooling in America. I don’t like the classroom system, and the grading system. For example, if you get an 80% on a test, and your teacher wants to move on to the next unit, you only know 80% of the material that the next unit is based on. Also the material that we are required to cover is almost entirely useless, we should not be learning a pure subject, we should be learning applied subjects. 

Homework makes a negative impact, I’m not saying that we should not have homework, but the amount of homework really wastes the time of students that have other passions. For example, I have already taken all the computer classes I can, and I want to be a programmer when I am older, but the amount of homework that I have takes up the majority of my time spent at home between sports, family events, clubs, and activities.

241,"This is pretty lengthy so I’m sorry for the long read.

So today at school after first period, a friend (15F) asked if I (16F) wanted to go to the cafeteria with her to get some tea. We went straight there and right to class when we were done and were there minutes after the bell. 

At my school, we recently started having days when teaching and assignments are postponed to help with stress. Today was one of them. So my teacher of that period wasn’t doing anything. 

We’re in the same class in this period too so we just sat down and minded our own business. Our school does the attendance online. I assumed the my teacher would notice that we were there and would mark me as present, so I didn’t worry about anything. 

The rest of the day goes by fine, and at this point I’m at home. My mom comes in my room angry and shows me an email from the school (it was automatically sent, because the attendance is online) saying that I had been absent during second period. I’m confused, did my teacher forget to mark me in class? Did it just happen to me, or did it happen for my friend too?

Now, things aren’t exactly the best for  friend. She’s not a bad person and hasn’t done anything dangerous but she’s gotten called down to the office a lot this year. I won’t go into detail for her privacy, but just keep in mind that her parents, especially her dad, are very unforgiving.
 
I lied to my mom and said that I’d forgotten something in my locker when she asked why I was absent. She didn’t believe me.

If her parents knew that she’d been absent, things would get even worse for her, so I thought that lying would be for the best.

I thought that it would be best if she really knew what I was doing. I hoped that she would understand that I wasn’t actually skipping class.

I told her the truth but she still didn’t believe me. She told me that she hated lying, which I totally understand, but she also told me that she didn’t like how I was covering up for another person. She said that was what my sister did a lot and told me that she was going to go to the school tomorrow.

My teacher will most likely be called down and might bring her into it to, since we came into the classroom together. Like I said earlier, this would be horrible for her. My mom doesn’t get how bad her situation is, and that getting her parents involved would make it even worse.

She’s been really stressed out and I’ve personally been afraid that she might hurt herself, or worse.

Now I’m not sure what to do. I don’t think I’ll be able to convince my mom to stop. I’m really worried that I’ll get my friend in even more trouble.

242,"I’ve been friends with this girl for 10 years. We were actually best friends at one point. But along highschool she changed, she has been on and off friends with me for about 4 years recently. In highschool I got in a relationship and she didn’t like him and stopped talking to me. She apologized and we were back to being friends. It was different though, we weren’t as close as we used to be and she was always passive aggressive most of the time. We became closer our senior year of highschool until she went to college. 

When college happened she made new friends and basically ditched me for her new friends. Drama happened and she dropped those friends and apologized once again because I think I was her only friend at the time. She made new friends again once she moved back and has kept me on the back burner ever since. She never initiated hanging out with me. I was always the one to do it, she’d only talk to me when she had drama in her life and or probably felt bad because we hadn’t talked in awhile. I would always be there for her, when she was sick I’d bring her a movie and tea, when she broke up with her boyfriend I went over there to help her out. But when I have a problem she only responds with a one worded text or makes me feel crappy if I’m venting about a problem of mine by saying how worse she has it. 

It started to become a toxic friendship and drama is her. She always has something to talk bad about with her boyfriend or other friends but then she goes right back to them. It started getting to me, I mean we weren’t hanging out for a month or two until she had a big issue to talk to me about. I love her with all of my heart but I can’t do it anymore. I can’t be the on the back burner waiting to here about her life. We don’t have a genuine friendship. I’ve actually told her I have a problem with what’s going on and have said I need her to step up but she turned it on me saying I was being childish and that she’s “busy” and doesn’t have time to maintain a friendship and that I need to go over when it’s convenient for her. 

I decided to delete her off of all of my social media because it was upsetting me seeing her say she’s busy but yet still make a lot of her time for her other friends and then when we hang out she just talks about herself for hours. But she apparently hasn’t noticed and it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve talked to her and she texted me asking for a favor and then said “nevermind how have you been”. 2 weeks I haven’t said anything and she asked me for a favor.

I’m not the type of person to end a friendship and burn a bridge especially with being friends for so long because even though she might be toxic I care about her and still love her as a friend.

243,"So, I'm Autsitic with ADHD which means a double dose of executive dysfunction - normally once I go to bed I can sleep without any problem (so melatonin or sleep hygiene tips aren't needed) it's just I struggle to tell myself to go to bed. 

My brain struggles to say 'Right, time to stop what you're doing and head to bed' or see through the various steps to getting ready to bed. Unless there's something external, such as my partner staying over deciding when we go to bed or having to be up for work, I struggle. 

Over the past couple of weeks the stress of Christmas, and lack of routine due to not going to work, has messed up my sleeping patterns. 

I'd normally go to bed around 6am, or if working the next day then more like 3am - I'm currently not going to bed until around 9am, also when I am going to bed I'm struggling to get to sleep so I'm not actually sleeping until around 11am. 

On top of that I'm also struggling to get out of bed - work is only a few days a week and I can call in to say I'm not going into the office, thus it means that I've no reason to go to bed. Lack of routine plus depression is keeping me from getting up, inability to self-regulate is keeping me trapped in this state of being nocturnal. 

In turn I've not seen sunlight for days, by the time I get up its too late to go to the store so I'm going without food, and in general I feel rubbish as I'm not getting anything done when I'm like this.

250,"(I’m a Guy, 18) So I started hanging out with this girl (19) a couple months ago, and to make a long story short we had started fucking, now she had called me attractive before and she knew I liked her long before that started happening because I would buy her things and in her own words “treat her so good.” so I tell her how I feel and she says something in between the lines of “I only see you as a friend.” And after that she sorta flaunts the fact that she’s lonely and single all over social media but still is talking to a bunch of guys she clearly wants more than me and it’s kinda heartbreaking to see her fawn over guys or talk about how she wants to do *insert random sexual act* to this guy right to my face and I tell her it bothers me but she always same the same thing like “I’m sorry your just my best friend, and I have no one else to tell.” Should I back out of this “friendship.” or whatever it is for the sake of my own feelings?

252,"Hello guys,

Long story short of my life, I have never been much of a normal person (people consider me weird), not much a socialité, I have a small group of so called friends but normally I spend time on my own. Growing up hasn't been much an easy task for me, I think in my late teens I developed a strong depression accompained with a great desire to watch porn daily. Now that I'm 22 I think situation just got out of hand, now I basically spend my vacation days in my bed checking my cellphone for messages from people who are just busy or don't care enough about me and watching memes, I don't have motivation to do anything and when I try something I just get tired and get back to bed, I study engineering so there's a lot of stuff that I can learn by myself to develop a better career but as I mentioned, I never have the motivation to complete tutorials or online courses. My sexual life is also a disaster, back when I was 18 I did something about which I of: I lost my virginity with a hooker, later that day I returned home crying and told a friend about what happened. To this day I have had hired hookers at least 4 times in my life, minor stuff, just a massage, kisses and stuff like that (I still feel like it wasn't correct thing to do, but it happens when I can't control myself enough) even just a few hours ago I was feeling so horny that I was chatting with a hooker for a massage session, the only thing that stopped me was a quick wank minutes before calling for a taxi. My love life has also been difficult, I don't consider myself ugly, some girls (few off course) have told me that I'm quite handsome, but till this date I haven't had a formal girlfriend, I have been dating with quite a few girls, but later on they lose interest and leave me, Tinder was a great tool but now I think the kind of girls that you find there is not the one to start a relationship with, so I just quitted it. To conclude guys, deep inside me I want to change my life, but I've realized how lazy and pesimist I am, I've overcome bad situations in the past, but now... I can't, I've lost my spark. I don't want an ostentatious life, I just want to be happy and do what's right.",09Jan2020,1
253,"It all started in June, I took an edible that my parents gave me and they told me it wouldn't cause any harm. I felt fucking amazing, I felt great I felt ALIVE! Thus began my pot habit I began smoking weed with my parents. Mind you, My parents are hippies from the 70's and 80's who believe everything negative about marijuana is false. I know it sounds wrong, But please just have an open mind. The first few months were great until I decided to research what pot does to teens. I read it, Ignored it and moved on. A few months later I began to feel very guilty about smoking. I took up smoking to help with my chronic anxiety that I had been dealing with for a few years that I couldn't deal with. It has certainly helped with my anxiety and I have had tons of fun while smoking pot. One of the more positive outcomes though, Is that I have bonded a lot more with my parents since beginning smoking weed we've had a lot of good times bonding over the devil's herb. They both have constantly told me to never do harder drugs, or drink alcohol at my age which is good. I've heard people say that ""at least you're smoking in a safe environment and not on the street"" and ""At least your parents know what they're getting"" I've heard many conflicting reports on marijuana and brain development, and let me tell you it stresses me the fuck out .

256,"**TL/DR: wife of 17 years lies, hides stuff, and shows no remorse for the last 3 years, only wants to actually put effort in now that I am ready to walk away broken and drained.**

&amp;#x200B;

First off, we have been together 17 years. Up until some point in 2017 she was caring, responsible, and hard working. 

She started a new job and was doing well. She then met a guy she worked with and began lying/hiding conversations and claim she was working late, when actually they were hanging out in the work parking lot. 

Around this time she went manic and spent the next year being hateful and narcissistic. it was also around this time that I found out she had been an alcoholic for a long time, but was able to hide it due to my work hours.

After a year of abuse and lies, she quit drinking and got meds for her bi-polar disorder. Instead of working on herself and trying to make up for her wrongs. She has spent the last year and a half continuing to lie about everything. Even when caught, she would double down on the lie.

She spent 6 months jobless. I had to sell off a car i bought brand new (only one payment left) to catch up on bills, I also had to take a second job to make ends meet. All while she slept up to 20 hours a day. Since then i have spent all of my energy outside  on trying to get her to figure out what was wrong and to fix it.

After another year of her doing the bare minimum to just make it through the day, still lying about pretty much everything. My oldest kid (13) brought up Saturday night that ""mom made me not like you for a long time. Mom lied and said you were controlling, manipulative, and abusive. and that she (daughter) was sorry for believing her mom because it was all obviously a lie."" I of course assured her that it wasn't her fault, its her job to believe her mom. I also told her to not be mad at her mom because she was having mental health issues back when she was saying these things.

I let my wife know about this conversation and that she needed to apologize to our daughter. Wife claims to have no memory of this saying these things, but agrees that she will make it right with the kid. I know she did say this stuff because of things she would say when manic and trying to upset me during disagreements. the thing is, she never even thought to apologize to me about saying this stuff. It was at this point I realized she still does not feel any guilt or remorse for what she does, and would not change.

I left Sunday afternoon after this conversation, and came back Monday. She had to beg her mom to stay there for two days, and left Monday afternoon. She texted me multiple times telling me how she wanted to come back and that she misses me. I replied with saying ""I miss the old you, but she's been gone for three years now."" 

She came back to our house today since her mom kicked her out. After so long of begging her to figure out why she changed so badly and did everything I could to get her to put effort into getting better, she only now claims to have figured out what has caused her to be so lazy, selfish, and hurtful.

I am bitter, confused, and have no energy left to put into this relationship, and have told her as much. She still wants to try and fix 'us."" I told her there hasn't been an ""us"" for three years, its just been me and its just yet another selfish act on her part to try and fix things now that I am done and burnt out.

I let her know that she needs to get right for herself and our kids, and that i am not promising to be around even if she gets herself figured out. Even if she goes back to being her old self, I fear I have been through too much to ever forgive and trust her again.

I love her dearly, but to quote someone from here ""I will not keep lighting myself on fire to keep her warm."" 

**Question: is it fair to her for me to let her drag this out any more? I am extremely bitter and have been shown for three years that her words cannot be trusted. I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive her and trust again.**",09Jan2020,1

258,"I'm 35 (F) and i'm having to come to terms with the realisation that i'll never be a Mum. Ironically, it's been in the last few years that I've realised that i really, really wanted to experience being a mother. 

It's not that i didn't want to be a mum when i was younger, it's just that like most people i was focused on living life and just assumed that it would happen when it happened. I did all the things you're supposed to do that 'give meaning' and 'happiness' to life - traveled the world, pursued a career, tried new things and pushed myself out of my comfort zone, etc etc. But the older I've got, the more I've realised that all this 'stuff' didn't matter so much (to me anyway) and that love and my soul and my heart are all that really matters. 

I'm really interested to hear from others who have had to accept a life without children (when they really wanted them). I'm absolutely devastated and can barely imagine how to go on with life. Like i said, i don't really get true happiness or meaning from 'things' - I've always wondered why i never felt as happy as others did just from 'doing things' until i realised that being coupled up with someone and having intimacy and love was essential to my mental and emotional health. Unfortunately, i have absolutely no way of ever being a partner to anyone, let alone a mother. 

I'm not interested in fostering, or in IVF as a single woman - I wanted a family of my own. I'm possibly in a unique position as well, because i am trying to cope with all of this as a single person - i feel like A LOT of other people in this situation may have had fertility problems, but they've gone through it with a partner, and at least may have a partner to grow old with. I don't have this, which is making it a million times harder. 

Is there anyone else who has gone through this (without a partner)? What was it like?",09Jan2020,1

261,"Sorry if the title to this is a little weird


I'm going to try to shorten this story as much as possible so that I can get straight to the point. My best friend was outed as a gay athiest to her family and they have not been accepting at all. She's grounded, cannot talk to anyone, is being isolated, and her general well-being is being ignored.

I saw her for the first time since this all went down a few hours ago. Her wrists have red marks all over them, she's making serious comments about suicide, and she looks- God I don't even know how to explain it. She just looks like she's given up. 

I know for a fact that it is her mom that is being the most unaccepting, and she's making her sisters and father follow suit. She is in a Christian homeschool family, so she can't really get help at all.

I talked to the only adult that is outside of the situation that knows about it, and she and I both agree that I need to call her father and tell him that if he doesn't let his daughter get the *secular* *accepting* help she needs, he is going to lose her rather through suicide or complete emotional separating when she graduates high school.

How do I handle the phone call? What do I say so that he understands the situation? And how do I convince him that he needs to help his daughter?

I would like to be able to do all of this without being forced away from her, but i understand that that is a risk no matter what",09Jan2020,1
262,"Posted this on legal advice too..

My  SO checked his bank account today (Chase bank ), it's only been a week  since he last checked, and there's now less than $5 of the $1200 he had  saved up and a series of out-of-state googleplay purchases in his  history. He was never warned his account was being drained and it  happened over the course of the week. Since his phone service ended  today he couldn't even call the bank and they're closed now, he'll go in  tomorrow but honestly we don't know how to go about trying to get the  money back. Will the bank help or the police, or will we just be told  we're out of luck?  How does he prove these purchases weren't his?  Should we be contacting google play somehow? He doesn't have any credit  cards and wants to switch bank accounts after this is done, will that be  hard to do without an I.D.? 

On  top of this he was fired today without warning for using 13 of his 48  hours sick time when the managers told him to use it for a bad stomach  virus he caught (he was a cook), and he's living with my family but we can't support him so if he can't find work in two weeks when his food runs out ..Idk what happens..and he has increasingly scary heart problems/seizure he was in the middle of going to doctors for, but without his job he has no health insurance and won't receive the life saving treatment he needs, including the sleep ventilator he was  scheduled to get in two weeks.

He has no support network of any kind, no friends, came from an abusive household, it's just me and what shelter my parents can give him for a while, I can't find a job either, there don't appear to be any helpful government programs I'm aware of, the shelter is so bad here he'd rather chance it on the streets in an unsafe town in the winter..with his health problems that's just..a death sentance..but my parents can't feed him..we spent the day asking around a leaving applications at various jobs downtown  only to find out his phone service ran out and none of those places can contact him..

265,"Okay for some background information, im an male (16) Norweagian student and over the past couple of months me and a close friend were going trough drama. After some time of thinking to myself i decided that i needed to cut her out after figuring out its a toxic relationship, mostly after destroying my trust in her. She did not take it well, ever since i cut her out there have been both an extremly intense atmosphere in the classroom. 

She told alot of false information, such as name-calling and other really non-serious stuff. Tough it had been taken seriously by some of the class members. Skip forward a couple weeks and things start to seem good again. Its less tense, im happier again since the previous friendship were pushing stress on me anymore and some were starting to speak to me again even after the false alligations.
(I dont 100% know if i should mention them since this is my first time posting here, so ask for it in the  comment section and i would gladly explain =)  )

Well fast forward even more to today, this evening after a friend of mine left, he had given me a little hit of alcohol and one of his adhd meds. ( i know im extremly dumb for doing this, and im working improving myself)

Well i go in the snapchat group chat for our class and begin to talk just memes and just having fun. Thats until i mention alcohol real quick and im called retarded, i dident think much of it until they started to talk about gathering a group and beating me up.
One of the messages roughly translated to Norweagian is ""you're fucking dead fag"", and ""i hope you know how to fight"" and so on  (i have secrelty taken screenshots of the convo in case i will need it later for whats about to happen next.)
They started to talk about the alligations (keep in mind no one had listened to my part of the story, the only information they have been getting is from this 1 friend i had, all i had been doing over time is showing my part of the story when asked about it). 

At this point im scared shitless, and i call up an old friend which i trust with my life, and from previous experiences i know she can be trusted. But i explain it to her while crying over the phone, she calms me down for half an hour and suggests i call the authoroties and file som sort of report (annmelde, dont know the english word sorry) since they have an track record and mean serious business when they say such. So thats what i did i explain roughly what have happened, and then was told to call my school in the morning, if that dosent help i get to report (annmelde) them.  

After some hesitation i tell my parents the situation and that im terrified of going to school the following day. I have been told to stay home, and we'll first talk to the principal at the school and later file an report at the police station. And thats the story so far.


So im asking, what should i be doing next?
Is there anything i should keep in mind?
What is going to be the consequences of this in later future? 
Is there something else i should do?
I need some advice, im desperate

267,"(19f) Back in November of 2019 a friend of a friend’s guinea pig got pregnant and had babies. She wanted to give them away and I decided to take them because I love animals and I wanted something to take care of. I’ve had them since then, and after the first couple weeks I realized how high maintenance and fragile guinea pigs are. They get sick easily, there’s a lot of consistent grooming that needs to be done, and overall they’re just needy animals. That isn’t the problem for me, I know how to take responsibility for commitments I make, so I’ve had no trouble keeping their cage cleaned and always keeping a close eye on their health and whatnot.

My problem has to do with a few things. The biggest is that I have severe anxiety, especially when it comes to health (of pets and friends/family) and I’ve sort of become a hypochondriac about them. I’m constantly worried about them and it affects my every day mood and my ability to handle stress. Second, I feel that I don’t have enough disposable income to spend if something were to happen and there was a large vet bill. There are maybe one or two vets in my area that are even experienced with guinea pigs, and even then there aren’t any specialists who can give me in depth information about their health. Thirdly, I’m very terrified of death. Just the thought of the two pigs dying, even at old age after a long life, breaks my heart. I literally can’t stomach it.

I live in northern california. There is a Guinea Pig Rescue in Los Angeles that’s very well praised and has a lot of resources. I’ve been debating with myself on whether or not I’d like to surrender them. On one hand, the pigs would be safe there and whoever adopted them would be properly educated on care, and the adopter would have that rescue nearby to go to for help and information. I don’t have anything like that in my area, so any emergency would be completely in my hands and that really terrifies me. However, I’m terrified of the unknown. Of the possibility of them ever being mistreated. I feel like I am the only person I can trust to take care of them, but at the same time I feel like I’m not the best owner they could have. I’m in a serious dilemma on whether or not I should give them up.

I can’t give them back to the friend because she takes horrible care of her own guinea pigs and I love mine too much to throw them to the wind like that.

I really don’t know what to do. Anyone with pets out there, please give me advice on what to do. Is there a way to gain confidence in myself to be the best owner I can be? Or should I do what is safe and give them up to more experienced owners? Giving them up would break my heart, but keeping them and watching them die (no matter sooner or later) would also crush me.

I don’t know how to do that though. On Instagram specifically I could end up growing even more until brands reach out for sponsored posts but even then that’s not guaranteed. Is creating a website the way to go? Or should I be in search of a company hiring a reviewer? How frequently does that happen? Is it easy to get a job a reviewer? I doubt as if anyone in here can help but I thought I’d try. Instagram just doesn’t seem like the best platform for this sort of thing.,09Jan2020,1

284,"I’m in my first year (second term) of university and i’m seriously struggling to i don’t even know.. Like it’s so overwhelming.

In high school i had so much fun i had all my friends (that i still see on breaks) that i got to see every day and i did well and loved my achoool and teachers and i had fun and played on sports teams had lots of friends and people i could go to, and actually loved high school. I was such a happy bubbly person and would strike up a convo with everyone and really liked and enjoyed life, never struggled with mental illnesses or anything. I was a happy kid.

Then i started university and i was so happy at the start, homesick, but happy and i play on the women’s soccer team here and i had a great group of girls and the other rookies were awesome too and i was having a flippin amazing time. I also had never really had amazing marks in high school but in uni my average is a 78% which is very good for me and life seemed really great. But then everyone on the soccer team who i was friends with made other friends and the people on my floor got close and my friend from high school who’s also here made a whole group of friends and really loves it here. I’m so happy for all of them and they always try to include me but i went from having at least 5 close friends to no one. I feel like i don’t have anyone here. I feel so lonely, i have an amazing boyfriend who comes and visits and is seriously a rock for me and i have my best friends from home who i still talk to but they’re not here. I’m no ones person here i’m no ones first choice to hangout with. And this is just the start of my problem.

I also am so overwhelmed with work. I try to hard but i have ADD and even the school doesn’t accommodate very well to this, i’m constantly catching up and overworking myself. I’m always worrying about the next assigment and it sucks because at my university i’m taking what is classified as a “bird course” by other students which it really isn’t. (It’s global studies and french.) And every time i ask someone to study or complain and worry about schoolwork they’re like you’re in global studies it’s so simple.. blah blah blah. heard it a million times. It makes me feel stupid. 

I’ve also somehow convinced myself that me being alone in my room during the week at night isn’t okay because you see everyone’s snapchat stories of them always out and always just hanging out with friends and i’m not doing that. I’m not saying i wanna be around people all the time but i just want to chill with people i like and who like me too. I’ve tried branching out and asking but it always seems one-sided or i get asked to a party. And i do see people during the week and hangout and party on weekends but it’s that empty feeling. That no one would really ever care if u were there or not.

I really actually enjoy my course and i’ve tried to surround myself with good people here, which has worked a bit i’ve made some cool friends and stuff but i don’t know what to do anymore. 

I hate it.

But my parents are so proud of me and i want a good job. I want to be successful for them. I keep telling myself just make it to the end of the year but that for another 3 years. It’s brutal.

I want and i’m going to try to go see guidance counseling, but our school isn’t too great for it. I don’t think i should be sad and i keep swallowing my emotions. Saying that i have the life. I have amazing friends back home, i have awesome best friends, i’m living my dream playing university soccer, i’m making my parents proud, i met awesome people here.

Then why the f am i sad.

I cry a lot thinking about it and it’s draining me. I look tired. i’ve gained weight. 

I miss my mom too but i don’t want to miss out on the experience i want to live here.
I have a house for next year with 4 other girls and i’m hoping it gets better. I want it to get better.
I want to push through but when does it get better.

Also how do u ask people for help or even just to talk to them about how you’re feeling cause i know some of my friends would love to help but i don’t want to unload on them.

I don’t want to go on forever on why i’m sad, i just needed to get it out.

I’m sorry this is so long so if u made it here. Thanks.❤️",09Jan2020,1
285,"Hey Reddit.

I'll start this bluntly. I (16 F) need to talk to my mom about her alcohol tolerance and how it's unacceptable to act and behave in certain ways. Every time she drinks she overdrinks and gets wasted. This leads to bad decisions and a lot of mental issues for me for months if not years. I need to talk to her but I'm not sure how.

287,"So to give a bit of background my friend (14F) and I (16M) are both freshmen. We’ve been kind of harboring a secret relationship from our friend group. We kind of like each other? Or are closer than our friends think we are. We’ve kissed a couple of times and we sort of have feelings for each other. While this was happening, I’ve been kind of liking another girl too. However she’s very distant and I don’t see her a lot. Mainly because she’s not really in our friend group. Today, I talked to her and she said she doesn’t feel comfortable because of the things I say, because of my age. I explained to her that I’ll stop, but only 2 years older than her. So it’s not that big of the deal. However, I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable so I stopped, because I respect people’s boundaries. 

My other friend, the one that likes me, had a conversation with me earlier about our relationship. We were trying to figure out what to do with it, and she thinks we should try dating. It would be fun, she says. Besides we’re both freshmen, so it wouldn’t be anything too serious. When I think about it and when the time actually comes for us to make a decision, I get confused. I don’t really know what I feel and I think to myself, “I don’t really like her as much now for some reason.” She told me to think it over because I keep changing my mind. We’re both a bit indecisive. 

So to me, it’s like on the other hand, there’s this girl: who doesn’t really like me, but who I sort of crush on. We don’t talk and she pretty much doesn’t like me that way, and I’m chasing after a dream it seems. 

On the other hand, you have this girl who: Likes me, known her longer, trust her, we have the same friend group, we kind of like each other, wants to take it to the next step with me. 

Obviously I think you know what the choice would be, but for some reason... I can’t take it. I always chicken out or at the last minute and say, “Nah” and try to go for something higher or greater than what’s already there. Which could be a good sign, but also a bad sign as well. 

I don’t know what to do here, any advice is highly appreciated.",09Jan2020,1

291,"My parents are divorced. We stay at my dad's place once a week and at out mom's for the rest of the week. When we were younger, this worked well and all was good. But, as we've gotten older, I found that my sister's began to resent going to my dad's house because they felt more at home at my mom's  (which I initially didn't understand/like but now I see where they are coming from and do not resent them for it). Although, soon it seemed they started turning on my dad. Year by year, they grew to not like spending time with him at all. Now, we are at a point where my sisters just use him for his money. It's as if they pretend to love him, yet behind his back they hate him, always talking about him in a negative manner, doing anything they can to avoid visiting him (unless ofcourse he is about to buy them something they asked for - which by the way, they ask for a LOT of things from him). Don't get me wrong, my dad's not an angel, but he is does not at all deserve to be treated the way they are treating him. Every complaint I hear them utter is either wrong, rooted in a misunderstanding, or valid but could also be said about my mother (who they never complain about and give all their love to). I've long ago accepted that my sisters will never love my mom and dad equally as I do, but I thought they'd atleast othewise love him dearly. My sisters kind of know how I feel about this, and so they try to hide whenever they backtalking my dad but they're attempts are futile and half-assed.

Overall, apart from when we're at our dad's house (and they try to make it very obvious that they hate it there when we are there) and when they are compaining about him, I really enjoy being with my sisters and care about them. But I just can't turn a blind eye to their apparent lack of morality anymore. When I see the way they treat my dad, I feel as though they are a living embodiment of evil itself. What shoud I do? I feel like I have to choose between defending my father (and losing my sisters) or turning a blind eye (and keeping a good relationship with my sisters - but I feel become just as bad as them if I do this). I don't want to be one of those families where siblings haven't talked to eachother in decades because they resent eachother.",09Jan2020,1
292,"How to break up with a friend?

I’ve been trying to do this for the past year and a half, but it’s very difficult, since this person is insistent in maintaining a friendship with me.

I’ve only known her for a couple of years and have hung out only about half a dozen times. However, she perceives us to be much closer than we actually are. She messages me almost on a daily basis, with memes, stuff that remind her of me, random thoughts and rants. I rarely reply, and when I do, it’s something brief and polite or a simple “like”. 

I met her through a mutual friend and hung out with her on a one-on-one basis a few times afterward. I immediately saw a lot of red flags. She was extremely impulsive. She would show up at my apartment randomly. Sometimes when we would hang out, she would randomly change plans on me, make sudden stops at places, like a boyfriend’s house, and lose track of time to the point where I missed school or had to sleep over at the guy’s house because she couldn’t drive me back home. Any favor came with strings attached. She would treat me to something, then ask me if I could buy her certain things (since she had treated me). Even though it was technically fair, I still found that strange, since I never asked to be treated to food or drinks in the first place. She would make a lot of passive aggressive comments and criticisms. Several times she tried to manipulate me into doing homework for her. I stopped seeing her for over a year but she kept contact with me on social media. I deleted my instagram page and made a new one so I could start fresh. She found me and has been reaching out to me regularly ever since.

I ignore this person 95% of the time, yet she talks to me as if we are super close. She is pregnant right now and the father isn’t in the picture, and I do feel for her because that’s an awful situation to be in. The other day she posted on social media that she was contemplating suicide, so I reached out out of pity and hung out after that long break. When we hung out, I did support her emotionally, but I also felt uncomfortable at the fact that she was still as impulsive as ever. That same night, she was planning to have a one night stand with a boy fresh out of high school who had no idea of her pregnancy. It was 1am and he lived far away, and no matter how much I tried to talk her out of it, she still went — even though she was exhausted and falling asleep. My partner witnessed the red flags again (including the forced closeness and everything having strings attached), which I had put aside because I felt bad for her. He made me realize that seeing someone out of pity isn’t okay. So I’ve drifted off again. But since then, she’s sent me a baby registry, asked me to be the godmother of her child, printed out a photo of my partner and I to show her future child her ‘family’. She asked me if it was okay to do that (the photo thing) and I didn’t know what to say except “yes”. This is on top of asking to see me once a week and me coming up with an excuse all the time.

I have a tight circle of friends that I have a lot in common with and that I’ve known since high school and early college. They’re people that I truly love to be around and, most importantly, trust. They’re complicated people, but I feel comfortable airing out my disagreements with them. They’re receptive and mature. I hope I don’t give the impression that I’m just not a social person or that I can’t accept people’s flaws. I would talk to her about her behavior if I cared enough about maintaining our friendship, but I don’t because she constantly and passionately complains about anyone who tries to offer her advice or guidance. And like I said, we don’t have a bond really, so there’s nothing worth saving for me. There’s no shared belief system, background, or interest. My partner thinks she wants to be my friend for the validation I give her.

How do I break up with her? Ignoring isn’t working. Blocking seems too harsh, especially with her current mental health. I still haven’t replied to the baby shower invitation she sent me several days ago.

TLDR; I want to break up with a friend who, although not having done anything explicitly messed up, is not someone I want to maintain a close friendship with. I feel like it’s all or nothing with them since they haven’t accepted my obvious distance and distanced themselves. How do I break up with them without seeming like a jerk?",09Jan2020,1
293,"So i’m currently a freshman in high school and right now i’m taking the basic class (bio, geometry, honors la, latin, orchestra)  that a lot of freshman take minus latin and orchestra but i’m interested in going into the medical field when i’m older and specifically i want to become an ob/gyn and i’ve been trying to decide what classes i should take throughout my next three high school years to help aid me in fulfilling my dream.

For backstory I’m a 19f living at home after I had to retroactively withdraw from my university for mental health reasons. My mom is extremely strict and my friends and therapist worried about how moving back in with my mom would be. I’ve never been a bad kid, never been in trouble at school or with the law, but I do smoke marijuana sometimes. I don’t feel like this is such a crazy thing because it’s so normalized now, but my mom sees weed as crack. I have a terrible relationship with my mom, she is extremely strict and emotionally abusive. I’m still tracked on Life360 and I have an early curfew. I’m rarely allowed to go out though because I have to ask to go out and explain where/when/with who. They also usually say no because I have chores to do (sometimes they’ll make up chores like clean the baseboards/ dust the fans) or they’ll start badgering me about how they feed me and put a roof over my head and I’m disrespectful/don’t care about my family. Honestly I thought all of this was normal until recently. 

Anyways. Tonight my mom burst into my room saying she smelled weed. Of course I denied, but she went on a rant about how weed destroys people and families and kills. I recently got a new job so I could save up my own money. I have been trying to get a job for a year. she said she is going to take all of my paychecks now and put them in a secret account. I don’t know what to do. She also threatened to kick me out if she ever smells it again. My mom is not the type of person to argue with and I feel like I can’t stand up for myself around her. She has complete control over me financially and she also pays for my college. I recently applied to a community college in my town and I’m worried she would cut me off.

296,"This search for advice, ideas and questions was originally posted by myself in r/seduction. I didn’t find any “perfect” subreddit for my post and I want to ask my question in different subs because I hope to get very different insights and perspectives on my struggle.  If you know any subreddit that’s more fitting for my question I’d be very thankful if you’d let me know.  This is my first own post here, I hope it fits for you and the mods. 


Ok, so here’s the thing. I’m not sure wether I (m, 31) can grasp my situation exactly but I’d appreciate any advise or clarifying questions of you folks because I’m stuck. 

For quite some time I’ve been struggling with “game”, “seduction”, “flirting” or whatever you may call it. This frustrates me beyond anything because four years back I had to start a fucking calendar to not lose track of my dates. I’m not trying to brag here or impress anyone - I literally started my first organizer in my late twenties to manage my dates; oftentimes it seemed to me like the more women I was seeing the less I had to invest in any interaction because girls either knew me already because of stories (I’m living in a small but very young city with lots of female students) or because of my own narcissistic charisma that I was radiating at that time. 

Cut to four years later. After making a wonderful person of the girls I’ve slept with my girlfriend, endless fights about her legitimate jealousy and trust-issues, almost 150 sessions of psychotherapy for myself, a terrible but rewarding breakup, I’ve not only become more aware of myself, my good qualities and my disfunctional behaviors, thought- and relationship-patterns but I really started to love myself step by step. What I mean by that is that I started to feel empathy for myself in moments of vulnerability and thus for almost anyone around me; I’ve built great relationships with new friends and repaired the old ones as good as I could, healed the relationship with my father and siblings, focused on my career - like really the good stuff. I realized that I probably wasn’t made for a monogamous relationship, made that clear to my then best friend who I fell in love with; we became a couple 18 months ago and have been building a wonderful (nonmonogamous) relationship since then I’ve never even imagined was possible. 

The only fucking problem right now is that I seem to completely have lost my game; I am considered a self-confident and charismatic person by my friends and new people I meet. In group projects at university or at work I usually find myself quite naturally in a position where I actively listen to everyone and work towards a common goal while appreciating differences in perspectives and opinions. Still I’m the guy who protests authentically when there’s something going wrong in my opinion while doing so in a manner that gives my counterpart the opportunity to respond without being crushed. In short: I often act as something I’d call a “good leader”. 

Four years ago I was kind of an asshole, especially to women. I always pushed myself to care less and it seemed as if I was rewarded for it. Now that I’m really interested in women, their thoughts and feelings, hopes and fears, I’m counting rejection after rejection. 

Probably one of my core questions might be: Can I be a respectful playboy? And if so, how? 

Sorry if this post might seem chaotic, it’s the first time I’ve tried to verbalize my struggle and English isn’t my mother tongue. 

I would really really appreciate help from you guys. Thanks alot in advance. 
 
Tl;dr: Lost my “game” with women after changing myself towards a more loving person. I don’t want to be a nice guy nor do I want to be the asshole I used to be.  Thanks for your help.

Edit: I used a new account for this because I didn’t want to use my “real” account (which is known by close people of mine) or my porn-account. I hope this is fine.

A year and 6 months about into the relationship Kylee finds out max has been cheating on her the entire relationship (about 4 months ago) but they continued dating. 4 days ago she started cheating on max with me.

That has a history of its own and the tldr the situation is the girlfriend and the mother couldn't get along, and the girlfriend couldn't deal with his mom's disability(fibromyalgia), personality(she's very abrasive and kind of has a strong personality that you need to get used to), and having to share her boyfriend with his mom. So when they got evicted from their place and we're moving out they told the mother basically that there would be no place for her and she would have ended up on the street, but I really couldn't let that happen she was always nice to me. So I said she can move in and live with my father and I, but now due to problems with the landlord we should be getting an eviction notice soon. And looking for places has been really hard because she has cats and one of them just had kittens. Like, I want to take her but, I've already done all that I could and I don't know what to do.  And if I am able to bring her if she's going to have to abandon her cats Christmas places around where I live don't allow animals and this is with searching in like 50 miles of my current living area.

308,"Specifically, the origin of my tricep short head/medial head (I'm not sure which, could even be the long head, I really have no idea). 

Recently I have been experiencing a sharp, pinching pain in the Triceps brachii area and would like to understand why this is happening.

During a standard Cable Tricep Extension, if I come into a full contraction I get a sharp, uncomfortable pinching sensation. With continued use it becomes slightly painful and I am unable to fully contract the Triceps.

This hasn't happened before and only until recently have I been ditching the standard cable tricep extension because I am afraid I might worsen the effects.

310,"So, a bit of background:
I’m a first year university student 
I grew up in city A
The house in city A is the only house I’ve ever known. Literally all of my life has been spent at the house in city A 

My parents recently moved to city B and live there now.

I go to university in city C. 
I have 90% of my friends in city A, no friends in city B and some in city C, but I am very homesick and I only want to go back to city A, I don’t want to go to city B anymore but of course I still want to see my parents. 

This summer when university is out, obviously I’ve got some time to work things out, I want to go back home to city A and get a job for the summer at my local tennis club, which is where I had worked from 2017-2019. My family and especially I know almost everyone there and my mentor coaches there. It’s like a second home and I miss working there a lot. The positions and hours are flexible and whatnot. 

However, I’ve mentioned the idea to my dad, and he of course says they live in City B. I want to spend time with them but to spend a minute in city B would be a complete waste of time because it’s not home, it’s a fine city but it’s not where I’m from and I don’t like thinking that’s any sort of home. City A and B are about 8 hours drive away and I have a car of my own in city A. 

The issue is my dad has work in city B. My mom doesn’t work anymore, and can drive down between cities at basically any time. My parents aren’t planning to sell the house in city A for a few years, but time is limited and I would hate to waste it in city B. 

Even if it’s living in city B and driving to work in city A, that is fine with me. However if I was to live in city A, which I would much rather do, I would be living in the house alone (I have no siblings) unless my parents drove down weekly to visit me. I would be able to see friends in city A and frankly I don’t want to go back to city B for a long time. Finances are not an issue, but it’s not efficient to fly back and forth every week. 

Are there any ideas I can propose that will allow me to maximise time in city A? I would rather live alone for weekly in city A than live with my parents in city B. 

Thank you!",09Jan2020,1

312,"**TL;DR:** How do I respectfully talk with my elderly Grandmother to ensure she has a will so her estranged brother doesn't inherit assets she would almost certainly prefer go to other family members?


My octogenarian ""grandmother"" is putting her affairs in order. (*""Grandmother"" refers to my maternal grandmother's best friend who didn't have any children and helped to raise me.  I'll use ""Grandmother"" to describe her moving forward, and ""Other-grandmother"" when mentioning my maternal grandmother.)

A widow with no children, if she doesn't have a will, her assets, go to her brother by default, with whom she's not very close.  In fact, it seems she dislikes him fairly strongly.

My aunt mentioned that when she had talked with my Grandmother about the will, Grandmother would usually change the topic, as if she was uncomfortable dealing with the reality of her death coming sooner than later.  Aunt said that Grandmother had initiated the process before, but not ended up completing the will.  Aunt has brought this up in conversation with me about 10 times over the past year.  Most of those times, she's tried to ask my 
Grandmother if she completed the will, and got a dismissive response.

During an emotional conversation over a year ago that I can't recall very well, Grandmother mentioned to me that she planned to leave me something.  She mentioned something about an executor, but I can't recall who that was.  I believe she may have asked me if I was willing or able to do something related to the will, but I can't recall and am not familiar with the process in general.

At least three times over the past year-plus, she asked me if I'd ever want to move back east, implying she'd leave me her house to live in.  I explained that I currently have no interest in moving from my current home in a global city, back to my backwoods hometown.

My aunt was the executor of my Other-grandmother's will.  She's a fairly high strung person, given to occasional emotional immaturity/instability.  I have considered the possibility that my grandmother chose to tell my aunt she doesn't have a will, to avoid the acrimony that could arise from simply telling her she chose someone else to execute it.  Not that my aunt would expect to be appointed to that role, anyway.  But they do have a fairly close relationship, while it's sort of an open secret that I'm her favorite.  

I could see my Grandmother not wanting her estate plan to negatively impact her relationship with my Aunt in her final days.  So maybe she told me what I needed to know (which I forgot/am uncertain about) and told my aunt a white lie to keep the peace.  This has been my working belief for some time, but my aunt's continual mentions make me feel like I should be sure and not just guess.

Anyway,

I don't want to seem rude, entitled or otherwise unsavory.  I am very close with my Grandmother and talk with her frequently about all kinds of deeply personal topics.  Especially the past 3 years or so, as she helped me navigate a series of personal crises and we've talked on the phone well over a hundred hours each year.  Her estate is something she's brought up a few times, but I'm just generally concerned/anxious about me mentioning it.

I feel like it's important to ask her again, that this is something I would be remiss to not mention as her health continues to deteriorate and now that it's weighing heavily on my mind.  Because there's no fixing a mistake like that.  

But admittedly, I was hurt by how my Other-grandmother, who raised me most of my childhood, chose to distribute the vast majority of her assets to her three children (not 'counting' me as one of her 'kids').  I don't want that emotion to negatively affect how I deal with this current situation.  FWIW, I have discussed that pain with my Grandmother several times.  I have considered the possibility that the two of them coordinated this, with Other-grandmother knowing that my Grandmother would leave me a substantial inheritance and sort of ""balance it out"".

I don't want to influence what my Grandmother may leave to whom.  I don't want her to see me as greedy, manipulative or anything like that.  But I don't want to let this slip and come to find out once it's too late that she hadn't followed through on a plan to implement her wishes.

How should I approach this?  I'm flying home to visit next week, so I'll be able to discuss this in person.",09Jan2020,1
313,"Yeesh, ok. I made a post awhile back talking about this, maybe a month ago, but things have quickly gotten worse. 

My friend is always poking fun at me, and although she is just “joking around”, it’s gotten to a point where its just not a joke anymore. She only says it when she’s around other people because she thinks that other people will think it’s funny, wanting to gain a laugh from them.

She is scarily possessive of me. I have found it so hard to go out and hang out with other friends because I’m constantly worried that she’s going to find out where I am and lash out on me for not inviting her. She tracks my location, again as a “joke”, but it’s really not a joke anymore. If I block her from seeing my location she freaks out and demands me to unblock her. If I were to tell her I’m going out with someone that isn’t her, she would either throw a fit on how I’m not including her, or she would try to work her way into my plans.

I know that I’m going to get a ton of comments that simply just say “leave her she’s toxic”, but in my head I cannot do that. I’m a senior in high school and have a few months of it left, so maybe I will hold out until then, but it seems to be getting to a point that is simply unbearable, and overall, just super deteriorating to my self esteem. This is someone I’ve known for over six years, and i feel like if I were to just leave it now, it would be a bad decision on my part. The most confusing part is that we do have good times, but when they’re bad, they’re awful. She’s also the type of person to make me feel bad for confronting her about something, constantly playing victim instead of owning up to her mistakes.

What do you think I should do? I’m so torn. It seems like a waste to just throw it all away.",09Jan2020,1

Tl;Dr: Assignment was lost even though I **know** I turned it in. Teacher can't find it and it drops my grade from an A to a B.

In my English class in October, we were given a monthly packet and would work on it 10 min./day. One day, we were asked to turn it in (everyone should have been finished by then). The tables are arranged so there would be a group of four per table and each person would be assigned a ""job"". It was my job to collect them. I scanned through my packet as my group members began stapling their packets (keep in mind: *the stapler was passed from table to table*). I noticed I had missed a question, so I started answering it. Halfway through, I saw that most groups had already turned in the packet, so I got up, collected my group mates' packet, and turned it in for them. By the time I sat back down and finished the missed question, ""everybody"" had turned it in. I don't recall if I was last to turn it in or not, but regardless, I (100%) remember going up to staple my packet (*the stapler was moved to the front since everyone was done stapling, which is why it caught my attention*) and turning it in to a metal container. I will add that I don't remember if I put my name on my packet, but I'm 85% sure my name is on there.

Fast forward to January, grades are due. My teacher marks it missing, so I go and talk to her. She was very kind and reasonable when I told her it was missing. She told me to come after school, and when I did, she allowed me to look around in her class to see if it was anywhere. I asked her if she had any unclaimed, unnamed packets, but she said she had none left. She talked about how she had folder when she moved the assignments around even though it wasn't in there. I continued looking and found nothing. She tells me she'll ask her classes tomorrow in case it got stuck to someone else's packet.

The next day, she notifies me that no one had it. I come back during lunch and look again. She said she looked around already and couldn't find it. I check my belongings for the third time and still found nothing (since I turned it in haha).

I'm honestly not sure what happened, but it's stressing me out. My grade dropped from an A to B because of an assignment that was not in my possession since I turned it in. My teacher says she can't do anything about it, but I can't wrap my head around doing something for a whole month only to not get credit for it. I plan on talking to my counselor, but I don't think anything will happen. I still have hope it's somewhere and will spend as much time as I can before summer to find it (I'm determined and won't back down).

In the meantime, what should I do? If it doesn't turn up, does that mean I should accept a 0 for something I did do and did turn in?

318,"TL;DR—my mom doesn’t realize how horrible she can be to me, my siblings, or my dad. it’s been a growing problem for about 7 years now and i don’t know how to help her understand that “nice” actions don’t just automatically cancel out the damage she causes. i’m worried she’ll never listen to me, no matter what i do...

First off, not sure if there’s a more specific sub that this would be better suited for, but i thought this was an okay place to start... I know this is a long one but after holding it all in for years, i have too much to say now.

I (20F) really don’t know where to begin with my mom. There’s just so many things I’m still angry about, as much as I’ve tried to let them go over the years. I would say conflicts started when I was around 13 and have just gradually escalated from there. I don’t know how to encompass all of her actions, so I’ll just give examples to hopefully give a better idea.

-when i was in high school, my mom would force my dad to use apps like find friends or the iphone finder to track my location whenever i left the house. i also had to facetime my parents to confirm there was an adult at wherever i had gone to. this made me feel super constricted socially and was so embarrassing to do all the time around my friends with more understanding parents.

-she’s gone through my phone, room, and belongings more times than i can count—never bothered to ask for permission. i understand i was still a minor, but this crossed a line of privacy for me that i still haven’t been able to forgive her for. once she found a single nug of weed and a vape in my room. she grounded me for the whole last six months of my senior year—it felt like social quarantine and was definitely a huge overreaction imo.

-for as long as i can remember my mom reassured me that i wouldn’t have to pay for college on my own or take out any loans in my name. as college got closer then arrived, she uses her ability to revoke this financial help as leverage against me whenever i do something she doesn’t like. which is a lot of things. i guess it helps keeps me in check, but only out of intense fear that she’ll leave me high and dry.

-my mom decided to start and open a rather ambitious business at the same time i was starting college, my sister had a stint in a mental hospital, and my dad ran into some health issues. this was against all our wishes, but she did it anyways, expecting us to simply follow her orders. she put my name as the owner of the business without letting me get a word in. she handles most of the actual business, but i was 18 years old and now my signatures are on contracts i can’t even begin to understand. it’s been over a year with four different locations, and we’ve yet to turn anything resembling a profit. she makes me work in the stores with no breaks, no say in my scheduling, and she doesn’t even pay me. i have another, actually paying job and she gets pissed at me when i tell her i need to work that job and not hers. i need the money since she won’t pay me. she says this is how i’m supposed to “pay her back”. i had severe mono a month ago and she still made me work full, unpaid shifts even though i had no business even getting out of bed, much less interacting with customers and touching products. i’d say this store has caused the most trouble in our family life, much more than i could ever describe here.

-those loans i was never supposed to have to take out? she made me apply for $26k in federal aid then used all of it to keep her business afloat instead of recognizing defeat. after years of telling me we can’t have a dog, she also bought two completely untrained puppies from a breeder. that came to about $4000. i can’t explain these financial decisions at all.

-she hits our dog. Koda, who is 9 months old, has a biting and barking problem and is not easily consolable all the time because he gets really anxious. whenever he gets too riled up, she’ll literally hit or kick him and even tells all of us to do the same. it doesn’t even make him stop, he just bites back. obviously i don’t do this because he’s a fucking puppy and it’s not his fault he can’t understand english or violence. i try to ask her to please not do that and she yells at me because “you don’t know what you’re talking about, you don’t live with him every day”. i should also mention that she refuses to get either of our dogs fixed and won’t give even ONE good reason. we have a boy and a girl and i’m worried she’s gonna try breeding them (which will likely happen whether she actually tries or not cause they’re often home unsupervised together).

-my dad went to rehab for alcoholism last year (he’s been sober since) and after he got out, my mom insisted he begin working again both for her store and his IT job before his outpatient care was complete. this threw him into 80-90 hour work weeks fresh out of an extremely difficult experience. she also was not an active participant in family therapy sessions, choosing instead to blame her husband entirely even though she was definitely his chief enabler. this was all against his doctors’ and counselors’ orders. my dad, unfortunately, has a hard time standing up to my mom because she’s so good at making him feel guilty or stupid when he tries.

-my little sister (14f) has severe bipolar disorder and enough anxiety for three adults. when i was 17, i came home to my sister having a full-blown panic attack, hyperventilating and sobbing uncontrollably while my mom SCREAMED at her for not doing her homework—as she was literally trying to do the homework. she often responds to my sister’s illness with anger and resentment, then gets mad at me when i suggest a gentler approach for the poor girl. i feel this has only worsened my sister’s condition and widened the divide between her and our mom. this is the exact opposite of what a confused and afraid kid needs from their parent.

these are just a few situations i could think of off the top of my head, but there’s so many more i’m still upset over. probably even more that i’ve forgotten about. i thought moving out would help, but i guess to the other end of town wasn’t far enough. she’s still a total helicopter parent. the worst part of all this is that she seems to genuinely, truly believe that she is 100% right about everything and we’re the ones causing her trouble, not the other way around. i’ve tried so many times to just help her understand ANY different perspective, but it’s like talking to a brick wall that’s intent on crushing you immediately after you finish speaking. she hears my explanations and defenses of others’ words/actions (my family, friends, customers, etc.) as teenage backtalk instead of a logical adult trying to get through to her.

what can i do to stop my mom from driving our family even farther apart and deeper into debt? how can i have a rational conversation with her without letting my emotions get the better of me, resulting in tears or shouting? i hate it, but i’m super sensitive to my moms criticism and negative words, so it can be insanely difficult to calmly talk to her when negativity is all she’s giving me. i just don’t know what to do anymore and i’m worried we’ll never be able to be on the same page.

any advice helps... i really need to find a way to fix this before it gets any worse.",09Jan2020,1

She was there when I was at my loneliest point, and she gave me a reason to stay here, if you understand what I'm saying. Unfortunately, I was too young at the time to truly understand what depression was. Back then I always saw it as people being sad. I was 11 at the time, and I would do anything to go back and stop her. Ever since she left, I've had severe anxiety when it comes to getting close to people. I'm constantly afraid that I won't do enough for people when they need it, and it pushes me away from others. Since then, I've had two people I can truly call friends. But I constantly worry that everything I'm doing is wrong or a mistake, and that if I'm not constantly trying to keep these people in my life I'll relive what happened. And since we graduated in April of last year, I don't hear from them unless I send something first. It's gotten to a point where I know it's best to let them go and live their own lives without me pestering them, but I'm so scared that something will happen and I'll lose them like I did her.

For awhile i have had thoughts about wanting to leave the relationship, he is great but sometimes i feel like i am missing something. Im tired of getting upset about the same things (sometimes its something dumb i can overlook and sometimes it isnt). He doesnt flirt with me because he doesnt know how and he is bad at it, he is cute but sometimes i just dont want to be near him, sometimes he just annoys me to no end, overall i just feel like im missing out. I love him and i would never want to hurt him but i feel like he isnt what i need, idk how to explain it. I could easily spend the rest of my life with him... but would i be happy? Truly happy? And even if i decide to move on or if i try to take a break it wont work. He lives with me at my parents house because of his family issues so now we share everything. (Examples: we share a car, gaming pc ((i do some photoshop work on it)), tv, ps4, and MANY other things). We even have a cat together that we both love with all our hearts. We are only 21 and to me thats very young, too young to have met someone to stay with forever while im still discovering who i am, you know? I cant just leave him, and if i do what if he is the best thing to ever happen to me?? Sometimes i wish he would just break up with me to like rip the bandaid off but he loves me so much.

323,"Hi, so to give background Im 19 years old in first year of collage. The commute to school is 36 miles front and back (72 miles total). I've been wanting a job for awhile while also having the freedom to do events, after school activity and want to use better use of my time (classes starts at 10:30am to 5pm for MW and 11am to 3pm T Th.)

I rely heavy on my parents for transport and I am limited by when ever they drive. I cant get a job as i rely on my parents to drive me everywhere. I love biking and i was thinking to bike to nearby shops, retailers from but If i get a job near my home, I cant go to school as I commute with my parents to go school (Dad leaves at 6am and picks me up at 4pm) So if i get a job it will conflict schedule of my parents and school. I also cant stay past 4pm so because of this so any clubs or activity is not possible. By the time im home its already 7:30pm due to traffic and bikeing 8+ more after the long day can put stress on the already stressful school work

My problem is that I really want a job and i really believe a car would help me succeed having a balance school and work life without interfering with my parents schedule. Whats preventing them is that they believe its a spoiled act and I do not need a car as they grew up without one. Im not sure if im being unfair to them as im asking for the cheapest car to commute the long distance and im 100% willing to pay back for the car with a job. for my perspective im asking for a loan for the car as im really thinking it would be a good investment for my future as it allows me to be more independent . **What your guys view point/advice on my situation?**

Additional facts:

\- willing to pay up too a 1000 dollar down payment and work Friday-Saturday but parents are also against work as they believe that there is no need too work which im very much confused

\- I dont know if this is important but i come from a upper class family coming from a poor background and i major in health science)

324,"For some background information, I'm a college freshman, and due to the overcrowding at my university, my roommate is a sophomore. Together we share a single room along with a suite-style bathroom with two other girls. Though we get along fine, we hardly speak at all asides from saying hello and goodbye. Since it's her second year, she already had an established group of friends, preventing the usual freshman roommate codependency. She also works a lot, so during the day she's gone from the apartment while I'm there, and I'm gone at night when she is there. Though I had suspicions of my roommate smoking weed, she was very discrete asides from a subtle lingering smell covered by perfume. Again, I didn't know for sure and I'm not a snitch, especially without concrete evidence.  


A few days after I left home for winter break, I received a call from my RD telling me that a drug search was approved for our room, and during the search, they found ""marijuana paraphernalia"" that violated the school's policies and she wanted to know whether I would fess up before I was formally charged. Of course, as someone who doesn't drink or smoke, I let them know that I had prescribed medication on my desk, but asides from that, nothing else. I asked where in the room it was found, and conveniently, it was on my roommate's side of the room. Despite this, my RD said that since it was still in our shared space, I would be held responsible. Usually violations like this are dealt directly by the RD and campus security, but my RD said that she would allow me to plead my case directly with the head of Student Affairs. After informing my parents about the situation, they made me take a drug test, which, (surprise surprise) came back clean.  


Upon my arrival, I received a very intimidating letter from the head of Student Affairs stating that I was possibly being charged with possession of illegal drugs AND alcohol (something my RD did NOT tell me about) and unless I set up a meeting with her within two business days of receiving the letter, they would assume I am guilty and discipline me as such. The letter went on to say that though I have the opportunity to plead my case, the decision will ultimately be made by the student affairs officers without my presence, and that if I am considered guilty, I will be suspended as well as possibly losing all my financial aid, merit aid, and tuition. I am almost on a full ride to this school... if I lose my aid I will 100% be forced to drop out as my family is not supporting me. I emailed the head of Student Affairs to make an appointment as soon as I received the letter, and her response was extremely curt and a tinge accusatory- as if she's already made her mind up on the case. Of course, I could just be overthinking as I have extreme anxiety over this whole situation. On top of this, they put a discipline hold on my account to prevent me from registering for classes until they decide my fate, which can take weeks. By then, registration will be over and any classes I need to change will be full and/or finalized.  


My appointment is tomorrow at 2 pm, and I honestly have no idea what to say. My future is literally resting on this and I haven't even done anything. I'm considering telling them that even if I wanted to, I couldn't drink or smoke due to my genetic disorder, which is true, but I don't know if that will be sufficient. I have nothing on my record and am one of the few students in their honors college. Do I tell them I had my suspicions, or do I play completely dumb? Can I get in trouble for having a feeling and not reporting it? I'm so clueless. Please help. All advice is greatly appreciated!!",09Jan2020,1

330,"So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 7 months now and she’s great I really like her and I can see myself being with her. But during winter break she left to go see her family in Texas and I was partying with a friend that came back from the army basic training and I didn’t give her much attention (besides calling her on Christmas and New Years and texting her to make sure she was alright) and she was having family problems and we talked about it when she came back home after break and I thought everything was okay until today we were together, she always wears a hoodie or a sweat shirt, so she tried to hug me and I’m a pretty tall guy so she has to reach to fully hug me so when she went to hug me I seen the cuts and we talked about it and she’s very deflective towards the issue and she said it’s nothing but I know it’s something and I can’t stand the thought of losing her and most of my friends aren’t really the type to give advice on these issues so i looked to this sub to see if yall had any advice on how I can deal with this problem because I’ve already lost one friend to suicide and I don’t think I can deal with losing her",09Jan2020,1
331,"Sorry im on mobile.
Anyway i am an incredibly introverted person. I find solace alone in my room. I could go days without talking if i wanted. I understand i need to talk to people and i do. Yet i always find most comfort alone. Its difficult to hold a conversation and, not to be rude, i lack the emotional response to show im interested. It not that i dont care, its that showing you i care is way to much work. Smiling all the time and laughing is hard to keep up. Its not that i dont feel things i just get tired of it. I laugh and cry and smile like people... just maybe less?

My younger sister on the other hand is very extroverted. She talks and talks and talks and still finds ways to make the conversation longer. She is out of school right now and she is bored at home. She constantly wants to spend time with me asking if id like to go to the store just to walk or if i want to go with her to the kitchen just to talk. She spends lots of time with me in my room. Sometimes she isnt even talking to me but she is on her phone. She likes to leave the house with me and walk our dogs together. Things i like to do alone. 

The issue im having is that i dont know how to recharge. She isnt being rude or mean. I know she just wants company and im the only one around to give that. But she is starting to see my lack of emotional response and is wondering if im upset with her. Im not, just as i said before i tend to give a more apathetic vibe. She knows i like being alone but her need to be with someone is stronger than mine to be alone? Ive tried to be both subtle and blunt about how i need some time for myself, But she doesnt seem to get the point. What can i do to recharge? She even wakes me up in the morning and stays till i sleep. Im currently writing this while watching a movie and her on my bed.",09Jan2020,1
332,"**Tl;dr** there was a situation where everyone treated everyone awful and no one, including me, was good, and some of my friends made excuses for a bully. It cost me some friendships, but I still miss some and sent an email explaining my feelings and appreciation to one in particular. Now I'm too chicken to read the response and it might be for the best since I'm easily tilted and also tend to let things eat me alive that shouldn't, and ain't no one got time for that.

&amp;#x200B;

The gist:

Some of my friends were also friends with people who blatantly admitted to holding a grudge against me and treating me unfairly, but let it slide since it wasn't *them* getting bullied. However, these friends were also incredibly supportive of me and helped me out of some very dark spots growing up. I'm not typically the person to be like ""you can't be friends with me if you're friends with them"" but the bullies were legitimately malicious to me and these people would just keep making excuses. It doesn't help that I was the one to try and reach out to the bully before to try and fix the situation while they just kept doing what they did.

We left on ambiguous terms since I finally snapped and publicly aired out all the dumb drama once I realized my friend group was part of the problem they said they weren't, and it was the only way to fix things after already trying gentle private talks. After a few months, I sent an email thanking one for everything they've done for me  even if things got as drastic as they did and that I know no one was the ""good"" party in that situation by the time it festered so badly. I did say it would maybe be nice to be friends again but that ultimately it is what it is, since I was the one to air things given to me in confidence (but also censored who said what) and it's easy to understand why that's something irrevocable. 

I felt like I was enabling the problem by sitting to the side and letting the drama repeat itself, point for point, for a seventh time in as many years, instead of using the info I had to really and properly do something. And it did help - after airing it, the change many people I know were hoping for finally happened after X years.

I wanted to enter the New Year, pettily and selfishly, to try and at least let the friend know that after all of it, I really did appreciate most of what they've done for me. Just not enough to compromise my values when it comes to bullying, and letting a problem lie if it is explicitly in your responsibilities to fix and then complain about it anyway. (I know that it's tough since the situation was pretty fruitless, but it was still better than giving up and still sticking around. At least when I realized the issue was too bad for me, I quit. It's just very... watching someone you care about make bad decisions and you wanted to at least try to step in and do something because you care, even though you realize they're their own person.) 

I also realize that because I'm young and pretty firm on these values I have a fire in me that's not necessarily for the best, nor the most practical. But since this wasn't at a job it feels reasonable to draw the line  there.

On the flip flip side, no person is black and white, and I don't want to be too eager to burn bridges or be ungrateful because that's not good either. I still think my friend is a good person but it also feels like they consistently prioritized my bully, knowing they bullied me, and supported a person with those values. On the flip (flop) side I did something awful and I can't imagine a positive response. 

It feels like I'm putting myself down just for the sake of companionship. I hope I'm wrong and I'm being unreasonable, because I do want to grow, but I'm unsure which direction will let me. School just started back up again and I already messed up one social experience on campus because of how overwhelmed I got seeing I got the email response at all. I do have more friends now but. Yeah. I can't just throw away half my life and pretend the person was garbage when they weren't.

But I'm also the sort of person who would prefers Schrodinger's cat. I would never want to confess to someone because even though there's a chance they may like me back, there's also a chance they won't and I can skim some satisfaction from keeping it to a fantasy of ""what if they did like me?"" On the flip side, I know that's no way to live and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I'm trying to move past it. But that doesn't mean I want to take on everything blindly.

I know I should read the response but I honestly legitimately doubt if it'd do me any good or if I should let sleeping(?) dogs lie and allow some cowardice on my part. Ripping the band-aid has been a bit of a bad solution for me in the past and people like to say I'm awful at subtlety, so I may be too headstrong.",09Jan2020,1
333,"So my mom (44F) found my box of Valtrex, which is used to treat HSV (herpes). She asked me (20F) what it was so I grabbed it from her and told her to not worry about it.

The medicine is empty now and it doesn't look like birth control but I still need a reason why as to why I have it.

337,"Okay, here it goes: Years ago, I embellished about living abroad (let's say, in Spain). It was always a discussed idea- for me and my partner to move to Spain. We spent a few weeks there, came home, and decided to move there. Then, we suffered a horrible trauma and things changed. Not only did we not move, we didn't last out the year. So sometime not long after that, I told someone I lived in Spain for a short while, even though I never actually did. Nearly ten years have passed, and I've always stuck to the story. I swear, it comes out without me thinking about it, like it's true. And it's been like that since the very first time. I assume it has something to do with what happened to me. But now I have a problem: I've lived with a wonderful person for three years, and I want to spend the rest of my life with them, but they think I lived, although briefly, in Spain. It's the only lie I've ever told them in our entire relationship. 

Should I tell them the truth? On one hand, honesty is important for making any life-long relationship succeed, but on the other hand, I predict our relationship would suffer if I spilled (they're a ""trust 'em til they give you a reason not to"" kind of person), and I really do believe this person is the one for my life and we are extremely happy. I've finally healed from my trauma, and I make a conscious effort to never mention Spain at all, and now if it's mentioned, I never say I lived there. But occasionally, my partner will mention it in conversation. The only way he would ever find out the whole truth would be from my mom or siblings, and they all live 2,500 miles away from us. Should I tell them the truth and risk destroying the best thing to happen in my life (they helped me get sober, quit cigarettes, find peace from my trauma, make me feel so loved all the time), or just continue to avoid it? I've been taught that the truth is most important, but in my situation, I don't think it is. If I'm gambling with my entire future of happiness, the odds are that my partner would never find out. What does everyone think? Spill or don't?",09Jan2020,1
338,"Now the question of the title doesn't do justice, so here's a little backstory, I've met my ex on the 2016's Christmas eve, and since then we started talking via phone and we started a relationship in september of 2017, it was sort of a long distance one because I could only see her once or twice a month, since then, we created a strong bond together, with what I assumed that we had a lot of love for one another, so much that we started to plan out our future, imagining how the marriage would go and so on. I never had that thought before for anyone, but she was so special to me that I started thinking about it, plus a family of my own.

So I thought that we were doing really well together, I got a few jobs along the way, and she is studying to become a dentist, and I always gave her support when she needed it, after all it's not easy, and she had to move out to another town to study, but we talked everyday via phone and even did voice chats to feel closer on our conversations, even though sometimes we were in a tight budget we tried our best to enjoy our days together when we could, and there were also times that we had to spend a few months without seeing each other because of her tests, but we still talked everyday regardless, on our first anniversary together, I even bought us commitment rings with our names written, as a sign of our love and how serious this relationship was going.

But then, the tables have turned, and on the first day of this year, she said she wanted to end it, with the excuse of ""I think we have different paths planned for the future"", I think she wasn't completely sincere with me, but that's not all, she didn't say that it was her or my fault, but out of sudden, she felt like it wasn't meant to keep going, and the worst part is, she invited me to spend the new years eve with her and her family, and I assumed we were doing great because she never told me anything about it before, and I thought that we would start another year together and plan new things ahead, after all, we always had a relationship based on conversations, where we looked out for one another to improve on what's needed, without useless discusssions or fights, but on that subject, she never said a word, so when she told me that out of sudden, it felt like I was stabbed in the heart, and everything I was planning for went upside down.

So, today is january 9th, the first days were incredibly rough for me, not being able to eat, sleep or even stop crying about it, now I'm calmer than before, but it's still tough, I'm not sure if you guys have been in a situation like this, but if you do, I would really need some advice on that end, thank you.",09Jan2020,1

345,"I was playing football with friends back in October when I was tackled to the ground. When this happened, my ankled rolled in the complete opposite direction and my knee went sideways and inwards. I felt the biggest shock of pain ever and instantly thought I broke my leg. After laying on the ground for 5ish min I finally opened my eyes and attempted to move it. Nothing really happened so I scooted off to the side and got my friends to carry me to my car and take me to their house. Later that night (after icing and elevating), I was able to my my leg from being bent to being straight, but still no ankle movement. The next morning I hopped my way to my car and somehow drove home. I noticed that it was swelling immensely and turning black and blue and purple. This swelling lasted like 2 maybe 3 weeks before going back down to a reasonable size (bruising color remained). 

Fast forward to now, about 9ish weeks since the injury, I can run and walk pretty normally. But I can not point my toes downward all the way and when I sit on my leg, I get a sharp pain behind my knee still.

Do y’all think I tore or broke something? I wanted to go to the doctor but my dad kept telling me that I probably just sprained it and it would take a few weeks to heal.. Well it’s been over 2 months now and I’m still in pain when preforming certain movements.

Overall, it sounds like a pretty peaceful seeming life. WELL! It would be great if I perhaps could cope with my hatred for my own face.

Alright, alright, hear me out! I’ve never been bullied for my looks. Heck, people even compliment me about my looks when I don’t say anything. But I can’t bring myself to believe that I’m beautiful, no matter what others tell me. If someone calls me beautiful, I’ll just automatically assume they say that to everyone. The thing I hate most is when I say I’m ugly to express the fact that I *GENUINELY* loathe my outer appearance and my friends immediately come to my defense and shower me with compliments. Don’t get the wrong idea, I absolutely love my friends, understand that they just want me to be happy and love myself, and would totally do the same thing if the roles were reversed. But I just find their reassurance useless, because there’s nothing anyone besides *myself* could do to make me appreciate what I look like. Basically, I hate my face and there’s nothing anyone—except me—could do about it. I hate the way my eyes are uneven, the way my lips perk out, my wide and low-bridged noise, my freckles, uneven skin tone, acne, you get the idea. Nothing about my face is beautiful. Absolutely nothing. 

Well, great, as a kid who isn’t old enough to legally get plastic surgery yet, what the hell am I supposed to do? Plastic surgery is the ultimate last resort if I don’t ever learn to love myself, and I highly doubt that my parents would be happy with that. I don’t want to sit here and hate myself anymore. I want change. I want to realize that I don’t have to wait until I’m old enough to go under the knife to love myself. I understand that these feelings of self-hatred are probably caused by puberty kicking in, but I want to come to terms with my appearance sooner. I mean, I’m in the prime of my years. I don’t want to spend it hating myself. So, this begs the question—How do I love myself? How do I learn to accept the way I look? To be confident, but not prideful? Please help.

349,"I have been having some trouble with my friends and I don’t know if im overthinking things or if they’re bad friends. 

I have been friends with A,and B for over three years and with C two.

Last year I had a bit of a fight with C,nothing big, it’s just they were teasing me in ways I didn’t like and I decided to distance myself from them for a bit. After a few months they apologized and we were fine but we still bumped heads here and there. I don’t hate them or anything but we just don’t click.

The thing is over the course of the year I had become very close with A (which B didn’t really like) and even got a bit of a crush on them. 

At the end of the year I had told A a very big secret and they promised to keep it. The next day I found out they had told B and another friend, who probably told a lot of other people (they were in a party).

A and B have always been very gossipy, so I almost never told them anything, but I thought A was really trustworthy at the moment since we were really getting along.

I of course got mad and the group ignored me for over a week. No matter later how many times I tried being part of the group it still didn’t work. They would glare at me when I said something or would be talking about something and when I came closer they would stop and would change the subject all of a sudden.

I finally told A (they were the only ones who would not ignore me and would stay beside me -they did apologize for telling the secret but that was way later, at the time they acted as if they did nothing wrong) that I was tired of the whole fight and told them how I felt. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety ever since I was very young, and told them that I honestly didn’t know what to do with my life anymore.

A was very understanding and promised to help me and they decided to hold a group meeting to solve the problem. Basically in the group meeting they just talked about what they didn’t like about me. How they didn’t like my resting bitch face, or how sometimes I read too much or how I just sometimes didn’t talk to anyone and stuff like that. I did accept some of the criticism but some of the things they were saying they didn’t like about me were things they also did.

At the end we managed to “solve” everything, since I promised I would change, and they promised they would help me with the things I was dealing with.

Things were going very good for a while, we had so much fun, and mentally I was doing pretty well. 

But the thing is sometimes they would say some things...with double meaning. Or I would say something and they would roll their eyes. 

At the end of the year we all said goodbye and I thought we were fine. 
But one day they sent a snap  or they have Instagram posts of them three together. 

I thought it was nothing, but there have been things like birthday parties, or new house party or just normal gatherings they have where they didn’t invite me. I told A how I felt and they said that B chose not to invite me because they thought I might bump heads with C (I had been getting a bit closer and we were fine).

But the worst thing is that B doesn’t really like C. Whenever they’re with C they act all nice but when they’re gone they just whine about how annoying and cringy they are. And I always feel scared they do the same thing to me. 

The thing is I told A how I felt. And they said ‘why don’t you invite B and C somewhere to have fun and show that you have a truce’ or something like that so I did.

I told them that whenever I saw them together I would feel very sad and depressed. I know I shouldn’t be feeling this way but I just do, and I try my best to not let it get to my head but it always does. 

At the end B and C had planned a day where we would all meet to watch a movie.

One day though, I got two snaps from A and it was of B and C in their house having fun. And I felt...betrayed. (We don’t have streaks) so I can’t help but feel they sent it on purpose. I felt sad because I get why B wouldn’t invite me to their stuff (kinda) since they maybe thought I was not gonna get along with C.

But A knew that I was fine with C and that it hurt me when i felt left out and they still sent it to me. And they knew how I felt. And I just can’t help but feel betrayed.


I know A and B can be very...hypocritical. But they’re the only people I got at school. I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should leave them, because then I have no one.

I mean I keep trying to tell myself that they’re not bad people and that I’m just exaggerating but I honestly don’t know what to do anymore and I just keep feeling depressed. What do I do??

The main career interest for me is somewhere within forensic pathology, or at least something within the forensics field. In high school, I never took any AP's and I did pretty below average (3.2 GPA/1120 SAT/23 ACT).

Considering this, first of all, I don't know what major I should pursue based off of career interest. Secondly, I don't know if I'm prepared or smart enough to pursue this degree. Say what?! I hope I'm being understandable. I grew up in a challenging environment. Went to a private all-Asian school with people who excelled in both academics and athletics simultaneously. I don't know how to change that mindset, but with some help, I hope that I can find out my pathway.

Additionally, I was looking at Psychology. However, I keep asking myself if I'm prepared to put in the extra work, effort, and time into something that I may or may not love. If you are majoring/have majored in Psychology, please let me know your opinion!

353,"Hi! so this is my first post in this group english is not my best language so forgive me if I make some grammar errors.

So I'm a normal highschool student and I think I have a good reputation in my class but I belong in 1 group I'll call them the ""cool group"" because they dont care about the rules and basically bunch of funny people they are like 15 people. I belong in that group before but I sit very far from them because I matured already and I understand that studying is what  I should prioritize more so I belong in this another group of friends let's call them ""Close friends"" and They are normal they are funny and actually cares about studying but they dont have that much impact in classroom and what I mean by impact is they are not that noticed by other people or consider ""cool"" but they are pretty normal in class sometimes get noticed but mostly ignored. ok here is the problem I was in that cool group but I noticed that I am not myself when I'm with them. I can't even think a joke and I just stay quiet while they are talking about some funny stuff I actually make some jokes too but I feel like if i make one its just gonna be awkward so I avoid doing those. But being with them gives me high reputation or what I call respect in class because as I said they are the cool ones. So about my ""Close Friends"" I can go full retarded on them and actually have fun. I can talk the way I always talk and I can make jokes without getting worried about the awkward stuff so I kept my distance with the ""Cool Group"" and sit with my close friends and this is where I have fun all the time but one day they removed me to the group chat. my ""Cool friends"" Removed me and doesnt even talk to me anymore I can understand that I kept my distance because I had more fun talking to my close friends but I still talk to them in classroom I even do some favors for them and they do some favors for me too but I dont understand why would they just remove me from the group because of that. I feel sad and depressed knowing that my other bunch of group friends doesnt include me anymore after all the fun times we had. What should I do should I just ignore them back? or just get close with them again. Ive been sad for the last couple of weeks and I  dont know what to do.

355,"About 4 months ago, the first really serious relationship of my [18M] life came to an end. She treated me poorly and I know I have no feelings for this girl anymore, but I can’t stop getting angry at any reminder or thought of her.

357,"Any answer is greatly appreciated!

Tl;Dr: Assignment was lost even though I **know** I turned it in. Teacher can't find it and it drops my grade from an A to a B.

In my English class in October, we were given a monthly packet and would work on it 10 min./day. One day, we were asked to turn it in (everyone should have been finished by then). The tables are arranged so there would be a group of four per table and each person would be assigned a ""job"". It was my job to collect them. I scanned through my packet as my group members began stapling their packets (keep in mind: *the stapler was passed from table to table*). I noticed I had missed a question, so I started answering it. Halfway through, I saw that most groups had already turned in the packet, so I got up, collected my group mates' packet, and turned it in for them. By the time I sat back down and finished the missed question, ""everybody"" had turned it in. I don't recall if I was last to turn it in or not, but regardless, I (100%) remember going up to staple my packet (*the stapler was moved to the front since everyone was done stapling, which is why it caught my attention*) and turning it in to a metal container. I will add that I don't remember if I put my name on my packet, but I'm 85% sure my name is on there.

Fast forward to January, grades are due. My teacher marks it missing, so I go and talk to her. She was very kind and reasonable when I told her it was missing. She told me to come after school, and when I did, she allowed me to look around in her class to see if it was anywhere. I asked her if she had any unclaimed, unnamed packets, but she said she had none left. She talked about how she had folder when she moved the assignments around even though it wasn't in there. I continued looking and found nothing. She tells me she'll ask her classes tomorrow in case it got stuck to someone else's packet.

The next day, she notifies me that no one had it. I come back during lunch and look again. She said she looked around already and couldn't find it. I check my belongings for the third time and still found nothing (since I turned it in haha).

I'm honestly not sure what happened, but it's stressing me out. My grade dropped from an A to B because of an assignment that was not in my possession since I turned it in. My teacher says she can't do anything about it, but I can't wrap my head around doing something for a whole month only to not get credit for it. I plan on talking to my counselor, but I don't think anything will happen. I still have hope it's somewhere and will spend as much time as I can before summer to find it (I'm determined and won't back down).

In the meantime, what should I do? If it doesn't turn up, does that mean I should accept a 0 for something I did do and did turn in?

I had liked her for a while before this and she had low key ghosted me in the past when I asked her out but out of nowhere she asked to hang out and I got really excited. She lead me on super hard and then called it off abruptly. Texted me that we should just be friends. It hurt like hell, I never responded at all and I haven’t seen her in person since. I muted all her stuff on social media too hoping it help me move on faster. Welp, on Sunday one of my best friends posted a bunch of stories and pictures that had this particular girl in them and it sent me down a pretty dark spiral that I’m just now starting to come out of. I almost sent this girl a loooong ass text even. While I’m glad that I didn’t, i can’t help but feel compelled to tell her that she really hurt me. Is that fucked up? I feel like it would help me get some closure? But also I could see it prolonging this too, I dunno. Also I’ve been asking before I meet up with friends at a bar or wherever if she’s gonna be there. I feel really immature doing that, but I’m worried that being around her would just stir up all these feelings of rejection and sadness and self doubt that happened over the last 3 days. There’s a large part of me that feels like I should be step up and be affable if I see her. I would never be rude or antagonistic but my reflexive behavior would be to not to engage with her at all. Which might be a defensive mechanism but might make it worse if I saw her and it was just super awkward. I dunno man. I know time heals but this shit is getting old. The last 3 days really freaked me out. I’m better today tho which is good. To give it context I’m goin on 30 and my first and last actual relationship was 9 months long and ended 3.5 years ago.

364,"So im 16M and overweight.
Bit of backstory to my life.
When my parents were together (i was around 8yrs old) they consistently would fight. My dad was the one that always yelled and caused a scene. Anyways i should note my parents arent rich in the slightest way, trying to scrape together every cent we can. I got to spend an even amount of time with my mum and my dad when they split. But I always had a loneliness thought. 
Anyways, enough backstory.
Idek where to start... So the main reason of my concern started nye. Nye i dodged my first ever kiss, but I also found out at 2am that im the dumbest person ever. I always thought that no one would ever love me etc. Anyways i was talking to the girl i liked in 2018, and we liked each other and saying ily ilysm etc to each other but I always shrugged it off as a friend. And ny she told me that she was waiting for me to ask her out, and after 2 years i finally realised i fucked up. But ever since I believe i just got worst from there, self doubting every decision i have made and wondering how i could be so dumb. So in the last two or three weeks, nearly every night or whenever im not doing anything i always think, whats the purpose of life, what happens when we die, why im so dumb, and everything else. I thought a couple nights ago to see the symptoms of depression, and low and behold... I tick at least 3/4 of the symptoms. I also took a few surveys because im always curious and yep, they say i am anywhere from depressed to severe. And i dont feel depressed, nothing is weighing me down, but yet i feel lonely as well.

She doesn’t know I’m coming. We broke up a little over a month ago. We’re still on good terms. 

I have no idea what I’m going to say or if she’s even going to talk to me honestly. Any advice on ways not to fuck this up would be greatly appreciated. 

I’m not expecting anything, if she is even willing to talk about it I’d be happy with that. 

Backstory and reasoning:

I’m the type who has to consistently put in an effort to care about something, but for this whole month I’ve been putting in effort to move on and stop caring and I haven’t been able to a little bit. The feelings in my chest and head I got when she broke up with me is the same to this day. I’ve taken time to think about all the mistakes I’ve made and things I could do better, I saw a therapist for 3 weeks to figure out my flaws and try to become a better person. I’m not the type to do radical or drastic stuff like this so I’m feeling really out of place and confused but I still feel like I have to do this.

377,"I’m sorry this isn’t a super specific question, I just keep remembering these instances and feel so weird, not good and I just don’t really know what happened. I don’t know if it was some kind of assault or what.  We were both 18 and we dated for a year, broke up a bit over 6 months ago I think, I’m 19 now. I’m so sorry this is long.

He was emotionally abusive, as in very controlling and isolating, demeaning,  and manipulative. But some of the time he was nice, funny, caring, etc especially at the beginning. Which, I know sounds naïve but he was. (sorry this is kinda NSFW lol) 75% of sex was fine, nice sometimes, like average. But a lot of the time he would make me feel terrible for not being able to finish, and not really caring about it. like he would put so much pressure on me about it and I hated it. That’s not really related though but I wanted to give you an idea of our sex life. There’s a lot more I could say about our relationship but basically it was rough lol. I’m a lot better now, except for these things that bother me.

One time, we were drunk at a friends house. He and I went to our friend’s guest bedroom to do the do. Sorry to be descriptive, but he was behind me and asked to put it in the back door. I said nahhh I don’t want to be drunk for the first time for that. He joked about anal a lot so I knew it was something he wanted to do but idk I didn’t really then. He kept asking and telling me it was fine and eventually I agreed. He didn’t use lube just spit and it hurt. Idk why but I just let it slide, I pretended it was some exciting funny news when I told my friends. But looking back now I feel terrible about that. I feel weird telling my friends now bc I acted the opposite when it happened.

The other instance that bugs me is once I was on top, like, reverse cowgirl. He made me bend over farther and then I recognized the flash of his phone. I was like what the hell dude and he showed me it was just the flashlight to see bc it was very dark. I said ok and we continued but it turned off and then back on for a while. Then it turned off again and I heard the sounds of us having sex. I realized he took a snapchat video of my uh, behind. I said what the fuck, delete that right now. I didn’t have my glasses on so I saw it disappear but I still don’t know if he saved it or not. He apologized and said it was a joke and that he never intended on saving it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I said okay, thank you and continued even though I felt wrong and gross. I laughed it off and didn’t say anything. 

Looking back I wish I had walked out then or at least said SOMETHING. I don’t know, it doesn’t feel right but I don’t know who to ask, I feel weird talking about it with my friends and family until I know how I feel about it, especially because I initially didn’t really say anything was wrong (like about these specific things,) and it was so long ago. I’m dating a new person who I am completely safe with, and is the polar opposite of my ex. I feel gross and scared when I think about those things happening though, it doesn’t even feel like it happened to me because I am one to stand up for myself usually.

Currently I go to a community college. My dad pays for it but he isn't the nicest of guys. I don't want to use the word abusive since there are kids out there being harmed right now, but the man ain't good. Helps and screams, gas lighting and threats whole nine yards. In an effort to get out I put in an application to the U of U. I tried this last year but made the mistake of telling my dad. He went wild, screaming and threataning to kick me out. 

After the dust settled it wasn't a father son relationship for the longest time. More like a very stiff roommate situation. I tried again this year and my application was denied with no reason given. Now im dead set on salt lake. I already have friends and a bit of a support network there. I love where it is geographically and it's close to all my family since mine is a bit split up. I have already been accepted to the community college in salt lake but I feel the U of U is the best fit for me and my goals. I plan to submit an appeal in response to the admissions decision. Part of that is getting two letters of recommendation. Several teachers, processors and coaches have already agreed to write one for me so that's covered. I have picked out three departments to sponsor me but the part I am really hung up on is new medical information. 

Throughout my life I have found it very hard to focus in class. I always day dream, doodle, play on my phone, etc. Anything but learning, and it really is tough for me. I'll try and unintentionally let my mind wander. As a result of this my grades were never good. That's most likely why I was rejected. Anyway I suspect i might have some kind of learning disorder but I have never been tested. The appeal is due 6 weeks after the date on the letter, mine is December 31st. My main concern is do I have the time to go to a doctor and get tested and diagnosed? Is submitting an appeal actually worth it?

Mind you I've been single some time and only started trying to date again recently. So early November I had started talking with this girl I use to work with but didnt know at the time we worked together. We were hitting it off,talking every day over facebook and snap. Sending each other cute picture and all that. Finally got the chance to meet up and go out,it didnt last long because her babysitter wasnt feeling well so we only had about 3+ hours to hang out and not long at the bar. So we drove around and smoked herb together and I had that moment when I knew I should go for the kiss and I took it..we ended up making out for the next 20 minutes or so then she had to get home. We continued to talk and try to plan our next meetup which was going to be during Christmas break because her son would be with his dad during that time. Well the day after my birthday was the day she was leaving and I didnt hear from her for the next 2-3 days. And trust me I didnt pester her or anything. We had already had a good understanding about like not always being on our phones and also when it came to replies we had long conversations back and forth so it did take some time to reply. Well I saw her post a picture of her and some guy on her snap story (assumes it was her brother but I'm now assuming it's her sons dad) she then gets back to me a few days later about she needs to take time for herself and to concentrate on herself and her son which I get,would never fault her for that. And dont think I havent been taking into account what kind of stress she could be dealing. But then new years rolls around and she's posting with the same guy. No inbetween all that i had tried to get her to meet up so we could talk about it,we had had conversations about staying friends if we didnt hit it off but since then she's said she would meet up and something comes up everytime...
Now I know I should just move on,I know we were only involved for almost 2 months but the shitty part is it fell apart right around when I was really starting to feel confident about the whole situation. I just wanted to meet with her to see if she'd tell me then truth about the situation. I do honestly want to stay friends. But I also want to know what was real between us and what wasnt. I mean theres no way that after all our talking and going out that night she just up and decided to be with her ex,like for how much of the time that we talked was she involved with him?

My best friend specifically has been coming over a lot in the past 6 months,  its been great. She's really polite to my parents and cleans up after herself when she's over at my house, the perfect guest. My parents dont even interact with her at all because we're always in my room. But for whatever reason,  my parents have been laying down new rules almost every day. She can't come over for a sleepover more than once a week. She can't come over after dark, she can't come over on weekdays. Its ridiculous, my parents have never been like this before and its driving me crazy. We both have jobs during the weekends and do sports 4 days a week as well as a full time school schedule. The only times we have to hang out are the in between times and during the week. My parents don't seem to care however and continue to lay down the rules. Even my friend agrees that all of the rules are too controlling.

Tl;dr
I’m a 17 year old guy who is catching some pretty hard feelins very irrationally for a girl I’m not even engaged with- I really wanna forget about her before I can’t i guess, I’m wondering if there’s a best way to do it


Just for context, I’m pretty average (in the middle with looks/personality)

there’s this girl who I only met this year but I can’t even describe the feelings I get thinking about her; it feels irrational because I literally do not hang out with her outside of class, but she’s the most attractive person I think I’ve ever met; and I don’t mean only physically (although that too) but even though she’s one of the ‘popular girls’ she genuinely is funny and has a personality. She’s also an actually nice person for no reason other than her just being good. We literally only have 2 periods together and only ever talk during class or in the hallway but literally anytime she laughs at something I say I remember that shit way more than i should. I feel realllly fukkkin weird. One time she saw me at the mall and yelled my name just to say hi and I thought about it for the next couple days, frequently. Sometimes when we do talk for a kind of extended period of time I think who knows, maybe she kind of likes me? But then I remember she’s just that nice and easy to talk to, she does it with everyone. Besides, literally every dude who actually gets with the truly fine girls would prolly get with her given the chance so she has plenty of options and Even if I thought I had a shot, I don’t display emotions that well so I don’t think I’d even be able to not be a fucking goon. (if I did ever go for it I wouldn’t be able to say how I really feel at all) basically, I really need to get her out of my head and stop thinking about her. I think I’m just gonna stop talking to her/ avoid her and wait it out.

Oh and btw, I don’t think about her all the time, mainly it’s at night or in class w her.",09Jan2020,1

399,"Yesterday, I arrived early to work and well the office was closed at that time, only 2 employees had a key for the door and I wasn't one of them. I work at a company that involves around 100 employees and I don't know the majority of them except my boss, the CEO and 3 other employees. At that time, I simply waited for 2 hours for someone to arrive but no one has came yet so I called my boss over 4 times but he haven't responded. Well, I just didn't know what to do at this point so I simply went home. Today, It happened again and my boss finally answered and told me hes outside for business and I can call my coworker, I did so and that coworker told me that he will come within an hour. I informed him that the office time starts 2 hours ago and it quite violate the company's terms so he went rude and told me that he can do whatever he wants and raised his voice a couple of times. Later today I was informed that my salary for that day will be deducted and will be counted as absence which will affect the rest of the days. This is not the first time this happened. I had alot of instances where my co-workers treated me in a manner than is not logical and quite rude, so I stood with my guts and talked with him politely that he was quite rude with me earlier today so he went frustrated and called me all things, he went as far as making up things as Im the rude one here and all. Of course, I'm not a dumb person as he thinks I am, every conversation I have with anyone at work I always secretly record because I have a short term memory since I forget stuff said which I can return to. I had a recording of  the behavior he was having with me and I intended to tell my boss about it but to my surprise he told the CEO and the CEO went ahead called me to the office and blamed me for being rude when I consistently told he was the one who was being that way. Of course I didn't tell about the evidence I have and the CEO took an image of me that way anyways. 

My question is, is this acceptable in the work field? This is my first job here and I have seen a lot of instance where people simply violated alot of material written in the rules and regulations of the company that when I bring them up they tend to be rude with me about. The CEO wants a solution so he wants us to open a new page that if anyone is rude to one another they have to inform the other party at that moment where they were rude at which I find it helpful but of course this will ditch all the instances that other coworkers treated me rudely. Do you suggest I should tell my boss about this and show him the evidence I have or stick with the CEO suggestion and move on with it. I know you might say I should just move on but I know people never change and will stick to being rude, never say anything about it and later in in secrecy blame me for it and I feel at this state I might actually get fired because of it. I dont know what to do and I really dont want to make any sudden or wrong moves which might get me in trouble but I want a piece of mind about this if you could please provide me with an advice, I will be greatly appreciated!

It’s been to the point we’re it’s small now and most of the people that were here from the start are gone 3 people are left that I truly care about. Now I’ve had a fallout with all of them and it seems it is my turn to leave. BUT THERES BEEN SO GODDAM MUCH that has happened so many good memories. This one person says it’s time to let it go and I can’t... there’s too much history and I wouldn’t even now where to go. We were like family and shit happend the people that left before me have never been the same and I don’t want to end up all alone because I fear that so much. Everything points to this being the end the final straw the final memory. I’ve fixed problems like this before thats why I’ve been able to stay around the longest by far.

404,"Ok so let me put you in a bit more context. 

There is a girl I've been friends with since many years ago. Let's call her girl 1. We have a very warm friendship although not that close. I have had the opportunity to see her approximately once or twice every six months since we entered college. We go to the same university but pursue different careers so I rarely see her there. We normally get in touch and give each other advice when needed in these times, but normally we have no contact during the semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've liked her for a long time ago, but one time I tried giving her hints and she friend-zoned me. This was around six months ago. I took the hints and understood she only looked at me as friends. This being said, I still like her but now I understand I can't be with her. I am single right now but am about to meet a girl to see if we'll go out, let's call her girl 2. So I met girl 2 because a friend told me he had a friend I would probably like and sent me her contact. All is going well in the chat and I am planning to meet her soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I went out with girl 1 to have dinner together. I think I felt a hint insinuating she might have changed her opinion about me. Before I describe what happened, I am pretty sure I would rather give girl 1 a shot over girl 2 since I have known her for longer and liked her before. So what happened is that she told me about the dates she had during the semester and I did the same. I honestly have my guard down since I understood I can't be with her. Since she had friend-zoned me, I told her about this girl (girl 2) I'll probably meet soon. She asked how serious it was, to which I responded, I still haven't met her so I don't know. We continued chatting until it was time to pay the check. I offered to pay but she said that normally when she goes out with friends, she pays too. She included that we would need to be something more than friends in order for me to pay for her food. Then she subtly laughed and told me really silently that we are only friends. To which I responded, ""let me pay, I only get to see you once every six months"". She turned to me with a more serious face, looked me directly to the eyes and told me ""I'll let you pay, you just have to give me one good reason why it is fair that you do. Why are you paying?"". I honestly didn't expect that and said it out loud. I was caught with my guard down and reacted a bit nervously. I said, ""I really like our friendship and I would feel nice if you would let me pay for your food since I had a really good time tonight"". I was nervous to make a move and be rejected again, and maybe end up destroying our friendship in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

We then returned to normal and I drove her home. I was kind to her but not more. Before she got out of my car we stayed there parked outside of her house for a while and talked about some other random stuff. When she got out of the car I got out and opened the door for her. Then she told me she wanted to see me soon again. I touched her cheek for a bit and said goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit more context:

We are both Jewish and Mexican (Mexicans are normally warmer people than others). She is a bit shy but I have been like that too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if I am only overthinking what happened or if I should do something about it. And if so, honestly I am not sure what to do about it. Should I just let it go and give it a chance with girl 2?",09Jan2020,1
405,"I’ve been friends with someone since high school, and we’ve had our ups and downs. She’s not a bad person, but she is a mess.

406,"I want to start out by saying I love my friends. I think they all genuinely mean well, but things have been bothering me lately that I want to extinguish before it's too late.

I had a really hard time getting other people to like me as a kid. I guess I was always kind of awkward, not in a weird creepy way, but in a timid, mediocre way. This isn't supposed to be a sob story, but it's fair to say that it was difficult for me to make/keep friends growing up.

I've been in several ""friend groups"" in my life, all very different, but my role in all of them was always pretty similar. I was always the guy who everyone gave a hard time/always the butt of every joke. I tend to let it happen and accept it because I want to keep the friends I have. I never wanted to lose a good friendship because I couldn't take a joke. And that's what they were! Genuinely good friendships, including the ones I have now.

I consider my current friend group to be the closest friends I've ever had. I love them to death, and I wouldn't know what to do without them, but I still have the same role. I'm still the butt of every joke.

Examples:
-I'm 5'8. I'm not the tallest guy around, and my friends usually poke fun at my height and general appearance.
-I get a lot of criticism for how I act. I'm a political science major. I try not to talk about politics too much, since it's heavy and isn't for everybody, but when I do I'm often hit with a ""____, nobody gives a shit."" Fair.
-I'm often just shafted. When making plans, what's convenient for me is usually not taken seriously and my friends all mutually agreed to make me sit in the middle seat in the car (appropriately deemed ""the bitch seat"") even when there are people who are smaller than me who would be more comfortable there, and then criticize me when my knees bump into things. 

There are other examples that are worse and more distasteful, but they're individual events. The things listed above are just little things that occur on a regular basis.

I'm still treated as the mediocre friend who's always wrong. (Which, I understand could theoretically be true, so you'll have to take my word for it). I honestly think my friends have good intentions and like me a lot, but I don't think they understand how much it actually hurts when I get treated the way I do. I often come home from hanging out being very sad or upset. I've also been struggling with my own mental health recently, and it's been a lot harder for me on the inside.


I think a lot of people are going to say that either a) I'm being overdramatic and everyone gets made fun of or b) tell me my friends are toxic and I should get new ones. Well, for the former... Maybe you're right? I guess that's part of the answer I'm searching for. For the ladder, I have to emphasize that I think my friends are great people. I don't think they realize how much I actually think about it. 

Again, I need advice on how to approach this situation. Is this just how friendship is? I want to be able to solve this problem without making a big deal out of it. Like, I don't want my friends to treat me differently just because I asked them for special treatment or something.


Thank you to whoever reads this. It's late, maybe what I said doesn't even make sense, but I appreciate any advice, or even any insight, that anyone might have. Thank guys.",09Jan2020,1

         Hi so I have a bit of a problem. I just started my first full time job after being unemployed for three years. It's a really nice job, I'm doing janitorial at our local hospital. I clean the OR nightly, and it consists of a lot of walking. 
                  
        Unfortunately, since being unemployed for a long time I haven't been on my feet much. My first day my feet hurt pretty bad but it was able to be ignored and pushed through. Today though, today was like walking on two mauled stumps . It hurt so bad that I was full out crying in the bathroom, embarrassingly. I kept trying to just get through it, but I was in so much pain I was nauseous, shaking and sweating. I took two tylenol, but it didn't even help it. 
       
     I didn't want to draw too much attention  to it because there's nurses there that work 16 plus hour shifts, and I'm afraid of being whiny about my achy feet in front of them, I would feel like I'm disrespecting them since I have only worked two days and eight hours a shift. 
     
    My feet were so bad though it hurt up both my legs to my back. I was being trained and I couldn't concentrate on what was being said all I could do was try not to cry right there on the surgical floor.
   
   Mostly what I want to know is how do I go to work tomorrow and go through that again? I don't know if I can handle that kind of pain again. I'm very concerned for my future in this position, it's a really great opportunity and I can't just not go to work. I'm hoping to afford a mortgage soon, and I have bills to pay, my husband counts on me to do this job right now. 
     
     I really feel like I'm letting everyone down, including my really awesome coworkers whom I've  just met but really like.

I’m a 20 year old female, I’m 5’4, and almost 198 lbs. I don’t really look it, but I’m SUPER tired of feeling like crap, heartburn, doing nothing, all of that junk. 
I just moved back home with my boyfriend. We started buying food to eat at home to save money which is a relief, but my problem is I eat when I’m bored. We don’t have jobs yet, I have school, and I’m working on my art career so it’s been tough, but we have family to help luckily. I have a lot of time on my hands now, so I’d like to start doing something about this. 
What can I eat? I really need info on this. I HATE vegetables, and I love any type of meat, but I don’t like fish too much. I also love fruits! I’ve always been lost on the diet part and I really want to get a schedule and figure it out, I know it’s a big part of losing weight. 

Last year I did do good with going on a small fast and going to the gym with my friends, but I was depressed during that time, so I really didn’t want food anyways a lot. I was down to 178 pounds. 

At our house, we have a LOT of steep inclines and declines, would that be good for cardio? I could go around the block which might be about  1/4 of a mile, and have 2 steep inclines, 1 steep decline, and 1 slight incline, then a straight away road. How does that sound? 

I would like to bump it back at the gym again, but unfortunately funds are tight until we can get a membership for $5 with my mom in July. (Compared to $60)

Class presentations make me look unprepared even though I memorized my speech tons of times. I forget words and it’s not good.

414,"So earlier last year my s/o and I signed a lease with a friend from University. He moved in later than we did and so we had to come together with the money for a few months before he moves in.
Well he moves in and his girlfriend follows soon after. This was problematic because our lease only allows for 3 adults to live in our apartments. 
We asked him to tell her to leave but then she tried to kill herself. So we dropped it.
Later he and her begin to smoke pot every single day. Our apartment smells like straight up pot. And we've asked them to at least try and put away their drug paraphernalia, and they haven't. Using marijuana is also against our lease and illegal in our state. 
And now just recently they have brought in a cat that is not allowed as we have reached our two pet limit. 

I've always been someone who follows the rules in everything I do. I can't sleep, and I'm terrified we are suddenly going to get evicted for breaking rules we arent actively breaking. 

I have no idea what to do and all I want to do is tell the landlord but I'm afraid he will evict me and my s/o as well.",09Jan2020,1

417,"I know a girl that has been living in my country for years now and came over here married to a native. They married for visa reasons but were in a relationship too that soon broke down after they arrived here, and honestly I can see why. She's messy, obnoxious, conceited, as well as really very insulting to our culture in a lot of ways. She puts on this grotesquely offensive fake accent nearly every day, but at the same time considers herself one of us, referring collectively to people in this country as ""we"". There is no ""we"". She will always be a foreigner, and never understand our culture. It makes my blood boil. On top of that she shamelessly insults and actively hates members of an ethnic minority we have here simply because she wants to fit in. In fairness, this isn't because she's a bad person, it's because she is downright stupid.

She currently doesn't live with her husband, and has a new boyfriend. Another native with a half decent job that she clearly doesn't care much about and is simply investing in to lead a cushy life.  She got fired from her menial job recently due to incompetence and will go after govt grants to try to start what I know will be a failure of a business whose only function will be to inject more sugar into our growingly obese population.

She very much knows what she's doing is illegal, and has herself in text referred to her marriage as an ""illegal sham marriage"" (I told you, she's pretty stupid). She told me they won't look into her case very much because she is white, and told me how unfortunate that is. She gets her passport in a few months. 

For the reasons I listed above, I don't think she is a good addition to our society and I have strongly been thinking about tipping off the authorities.

Please stop me. I know she's human, I don't want to do this, but I don't want her to get away with it either.",09Jan2020,1

419,"My (20) younger brother (14) had a friend (14) hiding in his closet when I came to check up on him. I was upset and told the kid he needed to leave. Almost instantly I had weird feeling that he *might* be here because he had nowhere else to go. I return to the room where he is putting in his shoes, readying to leave, and I ask him why he was there so late (11:30 pm) with there being school the next morning.

Tells me that he’s a runaway, a few days ago him and a buddy got caught stealing jo-jos’ from an Albertsons and got the cops called on him. His mother and step father were irate, screaming and yelling, and called his friends parents, I’m assuming to bitch them out too. The kid was on probation from something that had happened a few months back, and this caught him a petty theft charge.

After school the next day he heads to his friends house to apologize to his parents, when his step father pulls up and takes him home, yelling and screaming the whole way there. He got fed up and left the first chance he could. His mom called the cops and has pressed charges, and he  now has a warrant for probation violation due to both charges.

He’s a good kid, his parents are fucked up, he’s moved from school to school, state to state, and can never build relationships. My heart goes out to the kid, and I was wondering what I could do to help. I told him that he’s gonna have to face the charges sooner or later, but that I know he’s gonna do what he’s gonna do regardless of what I say. He’s scared, with nobody of relativity in his corner. He’s alone and doesn’t know what he can do, so he running from the problem like any kid would. What **can** I do?",09Jan2020,1
420,"Long post ahead. I’ll start from the beginning and go toward the current situation. 

We were about 7th grade students when we first met.  She transferred from another school from another state she got friends quickly and was the popular girl she was always mean to me and verbally abused me her friends tagged along with her. One day I got pissed and decided to fight her and she pretty much beat me up because at those ages girls are as strong as guys. After this is got worse until one night. It was the school dance and she was there. I went outside to go on my new phone I just got because I was bored I’m not good in those social situations. She came outside and I was really nervous she then kissed me and turned me around and... yeah.. I never had done it before and was very confused as to what she was doing. It felt good but also strange and I obviously didn’t want a girl touching my penis at that age. So it happened I didn’t even know what was coming out of me I thought she did something to me I pulled up my pants and walked back inside and the rest of the night was crap. 

After this it got better bullying wise. Eventually we had to work on a group project together and so my parents took me to her house in which her mother was there looking after us. she touched me the entire time... we went in her room and she made me have sex with her. Yes I know this is sexual assault and r*** however it didn’t nearly effect me as much as other survivors so please don’t pitty me. After this we did it a few more times a few times when she was bleeding and I found out a few years later she was on her period. 

Now we are 15. We go to the same high school and started dating... well I agreed to the dating a few weeks ago but we went out and hung out previously for a year. I felt better with her but she was just different. Eventually a few weeks ago she opened up to me about a lot of stuff which I’ll get into.. I noticed scratches on her arm and she didn’t take care of herself much. She wasn’t the care free girl or mean girl that she was before. 

She opened up to me about her being sexually assaulted by her mother’s ex when she was 10-11. I won’t get into detail as it’s private but she said that Because of that I did a lot of bad things to you I never had power over someone like I did over you and I abused it. I didn’t forgive her... but I understood her situation more... she told me her mom got back with that same ex and that she’s extremely scared everyday and she wants to move in with me.. 

I know her being raped is not an excuse to do the same thing to me. But the fact that the person who did it to her is still living in her has is horrible. How can I separate them? I doubt my parents will let her stay over and tbh I don’t like that idea as it would trigger some bad memories with her.. it’s like I love and hate her I feel the sexual pressure she gave me all the pleasure and love it then I feel the hurt the pain the innocence and hate her. But she doesn’t deserve this and neither do I. Her mom doesn’t know what her ex did to her as a kid apparently soo what should we do? She’s honestly scaring me. Everyday she comes with new cuts and is overall just weird and I can’t explain it through messages thank!",09Jan2020,1
421,"I've always had this problem in my life where I worried about what other people thought of me.  I've been an introverted person my whole life and this has lead to me being mocked a lot for my hobbies and interests. I've been mocked by people I considered close friends as well as by most of my family. It feels like most of the people who want me around only want me there so they can talk about how ""shy"" or ""quiet"" I am to their friends. I can honestly say I love the life I live even if I don't like to be around people as much as I like to play video games, read books, or watch conspiracy documentaries. However, I get anxiety when I think about my past failures in life and the times when I was made to feel low by others. I know my life can be so much better if I kick this habit.

My mom is extremely worried about him, i read articles and watched YouTube videos about this subject to help him and we tried to make a serious talk with him as a family.

Now I really have like this big feeling of just having an ONS. But I am very aware that I would regret it. But there is also this desire to do it. Maybe because I just miss the affection and attention I got from him, and I just want to feel loved. So I am very afraid, that I do something stupid. Like I wrote with one or two people on tinder ( but not letting it get serious or stopped replying at some piont, which is totally not nice I know) and I guess I am maybe going to just delete this app. How long should I wait till I am really ready to maybe habe some fun ?

Shes not a lesbian or anything, she looks like a normal woman and shes never been very horrible to me, only smacked me with a wooden spoon or around the head and punched me in the back a couple times when i was little but thats kindof different to how women can be bad.

434,"For starters, I’m a 16 year old girl that is fully capable of taking care of younger children. I’ve always been good with kids and I’ve babysat my neighbor’s two kids (7 and 2 at the time) on multiple occasions without incident, apart from one that was easily resolved. I’ve had some issues with responsibility in the past, but the babysitting happened in the worst of it and I like to think I handled it pretty well (the mother thought so as well and paid me despite me saying it wasn’t necessary). My responsibility issues have been mostly resolved and now I need a way to earn my own money.

The only issue is my little brother. He’s 7 and he’s pretty much the only thing that’s stopping me from being able to babysit. I have a weird relationship with him. Sometimes it’s loving and other times it’s hostile and volatile, often stemming from me telling him to not do something and getting something thrown at me. My family only sees the times that I don’t have the patience to deal with his outbursts and use this as a reason to not let me babysit, despite the fact that they’ve seen me deal with other kids’ tantrums extremely well. 

They’re afraid I’m going to lose my patience and “snap” on other kids like I do with my brother even though they have NEVER seen me do so and therefore have no reason to believe so. They want me to be responsible, earn my own money and do something that I like doing, but as soon as I want to do something that will allow me to all three, they think of every reason under the sun why I can’t or shouldn’t. What should I do?

435,"All I really want is to become friends with my cousin, because cousin is not enough. I will ask her if she wants to come with me to a music festival (I will pay for her ticket which costs 130$), and I will also buy a gift for 60$, because it is her birthday in less than two months. If she still doesn't want to be my friend after that I don't know what to do, except ending it by using an exit bag. However I know she won't be sad at all if I'm gone, she’ll probably be happy to have no male cousin left. I just want to make my cousin happy, because if she never wants to be my friend, then me not being on this planet anymore would probably satisfy her. I don’t know however if it is a good idea to do it on her birthday. If I do it on her birthday I want to do it on her bed too. Maybe she'll think it'll ruin it, or she'll think it was just a dream come true. None of us is going to live forever either way, one day nothing you have done will matter.

The thing is, she's never said ""I don't want to be your friend"" but I know she doesn't want to be my friend because she always says she's busy when I want to hang out, or she's with her other friends. Reasons why I guess my cousin wouldn't want to be my friend:

First off, I'm very ugly, and second of all I am a guy, and though she has guy friends judging from her photos on Instagram, most of them are girls. Also I guess there is a bit of an age difference. I’m not turning 18 until summer, which is when you become an adult, and you are able to drink where me and my cousin lives. And my cousin likes to go out and drink with her friends sometimes, as I've sometimes seen on social media (at  least before she removed me from Snapchat). I'm also not very good at socialising, when I'm with my friends I usually just keep saying stupid shit, but when I get the lucky oppurtunity to be with my cousin I don't say a lot, because I don't know a lot to say that wouldn't come off as stupid or redundant. So basically I think at least a little bit more before I say something when I am with my cousin in comparison to when I am with my friends, and my friends are all guys from the age of 14 to 19.

My only other cousin is 14, and she's told me she doesn't want me to hurt myself, but I'm sure she just says that because it maybe was something she learned in school, or something from my aunt. I don't think she'd be traumatised either if I died.

My friends encouraged him to pick one of them to take to the winter dance and still not wanting him to know I liked him I joined in.

I have this bad habit of lying about my parents doing something wrong and exaggerating the issue, I then scream and throw a stupid tantrum about it because they apparently ""did something really bad"" to me.

For example, I asked my dad why none of the lighters were working and he tried one and it worked. He then brought it close to the item I was holding like he was trying to burn it as a joke. I immediately screamed and cursed at them. (I'm from an Asian family so cursing is strictly forbidden but I always curse whenever I'm in this situation). I claim that he burned the item I was holding (fake) and then screamed about how this item was a gift for my friend that I've been working on for a week (which is true).
Even after I realised that my dad did not burn it. I continued to scream about how he ruined my hard work.

Since i was a kid I've been to church and so on when i was about 8 my mum stopped going to church due to her own reasons but insisted that we had worship and prayed every day and we read most of if not all of a chapter of the bible on Saturdays. My mum eventually wandered into the Hebrew Isrealites and since then I haven't been able to be on good terms with my mum. every problem has some type of conspiracy or herbal cure and not everything is that complex or simple. for a while i was in the religion too but since i moved away she has been really pushy on getting me back to the HI church and with these herbal medicines.

I've met her parents and she has met my mum and everyone is great, but my mum is pushing me to marry and convert my GF to the hebrew isrealites, and i don't want to force anyone into anything especially if I'm having doubts about it myself, i also questioned my mum's antivax beliefs and despite her being a nurse she ignores every scientific paper i present on the matter.

my brother and I have never had a good relationship. i have barely said a word to him in the last 6 years. i genuinely don't like how he's become and dont want him to be part of my life unfortunately. He thinks the opposite though, he thinks we should be hang out more often.

I married my wife 2 years ago, super happy.

Recently Jane Doe sent me a text out of the blue asking if its cool to date my brother. they already went on a date and she felt guilty. I wasn't sure what to say, so i said 'sure', and i think it was my honest reply given that i barely know my brother anymore. it was like she was asking permission to date a stranger.

Jane 'said' she didnt know he was my brother. and my brother 'said' he didnt know Jane was my ex. im not sure theyre both telling the truth though, just my gut feeling.

Now Jane wants to be friends with my wife. she's going on girl dates, hanging out, texting eachother etc. and NOW they want to do a double date. and this is where i started to feel super weird about the whole situation.

Am i crazy? what should i do. I don't feel like i have the right to not let them date eachother, but i also hate the idea of seeing them together, let alone being on a date with them.",09Jan2020,1
446,"Hello everyone,

once again I am in back in the same place. Without work, with payments knocking at my door... 22 years old.

I am once again searching for a job I would like to do, or at least I think I want to do. As because of this behavior I have changed 3 work places last year. Because of that HR are simply throwing my CV into trash.

The problem is I am motivated to work, I want to work, but whenever I get a job after two months it seems the same and boring. Than I start thinking if this is what I want and I always get into same conclusion that its not. But I still dont have an answer for the one question that I am curious about the  most ""What I want to be?"". Without answer...

Through my whole life I have been working as B2C Salesman (1,5 years),  B2B Salesman (2 months), End User Support Technician (7 months) and as Sound Engineer ( 1,5 months).

Everything I do is just because I want to find what I really would like to do. I thought about all of the above that one of them is a job I would actually enjoy. I had a great time working as Technician. Probably the work I enjoyed the most but the money I was getting wasnt quite enough for me. I still stayed because of collective that was there.

Now I am feeling scared and lost. I still dont know what do I want to do. How do I can find something I want to do? How I will know that the work I am doing is the one?

450,"So I moved out of my parents house a few months ago to a different country to study, I am 21. I am very lucky my parents support me financially but it’s kind of hit me hard today that as soon as my degree is done I will have to be completely financially responsible for myself. I can cook, clean, generally able to take care of myself but I literally have NO IDEA about finances or money or how anything works... real adulting basically. I am terrible at math, my IQ is in the 98th percentile for some things and 30th percentile for others, so my abilities are very varied. For some reason math just never really clicked for me, I could do well in chemistry, even physics which includes math for some reason, but I could never properly grasp even the most basic math. It’s now been a long time since I was out of school and had to use math and I feel like I completely lost any ability and am sort of phobic towards it. But I suddenly want to learn how to budget and learn how to be financially independent. I am dog walking on the side of studying not because it’s a lucrative career or worthwhile but I love animals and have 4 dogs at home so I just enjoy being around them and it’s a fun activity that gives me some extra cash. So I wanted to save up some of the money I earn doing that throughout the next 3 years so I can at least maybe pay for my own holiday after uni (I love to travel) or put it towards something maybe invest and grow it. I basically just want to start early before I even have to be completely independent. I am wanting to get a more useful job related to my studies during this time but am still on the hunt for that. But I don’t even know how to set up a bank account, I don’t even really understand why it’s better to put it in a bank but I know you gain money from interest if you do. I just really don’t get how it all works and I’m quite socially anxious, my family is all very business orientated and quite critical/make fun of me for being so bad at math so I don’t really want to ask them for help.

So I told him if he needs my help he should meet me first coz I needed answers to what had happened to him and why he went dark. 

So I decided to meet him and he was acting all suspicious of the people around. I asked him what happened to him and he started telling me about being mind controlled and gang stalked by people full Alex Jones conspiracy level shit. The gang stalking part is not true coz he was one of the silent types in college. Then I realised I won't be getting any answers from him and my trip was a waste.

I was so in love with this girl. She was perfect, absolutely perfect. But over time it just clicked how poorly she would treat me. I don't feel like listing them right now but check my comments or other posts if you want to know how horribly she would act towards me. About a week ago it all came to a point and we broke up. It was very passive and we had an understanding. 

Now despite knowing better I just wish she was here with me. But now that she's pregnant it is my choice she says. Either abort it and she never forgives me and feels eternal pain for losing a second baby during pregnancy, or have the child and hope she treats me better. I am very scared to abort the baby, my spirit, my blood, my soul, my child. I don't want to but after seeing how horribly she treats me when settled I might have to live with the death crossing my path of life.

If only she was as perfect as I believed. The feeling was so real. If she was good to me then I would go through with the birth, despite complications. But after how I've been treated I don't know if she should even be a parent. I know I probably shouldn't. Especially at this age, and with me being bipolar nothing is helped.

After she announced her pregnancy to me, she decided to say that she would get a restraining order on me (after I was attempting to block her social media because of her spam and harassment.) Not only that, she said she would have the baby and never let me see him, as well as have me pay child support. I would absolutely want to coparent my child if it was born. I'm just scared she would go through with these actions if she gave birth.

460,"DISCLAIMER: I apologise if it sounds like I’m not getting to the point, but I promise everything I say is relevant. Sorry if some details are vague, I can’t be too specific.

Right now I’m 17. My mom doesn’t work, so my dad is the sole provider. 

My dad is extremely misogynistic; he cheats on my mom all the time, and as far as I’m aware he has a total of 6 children outside me and my siblings. It’s hard for my mom to leave because she’s unemployed, my dad manipulated her into quitting her job and she hasn’t had a job for years now so bc of her age and lack of experience it’s hard for her to get a job — this leaves us with no option but to stay with my dad.

My father is also very abusive, when I was a lot younger he would beat my mom, and quite recently he beat up on of my female relative very very brutally. He’s extremely controlling, and he’s also very rich. Everyone is aware of his behaviour — the cheating, the abuse — but he has A LOT of money, and A LOT of influence, so people are scared to report him. He’s also extremely connected, he knows everyone. He knows waiters at restaurants, and he knows super important people on tv and stuff.

Because he’s so largely connected, he has people watching me and my siblings everywhere. Examples: My brother is in college now, and was staying at a residency (like a dorm/fraternity kind of) and my father stopped paying for his rent. He did this bc he didn’t like his behaviour (referring to drinking, talking to girls, parties — standard college things) But how on earth would my dad know *for sure* what my brother was up to if he away from home? How would my dad definitively know?? He had ppl in my brother’s residency spying on him, and reporting back to him.

Another example is whenever I’m at shopping centres, and I walk into any restaurant/fast food place/clothing store the employees will stop and stare at me (subtlety, and briefly). They will all stare and whisper to one another and pretend they don’t know me or who my father is. These moments are brief, but very telling. I know they know him, cos whenever I go to these same places with my dad they’ll be very polite and courteous (almost too polite) and say “Hi Mr [Surname], it’s so great to see you again!”

It’s gotten to a really bad point now though. My dad has had people hack into my phone (more specifically my iCloud, so my photos, whatsapp/iMessage, school documents) — so ofc it’s risky posting this. I found this out when I switched on my iCloud photos storage, and I found a selfie from one of his mistresses on my camera roll — she hates my mom and me and brothers. I’m so certain she logged into my iCloud account, looked through all my stuff and forgot to logout (hence the selfie). The iCloud thing within itself was easy to solve, I just changed the email and password attached to the account.

But this is a far greater issue. I know at malls people are watching me, at school too, and now my phone. The only freedom I have are my thoughts right now. He’s watching all of us, including my mom. He got a gardener to spy on her. I want to do something but I think he has way too much influence. He’s also my only financial support rn (I don’t want to state why I can’t get a job bc that’s going to make it easier to find out who my dad is, but it’s a very valid reason that I can not change). It’s a very complex situation, BUT I NEED HELP, I NEED TO FIND A WAY OUT FOR ME AND MY SIBLINGS - A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. I’m very desperate, so anything will be helpful, cos I’m living every second of my life like I’m in The 1984 by George Orwell. I have no privacy.",09Jan2020,1
461,"After high school, I stopped talking to almost all of my friends because I realized that most of them were immature, materialistic or overall negative people.

462,"Throwaway account here. And a long story ahead.

I've recently been through a breakup, but it wasn't the breakup that was making me unable to move on, it was the aftermath.

Here is the long story. I had been dating a female friend of my senior year for about 3 months. We've never spoken in high school before that, but we began talking to each other during our last year. So at that point we started becoming friends, and I've started developing feelings towards her at that time. Fast forward to after finals, I confessed to her and she told me that we could try and date each other. 

Things however didn't turn out as I expected. Yes we were 'dating', but something just felt odd in that experience. For instance, our conversations are always started by me, and I felt as if I was the only one doing all the work and doing all the initiating, that is I felt it was heavily one-sided, but I won't go into details here. Point is, I realized something wasn't right, but I thought it was part of the art of chasing girls. (lol) 

It wasn't a pleasant 3 months, because her being so passive really made me insecure. I did start to question if she was really interested at some point of our 3 months, but I quickly knocked those thoughts off as just obsessive thoughts, though I had always had the gut feelings that something wasn't right.

Fast forward again to 3 months later, my insecurity got the better of me and I texted her asking to have a conversation. I told her that I wasn't sensing affection from her, that I felt she was too passive in our relationship, and that I am willing to discuss about it. She saw my text and decided to break up.

Getting the text was devastating for me, because it felt like I have dedicated so much effort only to get dumped. In our conversation of breaking up, she turned so cold, even accused me of annoying her for calling her and wanting to settle it on the phone. After that, even though I was very sad and devastated, I sent her a wishful message and ask her to take care of herself.

That night, I tried my best to comfort myself. So I reached out to few of my buddies to plan for a group hangout. My buddies saw I wasn't happy and asked me why, and I told them I just suffered from a breakup. (Our relationship was a secret because it only started after our finals) Things escalated a lot after this.

My buddy comforted me and was surprised that I was in a relationship in the first place. I told him about her and I were dating for 3 months. After hearing that, he told me that she had been playing me all along. Then he proceeded to tell me about how his other buddies got played by her as well. I was unaware of it because her and I weren't friends until our last year in high school.

I was really angry at that point and sent her a text accusing her for leading me on for the past 3 months. No surprise, she was disappointed and accused me for not trusting her. And she proceeded to tell me another version of the stories about her and my buddy's friends. She told me those friends misunderstood her friendliness as seduction, and she wasn't playing them. 

Things went too far at that point, and I agreed on her that I trusted what others have to say rather than her. And I accused her with harsh words. I even went as far as breaking the friendship because I felt I didn't want to continue to pursue a friendship with someone who wasn't genuine.

However, I am in deep regret. I regret my action to accuse her of what might or might not be true. She was right that I trusted others rather than her, but in our past 3 months, it felt so exhausting as if she was breadcrumbing. Then again, I might just be a needy person.

If I don't do the initiating, we would never talk. If I didn't plan our dates, we would never go out. And it seemed she wasn't curious about me, and barely showed any affection. These are those subtle things that triggered my insecurities, and eventually led me to believe what others have said of her.

But even as I could convince myself to believe that she was deceitful, I am still in great guilt. Every morning I would wake up and think about how bad I was as a person to hurt the feelings of someone I liked. Every time I would imagine how disappointed she was about me.  I felt as if I betrayed her, I betrayed her trust and genuine interest.

I couldn't bring myself to a closure. I couldn't bring myself to forget about what I had done. I felt as if I had done the wrong thing, even though subjectively my judgements weren't wrong. 

I need help on how to move on from this mess. I didn't just lose someone I had feelings of, I also lost a friend. Should I consult a counsellor for this? It has been going on for nearly 2 weeks and I still couldn't let go of the guilt of what I had done.",09Jan2020,1

468,"Hello, me and my ex boyfriend had called it quits last year (he initiated the breakup) and I still have problems moving on and getting over him (it has been more than a month since then).
Background story:
We started dating during mid year 2019 and throughout the relationship, I treated him unfairly but he still stood by me despite all difficulties. He gave me emotional support and offered any form support he could give, especially during school term. However, he kept suspecting that I have affairs with others and it was somehow mentally disturbing as I clearly proved that I don’t have any other affairs. I admit that initially,  I did not reveal to my guy friends that I had a boyfriend because I wasn’t sure what we had going on. But as time passes by, I begin to feel more comfortable introducing him as my boyfriend to my classmates and friends (my family already knew he existed from the start). We had both unhappy and happy moments during our relationship (fyi, I feel that most of the unhappy moments were due to my angry outbursts). When he decided to call it quits during end-year 2019, I was devastated. During the last month of that year, I reflected upon all my actions and knew what had to be changed: my attitude (plus my anger management). When I warmly welcome the new decade, I was happy and resolute that I will not make the same mistakes again. I started participating in school events (which is out of my comfort zone) in order to expose myself to unfamiliar settings. However, as the school reopening date approaches, fear suddenly grip me. He used to support me emotionally during the school term and it greatly helped me. This time, he won’t be around and I started to feel scare. He used to be in my school to accompany me throughout my studies and I always feel that I had someone who I could rely on and trust which really boosted my energy. My friends have helped me to get over him by saying that ‘he won’t come back’, ‘you guys are not meant to’, etc and I understand where they are coming from. I just feel so lost. I’m worried that my distracted mind will affect my studies plus I do still miss him a lot (after all he’s my first boyfriend/first love).

470,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but here it goes.

I'm a 22yo male, pursuing an undergrad degree with Computer Science major. I'm in my final semester and am preparing for grad school. I'm wondering if I should, here's why.

I'm a good student, I'm set to graduate at the top of my class and am specializing in Deep Learning (Computer Vision for techies and Artificial Intelligence for non techies). Because of my specialization and my profile, it won't be that difficult for me to get a job. But I don't want to work yet and want to study further, I'm looking at PhD programs and really think that research is where my heart's at. That's why I'm preparing for grad school entrance examinations and even rejected an offer from Intel because it was clashing with my preparation schedule. As I'm typing this, this is sounding more and more like a shitpost, so I'm going to get to why I want to take a break.

I have always taken my studies seriously, no family pressure, I'm just too hard on myself. I almost had a mental breakdown when I was preparing for college entrance examinations right after high school which ultimately resulted in my performing bad and getting a mediocre college. It took me quite a while to get out of that phase. And what I'm doing currently just feels like the past, which scares me.

I'm not going to self diagnose myself with any mental illness, because I can't get myself to see a therapist for whatever reason. The thing is I'm too scared of failing again, not because of how my future will pan out, but because I'm not sure if I'm mentally healthy enough to handle if anything goes south. Now here's the dilemma

On one hand, I'm thinking of just going through with the grad school applications and entrance examinations. I've prepared reasonably well and I will get 3-4 months after the exams before I'd have to join a grad school. On the other hand, I just want to be sure that I'm mentally healthy enough to face the next part of my life. But the thought that I'd be wasting a whole year when I've always been in a race for the next achievement is scary.

I realize that this write-up is all over the place, but I do hope that I've been able to put my thoughts across. Any advice would be appreciated",09Jan2020,1

473,"What was my girlfriend of 2 years is deciding to move back home a few states away ~9 hours. The main reason for this is the health of her parents, which i won’t argue with. As a matter of fact I condone it. However she had broke up with me when breaking the news. A little background... she moved here for school and inherently got a job post graduation. I interned at the same place ending up in getting hired and our romance sparked. Work and personal life were kept separate as they should be. I always knew she was close with her family, we practically took every vacation to visit. The question was IF we would ever move there. As our relationship progressed it turned into more of a WHEN will we move there. Well we both work 2 jobs 1 full 1 part time apiece. However I grew comfortable and worked very few hours at my part time job. We’ve been getting by but not getting ahead. 

Fast forward to now.. we are no longer a couple but we still live In The same apartment. It’s truly a tough experience and the most unique one I’ve ever been in. It’s been a month now and she “plans” on moving back in 3 weeks. I’ve grown up and fixed most of not all of my major issues since the breakup. As a matter of fact she has personally noticed them herself. 

To be clear as much as I want to continue a relationship I want her to want that as well, not just because I want to. Up to this point she is not sure what she wants to do. Pretty much every answer to every question I have regarding us is I DONT KNOW. She says she still loves me, cares for me, has feelings, is attracted to me still, etc. pretty much the perfect recipe for a relationship but i digress. She mentions how she absolutely loves the way I treat her and how faithful I’ve been. Because up until this point our relationship was very healthy for the most part. 

It’s been a lot of back and forth. At this point she would move back in with her mom. It would not be ideal for me to move there too. That we both agree on. My suggestion is to kick start the move while as a couple. Her moving first getting established while maintaining a long distance situation for a few months. “ separation makes the heart grow fonder”. I just don’t really know if it would truly work otherwise as much as I still want it to due to the fact I want something as close to solid as possible for such a big commitment for moving. 

We are going on a date Friday to try to “reignite that spark”. Not to talk about feelings but to enjoy each others company. And I’ll try to get a read on the situation f few days later. 

She’s not opposed to spending quality time with me. She asked me to work on a puzzle with her I got her as a gift. All of this back and forth has me going crazy. I just want to know if I’m doing the right thing.. I feel like I’m playing the cards I’m dealt very well but to what effect?

474,"I’m about to graduate college in 6 months and I have no idea what to do after that. I want to eventually go to law school, but I probably need a few years working and paying off student loans before that. I’m estimating I’ll try to do 1-3 years of living as cheaply as I can and hopefully landing a $30k-$50k job. I don’t have my drivers license, so taking time off would also allow me to get a license and a car eventually. 

I don’t really have a large savings, by the time I graduate I could have $2k saved if I really commit to it. I’m scared to actually apply for housing somewhere because my credit score is only 650, from paying student loans, and I don’t have a credit card, and I’m worried about affording a downpayment. So this leaves me with 2 options: 

1. Move to live with my old friend from highschool who goes to college in the Midwest. I’m graduating a year early, so she still has a year left. She’s renting this apartment with one other girl, but they have an empty bedroom and she offered it to me for $350/mo. The problem is, there’s been a bunch of confusion over who’s name is on the lease, if an old roommate is trying to come back, if the landlord would even accept me, etc. Generally it feels a little messy. And, i grew up/go to college in the Bay Area, and I’ve never lived in snow or anything. I’m a little worried about the slight culture shock as well. But, living here with two girls my age would give me a chance to have an easy way to make friends, and a way to really be independent and start my life and career away from my parents. I’ve also been thinking about using moving there as a stepping stone to going to law school in Canada rather than the US. 

2. Move in with my dad in Hawaii. My dad rents out two studio apartments in the same big house as each other, one for him and his girlfriend, and currently one for my brother who’s 17 and about to graduate high school the same month I graduate college. His plan is to go work on our uncles fishing boat after graduation, so his studio apartment is going to be empty. My dad offered it to me for $500/mo. It’s a really great deal, the house is literally right on one of the most famous beaches in Hawaii. I’d get free groceries as well, and my dad could help me with learning how to drive. And since it’s an entirely separate studio apartment I’d still have my own space and feel pretty independent. The problem is, I feel like my dad wouldn’t think of me as an adult or a tenant, he’d think of me as his daughter and want me to constantly check in with him and not stay out too late. I also don’t have any friends in Hawaii and I’d be pretty lonely, which would be a bummer as a 21 year old girl. I’d also most likely have to commute an hour to Honolulu every day to get a decent job that actually uses my college degree. 

What should I do? I feel like there are a lot of pros and cons to each. I’m a very independent person, I lived with my neglectful mom ages 12-18 and basically raised myself. I’ve lived alone in the dorms for my 3 years of college and so I’ve grown accustomed to being able to party or do whatever I want. The thought of moving “in” with my dad (even though it’d be separate apartments) feels a little constricting to me, even though we get along really well. I stayed there for 2 months this past summer and it was a blast, but I’m worried that if I lived there I would be stuck in “vacation mode” and never seriously pursue law school or a competitive career. But, hawaii also leads to a healthier lifestyle than the midwest. But I’d also be really lonely in Hawaii and probably struggle to make friends. I don’t know. I need help!",09Jan2020,1
475,"I tested into an IB program at a new public school for grade 11. Right before school started, things in my family got really ugly and my parents left me alone with my severely mentally ill sibling. I won’t go into detail but things got really bad from there on. I don’t really fit in at school. I had friends but none that I was comfortable around. I don't think theres anything extreme wrong with me, most of my old friends really loved me. it was just a very different group of people than I was used to, and I had become really quiet because I just wasn't very happy. My mental health has been pretty crap for the past 4 years, and I did pretty ok for the first few months of school but after a while I sort of collapsed. I tried to get support, and I reached out to counsellors, teachers, and youth groups, but my depression and anxiety just was just getting worse. The semester ended with my teachers omitting my grade. I really want to go to boarding school, but most application deadlines passed a long time ago, my grades are pretty much non-existent, and I’ve quit all of my extracurriculars. All I have is an 86th percentile PSAT score from grade 10, which isn’t as good as I could’ve done. I have teachers who can write reference letters for my competency. I know I can do very well if I can just clear my head and focus. I’ve been suggested to just quit school for the rest of the year and focus on extracurriculars and getting a good SAT score and apply for the schools next year, but I’m already considered old for my grade, and I don’t want to graduate when I’m 19. What should I do? What are the chances of me getting into a boarding school in the middle of the school year? If I do take the year off, how will that affect my chances for applying next year?

I know I should've pushed through last semester, I just wasn't thinking clearly. I know things are supposed to be hard, but I figure I should try to make things better for myself if I'm able to.",09Jan2020,1

477,"Back when I was in secondary school, I made friends with this girl and we became really close. During the course of our friendship I started to notice that she was actually really toxic. She would constantly put me down and make me feel like she was doing me a favour by being friends wi tbh me.

If I ever told her that something made me uncomfortable, she would go out of her way to do those things more. I decided that I had enough and decided to message her saying that our friendship wasn’t working out. I was polite and took the blame for our friendship not working out. She replied saying she understood and said maybe it’s best. I told her I was going to block her because I felt like it would give me complete closure (in reality I just didn’t want her contacting me again). She said she understood.

3 months later, she calls me on an unknown number and starts telling me that she isn’t letting our friendship go and that I’m being a “quitter” and a “pussy”. She said that if I pissed her off anymore then she was going to show up and my house and college with her older brothers and beat the shit out of me. She has done stuff like that to other people so I was genuinely scared. She eventually bullied me into a friendship with her again.

Things carried on the same as before. Her being very toxic. She actually told me that she overdosed on pills because of me and that her doctors had diagnosed her with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and manic depression. She didn’t take any of the medication they gave her and refused to go to therapy or an institution.

I began ignoring her calls and texts whenever I could because most of the calls were just her finding an excuse to take up my time. I only answered once a week. One day she contacted me and sent me a screenshot of how she had been keeping track of my snap score everyday and could see how I was ignoring her. This freaked me out to I decided to straight up block her on everything. I even set my phone up so unknown numbers could not call and text me.

That happened in November and I never heard from her since. I thought that maybe she had finally given up. 

Today, I woke up with a message from my best friend and she said that the girl contacted her and told her to give me her number so I could call her. My best friend doesn’t know what went down and I don’t want her involved. When I saw that message I had a full on panic attack and I’m really scared she’s going to do something to me.

I don’t know how to deal with the situation. Technically she has not broken the law so I can’t get the police involved and we don’t go to the same school. What should I do? How should I approach the situation? I really do not want to talk to her.",09Jan2020,1
478,"Not totally sure if this is the right subreddit for the post, but hopefully someone out there can give me some advice, no matter how small I'll appreciate it!!

I graduated with my Master degree from grad school this past summer in 2019 - I studied Criminology &amp; Crim. Justice. I had just finished my Bachelors right before, and that was preceded by high school. I am now 22 years old and for now, I am pretty done with studying. Leading up to my final graduation and all throughout the summer and early autumn I searched for jobs related to my field, but to this day I've had no luck. I have a pretty specific area that I'd like to work in, and it may be my own fault that I have not found anything due to being too narrow in my search. But it has lead me to now work at a hotel for the past few months, and for the foreseeable future until I find something new. 

The job has been and is good in many ways, and I enjoy various aspects of it, but I feel totally and utterly like I am wasting my time and that if I don't leave soon, I am going to be stuck in the job for way longer than I would like. I absolutely hate the shift work and the unpredictable schedules and have to sacrifice a lot of social life and exercise/sport as my schedule doesn't align with others anymore. I really, really, hate it. I am dying to send in my resignation ASAP. I feel anxious all of the time due to the feeling of wasting my time, and the fact that with every passing month I fear that future employers will look down on me for spending time in the service industry and not getting relevant work experience. 

I have also been wanting to take a bit of a gap year since I graduated high school, which I never did. I would love to travel for about 6 months.  Now I am playing with the idea of just doing that, quitting my job at the hotel now and leaving in spring. But the same thought of being scared of future employers looking down on the decision prevents me from doing so. The idea of coming back and restarting the job search later in the year, with still no relevant experience to show after over a year of graduation seems terrible and even shittier than how it is now. 

I don't know if I articulated my situation and myself well. In short, I am in a job I don't want to be in, and I don't know how to proceed - continue with the job hunt and stay in the hotel until I find something else, or say fuck it and just travel? Everyone tells me something else and I feel so torn and stressed about it, so any drop of advice would be lovely &lt;3",09Jan2020,1

I started the year with J, we had dated on/off for years, tried to live together for the 3rd time but it didn't work. 


We broke up, I was devastated and tried to move on by dating people,  doing drugs and just general running away behavior. 


J and I tried again kind of in August but I tried to kill myself in October, and it was too much and he left. 


I then met D. Things moved fast and we're amazing. Then reality sunk in and I cheated on him (something super shitty I've never done before), told him and even though it hurt him he's still talking to me. 


J comes back before the end of the year asking what I want,  and because of how I treated D and just couldn't seem to get over J I thought fuck it maybe we're meant to be? 


Cue this morning. I find out I'm pregnant and am 90% sure it's Ds. He wants me to keep it and even if it isn't his will marry me and raise it. 


J obviously wants me to get rid of it and for us to try and rebuild. I love them both and am so confused. 


I have wanted a baby and family for a long time so even though I would have to move and mentally I haven't been great I feel ill never be ready and now feels right. 


If I get rid of it I'll stay with J and maybe it works out different than the other times.... 


Or I keep it and try a life with D. We both have personality disorders though and he tried to kill himself when I broke up with him on New Years so coping isn't our strong point. 


So reddit what do I do? Do I keep it and choose D, move and try get my life together for a family I have always wanted. Or abort the kid,  try fix myself and Js relationship and potentially be happier?

488,"A while ago I had an altercation with my neighbor who got really drunk one night and started shouting into our bedroom window. It was over a minor problem that had suddenly ticked him off that night. We’re not loud and had never even met him up until that night. We always left him alone. 

At some point he said, “Don’t fuck with me, I’m a fucking lance corporal!” And before that a neighbor explained to me that he was a veteran with PTSD. He shouted insults and called us perverts(he was mad that we didn’t have proper blinds for our bedroom) for the whole complex to hear.

During the altercation, my boyfriend went to talk to him and and the neighbor admitted to being on his 12th beer. A few weeks later he apologized for his behavior, but he clearly got drunk before talking to us. 

3 or so months later, he started getting loudly drunk at night again. He was cursing out some other neighbor, but I got anxious all over again, waiting for him to redirect his anger on us. With this guy I can never know when he will explode since he never tells us what’s wrong.  We called the police on him, but I just worry that he’ll retaliate on us later. 

So I’m already paranoid  and I’m dealing with an alcoholic veteran with PTSD. After seeing the way he freaked out on us and others, I’m pretty sure he has anger issues also. It’s not great for my anxiety and every night my heart races when he goes on one of his drunken fits. 

I like my apartment a lot, and the neighbors were on our side from the whole issue. The rent is good, the conditions are perfect, but this neighbor makes me so fucking nervous. He hasn’t hurt anyone but I just feel unsafe.

I will ask her if she wants to come with me to a music festival (I will pay for her ticket which costs 130$), and I will also buy a gift for 60$, because it is her birthday in less than two months. If she still doesn't want to be my friend after that I don't know what to do, except ending it by using an exit bag. However I know she won't be sad at all if I'm gone, she’ll probably be happy to have no male cousin left.

I don’t know however if it is a good idea to do it on her birthday. If I do it on her birthday I want to do it on her bed too. Maybe she'll think it'll ruin it, or she'll think it was just a dream come true. None of us is going to live forever either way, one day nothing you have done will matter.

The thing is, she's never said ""I don't want to be your friend"" but I know she doesn't want to be my friend because she always says she's busy when I want to hang out, or she's with her other friends. Reasons why I guess my cousin wouldn't want to be my friend:

First off, I'm very ugly, and second of all I am a guy, and though she has guy friends judging from her photos on Instagram, most of them are girls. Also I guess there is a bit of an age difference. I’m not turning 18 until summer, which is when you become an adult, and you are able to drink where me and my cousin lives. And my cousin likes to go out and drink with her friends sometimes, as I've sometimes seen on social media (at  least before she removed me from Snapchat). I'm also not very good at socialising, when I'm with my friends I usually just keep saying stupid shit, but when I get the lucky oppurtunity to be with my cousin I don't say a lot, because I don't know a lot to say that wouldn't come off as stupid or redundant. So basically I think at least a little bit more before I say something when I am with my cousin in comparison to when I am with my friends, and my friends are all guys from the age of 14 to 19.

My only other cousin is 14, and she's told me she doesn't want me to hurt myself, but I'm sure she just says that because it maybe was something she learned in school, or something from my aunt. I don't think she'd be traumatised either if I died.

TL;DR In what way would it be selfish if I [17M] ended it by lying on my cousin's [20F] bed, when it's her birthday?",09Jan2020,1

We shared our dark secrets . I was so happy as i never had such a friend.  We were close for around 6 months , we did almost everything (sharing , hanging out,etc)i was also her bestf , she introduced me to her family but after 6 months she changed her behavior towards me, i asked her why she is avoiding me . She told me that she will not talk to me if i dont talk to her first. I was so heartbroken. I find S's bestfriend cause of it. Her bestfriend used to hate/dislike me . Since girls can manipulate each other easily , i thought she filled S's ear against me.  its been a month since she stopped me texting/talking. I dont want to lose such a friend . What to do?

Every relationship I've been in, I have been really jealous and paranoid, totally convinced that my partner was cheating on me. Half of the times they were but that could well have been as a result of my paranoia. I know its not right to be this way and I find it so hard to explain why I am. It's not something I feel I have control over, its not a conscious action that I purposely do and I feel completely hopeless in combatting it and ashamed that I get like that. I get utterly convinced that I'm being cheated on and pester my partner about it, constantly needing reassurance but its never enough.

510,"Currently, I'm a 19 yo studying first year of a degree in management; I tell everybody that asks that It's really nice and I like it a lot, but I don't see myself working in the type of job this will lead me to. I've always been very creative, or at least I like to think so, and I have dreamed for a long time with being some day a screenplay writer, a filmmaker and a comedian (a bit ridiculous, I know). However, I don't have the courage to pursue those dreams, in part due to a fear of what my family would think, for more than one reason. I see other people that have made the choice of dropping out, and pursuing what they really want, but realisticly I don't think I have what it takes; besides, I think it would severely damage my relationship with my already mentioned family, as I'd most likely become an embarrassment for them. I personally don't think that having a formal education is equal to being an intelligent person, and I feel this system is frankly not made for me (this may sound arrogant, sorry for that). Anyway, I'm very conflicted about this I would thank any kind of response or interest shown, even though I can see how many of you may think (and I agree with you) that this is not worth the effort, as there is people in this sub that need more help and support than me (please don't take this as an attempt of victimise myself, It's not).

After a couple of days of her breaking up with him, we started having some fun. All this continued from August all the way to October. One day, just like that she ghosted me and disappeared completely. Fast forward a month later she sends me a message and tells me that she misses me and wants to work things out. I accepted and so it continued. During November things were rough and I felt that we were not ready at all. We got into a big fight and we didn’t speak for a week. That part was completely my fault. After I apologised we decided to be just friends as we agreed we were not ready for this. Three days later I go out with my friends. The morning she tells me, we’re done talking for today, my nose is stuffed and I can’t live like this to which I accepted. Some hours later I go out with my friends and I upload an Instagram story to which she replied if was still there so she can come and see me. I said I would leave in a bit and so i did. We kept talking for about two hours, and, she sent me a meme, I sent one as well and out of the blue she says the following: “mood swings, have fun, we’ll talk” and proceeds to block me without a reason in the world.

516,"This is quite a long one so I do apologise, it’s the first time I’ve ever spoken about it to anyone.

Bit of backstory first. 

My mum means the world to me. She is genuinely one of the smartest people I have ever met, kind, compassionate and selfless. She made her career out of years of hard work where others have just married into wealth and I would be lying to say she isn’t one of my idols. 
In contrast, I’ve never been very close to my Dad. He has a very cold front and is awkward, reserved and patronising at times. He has very little insight into my life outside of the house nor has ever really enquired about such and has very few friends (or so I thought...).

A while back I setup Facebook for my Dad (boomer) and his business to help gain some clients and a couple years ago I decided to check into it as I still has the password for some reason or another. In his messages it was clear he had been sexting/sending explicit images behind my mum’s back for a while. He has always been very protective of his phone and always keeps it on him which I had thought was odd but now understood why.

I wrote it off to him making a mistake and tried to forget about it however I few months passed and he was becoming ever-more distant from the family in evenings often taking himself away to their bedroom or another room. As he’s not very tech savvy I guessed his iPad password (birthday) and felt my whole world drop.

My parents have been married for 20years (since I was born) and on Dad’s camera roll were pictures no Son would ever wish to see of their father. He was trading pictures with other women and sometimes married men alongside being part of groups on Kik and other anonymous chat sites. I, against my strongest will, delve into his camera roll further to find screenshots of messages where women have thanked him for s*x and even found messages of him arranging times to have s*x at my own F*CKING HOUSE. Like for real this woman sent a picture of our front door to him saying “I’m knocking where are you”...I am enraged, distraught and helpless in the fact that the future of my family rests with me.

I am the only one who knows about it and it has been a burden on my shoulders for 2 years now. I know my mum and dad aren’t happy but my she truly deserves the f*cking world not this absolute joke of an excuse for a husband. If it was just myself, dad and mum I probably would’ve confronted him about it by now but I have a younger sister who’s previously suffered with anxiety and stress disorders and I could only imagine it tipping her over the edge if the family broke up.

What my dad did is unforgivable and our so-called father-son relationship is irreparable however he still has really good relations with my sister and is still civil with mum.

I really have no clue about how to approach it. My dad is a piece of sh*t who doesn’t deserve my mum yet if they got divorced we’d likely lose the house mum has worked her entire life for. I feel like I am keeping the family together and being the man of the house but it’s so trying at times and I’ve just got to the point where I don’t know what I can do anymore.",09Jan2020,1

523,"
Ok I’ll start by providing some background. I’ve been friends with my friend since we were very young, and we grew up together. He’s always been supportive of everything I do.

We used to hang out with each other but the last time we hung out was this last summer.

He’s been texting me nice messages almost everyday since the summer just to check in with me and see how I’m doing.

After I hung out with him in the summer I eloped with my husband and when I told him he was surprised but happy.

We used to hang out but he doesn’t ask me anymore. When I try to ask him he beats around the question.

He still texts me though. He has texted me almost every day for the last few months so I think he still cares about me but doesn’t want to see me in person for some reason.

This has been happening ever since I told him that I eloped with my husband. He’s been acting this way ever since I got married.

He was good hanging out with me before I was married though but now he’s acting different and I don’t understand.

What might be causing him to act this way? I think it’s about my marriage but I’m not sure why that would make him act this way.",09Jan2020,1
524,"This is going to come off weird, but I need everyone to read fully through before giving an answer. 

My cat passed away 2 days ago. It was quite traumatic for me and everything happened so quickly. He'd been my world for the last 17.5 years and in about a half an hour things went from normal to everything having changed. I was, and am still, quite devastated over the loss. I haven't been able to sleep normally since it's happened and I still feel kinda shocked. I've got another cat as well, and she has helped me cope to an extent but I miss having a cat of my own (the other cat is more bonded with my sister than myself). 

Yesterday was an interesting day. I swear i'm not much for impulsivity and I swore I wouldn't get a cat for a few months at the earliest and just wait to see what happens. And yesterday a cat popped up that needed rehoming. Now, she/he (unknown gender) is tiny. 8 weeks old. And I said that I would be happy to be a home for her. So i picked up a bunch of stuff for the kitten and picked it up. But I have this over whelming sense of guilt that I made the wrong decision. That I shouldn't have. That I might do wrong by the new cat and I won't give it the best life it could get. And i'm at a point where im unsure if I should rehome her again or if this is just part of the grieving process. 

I have support from (most) friends and family regarding the issue but I can't get out of my mind on this and I can't find many, if any, info on this. I don't know what to do. I have some that are like ""wow so soon"" and they think i'm reliving my cat which no one and nothing will ever be able to do, but i have others that say redirecting the love I had for my cat may help.

530," Hey everyone, I hope this post fits here because I could really use some advice. I apologize in advance for the long post, but I feel like the context is necessary. 

I graduated college at 21 with a degree in journalism because I wanted to be a lawyer. In my senior year, I realized I didn't want to be a lawyer. I talked to advisors about switching my major to computer science since I found I enjoy programming and it is a good field. At this point, I still had enough Pell grant money to cover at least 2 years of school. My parents pressured me to graduate swearing any degree would be a good degree. Nine years later, I have learned, after several jobs in the field, that I'm not the kind of person who can succeed in journalism. I'm still stuck working dead-end jobs, with some occasional web-dev work, but not enough of a profile to get a real job in the field. I'm still living in a small town in Tenneesse that I hate. I applied for a job at a local university where I will get free tuition to pursure that CS degree. 

That being said, I talked to my mother last night, which triggered a major attack of my depression(which I'm being treated for) who told me I should move out of my apartment with my friend and move back in with them while going to school and honestly the thought of that makes me want to cry. I love my parents and they're not bad people, but my mother is, honestly controlling and smothering and has never really accepted that I'm not striaght. Beyond that, I really feel like her and my dad's advice is geared for a world that's been dead for 40 years.

After talking to my mom, I spoke to my best friend and sometimes lover(we aren't currently dating, but we both love each other) who got so angry with my mother that he almost called her and chewed her out. That's when I discussed the idea of moving away from Tennessee. I lived in Brooklyn for a year and loved it, but my apartment caught fire. I can't afford to go back to NYC right now, but there are other places I'd love to see. I mentioned the idea of just moving away from here, me, him, and another close friend. We talked about working here for another few months or even a year, saving as much money as we could, maybe taking a few courses if I get that uni job, then moving to a place that would take a down payment as my credit isn't great(he found several nice ones) and me taking out loans to go to school in OR(after obtaining in-state residency) or possibly just doing a coding bootcamp to get into the tech industry. 

So, I guess what I could just really use some general advice about my situation. Is my idea of moving and going to school somewhere else feasible? I know my parents will tell me I'm throwing my future away and taking unnecessary risks and maybe their right, but, to be blunt, I already feel like my life is being wasted here. Again, any advice on this situation would be great. Thank you all.",09Jan2020,1
531,"Hi all, I’m desperate for some guidance as I just don’t know what to do.

I’ve (37f) worked the same part time kitchen job for years, it pays fairly well for what I do and fits in around the family (meaning I mostly work evenings and weekends)
Thing is I’m sick to death of working there, and now the children are all at school I hate spending the days home alone doing chores then heading out to work just as everyone comes home to relax. 
Problem is I have no qualifications as I’ve been at my current place so long, and I don’t drive so I’m  limited in my job search area, and on top of that as my so’s job is pretty low paid I can’t take a huge cut in pay (which I would if I go elsewhere) without doing more hours, which I don’t mind, but then that means paying out lots in childcare and the mum guilt of missing assemblies etc at school.
My husband says just wait and keep looking but I’ve been doing that for over a year and nothing ideal has come up. So should I just suck it up and carry on in a place I hate, working hours I hate as the money is ok and I’m around for the children and the house, or do I get anything that’s going that means I’m working more but not working evenings and weekends?

535,"Hi r/advice. I have always been creeped out by my downstairs neighbor, but a few weeks ago it escalated to sheer terror. I live in an apartment complex, and I usually keep to myself.  When I first moved here, I was still finishing up my bachelor’s.  I’m in my early 20’s, and this guy is in his 60’s. Upon first meeting, he asks what I study and informs me that he used to be a professor in the subject and suggests that if I need any help, I come down to visit him- that is, if my “boyfriend” wouldn’t  mind. I politely refused, and he said “maybe some of your more desperate, young friends would be willing to accept the offer.” I later looked him up and found no record of him being a professor in x subject. 

I started to notice that he was more than a creep; I  realized that he has severe anger issues. Over the past two years I’ve heard him shouting from the top of his lungs so loud that I can hear it upstairs, and I once even woke up to him shouting at another neighbor outside, childishly demanding that they not “look at him”... It goes on- he once told me that he wished we could “wipe away *insert racial slur for Japanese people*”  over an unassigned parking spot that one of our obviously Chinese, not Japanese, neighbors had rightfully parked in— it operates on a first come first serve basis. Seeing and hearing all his outbursts, it should not have surprised me that I would eventually be a target, but I managed to avoid it for 2 years up until now. There was a leak in his apartment that was happening every time I showered, and it was soaking him. I obviously was not aware of this, as I cannot see into his apartment. We have an on-site maintenance staff that you can report these matters to. But no, he belligerently came up to my apartment, pounded on the door to scream in my face. He made me feel threatened, and he said “This is the LAST time this happens,” as if he was going to do something. It was so loud that other neighbors stuck their heads out to see what was happening. As someone who really tries to stay quiet and keep to myself, this was absolutely humiliating.  This happened 2-3 weeks ago. Ever since, I have felt really scared and unsafe. I’m a single young woman, and I live alone. The other day I parked my car in what he perceives to be his parking spot, so I could tote all my groceries in. He was cleaning his apartment and threw a plank of wood out in his yard, right in front of my car, almost hitting it. I did not know if this was intentional or if I’m just worried. Last night I heard him downstairs shouting over something and the fear continued. I did not know if it was about me or someone else. 

 Where should I go from here? I’m thinking about calling the apartment office today and filing a complaint, but I fear sounding like a drama queen or an instigator.  I don’t know if there is anything else I can do to feel safe other than installing security, but that doesn’t stop the fear of him standing on my porch banging on my door screaming. I would usually handle issues on my own, but I am so afraid of him that I need some other form of intervention.",09Jan2020,1

* I don't have the uniform , because I'm pretty new 
* I never went to a funeral in my life and I don't know how to behave myself
* I'm affraid that I can't handle it

from the other side if I don't go I'm affraid that I'll be judged by other people for not going and I don't know what excuse to use for not going (what to reply to my friend's message and what to say afrewards when people ask.)

Sholud I go or should I stay home? 

If I should go what how to dress and how do I behave myself there (I'm clueless)

If I don't go what do I reply to my firend and what excuse do I use. Should I just tell people that I wasn't comfortable going?

542,"I have two very close friends and we used to hang out a lot. Now that both of them are in a relationship, they still invite me to hang out but they keep on cuddling and kissing on front of me if not, they will leave me for a while and make out. One time three of us sat on a sofa, my boy close friend put a pillow on his lap and his gf put her hand beneath it. At first I thought she was touching his thighs (they do that a lot) but then they said ""Aw it's gone I'm so sad"" ""Yeah it's gone"" so it made me think she was actually touching his hard dick and I noticed her arm was already deep within the pillow.

It makes me uncomfortable and I already opened up this topic to them (except for the pillow part) they simply said ""Get used to it, it's what couples do."" Do I stop hanging out with them?",09Jan2020,1

But then I when I realized I was rushing my tree not actually taking time to learn so I reset my tree. And only moved off a lesson once I ""Golded"" (its like a ""A"" on a test I guess)it so after while I'm still enjoying it and my family go over to my grandparents since we haven't seen them in a long time and I told them I was learning German.

When I told them I didn't hear a word. Then later I hear my grandma whisper in my mom's ear (My is and was supporting me) ""To get him off of this stupid~~~""(I don't really remember what she said) and now it hard for me to do it I stopped doing it daily.

550,"My grandmother passed away 3 months ago and my parents paid out of pocket for the funeral. Since my entitled aunt pocketed my grandmas life insurance money. My grandma didn’t know English so trusted EA to help her out. The LI was for funeral expenses then split between the 3 siblings. EA refuses to pitch in anything, EU also refused. To give my grandma a headstone so that when I come to visit her I can see her picture and talk to her like I used to. I decided to save up to buy it, the last thing I could actually do for her. Honestly I’m glad she’s not here to see what’s been happening. There was this one time my EA brought up that my grandma should be put in a nursing center. It broke her heart so much all I saw were tears and disappointment...it hurt me to see her like that so I hated my EA with a passion. She knew grandma was scared of new people it gave her anxiety and the worse was when someone brought up nursing homes. My sweet grandma always told me that place is just a place for old people to die. She watched a lot of news and sometimes there’d be a coverage on elderly abuse it made her even more terrified. So hearing  EA say that it broke her heart. If she was here she’d probably be bawling her eyes out...I miss her so much. She raised me and was the only person who protected me from my EU and SBSD&lt;scum bag X step dad&gt; when they’d verbally attack me or make me kneel down for an hour with my bookbag above my head for coming home too late...1hr walking ...due to staying after class to ask teacher to help explain some stuff. She’s take out the broom and say 

“If you want someone to pick on them do it to this Old Lady!!!” 

“Your both grown men picking on a kid for what?! one not being your child” 

EU “She’s your treasure right! No one can even scold her for anything!” 

&lt;don’t know why EU used to hate my guts&gt; 

Now all that’s left is the memories, I been writing them down so if times passes I can share them with my kids. She’s given me so much so that I can never repay her. For everything she’s done for me. The last thing I can do for her is save up to get her a headstone since EA/EU doesn’t want to pitch in. Maybe it’s more for me since I can come to see her and sit next to her and tell her how my day went like we used to do....how do people deal with grief? How can I stop the empty feeling that randomly hits.

558,"So I lost my virginity yesterday. It wasn't all rainbows and sunshine. It hurt a bit at first but then it felt good. I don't really think of it as wow that was amazing because...it was just normal.

It was just a guy I met on tinder who came over my house once and then I went to his house yesterday. 

What worries me is that a few hours afterwards, noticed some swelling on 'that area'. It was inflamed and when I touched it, it started to itch a bit. However, today I've noticed that the swelling has gone down a bit so I'm hoping that'll continue.

We did use a condom but he rubbed on the outside without one (he didn't ejaculate yet) but I'm worried that I couldve had a chance for an STD/STI despise this (I also gave him a bj). And also that I couldve gotten pregnant (precum?).

I'm planning on taking a pregnancy and std test when I go back to college in two weeks (because of parents.

Furthermore, I dont know what I should feel regarding that encounter. When I showered today I felt dirty and unpure. Was it because I lost my virginity? Was it because I let this guy that I've only known for about a week touch me like that? I'm just not sure about all this. Part of me kinda regrets it because my family was saying not to have sex or anything like that but I ignored them because I'm not religious and they wanted me to wait until marriage.

First i'll explain the context, i'm an 18 years old and I left my country to go to college. When I left, my father gave me 60 euros and told me to gamble for him twice a week since gambling doesn't exist in the country I used to live in.

But now i'm concerned about him, I know it's his money and he can do whatever he wants with it and everybody in my family tells me it's his guilty pleasure and once the money is finished he'll stop but i'm still worried. (Also my dad has been gambling for years everytime he comes to the country i'm studying in)

I tried to tell him that instead of putting all this money on a game where he has absolutely no chance of winning, he could try and put it aside to be rich someday but ofc, he won't listen. My dad is a very stubborn person and never has he ever listened to me, to him I don't have the ability to debate since i'm not a ""grown up"" like him and I can't understand what it's like.

My best friend and house mate just opened up to me this morning letting me know that he has been severely depressed lately and has been contemplating suicide. We share a house with my wife and almost 2 year old son. He works for the Union and is gone most of the year, home for a few months each winter. He just found out he may not have work until April so he's worried about money. Also he has some pretty unfortunate family circumstances that leave him stretched pretty thin. 

This guy is one of the nicest dudes I've ever met. He has helped me and my wife out so much in the last few years. He is kind, honest, hard working and generous. Normally he tends to be the life of the party. He always helps anyone he can and puts others before himself. Lately he has become a hermit, sleeping a lot, only coming out when its necessary. We have tried to institute a family night a few times a week but he hasn't seemed interested which is disappointing because my wife and I love hanging out with him. 

Anyway, to keep this semi short, I want to help him in any way possible but I don't want to come at him with a plan and overwhelm him. He has been in a similar spot before but I don't think it was this bad and I have a feeling a few family members made getting help though for him. I haven't really dealt with anything like this before but this guy means the world to both me and my wife so we want to do whatever we can to be there and help him. So far I'm the only one he's talked to, he plans on filling my wife in this afternoon.

First, let me give some background. 

There’s been some history of depression and mental illness in my family so I’ve been able to see the signs in people sometimes. 

I’m starting to see the same signs in my sister. She’s starting to have panic attacks and really negative thoughts. I really want to help her out and make her feel better again but I don’t know how. I just choke and froze when it happens and I hate myself for now supporting her at the moment. 

Although, I have noticed that my mom’s presence is really not helping with my sister’s mental health at the moment. It feels like she’s making it worst for her (my sister). I was scared to say anything to my mom because it might hurt her feelings instead. But I finally did and told her (my mom) to cool it down a little with the ‘advice’. Tried to do it as diplomatically as possible. Hopefully it’ll turn out for the best.

Anyways, any advice on what to do? I don’t think my sister is realising she’s going through the same thing depressed people are having. Or she’s just denying what’s happening.  I’m still considered immature in my family’s view so any help I can give wouldn’t really be acknowledged. 

I’ve told her about a hotline to talk to when you feel really alone ( I’ve used it myself a few times ) . But my sister didn’t take it seriously. I really think seeking professional help would be good for her but she doesn’t want to get any help from others. I just made her this honey lemon drink to soothe her throat from all the crying but I don’t think it’s enough. The only thing I do is listen but I can’t say anything to make her feel better. 

Me and my sister aren’t really buddy buddy or anything but it hurts to see her like this. Any advice is deeply appreciated. I’m sorry if I’m rambling too much.",09Jan2020,1

I believe the last part that he does it out of the kindness of his heart but at the same time that doesn’t make it okay to disrespect me and say whatever he wants to me. Is disrespect justified by age or family.

580,"I am living with my SO and we had a cat. Due to some stress (we have a long stressful time coming when we won't be able to stay much at home and this can be felt even now) the cat started misbehaving alot. We knew it was before of the stressful mood around the house. We gave him up a few days ago and we're so sorry as we were totally in love with that cat. The new owner is awesome and the cat is a bit confused but overall seems calmer. It seems overall a good decision. 

Yet we can't take our thought from him. I can't cope with the empty house. I can't stop crying and feeling dead. I don't know what to do to accept that he's no longer in my family. I'm happy that he has a good  home yet I miss him so much...

Please give me sims advice, what should I do? I don't want to forget him, I just want to accept his leaving and stop being so sad (I just recently started feeling better from a long depression and I feel like I'm falling back, I don't want to, I'm scared and feel lost).",09Jan2020,1
582,"Ok so this is new territory for me. I (33m) spend almost everyday I possibly can with my gf (34f) of 9 months (today is 9 months). She has a daughter (4) from her previous marriage who I adore and we get along really well. Tomorrow her former stepdaughter (18) is picking up the daughter and my gf is asking me to not come over because she’s worried about how her former stepdaughter will react if I’m there even though our relationship is on the social bullshit. Personally I don’t mind meeting the stepdaughter but it makes me feel that she’s putting our relationship behind her former relationship with the stepdaughter because she’s “sensitive”. I wouldn’t reach out for advice on Reddit but my therapist isn’t available for this conversation. Also, should I be sensitive to this girls feelings? What if this is something she tries to pull every time? I don’t know her or anything about her. It’s not my fault my gf left her relationship. It’s not the stepdaughters fault either. I’m just confused on how I should feel about this since I plan on being around for quite awhile. My gf says there could be a better time to meet her but I can’t think of a better time. What would even make it a better time? We’ve talked about moving in together after summer so what happens then in situations like this when it’s our house and not just hers? I can’t cater to her former family stuff when we’re trying to build our relationship. Or how much should I cater? My thoughts are that the stepdaughter should be grateful that her little sister and former stepmother are in a good place and that i care about both of them very much but what the hell do i know?

583,"Hey everyone. My brother has had anger issues since we were younger and it even shows when he was a toddler. It was the worst his pre-teen years, and I hate to say it but he did abuse me which can be played off as an older brother just beating up his annoying sibling, but the intensity was more than that. He got help and went to a young persons group. The group really did help him because from what I saw he improved a lot. There was one incident when we were teenagers and he destroyed my stuff and didn’t talk to me for weeks. I think he believed I was in the wrong, but I really don’t know what he thought. He bought new stuff for what he destroyed but he never explicitly said he knows he was wrong. (I have never fought him back given the circumstances). Since then he hasn’t really shown any signs of anger, that was YEARS ago (I’m 21, he’s 24). 


Lately I’ve been noticing it’s coming back. The impatience, the overreacting. He won’t physically harm me and he doesn’t yell but still he is very cold. He was explaining something to me, I asked a question and he wasn’t having that at all and immediately got mad at me and walked away. Every single time we’re having a conversation he gets mad at me for asking a question or cutting off his sentence. I was on speaker phone with my dad, my brother in the room with me and my brother had to go pick him up and he was acting like it was such an inconvenience when it’s not ... so I say it’s not a big deal and just do it and he says “whatever, whatever bye”. 


Long story short it doesn’t feel like he understands how communication works. Even if we’re talking when I get home from work he gets very annoyed at me for asking about his day. I feel like he doesn’t necessarily care. His career seems more important, but the thing is, for his profession he can’t be so overreactive. 

I feel like if I disagree with him in the slightest or ask a question he’ll do what he always does and end the conversation. I really do think there’s something wrong with him and he needs therapy or something but I don’t even know how to go about that. I just don’t understand where all this anger and impatience comes from when he was doing so good.",09Jan2020,1

She recently decided to move out due to the stress, however on returning to the house to collect her stuff, her room had been slept in, her room stank of weed and a set of candles that her little sister bought her for christmas have been thrown on the floor, ontop of damages that the landlord are demanding they both pay.

I've spoke to this guy in the past and told him to stop acting like a dick.

This is the last straw for me, she called me crying today about the situation and said she feels so disrespected and embarassed.

To the bottom of my heart i want to hurt this man, of course, i have no plan to but the feeling is there. Her parents have suggested simply speaking to the landlord and arranging a meeting to sort out the issue, but for me, this guy just cant get away with a slap on the wrist this time.

588," I don't want any unrealistic answers, just the hard truth... These are things that have been going through my mind for a long time now...

How do I start conversations? - I recently gained enough confidence to text a girl for the first time, who I have wanted to text for a while now. We have had short conversations just getting to know each other but I'm running out of conversation topics. After the ""get to know"" phase I just become lost and I don't know what to say anymore. How do people find it so easy to talk to others while I'm just struggling?

How do I hold a conversation and keep it interesting? - This is also a problem because often times I'm only able to talk about something for a short amount of time. Even when I talk I kind of feel like people just get bored but I never know if they really are. When I compare myself to my friends they are able to start a conversation out of thin air and keep a conversation going while keeping others interested. This is not really the case for me.

Am I boring because I'm kind? - So I mentioned that I recently texted a girl for the first time and I have some insecurities. For one thing I dont have the confidence to make jokes or tease girls like my friends do. That's why I find it so hard to make a girl laugh. I just never know what to do or say. My mind is just blank. Girls often time call me super nice but not much else. Is this just a euphemism for boring?  How can I be funny and is it actually necessary?

I know these things don't seem like they're of any importance but these things have been constantly going through my mind and destroying my confidence for some reason.",09Jan2020,1
589,"I (19F) live with my parents. My dad(53M) has been physically, verbally, financially, and emotionally abusive to me and my mother since I was a child. However, my mother then became the breadwinner of the family and the dynamics changed somewhat. He is polite and courteous to her WAY more often now but continues to treat me like absolute rubbish still. My mother and I have been close since I was very young (partly because I only felt safe with her) and from the very beginning, has been saying that when I turn a certain age (I’m saying “certain” because the number would go up as I became older. It started from 16, went to 18, now it’s “when you get married”) that she would leave my dad and take me with her and go. But it never materialized and she does everything he wants her to. He demands for SO much money and she always complied and even though it’s obvious to everyone that I’m miserable because of him, she does not do anything but blame me for upsetting him and orders me to take whatever he throws at me. I have come to terms with the fact that she won’t leave him even though she complains about him to me every single day. She has always refused to let me seek therapy, and showcases a completely different scenario to the world. People don’t know that she indulges him in his manchild ways. She often calls me ugly now (she never used to) when anyone says I’m pretty and it screams of insecurity. I’m slowly losing respect for my lifelong best friend, even though she takes care of all my financial matters and it might be disrespectful to think so.

596,"Hi there, I'm 28 years old in the US. I used to care about how I looked a couple years ago, but ran into some big life changes that severely impacted my self esteem and mental health including sexual harassment and some mean people. I've been pretty unintentional concerning my appearance - not going to the salon ever (always a tight bun), buying the cheapest clothes possible even if they don't fit right or have holes, sweat pants and flannels, rarely wearing makeup.

I'm at a place now where I'm starting to care more about being put together again. I've bought some actual cute clothes, natural makeup, and am making more of an effort with grooming in general. However I've been getting some negative feedback...

Some friends and acquaintances have commented about how now that I'm married the way I'm presenting is inappropriate. Some say that I'm not supposed to be ""advertising"" anymore so I need to keep it low key. I was even called a thot, and someone asked if I was missing something in my marriage among other things, and I can feel the weird looks I'm getting. A gaggle of strangers (men) saw me and gave me the up down, at which point another friend said ""see that's what I'm talking about"". 

It's winter where I am, and I am always fully covered. I have had minimal skin showing, long sleeve dresses or sweater with skirt and my hem is never shorter than mid thigh, and I'm always in tights or leggings. I don't wear heels and the most intense makeup I've done is a red lip or fancy eyebrows. Also I feel like I should mention I don't ""make eyes"" at people if that makes sense.

I can't figure out what is the right thing here. My husband loves me no matter what, and he doesn't think I'm being skanky. But I don't want to seem a certain way to people because they can get the wrong idea. What is going on? What's appropriate? 

Tl:Dr; I used to not put any effort at all into my appearance, and now that I am people are assuming that I'm trying to flaunt my stuff for men or that putting too much effort into my looks means my marriage isn't doing well or is inappropriate. What is appropriate here?",09Jan2020,1

601,"I just recently started a job (two weeks ago) at a new company and it’s by far my favorite one I’ve had. My aunt is an executive at the company and using her as a reference helped in getting my initial interview.

To congratulate me on getting the job, my aunt (who I’ll call Lisa for the sake of this post) gave me some shirts she got from marketing and some of her old ones as we wore the same size and the shirts were more or less unisex.

For context, the shirts typically have to be purchased AFTER you complete training from the “swag shop” and the one I really like is one usually only given to senior managers. I want to wear that one today as it’s a very nice dressy shirt but I’m concerned if it raises an ethical issue.

My company is VERY focused on ethics and we spent a whole day on family and dating relationships, and how we can’t attempt to use those for any type of advantage. Now, I know a shirt isn’t an advantage but everyone knows I’m Lisa’s nephew so I don’t know if it’s a bad look to my peers and trainers if I pull up in a shirt that nobody else has access to yet (people have been talking a lot about wanting one), especially one for people above all of our positions.

On the flipside though, people who ask about the shirts are always praised and it’s mentioned how it’s always okay to rep company gear but idk if that applies to me yet 

Essentially, am I just overthinking or should I avoid wearing that into work?

I really don't know what's the best way to budget and set time aside to plan a good trip. Do I set the time away from work first? How much time? or does that depend on flight availability? do I set an amount before all that? Is it all driven by lodging first?

What percentage of my trip should be spent on food? on transportation and lodging? Again, I am ashamed but I am really lost on those things, but at the same time, I am sick and tired of postponing a good time for me and my family, which we deserve, just because of my lack of experience.

I asked him yesterday to keep the gun unloaded while in the home, he responded by telling me he understands how serious this is and won’t mess around.

We live in a bad side of town and he frequently talks about how bad it is but then leaves me in the house sleeping with our front door literally open almost daily, he doesn’t lock it and depending on how hard he closes the door it swooshes open because it doesn’t latch, among leaving the back door unlocked very frequently from letting our dog out at night and sometimes the patio when he lets him out that way. He’s literally leaving the gun out for anyone who wanted to walk into our house along with all the ammunition he just bought. He’s someone who shuts me down when I bring things up twice.

The day before last I informed them that I would be traveling 2 hrs to visit my friend, this was at 8pm. (I told my mom I was going to go the next day but decided to leave that night instead.) They insisted that I stay because they don’t trust my car enough and didn’t want to have to come get me if something happened.

So I unlocked the door and said if I need help from anyone I will call anyone but you and left. My car did not break down, I got here just fine.
I just answered a call from my sister and she told me that a mom was saying she was going to put my car in my name, which I thinks means they are planning on cutting me off and not paying my insurance.

But at that moment, I felt that something was wrong, because he was holding a pair of scissors on his hand and was shaking a bit. I saw scars on his arm, and I started to get scared.

Today, he was still shaking with the scissors on his hand, but I waited a little and went to talk to my friends of something to relax myself. Then, I looked at him: blood over his arm, with the scissors on his hand and the cuts in his skin.

One of my friends and I went to help him, if he wanted to tell a teacher, call his parents to go home, but he didn't want to do anything. He told us that everything is okay and to not to worry, and that he is currently going to a psychiatrist.

I don't know what to do, I need some tips to help him please.",09Jan2020,1

So I've been friends with this guy since grade 5 and yeah i sleep over at his house every now and then but the problem is cringey but im not sure if its ok... my heart says yes but my mind says it wont right. Ive been through one or two relationships and I've learnt enough to know that im not very outgoing. But I've kinda fallen for his sister. But she's 16 and i live around 40 km away (over a mountain) and i dont know what do do. And my friend is going to boarding school for highschool from this year on so i don't know when i could see her (if it even happens) and im like family to their family and i dont even think that her dad approves of dating, much less of dating a child younger than her. But she gave me hugs and stuff when i help her out when im at my friends house
In my eyes she's almost perfect. 
She watches GoT, and TWD.
She's beautiful.
Sweet.
Kind. 
Loves videogames.
Has my sense of humor.
She isnt shallow or rude and is always nuce to me.
And she stays up till 3 am with me playing games and watching movies when my friend goes to bed. And i don't want to ruin my friendship with my friend or his sister. And my friend leaves for school this Sunday
What do i do. Ive never really been scared in a relationship (or just a crush) but damn. Im scared. Please give me some advice I've been feeling terrible the past few days.",09Jan2020,1

631,"Hi, I need some advice.  


I'm 20, my girlfriend is 19. We've been together for a year. Things have been really toxic and its been my fault.  


I have a bad history of being lied to, abandoned, and mistreated in my past relationships with other significant others and my family members. As a result, I've developed severe trust issues that really affect my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, I am distrustful of everything anyone does and I find myself overthinking everything anyone does. And as a result, I find myself pushing this onto my girlfriend in comments, or not being okay with certain things.

There are other things that feed into this such as her having very sexual friends that like to sexualize her which makes me incredibly uncomfortable, her having a majority of guy friends, and her poor choice of words in an argument. Little things stick with me for months.  


A little insight on a past issue that sticks with me as an example; I needed reassurance and she was telling me she was for me, that she wanted me. She told me if she wanted to, she could have slept with anyone of her guy friends but didn't. I know this was her way of saying ""I don't want them, I want you."" but this bothered me for months to come.  


Fast forward to now, we have had many arguments because of my trust issues, my comments, and my negativity. As a result, she has also begun being very toxic in arguments and it's my fault.  


I made a nasty comment, she got upset, yelled at me, I told her I was sorry, and I impulsively did it again a few hours later. I screwed up, I made a mistake and I have no excuses for it.

&amp;#x200B;

But now she told me she hates me. She resents me. She doesn't want me or anything to do with me anymore. I told her I could fix it and she said ""Fine, whatever.""

I can fix it. I'm going to therapy, I'm going to get better with my issues and I'm going to work on communication. For myself, for her? I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

But she told me this; ""I'm only here because you won't leave me alone."" She said she hates me, that she resents me. She has said terrible things out of anger so I believed it to be that. I just asked her on a serious note, and she said she meant every word of it and she's still here.   


I love her, I'm tired of hurting her, I care about her, I just want to be able to express it.

&amp;#x200B;

But she hates me now, and she meant it. She doesn't leave. I need to be the one to do it otherwise I'm just tagging along.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do and I just need advice.",09Jan2020,1
632,"So, I met this guy, lets call him T, around 6 months ago, through our  friends, and we ve been together for 5 months already. Thing is, he's kind of a loner, he s 29 and his  only serious relationship was with this girl from his hometown, for almost two years. He used to drive 5 hours to almost every weekend to see her. So yeah, most of the time, he was alone. After they broke up, he didnt date anyone for almost 3 years. Im 21, my most serious relationship was with this guy (for 1 and a half year or smth) who lived 15 mins away from my house. We used to meet almost every day for a couple of hours at least, sometimes I would sleep over. We broke up and then for 3 years, even if I dated 3 people for a very short time, I never cared for someone that much until I met T. So now, my problem is the fact that he is very confused. T likes his space because he got used to being a loner and not dating and going out just for work and meeting his friends. We meet almost once or twice a week, I sleep over at his place usually, but sometimes when I want to come over or just go out with him, he tells me that he wants some time alone. Eventually, I asked him if it is because of me, and he told me that ""no, its just, im not used to this"". I must admit, it kinda scares me. Like, he tells me he likes me and cares about me but he likes his space too because this is how he s been living since he moved into our town. And I dont know  how am I supposed to act, because I m 100 % I want to be with him and see how everything turns out, and I feel like he does too in a way, but I just dont know how much space I should offer him or what am I supposed to do.

633,"So I broke up with this girl (yellow) back early last year, and while it was a messy break up we’ve still tried to remain friends. However, during the time since then her memes over Instagram have becoming increasingly insulting. The most recents ones are calling me a baby, and in the uno meme formate “admit you’re wrong or draw 25 cards” with a “U” attached. Now I understand these can be a sort of humour, but I have communicated to her I don’t appreciate these types. 

Yellows ride or die best friend, blue, was also friends with me during the early year, and adopted a similar humour towards me (however in person and to My face) often insulting my skills and abilities, until our friendship finally ended when blue called me a problem and insisted it was a joke (we aren’t friends anything more thankfully, but blue and yellow are still ride or die). Now, I went to yellow about this many times, often crying alone with her. After a particular mental break down over the “problem” joke (this was after weeks of “humour”) I spoke my concerns to yellow, in which she said  I had to “adjust to blues humour” and that when I insisted I tell blue I didn’t like her jokes I “shouldn’t tell blue cause you’ll make her upset”.

Thus, I don’t believe me telling yellow I don’t like her insulting humour (even if they are jokes) will change her behaviour, and might make it worse. 

Advice would be greatly appreciated, as yellows “jokes” are continuing to poison our carefully built friendship further. Thank you for taking the time to read this (and sorry I’m on mobile!)",09Jan2020,1
634,"Post title explains it. Nothing wrong with getting home from work and going on Facebook to kill time. I obviously could not care less about her having social media or using it - who doesn't?? 
But all she does in her free time is scroll through Facebook and Instagram, reading absolute nonsense constantly. Just total drivel - stories about inane rubbish, relationship posts, makeup videos, other people's opinions on issues which she doesn't even hold her own opinion.

Don't get me wrong, I catch myself getting lost in it too every now and then, but I've recognized how much of a useless void it is some time ago and I make social media as difficult to access as possible for myself. But I also read incessantly and have other hobbies. My girlfriend doesn't.

When we fight, he gets mad at me and says pretty awful things, like ""Good riddance"" and ""We don't love each other."" I left and after two days he started saying how sorry he was for making me feel unloved, which was the reason I told him I left. Now, I am no angel. I can be mean as hell, too. But I always apologize and try to make up for my shortcomings. He takes forever to do that, if he chooses to. Anyway, I relented after he started saying sorry. I was distraught and told him how depressed I was. As soon as I did that, I got an onslaught of how I was to blame and so on and so forth. He called me later to apologize after I said I don't want to talk to him. I was crying and said I couldn't believe he would tell me he didn't love me. He didn't say a word, just let me cry. I told him then that I didn't want to talk to him. He said, ""Sorry"" then hung up. That destroyed me. Anyway, after a few days of hardly any talking, he's back on it again texting me. I told him I'll get my things in a few days and he says ""it's a shame we can't talk through this process."" And then ""I just need time to figure out what I want."" And I said that's fine.

While worrying about being approved because of my okay-not-perfect credit score, I remembered that when moving out of our last apartment, we left some damage. 

My husbands friend came over to help us move and brought his 8 month old mastiff puppy, which is a huge untrained dog. Our apartment didn’t even allow dogs in the first place, so I was worried because he was staying two nights with us (5 hours away from where he lives). I was very against him bringing the dog but basically nobody listened and he brought it anyway. Long story short we went out one night and the dog panicked and scratched at the door and carpet and pulled up some of the carpet. My husband estimated it was about $200 in damage.

Usually, I treat him on this day - buy him a very nice lunch/dinner, maybe take him somewhere cool, get him a present in the 50 to 150 dollar range. On my birthday, he took me on a weekend trip that was around 400 dollars but he makes more money than me, so we were okay with that.

But this year, I am super broke. Due to several payments that had to be made, I've been living off 150 dollars a month basically. He's been paying for my food, otherwise I wouldn't have had anything to eat. 

Because he knows I am broke as fuck currently, he offered to switch it up - he wants us to have a nice dinner, his treat, and when I asked what to do about presents, he told me not to worry. I'm pretty crafty so I figured I could like, knit him a sweater or something, but it turned out hideous and I do not want to give it to him.

I talked to my mom this morning about getting a job (I’ve been asking her about it for awhile and she always ignored me). Basically she said that there’s no use in getting a job and dealing with that stress and responsibility when I’m young and am cared for. There will be plenty of time for that when I’m older but for now, I’d be missing out on family time. The issue is I feel trapped.

652,"So my best friend and roommate is dating a horrible argentinian guy atm. 

Some background info:
They started out as friends. He always had a crush on her, however she absolutely wasn't interested, which she told him. One drunken horny night they sleep together however, and apparently it was a good hookup, 'cause they continued on. Now she has even managed to convince herself that she might be romantically interested in this guy. (This has happened with all of her previous hookups as well. She's not actually interested, but they're easy dick and then after spending a lot of mornings with them she's like ""yeah idk maybe I kind of like him"".)

Reasons why this guy is terrible:

-He is incredibly immature and irresponsible. This includes:
- He's living and working here in Denmark with no  permits at all. He doesn't have a recidence permit and he doesn't have a work permit.
- This means that obviously it's difficult for him to find proper living conditions and a well payed job.
- This results in him living in an absolute dump and deciding that probably ""the only option he has"" is to starts selling drugs, which he is doing now.
- He recently took her to the movies, where they did shrooms beforehand. She has never done mushrooms before and obviously he was the one who was supposed to take responsibility for their trip together. Not only was he not sober to tripsit, he had given her about 3-4 times as much as she was supposed to have according to her size. This resulted in her having an incredibly bad trip where she actually believed in her paranoia, that she was going to die. He didn't do anything to help her. Just told her he felt fine.
- He managed to give her a yeast infection but doesn't take medicin to cure his own.
- He found out that he probably has a son, as an old hookup recently contacted him, telling him she had just given birth and he is the father. He wants absolutely nothing to do with the kid and hasn't even replied to her. Not even to take a DNA tests. Now, I know that it is a major dick move on her behalf to have the kid without even telling him she was pregnant or asking for his opinion. But he chose to have sex with a single 35-year-old without using contraception. And now he doesn't want to take responsibility for his probably-child.
 

Now - I know that they are both allowed to make their own decisions. And she knows that he is a bad one, but keeps seeing him. (I believe she is mainly attracted to him exactly because she knows he is bad news). 
But... Maybe a lot of things would just be much better, if I tipped the police to let them know of this guy.

What should I do? Am I a terrible person for thinking like this? Or do I have a responsibility as a citizen and friend?",09Jan2020,1
653,"Hope this is the right sub. I think this more related to mental health and well being than dating or relationships hence why I am posting here.


*** This is a long post and I apologize. Need to get it out***

In August 2017 I (M34 now) broke up with my then 5yr+ LTR girlfriend (F36 now). We had been “living” together for yr and a half before that and I say “living” because she spending up to 60% of the time on her mom’s was part of the reason I called things off.

There were other reasons, all of which made a lot of sense at the time and from which I needed a break. She had become hypochondriac, negative and whiny, our sex life was near to non existing albeit her various non-diagnosed deseases, she refused to make plans with me of any kind from planning trips together to buying a house or owning a pet... etc. Overall I felt trapped on a relationship I was getting little of... except that I loved this person. I loved being connected to her and being related to her. I loved her.

We broke things off after she made my mom cry for an unrelated thing (they were arguing about something in the house when my mom was visiting). I stormed into our bedroom and asked her to pack her things and leave. She left that same night with all her things. Obviously I was emotional at the time so it wasn’t honestly something I planned or did well.

It took me about two weeks to realize I wanted to work things out but she refused. She said she felt numb and needed time. I needed time too. My self esteem was on the floor. I had been married and divorced already seven yrs earlier (married very young) and here I was again separated because I couldn’t make things work. I blamed my physique, my lack of masculinity etc so I found confort and guidance on The Red Pill. Honestly it helped. I shifted my focus to lifting and eating healthy, I groomed myself, became positive, started making friends... etc. Spare me of hate... I don’t go with the misogynist portion of TRP and I think is a shit show. I am not an advocate of the community. All I am saying is that at the time it helped. (I also discovered Reddit because of it hence my username).

I “let go” of my ex and started seeing new people. Because I had been sex deprived for a long time having young, attractive women wanting to have non-commitment sex with me was something very attractive and new. I did everything I wanted, went traveling alone, did all the stuff I couldn’t do with her and had a great time for about two years... although my exGf was still there on the back of my head always.

Something important is that my ex works in the same building I am, and while we almost never see each other or interact we had done sometimes. We have had a coffee or two in the past two years. That doesn’t help.

Anyway in Sept last yr I met a very young (25F) women and started getting feelings for her. I thought things were going to work out and she was very much in love with me... but then I started having panic attacks and nightmares. I would shiver and shake like if it was very cold when we were on bed and she spooned me from behind because it reminded me of the way my exGf did. I would have problem breathing/catching air if I knew my ex was on the building. I had recurring dreams with her when I hadn’t have them for the past 18 months... It was traumatic.

I then decided to talk to my ex and see if things could work out but again with teary eyes she said she loved me but that our history was past. I accepted it (or so I thought) and tried to continue focus in my new relationship but not two months after I broke things up with 25F because I could feel drifting apart more and more while she continued developing feelings I could not return.

Now the final chapter is me continue to meet new attractive women, having sex with them which soothes me for a while and then makes me recoil and my exGf being in a relationship.

I know I need to move on. I know being with new women doesn’t help but loneliness is hard (just being honest). But I continue having dreams, sometimes I even feel like I can smell her hair when I wake up. Sometimes I feel like she was with me, like if we just had a conversation but I know we didn’t. I guess is similar to what people who lose love ones get through... although is idiotic because she isn’t dead.

Things get worse like yesterday when we had to email each other to fix something in Google calendar. 

It is like that.., I constantly get reminded of her because my house is still after several clean ups filled with thing from her like love notes or photographs or lotions etc

Then there is FB bringing memories I thought deleted, or that Google Calendar thing showing me her appointments because she had shared her calendar without realizing. 

I swear it’s always something...

654,"So my gf had this guy on her Snapchat named job, and she said they messaged each other but she wouldn’t consider it talking. This week she was going through a lot and I know she’s very pretty and a lot of guys message her so I said you if you wanna have space don’t text anyone because like that would hurt but I guess we broke up anyways. I go and see her and I’m not sure if we got back together at this point but she swears she wasn’t talking to anyone and I ask her about job and she says no. Yesterday she comes clean and says she did and that he asked for nudes and I guess at this point we’re trying to get back together and she says I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to argue. Anyways I message job and say did my gf send you anything and he said no but she sent me something on Snapchat which is anonymous saying I wanna suck dick, ur dick and saying your cute as fuck these are on to separate occasions we were broken up on both occasions and she said I was just so mad at you. But this job guy was nice enough to tell me everything saying she initiated every conversation on Snapchat and that he left her on read and they talked while we were dating he said she wasn’t flirty or anything but she initiated every conversation and he brought up the things she said and she acknowledged it was her and she still talked to him, also one of them was anonymous and she claimed that she didn’t know it was him but he told she would have had to know.  She told me all the time that she never talked to him and that he started every conversation and he confirmed she lied about what they talked about. 

I don’t doubt my gf or ex gf loves me and she said this wasn’t cheating and technically it’s not but I feel like it would have became that, knowing she lied to me saying she never talks to to Guys while we dated but she talked to him both knowing what she said about him. Idk if it’s worth even trying to work things out with her or not or I should just let it die I’m sorry if the gramma or punctuation is bad I’m stressing and shaking and like feel like dying",09Jan2020,1

658,"So last night I was a little upset that my roommate left without me to go see our friends because I was on my last homework problem and decided not to go see them after all. Maybe I would have decided to go out after anyways. I don’t know. It was an immature decision but whatever. I kind of wanted a night anyways
I text my boyfriend that I am not coming over because I’m upset about this and I’m afraid of feeling left out. This fear of being left out is something left over from some issues I had with friends in the past and my own insecurities.
My boyfriend then goes and tells my friends that the reason I’m not going to go out is because I’m scared I’ll feel left out. And now I’m angry at him and I don’t know how I can talk to those people again. Because even if they see me again I’m scared they won’t act genuine and walk on egg shells since it’s clear that sometimes I feel left out. And if there’s anything I don’t want. It’s that.
I got into an argument about it with him. He did it because he “couldn’t keep watching me suffer” (which I’m not btw) and that if he didn’t do anything he would “feel worthless.”
What do I even do?",09Jan2020,1
659,"So someone I know is really far down the rabbit hole. Listens to and watches Alex Jones, infowars, believes fluoride in water is deadly toxic, society is definitely going to collapse relatively soon, is anti vaccination, only eats organic food because normal food is too bad, mass immigration is an existential threat to USA/Europe, 9/11 inside job, China is taking over the world, overarching global elite controlling everything - like almost every conspiracy imaginable has formed part of their world view, often extreme right wing views. 

It’s tough because they bring all this stuff up when we’re together at any opportunity.And it’s really frustrating because it’s coming from a place of concern about our family and fear of what’s happening to the world. 

They’re actually very intelligent - self taught software developer, but left formal education after school. They live by themselves. They also have aspergers. 

I’m actually a biology graduate so it’s even more frustrating trying to argue against some points. Often they’ll be nuggets of truth in what they say, just massively misrepresented or exaggerated.

661,"A few months ago I was walking home from parking my car at a grocery store(limited parking at my apartment) and a guy walks up to me. He asks if he could borrow some money because he was out of gas for his new Mercedes car that he just got and didn’t have his debit/credit card on him. He promised that he’d pay me back through Venmo, and at that I was sold. Sure, as a person I was also wanting to do good, which was why I even engaged with him instead of telling him off. I never carried cash, so I had to take out money at the grocery store. He’s around the same age as I am (20s) and he starts talking about where he graduated from and how he helped someone else awhile back and he hope karma would do him good. So anyways, we go in the store, I grab some chips for my girlfriend and I ask him if $20 was good. He was really pushing for $40 and I said that I didn’t have enough. I give him the cash, we exchange info, he promises he’ll pay me back and I walk on home.

A few day passes, and it didn’t bother me because I know how it is having to pay someone back. I text him just in case. After a few more days, I kinda get irritated and texted him more because I thought this dude was legit. Keep in mind, he was around my age and didn’t look like he’d be the troubling kind. He replies with “Chill” and goes on to explaining why he’s been late with the money. I told him it’s cool, just send it soon.

More days pass by and yeah, my best friend had to break it to me. “You’ve been duped haha.” I felt like a big gullible dummy. But soon I laughed it off with my best friend and forgot about it.

Many months later, were in 2020. I’m going through Facebook and BOOM! A girl posts a giant paragraph about a guy who asked more money and told her he’d pay her back and never did. She posted screenshots of the dudes Facebook profile and yup, it was him.

You could also see other people facing the same thing in the comments. I was just baffled in how these people living in the same area getting duped by the same guy. Experiencing the same thing as I did. 

So if you’ve reached this far I’m asking for real advice. If I ever find him in public, do I make a citizens arrest and call the cops? Would they even care? I’ve told a local security patrol officer and he didn’t care at all and told me to f*ck off, so I’m not sure if there’s anything that could be done.

I simply just want Justice and to stop this b*tch from doing this to more people 🤷🏻‍♂️",09Jan2020,1
662,"Apologies in advance for a few vague details. I posted this originally on r/careeradvice, but wanted to get more thoughts/ideas

I am a college student majoring in Engineering. I've performed well, joined a research group, and last year I was selected for a multip-year internship which generally leads to a full-time position upon graduation. My summer ended with glowing reviews from my supervisor and excitement for my return.

This past semester I experienced an unexpected, significant shift in my attitudes towards school. My excitement and eagerness towards learning were replaced with apathy. I trudged through my classes for the sake of maintaining grades and my internship/job, but my heart was really not in it.

Instead, I found myself fantasizing about becoming a wilderness rescue specialist and guide. I have a lot of backpacking and first aid experience, and I spend **all** my free time hiking and climbing. While I do have a plan on how to make this shift, the details are certainly a bit murky/needs more flushing out.

On one hand, I feel like I would be crazy to switch gears and pursue this completely separate career/life path. I'm probably just feeling burnt out, but what if its something more than that? I have two years left of school and while I do have some scholarships to cover tuition, I also had to take out loans. Is job security worth pushing through something your heart is no longer in?

Has anyone felt this before and, if so, how'd you deal with it?

668,"I am starting to lose my patience with my male friend(I am female) and am looking for advice.
We are both in our early 30s, both single. I want to preface this by saying I know he has absolutely no romantic interest in me, nor I in him. We have been friends for 2 years, and he has become increasingly clingy with me over the past 6 months. 

He texts me random memes about 5 times a day, tags me in stupid crap on Facebook all the time, and messages me everyday at least once just to say hi and ask how my day went. He usually messages me late at night 11 or 12, and most the time I am sleeping or trying to sleep. If I message him back, his conversation goes like “work was busy, had to stay late, so and so was being annoying, etc” useless crap. Texting him back traps me in an ongoing conversation for hours. I am the kind of person who likes to text for a purpose, and I hate long text conversations about nothing. I try to ignore him when I want to rest but if I don’t respond within an hour he will double or triple text me an annoyed response like “thanks for ignoring me” or “well, have a good night then”.  A lot of the time he just messages me to tell me he’s going to the store, or heading to work. I personally don’t feel the need to speak to my friends everyday multiple times. I message them when we are making plans or when something pressing or funny comes up, they do the same for me. Ive tried to tell him I’m not a big texter, but he doesn’t get the hint. He just tells me I’m “bad at texting”. 

He is lonely and only has a few good friends. He wants a girlfriend badly, but doesn’t seem to meet anyone. Ive seen how he messages new girls he’s talking to, and he is the same with them as he is with me. I’m assuming this is why things never work out for him. I feel like he tries to fill that void with our relationship, but I don’t want that at all. If I say I am out somewhere he always says “text me when you get home safe”. To me that is so annoying because I don’t feel the need to let him know when I am home, and honestly I usually forget. One time I tried to express that to him and he got pissed, saying “it’s not so difficult to text when you get home I want to make sure you are safe”. I’m thirty years old, and very independent, I think I will be fine. He also invites me to his work events and family things which I don’t feel comfortable going to(again, I’m not his gf) and he gets super offended. 

He has always been there for me through hard times, and I for him. He’s the type of guy who would do anything for someone he cares about, and I reciprocate this with him. I don’t want to lose the friendship but I need him to back off. He’s ultra sensitive so I need advice on how to approach this topic without him feeling like I don’t want to be friends with him anymore. How should I address this?",09Jan2020,1

at least he’s not a bully like my mother tho.

also my mother is just rude lol. she says stuff like “i hate you” “slut” “useless” and etc and the only time she talks to me when she ISNT insulting me is when she tells me to clean. i don’t have a proper relationship with either of them. she also doesn’t let me do anything i want, and controls what i want to do after i graduate high school this year. also she physically beats me like everyday for the tiniest thing.

674,"Throughout the summer, I fell hard and fast for a guy in my friend group who pursued me shortly after I'd ended a long-term relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a nice distraction at first. However, as we continued to spend a lot of time together and get more and more physical, feelings started to develop and we started going on dates.

&amp;#x200B;

Over a period of 4-5 months, we'd talk, hang out and go on dates often. But it got to a point where I needed to know where we stood in terms of a relationship, as my feelings were growing significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a candid face-to-face where I asked bluntly what he wanted. He told me he wasn't ready to give up his freedom but he really liked me and wanted to keep doing what we were doing. But I told him I couldn't do that, so I asked if we could just end things as they were and go back to being platonic friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Winter. After months of not really talking (at my request so I could get over him), we reconnected as friends. But he started to send me increasingly flirty messages. I'd play back, keeping myself at arm's length, but having some cheeky fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, we ran into one another in a bar by chance and I walked him home. He asked to kiss me and since then, we've been occasionally spending time together, hooking up, and talking every day like we used to.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Issue:** Though I told myself to be careful, I've started to get feelings again. I don't want to get hurt, so I think I need to ask him if we can go back to being platonic, or else I'd lose him as a friend. But, I have no idea what he's thinking or feeling. He sends me so many mixed signals. Some days, he's flirty and forward and interested in how my day is going, and others, he leaves me on read and is unresponsive.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is it worth it to have a conversation about intentions to clarify what we both want? Or should I just let it be and try to silently push my feelings aside?**

&amp;#x200B;

Again, **I have no idea what he's thinking or feeling about any of this**, and while he's always been the one to pursue me, I get the feeling in my gut he still doesn't want to commit to a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally starting to lose sleep over this, as it's always on my mind and causes me to ruminate. Any advice is welcome, I'm at wit's end.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** A guy I casually saw earlier this year for 4 months re-connected with me and has been flirting; I'm starting to develop feelings again, but I don't know if anything has changed. Do I ask him, or let it be and move on again?",09Jan2020,1
675,"I need help/advice. I’m kind of desperate and not sure what to do anymore.

I’ll put a TLDR at the bottom for those of you who’d like to skip the sob story.

I apologize if this is hard to read. Grammar and punctuation have never been a strong trait of mine. It started back in October, I was getting ready for my wedding. My grandmother ended up getting weak and couldn’t stand so she was rushed to a hospital. A bad one at that but it’s the one she preferred due to its proximity. Turns out her hemoglobin was low. She’s gets through a couple units of blood before her tough ass decides to say “fuck this, I’m going home” checks herself out and gets herself a ride home. She’s 91. Obviously this didn’t work out well in the end. I’ll skip a few graphic details and my loss of a relationship with my cousin over the incident. She ends up going back to the hospital, the Wednesday before my wedding, the ceremony itself was on a Sunday. The hospitals calling me every day about Consent for procedures, because she left the decisions to me. They call me once more, the moment before I’m about to head to the venue for my wedding and I beg them to give me until the morning. They oblige. Then somehow, my great aunt, her sister has her taken out of the hospital and put in a convalescent home. I spent the entirety of the next day trying to find out where she was.

After I find out where she was, I accept the fact that I can’t take care of her 24/7. I just got a full time job working overnight from 8 pm to 5 am. Her sisters  don’t visit her, my brothers are all either in jail or going there, my biological mother is in Nevada, we’re in California and to this day hasn’t come down or done shit to assist in the situation. Long story short, it’s just me. My girlfriend, now wife has gone through two surgeries herself and can only do so much at the moment, which given her current circumstance I understand. Fast forward to a a couple days before New Years. My grandmother who ordinarily is quick witted, snappy and for the most part all there mentally, forgot who I was. Within literally two days. I was working on saving money and budgeting to get my grandmother 24/7 nursing to go home. But it’s been tough, I was either told that they don’t offer it, only offer up to 40 hours a week or if I went to another company, I’d be paying $300 a day. I can’t afford that. I’m in full panic, the facility she was at clearly wasn’t paying as much attention to her as she required. I was there visiting every day, I could tell. But between driving to different facilities, calling and comparing reviews, I was running around in circles and at a loss. I didn’t know what to do.

Fast forward a little bit more, I’ve asked them to run some tests because she’s looking more worse for wear and I’m being a bit more confrontational than admittedly needed with the staff. I get a call while I’m at work. I work on a secure floor so I have to keep my phone in my locker. I call back on my first break and find out she’s been moved back to the hospital. This time a much better one mind you. They’re treating her for low hemoglobin again, she’ she also got pneumonia. Her temp was at 94 degrees and she’s basically passed out, can’t speak, barely breath, I’m in full panic mode.  Couple days later, she’s gone from ghostly white to her normal bronze shade and her temperature normalizes. They’re not feeding her or giving her water on orders from a speech specialist from what I understand is because of the pneumonia causes trouble swallowing. 

I get another call from the hospital before I go to work telling me she not only has sepsis but she has a large mass near or on her gallbladder/Liver and was given six months.  Same day they’re telling me they’re discharging her. I rush down there, am re-assured they’re not discharging her. Had a meeting with a social worker and palliative care worker. Due to her age(91) and her condition there’s not much they can really do. I’m hit pretty hard with this but, I keep the conversation going. They give me a short list of “palliative care options” and hospice stuff I barely understand along with a pink slip to fill out if she’d like to be resuscitated or placed on any sort of support. I ask for a day. It’s been a big announcement then this shit the very next day, to say the least I’m overwhelmed. 

As soon as I leave the hospital after speaking to the doctor and social worker,  I get called from the hospital about 4 times before I even leave the area asking what I want to do because they’ll have to discharge her by tomorrow. Which is now today. I work up early to go to my doctor’s office as a walk in because I can’t hear out of my right ear, haven’t been able to for about 3 days now. Makes the phone calls really hard to have. In short, I don’t know what to do. They’re trying to force me into putting her into another convalescent home and to be honest, she doesn’t deserve that.  No one is willing to go through anything to assist her but me. Another issue is her insurance,  they’re saying she only is covered for another 8 days of long term care before it switched to an HMO  for a state thing which is apparently horrible and doesn’t pay for anything. I’ve got another appointment regarding her today at 2 PM pst and work tonight at 8 pm pst.  I’ve literally gotten called by the hospital while on the phone with another person from the hospital to make a choice as to what to do, this is the day that I was just told she was going to die soon. I don’t know what I’m doing and need help.

Sorry for the bad formatting. I’m not good at it, I’m also posting this from my phone waiting to see a doctor about my ear.

686,"Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! 

I (20F) moved to a larger city around 4.5 hours from my hometown in order to go to uni in 2018. Since then, I have suspended my studies and I won’t be going back to this same uni.

This means that I would have to study a different course elsewhere if I wanted to go back to uni, and have decided to leave this until later in life until I can both afford it and actually want to go. 

Here’s the dilemma: I will need to get a job and a place to rent since I’m not going back to university. I could do this either in the larger city or the small town where I am from. 

Being in the smaller town would mean I could be closer to my family, and have my cat move in with me. I have one friend there that I am not particularly close to, but know the area well and could rejoin clubs I used to be a part of.

Being in the larger city would mean I get to be close to my friends here (only two of them!) but that I would rarely get to see my family and my cat. The rent is more expensive here for what you are getting, but the opportunities are likely to be better, with a wider selection of jobs. However, due to the amount of experience I have, I feel I would have no problem getting a job in either place. 

I should mention that I own the student flat I currently live in, but would be asked to leave in August should I stay here. I will rent this out, which would cover the renting costs of a small house or large flat in my small town, or a room in a shared house in the city. 

I have no idea whether to stay in the city or move back home, because I will be missing people either way.

What do you guys think?",09Jan2020,1
687,"Hello everyone and thanks for coming to take a peek. Back in September I found a stray cat that was super friendly and decided to take her home. We got her to a vet and had her checked out and the vet said she was fine, confirmed she had been spayed (has a clipped ear), and so on. Things were rocky with our other cat at first, but they eventually came to an agreement of some sort. 

&amp;#x200B;

After maybe a month though she started shitting everywhere, and more recently began pissing everywhere as well. She still uses the litter box but at the same time she keeps shitting on any blankets, clothes, coats, or beds that she can find. She never does it on the floor, just on all our blankets and jackets and such making it even harder to deal with. The poop isn't runny or anything like it would usually be if she was sick and isn't any odd colors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got pretty angry at her doing it while looking right at me and chased her around the house, and she stopped doing it for an entire week before resuming again, which reinforces my belief that it's not a medical thing. Either way though, our financial situation has worsened in recent times and we cannot afford to take her to a vet. It's not a matter of budgeting the money for her or cutting out some luxuries - we already did all of that just to keep eating food. Taking her to a vet, even ones that work with you on the cost, is completely out of the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have called and/or emailed all of the places I can find within a several hour drive that take animals and ALL of them are full and not accepting new cats. I called them about a month ago and then last week and got the same response. Obviously nobody else wants her that I know with her issues either. Does anyone have an idea of wtf I can do with this cat besides throw her out in the cold? We aren't monsters and don't want to do that, but we are at our wits end. This cat is causing massive issues in the household with all the additional stress and tension and everyone has come to a breaking point recently. We need her out ASAP.",09Jan2020,1

Few months go by then. I am moving away she says she wants to stay with me and I agree.

693,"Back in August, one of my two cats started attacking the other out of nowhere (I think it was stressed induced). I've had to separate them and I am rehoming the cat that attacked the other because I have not had her for as long and the other cat is much more well behaved. 

For context, I got my cat Zephyr in January of 2018. She is the sweetest cat ever and loves attention and have never had behavior issues with her. I've had my other cat, Kitty, since 2012. It took a while for my two cats to get acclimated to each other but eventually they got along. 

I moved in with family for a few months last year and Zephyr was slightly aggressive, just hissed at the kids but nothing more than that. Still sweet as ever to me and the rest of the family. 

Moved into my current place of living with two roommates and a dog over a year ago and it took her a long time to not hiss at one of my roommates. The dog here is cat aggressive so I have to keep the cats away (normally in my room, which is almost the same size as my apartment when I first got Zephyr) everything was fine for about 9 months but one day last August when I had to bring Zephyr to a bad vet visit, she started attacking Kitty and I had to separate them. The aggression continued each time I tried to reintroduce. 

Due to the dog in the house who never got used of the cats, I have to keep the cats locked away unless I'm home AND the dog is not out. Kitty has been staying in our half finished basement and hanging with my roommate (room on first floor) for a lot of the time. She shows no stress, but does seem out of it with all the changes) and Zephyr lives in my room. 

I have been trying to re-home Zephyr, but here is where the real issue comes in - she is showing extreme aggression to her new home. I have been going to this place once every few weeks (trying weekly when schedules match up) to get her acclimated to some friends of mine. They have a cat, so we keep one cat locked up when the other is out. 

Zephyr is aggressive when approached and, when I start smelling like this new house and these people after being there for 20 minutes or so, attacks me too. As soon as we get home she's sweet as pie again but I've been trying to re-home her since October to this one new place and she has shown no improvement. I don't understand her aggression.  The last time I was there she straight up attacked me because I moved my hand slightly. 

She is stressed at home due to the dog and no amount of time I spend with her is enough. She meows constantly when I'm not in the room with her. I work 9 hours a day and have about 4 hours between when I get home from work and need to go to bed. 

Trying to split time between the cats, keep up with my life and other responsibilities, and spend time with my boyfriend (one of my roommates who has been hanging with Kitty) is getting to be waaay too stressful. 

What do I do? If I bring her to a shelter I'm afraid that she will not get adopted due to this weird aggression that I never see from her at home. But I cannot keep doing what I'm doing. I need my room and life back and I cannot deal with this stress anymore",09Jan2020,1

I am 19 and he is 20. I am not so sure about moving in and money isnt the problem bc it would be around 6 months - year before i moved in with him so i can save up as much money as i could to afford moving some of my housewares passed down to me from family. The main problem is what if i moved 3000 miles away from home to live with him and we dont like each other. Im not sure why we wouldnt like each other considering we talk everyday and havent had any issues besides the normal argument that we get over. 

Should I move in with him in 6months-year?
Should I go on a trip to visit him first?

700,"I've been working nights at a grocery store for over a year now and the longer I'm here the more miserable I get. It's easy work but the social environment and toxic state of management have been tough to deal with and I've reached a point where I don't know how much longer I can deal with it. 

I live in a small town based in agriculture, good jobs are incredibly tough to find here if you are not a farmer or work for a feed or plant. Fast food and retail jobs are always hiring here but after working at Wendy's (and quitting because of my crippling social anxiety) I realized I can't handle customer service jobs. The one perk of my job is that I have no interaction with customers. I had to come in for a day shift the day before Thanksgiving and had an anxiety attack so severe because of the huge crowd of people that I couldn't stop shaking and my managers kept me working in the back for my shift instead.

Socially, my work environment has become so negative and toxic that I recently became withdrawn from everyone with no regrets. It has made me wish for another job so bad just because of how miserable and bitter it's become. Coworkers I thought were friends turned out to be vindictive, backstabbing and gossipy. I've always been outgoing and talkative and inviting people to hang out but no one was ever interested and to this day I'm still left out of social events outside work. I feel left out, ignored and not needed. I feel like if I quit tomorrow no one would care, not management or the crew I work with. Everyone I work with is always negative and complaining and talking bad about each other behind their back, and yes that includes me. I know there's potential for drama in the workplace no matter where you go, but it's gotten so bad lately it just brings me down. There is constant drama and the store manager is the most immature and incompetent person I have ever met. It took 9 months for me to get my first raise, and now I'm barely making 11$ an hour. Meanwhile, a brand new chic fil a down the street is hiring for 13$ starting out.

My job feels like a joke. I feel like I've wasted a whole year of my life here and I feel like I'm wasting time every second I'm working. I feel like no one respects or notices me except for the assistant manager. I'm not a perfect employee but I show up on time, get my job done and bust my ass to make sure things are done properly. I have no interest in continuing this job and I feel like I'll never advance because of my bad social anxiety. 

Besides working dreadful fast food, my options for a job are very very limited. I've been trying to find a computer related job, maybe something data entry based, but have had 0 luck. The closest job I found is a receptionist position at the hospital, but my social anxiety has deterred me from applying, I'm terrified of interacting with people over the phone and genuinely don't believe I could handle it. I know that sounds ridiculous, and I seriously regret not being able to handle it because I know the hospital pays better than my job does and it would be a good opportunity. 

I have a passion for helping and caring for animals. I've looked around for possible jobs but we don't have a shelter or groomer even close to my area. I've just about given up on job hunting. But at the same time I've gotten so depressed over my current job I'm just desperate to get out. I wish I could just quit but I want to play things smart and get another job first before I leave. I've looked for at-home work but nothing that appears legit.

Please, I'm at the end of my rope here. Does anyone have any advice?",09Jan2020,1
701,"I’ve been in a toxic abusive relationship. I’ve been isolated and stuck. I have a kid too. I’ve been trying to get out but have no money and no means to do so.

My kid has grandparents here on my husbands side none are biological he himself is not biological but they have all been in her life for a really long time. I am close to finishing my schooling to get a real estate license here if I move I’d probably have to start over because of different state laws. I’d have to leave all my stuff behind, my car everything.

I wish I could just end my life and be done with it because literally nothing good has come from my life but one thing,  my kid.

They end up sleeping in the same bed sharing a carpet. And the guy starts touching her. She says „bitch“ but doesn’t try to make him stop physically. He continues while she keeps saying „bitch“ a few times. It goes on and comes to oral only including his genital. She also touched his genital. He tried to put her hands in her trousers also after she let him know that she didn’t want that and also preventing it by taking his hand. Which he tried about 3-4 times. 
After it is over she goes to the bathroom and he follows her and asks her if everything was ok after knocking on the door. 
They then share the bed for the night.
In the Morning they talk for an hour in the bed and before she offers him to eat something he says that he wouldn’t mind to stay a bit longer if it was ok for her.
She then takes a shower and offers him if he also wanted to take a shower but he denies. When he leaves they exchange phone numbers on his asking. 
3 days later the holidays start and they don’t meet or text over the 2 weeks the holidays last.
Afterwards he meets a friend of the women in a club. 
Then next day she contacts him and he replied not knowing at this point that he wouldn’t understand what this was about. If it was about the day when the describes situation took place and that if so they that it would seem they had different perspectives and that they could talk about it. He doesn’t say sorry or anything, making it later clear that he would be scared of it having consequences legally, without saying so.

Parents divorced when I was a kid... mom rejected family and I was forced to live with abusive dad even though I begged my mom to take her (another long story for another day).

Mom: quasi-functional paranoid schizophrenic. Has held jobs successfully and is financially independent. Loves me and my kids in her own way, but not in a ""safe"" way. Held at ""arms length"" and maintained this distance successfully for about 20 years now.

Dad: Former alcoholic abuser, later when I was a teenager just became completely disconnected. I preferred the disconnected dad from the abusive dad. Re-married once when I was 20-something to a woman who was pretty good for him... he cleaned-up but was still distant. Kept at ""arms length"" for many years successfully. Wife died and re-married again this year. New wife is amazing, I wish she was my mom. Dad is like... uhhh.... he's like the dad I always wanted?  Except I'm in my 40's now and it feels super-weird.  Examples:

He's been SUPER-generous... like thousands of dollars that I didn't ask for generous. He used to be super-stingy. Like my dad once give me a used car radio for my birthday if he even remembered my birthday which often he didn't. To top it off, it was a factory radio and keyed to the car he took it out of.

He's been SUPER-kind... like my kids want to see him... that's really uncomfortable

and NOW, he's being SUPER-thoughtful and intentional which is something else he's never done before. Below is an email conversation I had with him this week:

\-----

Dad: ""Hey! Here's hoping you passed the exam and got the promotion! Love, Dad""

Me: ""Hey Dad! Thanks for checking in! I took my test on Friday and it was really hard. I did pass although I couldn't believe it at the time. The promotion isn't automatic but we'll see what happens! Love you too!""

Dad: ""Congratulations! I'm very proud of you! (two thumbs up emoji's)""

\-----

Now - my dad has almost never said ""Love"" or ""Proud"" before... I didn't even think those were words in his vocabulary. He has had very little interest in my life to date.

So I'm confused, I don't know how to feel, and I'm not sure if I can trust this or if I should embrace it or keep him at arm's length or what.

So i am a 24 year old male. ever since i was young i had problems with anxiety and social situations. i was treated by a therapist when i was 10 years old. And it kinda worked. I now have a decent amount of good friends, and i go on vacations with them and do things in the weekends.

But there are still moments i feel my anxiety like when we had something planned with 3 friends but then one friend invites a complete stranger i dont know, and i just cancel the plans and stay at home

But the main thing i want to talk about is how do i get deeper conversations with people and how do i open up, espescially with girls. There is a girl i met 5 yrs ago and we had good talks and a good chemistry but after a year she found out i liked her, but she said to me i dont know you that well. And that is where the fun talks ended. So i wouldt really like to know how to have long deep converstations with girls and have myself and the girl open up about herself. BTW is it weird to start opening up with this girl i know for 5 years even if i did not do that the past couple years? is it maybe possible she will see a new me? i now its maybe too late for a relationship with her after al these years. But i just want her to see i have changed myself and have good talks again with her.

I can go weeks without having this kind of ""tics"" but they are always there and always come back anytime I have something on my mind. In the last few months these tics have increased so much that I get literally pain in the areas that I forcibly stretch but I cannot really stop these movements otherwise I will feel really uncomfortable. Sometimes I end up having to take some pills for muscles inflammation because I cannot deal with the discomfort. I've always done it and until recently I have never really questioned it but since it has become really present in my life, I am beginning to think it is some kind of compulsive behaviour. Could it be because of my anxiety or something else? Is it a tic? Do I need to see a doctor about it? I cannot really understand whether it could be a serious problem.",09Jan2020,1

Hi everyone, this is my first post on this subreddit and I’ve been kinda scared to ask anyone about it. 

I’m a freshman at Uni and a lot of my friends from high school also goto this Uni. So about 6-7 months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of almost two years and we broke up on a really bad note. He lied to me saying that our friends think I’m abusive but then told me that he just fell out of love with me when I started panicking. I went to ask my friends about it and they said that they had never thought that, just that the relationship itself was toxic.

He then apologized to me later after blocking me but I had already been seeing someone new, my now boyfriend of about 4 months. My ex told me that he wanted to just be friends because we were still very close and I forgave him. He was one of my best friends after all and we promised that when we broke up, we would do our best to still stay friends. 

This went well for about a 3 months or so and suddenly my ex has been ignoring me on all forms of communication. He blocked me on discord and on the normal phone and logs off of all the games we have each other added on if we’re online at the same time. I reached out to him multiple times, all of which received no reply. The only reply I ever got from him during this time was “I don’t want to be friends anymore.” 

He never gave me a reason and I don’t think he ever will but this has been hurting my relationship with my other friends who actively choose him over me. When I try to talk to them about it they just say that they don’t do it on purpose but... I feel like I did something and I don’t know what. Please help if you can.",09Jan2020,1

I was in the right lane, then it tells me to turn left in 500 meters. There were two cars in the left lane, meaning I couldn't merge over, and a car behind me, so I couldn't slow down and get behind the two cars. Obviously, I missed the turn, and so I had to turn into the next street and come back.

We’ve been together almost 8 years, senior year of high school, throughout college, and graduating. After college I got some money (6 figures) from a project I did. After the project, 2 years ago, I have been unemployed. We still live with family. I don’t have a car, and I’ve been applying to jobs since September with no luck. He is obviously not happy I don’t have income, but I’ve really been trying. I’ve applied to 100 jobs monthly. The problem is, I need a part time job close to home. With a full time job him and I won’t be able to hang out as much, and I have a dog I can’t leave alone on a full time work schedule.  
Once I get a job, I’ll buy a car. I can buy one now with my savings, but I know he will complain about the expenses and me not having income. He’s been getting more and more impatient to the point of belittling me about not having a job and he’s starting to resent me and not even want to be intimate with me. I don’t think it’s fair since I am trying my best, and even showed him proof I am trying. 

I do love him very much and he loves me. We got into an argument yesterday about this and we don’t want to break up. I just feel like a bad girlfriend. I don’t want friends to go out with, because I have online friends I talk to on a dog group I run and have people constantly talking to me so I don’t feel lonely.

I'm at my final stages of high school. And, frankly I'm a very lazy person. I figure every student is like this but, even if 100% of the people are like that I don't want to be. 

I just really really lack the motivation to study. I, at best hold the books and place them next to me but without any care to even read them, let alone memorization. Also, in class I never focus. It's not like I am a trouble maker who doesn't want to focus, I just always go like ""ughh ill just sit back and study this at home"" and eventually never do. I don't want to be like this, it would especially be the death of me in college, if my grades this year even qualify me for a good college. I want to be very successful. I want to become a person of higher education truly. Ever watched Doctor Strange? I aspire to be as study loving as he is. I used to love reading books but now all I do is phone phone phone.

730,"I have the misfortune of being somewhat acquainted with the son of a congressman. This congressman is  one of the handful of GOP representatives that are aggressively defending Trump throughout the media. I  heard he also may be trying to run for senator next term, and even if he  doesn’t he’s in a VERY red district so re-election is likely.

The  son is the embodiment of the son of a GOP politician. He’s a complete  obnoxious asshole that clearly only cares about himself, and he’s  already developed his dad’s method of saying a bunch of stupid bullshit  that doesn’t make any sense really fast to make it seem like he’s  winning an argument. He’s done a lot of shitty things to a lot of people  and never acknowledges anything or shows any remorse. He’s one of my  least favorite people.

Anyway, my  roommate who actually hates him even more due to his consistent  disrespect to a lot of women that my roommate is friends with, used to  be somewhat part of the same social group. My roommate possesses a video  of the congressman’s son clearly saying “n\*ggers,” trying to keep a  straight face, and laughing. There is no additional context in the  video, the dumbass just saw himself being recorded and thought it would  be funny.

He’s a junior in college  and definitely intends on trying to follow in his dads footsteps as a  career, and I’m pretty sure that a video like that could probably cause some problems for them if it were to go viral.

733,"-I fractured a small bone in my wrist called trapezium I believe. It's right uder my thumb.

-About 4 weeks ago I secretly went for a friends birthday party and fractured a small bone underneath my hand. I drank a lot and had a lot of adrenaline in my body so I didn't feel it until the next day. 

-The next day I woke up with a swollen hand and called the emergency center and they told me it's nothing to worry about and it should be gone in less than 3 weeks.

-Btw I still didn't know at this point that I fractured it.


-3 weeks later and then pay has decreased a lot, but I can't lift anything beyond 12 kg with my hand. So I decided to make an appointment and had to wait a week for it. 

Today was the appointment and the doc told to get some X-rays. I did and they told me I slightly fractured it and it with a cast it will heal within 4 weeks, but if I don't cast my hand the bone might not heal and I might have to get an operation. 

Here is the problem if I get a casting I can't hide it from parents and at the moment my family situation is really f'ing tense between me and the rest of my family. I can't give you full context, not because I don't want to, but because it's a lot and deserves it's own time later.

Now I am risking my relationship with my whole family that I have to rely on or should I risk my bone. I am thinking of getting one of those casting you can remove and put back on, but ill have to wait a whole week on it.

735,"  

**tl;dr: Love of my life died, want to start over, where do I go and what do I do?**

I grew up in a rural area. My dad died when I was young in a house fire, and I went through all of grade school depressed and lost. No real friends, or anyone I would consider family. Never have gotten along with my siblings or mom I actually don’t have much contact other than holidays due to resentment for a number of reasons I won’t get into.

I met my girlfriend when I was 16 online through video-games. After a couple of years of an online relationship I flew her out to meet her in person. She lived in a major city across the country.

Neither of us were really interested in have a large social circle, or having any friends for that matter. We spent most of our time playing video games and talking through Skype. She was the only thing I would consider my real family to this day. She kept me grounded in a life where all I’ve ever known is misery.

We’d make it a goal to see each-other at least once every 6 months. I’d fly out to her city sometimes, I knew from those experiences that I wanted to live in a major city. 

This continued until around 23. I was near ready to move to be closer with her, plans for a well-paying job in a high cost of living city. Recently revealing that she was pregnant, I was a level of happy I can’t even describe. Through a series of unfortunate events and strain on our relationship she ended up taking her own life.  Devastated, I dropped all plans of moving. For about 3 years I reverted to severe alcoholism. Bar fights, DUI, arrested on several occasions. Working and the bar were my life. 

Ever sense I lost her, I stopped all of my hobbies. Stopped playing music, haven’t touched a video game. I told myself I’d live the rest of my days alone. Thought of it as being poetic, actually. My interest in hobbies like music, videogames ceased completely.

Of course, It got to a point where I couldn’t live like that, so one day I completely cut out alcohol. Started eating better, working out. Bundled those feelings deep down and tried to act normal. I made it a point to go out at least once a day. Sitting in a coffee shop or some social event or whatever.

Fast forward a year now I’m in the best shape of my life. I have $10,000 in savings due to working two jobs non-stop. Left my retail job I’ve worked all my life for a decent IT helpdesk position. My old hobbies are starting to interest me again. With those changes, came changes of what I want out of my life.

Mentally I’m not in a great state, but better than I was before. I still blame myself. No amount of counseling or medication will ever convince me it’s not my fault. That things couldn’t have been different. But I’ve accepted that. These events in my life has left me incredibly stoic. Realistically I’m pessimistic and just full of hate. Complete opposite of who I was or who I wanted to be. I want to change that. I feel I come off as boring or perhaps even creepy. But coming up on 28 this year, I think I want to try to have the life I lost before.

The one thing I know for certain is I don’t want to live in my home state anymore.

So finally my question is…Where to I even begin. If you were in my shoes, where would you go? What would you do? I want to casually date and meet people. Explore. Travel. Live life. How do I learn to socialize with others with such a morbid past? I feel like I’ve never been more ready to move, but feel totally lost on how to do it.",09Jan2020,1

739,"Kind of a silly question but I keep going back and forth on it, I'm leaning towards saying nothing. 

I met a guy through work and we get along really well. We made plans to meet up at my house and play video games this weekend. This friend has spoken to me many times about how he grew up in a very strict, religious household who attended a church with some pretty extreme views. He has since renounced religion and is pretty vocal about it. Throughout all of these rants and cracks, I never shared with him that I'm a former Sunday school teacher and still practice my faith. It isn't usually something that I talk about outside of church or family, I just never want to feel like I'm pushing it onto people or start a debate that two people couldn't possibly win. Also: him having a bad experience with Christianity doesn't affect me wanting to be his friend, and I don't want him to get the feeling that it *does*.

So he's coming over, he's never been to my place before, and I actually have some Bible verses and crosses on my walls. I'm not going to put it all away, I'm not ashamed of my faith and I'm not trying to hide it from anyone, but I also don't want it to be a big awkward thing.

Anyway, do I need to pull him aside before he comes over and say something like ""listen, it's not a big deal but I'm Catholic and I have some Bible verses and stuff on the walls. We're not in church, we can still call each other assholes""? Or do I just say nothing and whatever happens happens?

743,"I'm not asking for advice on what to do, more asking about opinions on my question. I'm 19, graduated high school in June, and am mostly looking to earn money and get work experience on my belt before continuing my education any further. So I am inside A LOT, I won't deny it. Especially since I love to game I get the stereotype of a hermit from the rest of my family. 

Anyway we all live in a very full house but only a few are relevant to the question. Since I'm grown up now I obviously don't expect a bunch of Christmas presents considering it is mainly for children. So at this point I am already use to getting nothing.

On holidays we all tend to hangout in the living room just playing board games, and my one nephew who is 20 and lives with us all told my sister (who owns the house) that she bring out my Christmas present. It generally made it kind of awkward, which he tends to do sometimes, but I just ignored it. 

At the end of the day just before we were all going to go back to doing our own things he brought it up and again and she went into her room and brought out a leather jacket and and asked if I would accept it. (she once bought me a new laptop after it had broke but I told her to cancel it because I don't like when people spend that much on me) Clothing is one of those few things I actually like to get, especially jackets because they kind of feel like my security blanket when I go out. So I ended up accepting it and thanking her, hung it up on the holder next to the front door and that was pretty much the end of the day.

Turns out the reason why my nephew was being kind of weird about it is because the jacket was originally for him but he already had one and didn't want to accept it either, trying to push it off on to me I guess my sister finally caved and gave it to me. 
Now a few weeks later he's decided not to use his jacket anymore and just take the one that was meant for him. Like I said I don't go out a lot so I guess they just figured because of that I wouldn't care if she just gave it to him like originally intended. 

So finally I just wanted someones opinion on it. Personally I'm not mad at them or anything.

744,"This is my first time posting anywhere but at this point I really don’t know what to do. I apologize for formatting, I’m on mobile so this will probably be a massive block of text. Basically, I was at home for lunch on December 13 and walked out to my car to see my boyfriend’s car being towed. His tags were expired by one day and our apartment complex tows anyone and everyone they can justify. After much arguing, the driver actually took the car off the truck (we had no warning that his car would be towed and the guy was feeling nice I suppose). I had to get back to work so I really couldn’t check for damage. When I got home, boyfriend barely touched the bumper on his car and it fell straight off. The bumper had been hanging over the curb and it has very obviously been dragged over the concrete and yanked off, then pushed back into place (so I didn’t notice initially). Everything that holds the bumper onto the car is broken, so it’s not a matter of just buying a new bumper. The tow company fired the driver (for supposedly unrelated reasons) but according to them, he said that he didn’t do it so they won’t pay for the damage. I have emailed them pictures and I am working on getting an estimate but the owner of this small company is dodging my calls and takes calls at his house- not their actual tow yard. Is there anything aside from taking them to court that we can do in order to get the damage taken care of? We’re looking at at least $800 in repairs that we cannot afford. I hope this makes sense, any advice is greatly appreciated.",09Jan2020,1
746,"I am not an anxious person typically. I've always been self-supporting, optimistic, independent, etc. Last year I was living on my own, doing my own thing, life was alright. Then I met my fiance and we fell in love and got engaged. He lived out of state and I agreed that, after our engagement, I would give up my job, my apartment, my city, and my friends to move in with him.

I regret nothing about it. I love being here and I love living with him. However, I've never been so dependent on anybody before. We spend a lot if time together and I love that. The only friends I have here are his friends, but they've been nothing but welcoming and amazing to me. I got a new job, I love the house we live in. Life is great! I'm the happiest I've ever been.

This is where my trouble comes in. For the past few weeks I've been riddled with this sudden and horrible anxiety. I cant stop thinking about what would happen if something happened to my fiance, like an illness or a car accident or something horrible. It terrifies me to think of him no longer being here and leaving me alone in this new place. These thoughts bring me to tears suddenly and more frequently as the weeks progress. Even when I'm with him, I cant enjoy the moment because I'm too anxious and in my own head and I start to cry. The logical part of my brain tells me to stop worrying about things that haven't happened and enjoy the moment, but my illogical side says that surely if anything happened to him, I would want to take my own life too. I am not depressed or suicidal, just anxious and scared. How do I get over these feelings and start enjoying life in the moment again?",09Jan2020,1

Im going to be 26 years old in 2 months. I have been at my job for a while. It wasn't until recently that i found out what i wanted to go to school for. I want to become a park ranger.

I had no motivation to go back until recently. Im getting older and time won't stop. So i want to make the best of what i got teaching people about the outdoors or helping conserve the outdoors.

I was so mad when the woman told me what happened, I want to destroy that man or at least make sure he can never harm you g children again.

Here’s some background. We’ve been together for 6 months. Before we began dating she was a virgin, while I’ve gotten around a little bit. She acknowledged my past. She asked the question and I didn’t just outright say it, I beat around the bush for a while before she realized on her own that I couldn’t get the words out. We spent the night talking and all, she got insanely upset about it which is a given. I tried my best to look at it from her perspective, it’s not easy being told that you’re #2. I’m satisfied with our sex life, there’s nothing wrong about it. She asked about blowjobs, that’s a very hard subject for her since someone ruined her perception of that when she was much younger. I wish, I absolutely wish it didn’t happen and I would never hold that or her virginity against her. I never cared about her virginity, I don’t have some special kink of it. I just didn’t care. I love her more than anything and I told her that sex isn’t everything to me. She asked me a series of questions which I was honest about, she didn’t want to be hurt. I could’ve told her she was #1 but I wasn’t going to lead her on like that. She assured me that everything is okay, but I don’t want this to be the doom of our relationship.

758,"I’ve been friends with this girl for 10 years. We were actually best friends at one point. But along highschool she changed, she has been on and off friends with me for about 4 years recently. In highschool I got in a relationship and she didn’t like him and stopped talking to me. She apologized and we were back to being friends. It was different though, we weren’t as close as we used to be and she was always passive aggressive most of the time. We became closer our senior year of highschool until she went to college.

When college happened she made new friends and basically ditched me for her new friends. Drama happened and she dropped those friends and apologized once again because I think I was her only friend at the time. She made new friends again once she moved back and has kept me on the back burner ever since. She never initiated hanging out with me. I was always the one to do it, she’d only talk to me when she had drama in her life and or probably felt bad because we hadn’t talked in awhile. I would always be there for her, when she was sick I’d bring her a movie and tea, when she broke up with her boyfriend I went over there to help her out. But when I have a problem she only responds with a one worded text or makes me feel crappy if I’m venting about a problem of mine by saying how worse she has it.

It started to become a toxic friendship and drama is her. She always has something to talk bad about with her boyfriend or other friends but then she goes right back to them. It started getting to me, I mean we weren’t hanging out for a month or two until she had a big issue to talk to me about. I love her with all of my heart but I can’t do it anymore. I can’t be the on the back burner waiting to here about her life. We don’t have a genuine friendship. I’ve actually told her I have a problem with what’s going on and have said I need her to step up but she turned it on me saying I was being childish and that she’s “busy” and doesn’t have time to maintain a friendship and that I need to go over when it’s convenient for her.

I decided to delete her off of all of my social media because it was upsetting me seeing her say she’s busy but yet still make a lot of her time for her other friends and then when we hang out she just talks about herself for hours. But she apparently hasn’t noticed and it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve talked to her and she texted me asking for a favor and then said “nevermind how have you been”. 2 weeks I haven’t said anything and she asked me for a favor. I’m just done.

I’m not the type of person to end a friendship and burn a bridge especially with being friends for so long because even though she might be toxic I care about her and still love her as a friend.

764,"i know this may be a difficult thing to reach out to for the regular person online, but im just tierd of my situation and i dont know what to do anymore its honestly making me so depressed because i really do believe i ruined my life by training my brain for over 20+ years to be on autopilot.

when i was younger for some reason i picked up the believe that im not important/need to hide my personality and emotions. i got through school by completely zoning out and purely surviving by being in my head.

fast forward today- its hard for me to get out of this state of mind, i have issues concentrating on a task because my mind wouldn't shut up. i find it difficult to do anything without constantly having to think about something. when  talking to people even when i want to listen and engage with them its almost as if i subconsciously make the conversation boring to make them go away OR i struggle to pay attention due to my thoughts always being foggy.

\-when around groups of people (especially those i don't know/well enough)  i suddenly feel like im aware of everything from thoughts, my posture, facial expressions and pretending like im not aware or trying to refocus MAKES IT WORSE!

\- when around people im actually close to i have to pretend that i care for them and they care for me because my natural instinct is to belive our relationship is fake/ one of circumstance.

\-sometimes when in public situations i want to do or say things but i dont ( WHY?!)

\- Im aware that people are real and have emotions and stuff like me but for some reason my brain acts like people arent really people. for example if you go to a gym class with an instructor leading the class trying to make it engaging, a reg person who sees the world as a playground would comment on things during the class, thank the instructor/ask questions etc but for me because i register people as robots or being so stuck in my own bubble i treat situations like this like its black and white .its kinda like if i clicked a button in a game to make me go to the gym and i work out and get the benefits but i completely miss the experience of being around other people or being present in the moment.

\*\*the worst part of all is that even though im aware of this and want to fix it with baby steps, i always end up  in the same situation i started in.

\-i have been working on eating super healthy and i have been going to the gym almost daily for the past 5 months. ive had my blood checked for deficiencies and its all come back clear. i have been counselling in the past but i felt like i didnt get much from it , we mostly just talked about trumatic stuff in my past but it didnt help fix my current brain fog situation. i read so many self help books about confidence/psych/self improvement but still feel like im not improving. my new years resolution is to start meditation.",09Jan2020,1

later, his family member offers us a house. the house is on a highway and still in a very rural area. i expressed i didnt feel comfortable with this as he works night shift and id be home alone there as a young female. i didnt think it was very safe and he continued to try to get me to be ok with it. i gave in, thinking i was being too paranoid / dramatic / picky. 

turns out his family member was selling the house and now offers up a trailer. he mentioned this to me and i was confused because i had just begun to accept the idea of moving to the house. i told him i didnt want to live in a trailer as ive experienced that life before and its not something i want for myself. he said it would only be for until i finish school and we could get a house in the place we initially agreed on, &amp; later admits he lied about this compromise to get me to agree to moving there because he knew i wouldnt otherwise.

now, he has already moved into the trailer and im set to move either this month or early next. im moving away from a place i love, leaving my mom and everything to a place that i dont like that id probably be stuck in for a long time. maybe im just being dramatic or something but i really cant tell if im about to fuck up my life or what but im scared and i dont know what to do",09Jan2020,1

I did and early one year birthday(we got her when she was 3 months she was turning 1) no I didn’t get to celebrate her real birthday with her. It’s been 3 weeks almost a month. And I can’t anymore. I miss her and I just want her back. Idk what to do would I be a butt if I ask to have her back. Would I be taking away some else’s dog at this point.

785,"Hey everyone. I’ve been with my bf for quite some time now- several months. I’m very close to him and our relationship is healthy and going smoothly. But I feel like I don’t know what to do in this situation. 
I come from a very conservative family that will not accept me dating, as I’m a girl and away from home for college. One of my parents knows about my bf but does not bring it up as she doesn’t approve one bit. 
Now I’m home for the break, and although I want to see my bf, the catch is that I’m a college freshman staying with conservative parents and no personal car while he’s a college senior with freedom of his own time and transportation. 
To solve this, we tried to meet in secret in my small hometown, as I live far away from our college. I’d take my parent’s car with an alibi just to see him.
Last time an hour before I left to meet him, my bf was in a parking lot of the only supermarket of our town. One of my parents (the one who knows who he is and doesn’t approve) coincidentally and directly passed by him there. My bf called me and told me he saw one of my parents, and my fear was that my parent saw my bf and could connect the dots as to why he happened to be at the same small town as I am.
Before my parent came back home, I was terrified that they would take my phone and demand to know what was going on (as they had done so before and have gone through many of my messages and photos even before I left for college). 
So I deleted all my photos, messages, and videos of us. Turns out my parent never saw him at the supermarket parking lot and I was scared for no reason. But I had to tell my bf that the photos were gone. 
He’s very upset and honestly, I can see why. Those memories are gone but I feel like I have some justification, too. I know I would be prevented from seeing my bf in college if my parents demanded they take my phone. I wanted to be safe than sorry.

My family are really against me moving out (""waste of money"") and my mum is insisting on building a studio at the back of her house which I would rent from her. Basically I am stuck here forever...!?

I would be so grateful for any (brutally honest) advice. I am tempted to be 100% selfish - book a one-way flight to London. Moving across the world may be the only way to extricate myself from my family. I could do teacher training there. Or should I start small with what I have, stay in Au and find a Law job?",09Jan2020,1
789,"As the title reads, I am a 22F. Over the last year I have come to not enjoying drinking. I get headaches/migraines often and alcohol seems to be a major contributing factor. It’s not worth it for me to waste a whole day recovering from one night of drinking, so I personally choose for myself to not drink. This sounded so liberating and free when I choose it, but now it seems like Im an outsider and a little bit of a wimp? 

I started drinking socially at 14. I was in the “popular” group in high school and partying was something that took place every weekend, it was a given that I was going to be drunk. My friends now all still drink and go to bars and enjoy the atmosphere and Im struggling to fit in. I have a few great friends that have accepted and come to understand that I just don’t enjoy drinking but I still feel like a weird burden when they ask to hang out. 

Clearly this is an issue within myself as I feel a societal pressure at 22 to drink to be social. Any advice from those that also do not drink? I’m new to this and don’t even know how to explain it to new people without sound pretentious. What do you do when you hang out with friends? 
Thank you for the advice in advance!",09Jan2020,1
790,"My current name is Molnár Gergely in my language. Gergő for short. In English it's Gregory Miller which sound like a pedophile name and I'm not exactly on good terms with Greg either. When I'm older I want to move to an English speaking country and get an English name legally. The only name I've came up with so far is Brandon. I haven't thought about a last name yet but I'm working on it and I'm still not sure about Brandon. I'm open to suggestions. What are some first and last names that you think sound good and you'd like to have?

I want my last name to be rare enough that it doesn't show up in a math question but I don't want it to be so unique that the furnitures start floating if someone says it.

First name can be anything but it has to sound good with the last name.

I'd also like to get your opinions on Brandon.

Overall I don't want a super basic name like John Smith or a super rare weird and borderline insane name like Alexander Pendragon. I just want a cool name that's not basic or stupid.

Also I'm aware that middle names are a thing in English speaking countries but it's not a thing in my country. How important is the middle name? Do you need one at all?

If I get anything over 8 hours of sleep then I'm tired and groggy all throughout the day and even have to take naps. Usually I aim for 4-5 hours of sleep and I wake up fine and feeling well rested all throughout the day. It's easy for me to get up in the morning with less sleep and I don't feel like laying in bed all day. I'm 19 btw. Is this something I should be concerned about with so little sleep?

796,"So I was with this one girl online for about a year (online relationship), we met on a game and I spent every single day talking to her. Every day even during school we would call. We got along so well since we have alot of things in common. And at the time she gave me all the attention I needed.
 Then during July 2019 my grandma was dying of cancer. I fell into self harm and I needed her then the most.  But she started acting weird. She would play games for 7+ hours and not text me the whole day. She once said to me that if I cut then she would cut herself.
I understand that I scared her and she had no idea what to do. And i know that it was partly my fault.
When my grandma died, she left me. Said I was too much to handle.
I ended up meeting a guy on a dating app. We decided to meet up and a few weeks later we got together. We've been dating for about four months now and he treats me so well. Hes always there for me and he makes sure I'm feeling okay. Hes even been to a therapy session with me. I'm the happiest I've ever been with him. 
A month ago I decided to text her and say I was sorry.
She said she was at fault and she was very sorry aswell. I got on our game that we met and we played together.
she started texting me again. 
I don't have any feelings for her. She knows I have a boyfriend. And I'm making sure she knows that this is strictly friendship.
I'm not telling her anything about my life or how I'm doing.
I dont mind being her friend again, but I want nothing more than that.
Somehow though, I feel insanely guilty. Like i feel the guilt as if I'm cheating on my current boyfriend. I talked to him about it and he said I'm not cheating and that hes okay with the friendship, he just said to be careful. 


Am I right to be feeling guilty about this? Its starting to hurt me physically. I want to be just online friends with her and nothing more, I dont know if what I'm doing is right or not. 

I am prepared to cut her off and block her if she does become toxic though.",09Jan2020,1
798,"Hi everybody. Sorry to post this, but I'm really paranoid right now and need some help. You should know I use to self harm, have struggled with suicidal ideations in the past and am really sensitive. 

I have been talking to someone for 4 months and I really really like them. They live in another country, but we are meeting soon in like a week. English is their second language. Meet through a family member of her's. I'm only 25(I turn 26 this year) so still young and they are only 23(they are 24 this year). They said they like me too about 8 weeks ago.

The last thing I said was a reply to them answering a previous question about what American food they have tried. I replied to that by saying: ""I bet it was really good! I'm on my lunch break. I was thinking of getting Mexican. Ever had that? I use to have a Mexican friend in HS. He was hilarious, but a troublemaker. Goodnight (insert name).""

It was midnight where they live by the time I saw the message(12 hr time difference), so I figured they were going to bed and didn't want to make them feel like they had to respond yet. That was yesterday, and I haven't heard back yet(they work 11 hours days so I figure they are busy). And I brought up the old friend because I thought it could be a conversation starter to tell a funny story. 

I'm so paranoid they are going to reject me because I said something stupid, or weird. I really don't want to be rejected. I do not like being thrown away over some miscommunication.

I'm so scared of my feelings not being returned because I have BPD. Did I say something bad? How do I not worry so much about getting rejected.",09Jan2020,1

TL;DR 
I’m too scared of being an adult, and i don’t know what to do.

801,"I'm in my late 20s and happily married. Got an early start and started first real job at 21 and made awesome money to support both of us. I was burnt out despite many promotions and the company had great benefits. With some early success in trading stocks, I decided to try trading full time. (a decision we made as a family)

Trading didn't work out. Luckily we had savings so now I'm in grad school while I try to figure out my next steps. My wife started working a few years ago and makes good money to support the both of us. I feel so self conscious and awful whenever someone asks what I do for a living (which is nothing right now), and whenever we have to make decisions I would seek her approval vs. seeing us as equal. Even worse, I find myself having absolutely no useful opinion on any matter until I hear her idea (not normal compared to few years ago). Career aspect: I can tell my lack of confidence and no real idea on a particular career path is affecting my performance during career fairs. The most feedback I got from interviewers were to brush up my interpersonal communications even though they were technical roles. I feel so invalidated by those feedback as I had many job offers that required interpersonal skills during undergrad, and my first job that I got raises and promotions was a customer facing job as well.

In a nutshell, I feel useless all the time and lost in life, and I have no idea what I want to do next (definitely not my old job). My wife has been very supportive and never gave me any negative reactions on my trading failure or that I look down on myself all the time. She tries to help and tells me how much she appreciates the things I do for our family (money support during our early years, cooking, logistics, fixing things, etc), but sometimes I feel even worse because I feel pathetic. I want to get better for me and for us, and I really need some advice on how to change my thinking and gain my confidence back!

803,"TL;DR Woud I be an asshole basically if I made jokes about using an exit bag, and then actually doing it? I don't think it would traumatise her at all, because she is much better off than me. She has a job, a perfect boyfriend, and she knows how to be social. She's also an amazing football player, and I feel like, when she plays, knowing I’m gone, she'll play even better because she's so happy that I'm gone.

All I really want is to become friends with my cousin, because cousin is not enough. I will ask her if she wants to come with me to a music festival (I will pay for her ticket which costs 130$), and I will also buy a gift for 60$, because it is her birthday in less than two months. If she wants to be my friend after this, I will not end it. However, if she still doesn't want to be my friend after that I don't know what to do, except ending it by using an exit bag. However I know she won't be sad at all if I'm gone, she’ll probably be happy to have no male cousin left. I just want to make my cousin happy, because if she never wants to be my friend, then me not being on this planet anymore would probably satisfy her. I don’t know however if it is a good idea to do it on her birthday. If I do it on her birthday I want to do it on her bed too. Maybe she'll think it'll ruin it, or she'll think it was just a dream come true. None of us is going to live forever either way, one day nothing you have done will matter.

The thing is, she's never said ""I don't want to be your friend"" but I know she doesn't want to be my friend because she always says she's busy when I want to hang out, or she's with her other friends. Reasons why I guess my cousin wouldn't want to be my friend:

First off, I'm very ugly, and second of all I am a guy, and though she has guy friends judging from her photos on Instagram, most of them are girls. Also I guess there is a bit of an age difference. I’m not turning 18 until summer, which is when you become an adult, and you are able to drink where me and my cousin lives. And my cousin likes to go out and drink with her friends sometimes, as I've sometimes seen on social media (at  least before she removed me from Snapchat). I'm also not very good at socialising, when I'm with my friends I usually just keep saying stupid shit, but when I get the lucky oppurtunity to be with my cousin I don't say a lot, because I don't know a lot to say that wouldn't come off as stupid or redundant. So basically I think at least a little bit more before I say something when I am with my cousin in comparison to when I am with my friends, and my friends are all guys from the age of 14 to 19.

My only other cousin is 14, and she's told me she doesn't want me to hurt myself, but I'm sure she just says that because it maybe was something she learned in school, or something from my aunt. I don't think she'd be traumatised either if I died.",09Jan2020,1

And the ones that are caught will only serve a small amount of time then go right back to what they were doing. 

I can’t stop thinking about this and picturing the innocent animals being in pain and the person enjoying it. And they’ll never get caught. I get so heated I want to cry. It makes me want to hunt the people who do this down and do what they did to the animals to them. 

I know this might sound like too much, but I think people who are so evil that they hurt innocent animals for their own sick pleasure deserve the death penalty. They deserve to have what they did to the animals to them so they can see how it feels.

If the universe were to restart in the same subatomic slate, would we be here again?

You dictate nothing, it’s just a combination of chemical reactions in your brain that were caused by atoms interacting with each other as they should. Did you decide to read this?

815,"So I won't disclose any names or the location of the incident for legal reasons and etc. I had 2 cousins who were twins (both 26 at the time). They were living alone with a roommate for several months. The roommate had a history of anger problems and he even lashed out before at one of my cousins. He was a severe alcoholic and that made his anger worse. My cousin who was killed got a gf and their roommate was jealous of him for that. Well a few weeks later they were all cleaning off their guns in the kitchen ( they went out to a shooting range that day). Their roommate was majorly drunk that night and drank a whole case of beer. My cousins brother got his gun cleaned and walked out of the room to put it up. That's when he heard the shot. He ran back into the kitchen and saw my cousin fall to the ground with a gunshot wound directly in the head. He was cradling him and yelling for help and somebody to call the police. The roommate who shot my cousin ran outside and neighbors around their house heard him screaming ""I shot my friend by accident, I killed my friend!"" My cousin died later that night at the hospital.... the autopsy showed that the gun was less than 2 inches from my cousins head when it was fired and the bullet went in right beside his ear. The killer said that he picked up the gun and it just went off on it's own. This caused the police to confiscate the gun and do intense testing on it. They discovered that it was not faulty in any way and that the trigger was in fact pulled. The killer has continued to lie about what happened and swearing up and down that he did not do it (even though the neighbors heard him shouting that he did). He got the best lawyer in the county (paying her $50k) to stand by him in trial. It's been a long and strenuous case and his lawyer just keeps on delaying the trials over and over. The thing that pisses me off is how is this tucker not arrested yet? He killed my cousin in cold blood and yet still walks free!?!? He still gets to have a life while our family has been saddened the past 4 fucking years. Why are the police doing nothing? They got all the evidence that they needed over the past 4 years to show that he did the crime intentionally and yet justice has still not been served!

822,"Right now, Im currently a sophomore in college and saving like mad, since both my parents have always been pretty bad with money growing up and I dont want to be like them. I have a pretty decent savings for a college student with little income, and I've put most of it into an investment portfolio with steady returns. It really isn't much, however, Im hoping that by adding a portion of my income to it every month for a while, eventually it'll reach something substantial. It helps that I dont spend much money in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, i've also come to the realization that both my parents are going to retire soon, and being an only child the burden of financially taking care of them falls solely on me. My mom has always joked about it, but Im not starting to think shes getting more serious. My dad has always said he can take care of himself, but I know his financial situation and that he struggles to keep up with hills bills sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both of them took out all their retirement savings and what they had saved for my college when I was younger to start a small business. That failed, and then they got into a really long divorce  that took out most of the rest of their savings. I dont have the details, but I also know that both of them also had some shit with the IRS over debt or unpaid taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the whole divorce thing, its not like I can make them both live with me when I'm older; they hate each other. I also wouldn't want to put them in a nursing home, I used to volunteer at one and it would not be a place I would want to send them, everyone was always sad and lonely and the nurses were really mean. But I honestly am lowkey pissed that Im going to set myself so far back financially for them. I spent a good chunk of my working life trying to secure my finances so I wouldn't end up borderline homeless like my mom and I in high school, my tuition is paid for by my uni and I never go out to restaurants or clubs like my friends do. I do owe them though, my dad helps out with my rent when he can since my part-time job cant cover the full expense without digging into my savings, and my mom raised me. But by the time im 25, they'll have entered the age of retirement and Ill end up with two people financially dependent on me when my career would have just started. Maybe I'll want kids in the future, but i wouldn't be able to afford that in a timely manner. If I get married, it'll also be an unnecessary financial burden on my spouse. I know this sounds greedy, but I feel that its really not my fault that they never bothered to save up. And I doubt social security will help much, since my mother only became a citizen a few years ago and Im pretty sure my dad is still in debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do besides saving like I already am to help lessen the future financial burden?  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR my parents are reaching the age of retirement with little to no way to support themselves, and I dont know if I can financially support them both in the future",09Jan2020,1

I was being told non stop to move on and I couldn't. I tried really hard but it made the pain worse. I found someone (Lets call her Jully) through an app and they were just a friend at first. I thought she was ungodly beautiful but I need more for me to have feelings. We'd talk every now and then Jully posted something about how her friend sent her a long ass paragraph of how pretty Jully was. I told her every word if it is right. Then my heart took over and told her how pretty she was. I mean it was deep. She ate it up. I made comment like ""I could do this everyday"". She told me to do it and then BOOOOOM. My heart sank. This girl wanted my love. Then I just kinda thought about and she just liked when I called her pretty. I thought that until I got to know her. I thought she was perfect for me. She is perfect for me. I started commenting in who she was and how I love how she is and she is. She's not the best at opening my chats because she has ALOTTT of people on her snap. She said she'd pin me but idk if she really did but I think she did because she responds better after I said something. When I stay up late, I get VERY emotional because I'm laying in my bed alone with nobody and I want someone right next to me. There's alot more to it but thats it. So my emotions take over which causes me to cry and I'll rather try to talk to a girl or post shit. Anything and everything I say when I am emotional is true but I normally wouldn't tell anybody. On one of those nights, I messaged her, ""I love you"". She hadn't opened it all night. So in the morning (Every morning I send her good morning.

Shes currently 17 and will be 18 later this year, when I thought she was like 23 to be honest.

she's a positive person and we get along so well... I want to keep in touch with her, but am not sure how to go about letting her know this.

I don't seek out people her age, and obviously have friends my age, but it seems shallow to discount a friend due to age.

maybe we just get coffee once, keep in touch until she's out of high school and then hang out more then?

827,"Last year I developed feelings for my best friend. I told her about them and she shot me down. She told me she’s still trying to figure herself out and that she doesn’t want to risk our friendship for a relationship.

In the past two months she’s been interested in two guys, one interest didn’t go anywhere and she moved on quickly. She still talks to the guy but not as intimately. The other interest she dated for a month before she had to break up with him. Because of this we drifted apart somewhat. I wanted to give her space so she could focus on them and could be happy with them, as I moved on. That didn’t really help me but she was happy.

She’s recently gotten out of a bad position with her father and she and I have gotten close again. I want to tell her that I have feelings still. I want her to know that I care about her so deeply that the only word I could use to describe it is love. Should I approach her about this and if so, how should I go about doing it?

Even if she shoots me down again I feel like I need to hear it in order to move on completely. A lot has happened in the past year for us so I’m not sure if her feelings have changed. Maybe it’s just hope but I would like to know for sure. But I also don’t want her to think the only reason I’ve been helping her is because I want to get with her.",09Jan2020,1
828,"Hello Reddit!

English is not my first language, so please don't be to harsh on my spelling/choice of vocabulary and stuff.

I would like to tell you my story, not as problematic as some others here, but any advice I could become would be helpful.   
Where do I begin to tell my story. I'm a 22 year young adult, with litteraly no real friends but a 16/yo Internet friend. She is like the only reason I motivate myself to live my life! She always keeps up my mood, she is definetly my soulmate, I don't really know, but recently I think I fell in love with her. I don't know about her, but it freaks me out, that I fell in love with a 16/yo! And I'm scared, that this could end our friendship! But beside my feelings for her, I helped her to get together with a boy she loves, and seeing her happy makes me happy, in the other side it destroys me inside, because I love her, and seeing her love someone else is just horrible somehow.

In my hometown, its not the problem that I don't know people. But all people I know don't really want to do something with me. Always when I ask, like some minutes before we made out, they get an excuse why they couldn't meet me. And if we meet, they just keep the meeting short. I'm very introverted, but whe nI know somebody, I really like to talk, about everything... but when I know someone, its the best thing you could do with me! I don't need all this stuff other people I doing... just talking about something, I just love it!

And, also a small thing... since some years I really long for hugs or something with human interaction. I really starve for something like this.

I had a girlfriend once, and it was the best feeling! All those compliments, this human contact, I love every part of it. But she went to a Trip for two weeks, and in this two weeks my depression hit again, and I stopped every contact I had with everyone but my internet friend, because I was scared to hurt someone or to be a pest with my depression. In the end she dumped me and I wa like ""ok, if you want this, have a happy life"". And since then its like hard to find a new girlfriend, because my introvert being and someone told me, i am ""to nice"". Like every girl I got my courage to try something, they friendzoned me. And I just hate it.

I had another ""thing"" that had a big reason for me, but in the last couple of months I just realized how fucket up this community I was is... they don't look after people who have problems, just want to get wasted and this all under the guise of a group that looks after children and young people. 

I'm just done, as I said, sometimes I my thoughts started to thing ""just end it all"", but like a moment later I thought about how sad my family and my internet friend would be, and this always gives me new energy!

Sorry for this ""weird"" story, and  my writing style, but I just needet to tell someone, Just tell mine problems in a nutshell.

My MIL who is about 15 years younger than him has been his sole caregiver. Her life has drastically changed regardless of my FIL age they used to always be pretty active, traveled and done things so her life has taken a total 360 yet still continues to work fulltime. Well here is where things get tricky for us my FIL has become extremely emotionally abusive towards her lately and its absolutely taken a toll on her as well as everything else she’s experienced the past year…  she has become depressed and anxious she’s also not eating much, lashes out, extremely forgetful calls us the wrong names however, she absolutely refuses any of our help she is from England and takes on everything herself she is a very prideful, stubborn women who will not accept help from any of us or others…more importantly she will not receive help for herself we have tried our best to give her information on caregiver support groups in the area as well as individual private therapy for her and she won’t do it.. not only is my husband losing his father more every day now he is losing his mother slowly she has even made a comment on Christmas to us that “she doesn’t want to be on this earth anymore” She is the absolute glue that holds our family together so we have no idea what we can do to help her if she doesn’t want to receive help. 

My husband and I live out of state which is heartbreaking for us because we can’t be there 24/7 for in person support however my SIL does what she can to help but MIL still refuses anyone’s help.. if anyone has any suggestions or advice PLEASE let me know or share your stories.

837,"So, about 3-4 years ago, I made some dumb choices. I was a young kid on the internet left pretty fairly unsupervised. I have gotten grounded many times and twice have had my phone taken away as a result of my mistakes. I'm not here to say I didn't deserve it or that my mom is horrible, but i'm just stating a timeline for you all to sort of grasp and have context. As a result, she looks through my phone. Now, I could be more fine with it if it weren't for the fact that she doesn't even want me to be on here, or discord, or pretty much anything that isn't Facebook and Instagram, places where she can fully monitor me and keep me like Fort Knox. Literally, mom doesn't know that I have a Reddit or discord account, I've had to hide the apps on my phone ((its and Apple iPhone 7 btw and I haven't ever tried any of those hiding apps since I tried one once and it didn't work to even hide the discord app)). 

It's been a fair amount of time, I've done a lot of growing and I've gotten to a point where I prioritize my actual real life with school, and yet she demands to see my stuff still. Last night struck a nerve for me more, as I have a school assigned computer and email. In the process of filling out an application for a Governor's school, which is basically 4 weeks in July for a chance for better education in things like Visual Art, Drama, Science, Music, etc, I had to access my email in order to get a link, my mom is sitting with me at the kitchen table. I have notifications from Google Classroom enabled, so the mailbox is full of emails constantly from when teachers upload new assignments. My mom gets that slightly heated tone in her voice, you know, like how moms do when they want to accuse you like ""WhOs ThIs?"". She looks at an email and says ""Whos this?"" and I (already being annoyed) had to explain that its my teacher. She keeps touching the computer and saying ""whos this,"" ""whats this?""

After putting up with her usual nonsense, she puts on the intimidating look (which still works on me sadly) and what I remember essentially boiled down to ""I have the **right** to monitor your digital things""

So, here I am. Mom knows the passcode to my phone. If I change it, she demands me to tell her the new code. I imagine if I get a fingerprint id, she's going to demand one for herself. I have to just manage to hide everything until I turn 18 this December. I know you're all probably going to tell me to listen to my mom or whatever, but literally I can't, I don't want to live in a virtual fort knox where im just doomed to have someone lingering over my head and ripping me of my privacy. I have so much anxiety that im being watched, I don't know just the extent of what she sees. She's questioning me on what obvious game apps are. She went through my note apps once and read personal things that I had written such as poems or even a full-on depression dump that I had wrote many months back. I get so anxious when she comes down the hall to use the bathroom because I think she's coming to my room. *I've been so anxious that I don't even want her in my room anymore.* My own mother. That's the part that makes me most upset about this. I have to value my things and my online friends more than I can the woman threatening to take them away if she finds enough of a reason for herself to take them. She literally doesn't trust me enough after so much time and I have very little trust in her

&amp;#x200B;

# tl;dr, My mom looks through my phone and if she finds out I have any online friends at all, she'll ground me forever and the very thought gives me anxiety so badly that I don't even like her being in my room. What do I do, or at the very least, how do I fix my anxiety/keep everything hidden still?",09Jan2020,1
838,"Some context: I moved into my long-term boyfriend's house a few years ago, which is divided into 3 living areas: His parents live in his basement suite that is not connected to the rest of the house, my boyfriend and I have the main floor, and his brother lives in the attic (it's a weird arrangement, and I don't like it, but that's a story for another time).

His mother owns a small dog, similar to a bichon frise, named Princess, and she is rarely around to look after her. Gone for months at a time, despite being able to take Princess with her. Because of this, I've taken on the task of looking after her dog since she stays on the main floor anyways. 

Onto the problem:

Princess is very old, about 14 or so, and I've saved her from death's door more than once since I moved in, but I think her time to go is very close. Her health has been declining and we've had to block off our living room because she has stopped going outside to do her business. I've grown up with two parent's who are veterinarians and have had jobs at their clinics, so I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to knowing when an animal is close to their end.

I don't have a lot of time to look after her, as I am a full time university student, and my boyfriend and his brother are working 8-10 hours a week as a semi-truck mechanics. We both love this dog, but I don't feel it wouldn't be worth it to take care of her anymore. I've tried speaking with his mother since it is HER dog, but she is one of those people where trying to make her see reason is like herding cats.

My question is: Even though she is not my dog, would it be a horrible thing to do to take her to the vet for a euthanasia, or at the very least talk to the vet about my options? The mother isn't here right now, so it would make the process a lot smoother, and I don't think she cares very much if she won't even take the dog with her when she goes away, let alone have Princess live in the basement suite with her.

I just don't know what to do, and would appreciate some pointers.",09Jan2020,1

I was offered by my English teacher if I want to participate in this speech contest, I decided to take the risk simply because of the cash prize.

My issue here isn't necessarily the anxiety, but what I should say in the speech.

I (16F) have a twin brother. We are practically opposites and almost no one believes us when we tell them we’re twins for the first time (although my friends reckon we have the same hands??). It’s as though he got one set of genes and me the other. 

I love him to death but sometimes being his twin specifically gets really annoying. 

To start, he is, according to almost every person attracted to males who have met my brother, “hot”. This is to the point we’re I get prank calls and anonymous messages telling me how attractive my brother is and he gets messages from random people asking him to meet up and “fuck”. I’m not as attractive as he is, he has had a couple girlfriends and countless girls wanting to date him and currently the only boy I’ve ever had who expressed interest in me was the grade 3 token gross kid. I’ve also had girls pretend to be my friend and hang out with me as a chance to get closer to my brother (this isn’t speculation, everything was waaaay to convenient to not have been)

My brother is also a lot more popular than me, recently he was invited to two parties by basically the same group of people recently (people from the same friendship group, but not my brothers) and almost all of my close friends were invited, but I was not. I tried to pretend that it didn’t bother me because I knew he was pissed at them for this but I told him not to say anything. He did, and I got halfassed messages from the organisers of both parties apologising, and a pity invite to the party that hadn’t happened yet, I declined because I’d already organised something else, and even if I hadn’t I would not have gone. 

He also is outstanding at literally every sport he plays, being recruited to the highest level of sports in age groups one or two age brackets higher than his own. I’m not bad at sport but people who know my brother always expect me to be better than I am. However I have numerous MVP trophies (he has more), but girls leagues are always easier to win these in than boys. 

Things were better when we were at different schools because only a few people at my school knew him but now he’s moved to my school (I was there first because I have an academic scholarship) and everyone knows him it’s hard not to be bothered by things. 

The only things that I’m better at than him are school (and he isn’t exactly shitty), cooking/baking and helping out around the house.

845,"So someone on Twitter posted a link on a post to a Reddit thread about some guy who claims to have persistent sexual side effects from fluoxetine (SSRI antidepressant medication) that he discontinued. I shared this information with my psychiatric PA and primary care physician and they both told me that while the sexual side effects of the fluoxetine may **temporarily** persist for up to three months after discontinuation, they have never encountered a case where it was somehow permanent. They also told me that ""Dr. Google"" is ridden with inaccurate and outdated information that should be taken with a grain of salt. 

The thing is that often times, doctors fail to provide all of the information about side effects and withdrawal symptoms from a psychiatric medication and educating yourself is ones best shot at being informed. This is a common trend since the end of the 20th century. If you had a question about a topic, you research on a search engine such as Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. However, I now know that not everything you encounter on a search results page is not accurate or reliable.

Here is my question. Is it still a good idea to use an online search engine to research non-medical topics? What should I do to avoid misinformaion?

850,"Hey everyone, posting this in a couple subs for visibility.

So, I'm a 29 year old male with a younger brother who's 15. My mom recently called me asking that I speak to him because she's pretty much at the end of her rope with him. Basically he's just being a totally disrespectful, entitled, and smug jerk to her at every corner, and at times he's been aggressive, vulgar, and just short of violent during altercations they've had. I don't believe he'd ever get physical with our mother, but he's a big kid for his age (6'2 maybe?) and it's clear that he likes to show that he's not intimidated by anyone because of it.

To give a little context about him, I don't believe he's a bad kid, just misguided and insecure. He only really acts out this way with my mother, and I guess my sister who all live together in a pretty small apartment. For the most part, he's a big gamer which is probably the biggest thing we have in common and he's obsessed with anime and Japanese culture. Being older, I wasn't around much for his upbringing. His father was pretty much useless and not around before he died a couple or so years ago. The only older male figure he truly had around in his life is our other brother who's about to be 20, who has always had this sort of thuggish mentality, and who always kind of bullied him. While their relationship has pretty much always been antagonistic, I can see that the youngest has this ""guarded tough guy"" yet superficial element to his persona that he picked up from his older sibling that clearly seems unnatural and out of place. In my eyes, he's an awkward lurchy teen who will deny how very much he cares what others think of him and is struggling to latch onto some sort of identity while evidently having a tough time with it. I can tell he's the smartest of my younger siblings, if not scatterbrained, obsessive, and ADHD-ridden as I am. From what I can tell, he's on the path to becoming an unironic walking living 'we live in a society bottom text' gamer meme, something my culturally conservative hispanic mother is ill-equipped to deal with. Cliche as it sounds, I think he just needs a positive role model and it's looking like I'm gonna have to step up to be the one. 

So, while I typically have always been pretty good at getting others to open up and a decent advice-giver, I've never really had to deal with someone this much younger than I. Just wanted to check in with good 'ol Reddit for some tips and insight. He's coming over in a couple days where I'll have to figure out a way to talk to him. 

Anything helps, and I can always get into more detail. If you've made it this far, you're a warrior and I appreciate you. Thank you.",09Jan2020,1
851,"To start I’m turning to Reddit as my best friend isn’t picking up and is probably busy so reddit is the best I’ve got. Before I get into what I actually need advice on I’ll provide some backstory of the whole situation and include all details I can. So about a month and a half ago I moved schools and was and have settled in nicely( for those wondering). About 3 days later a new girl joins and is in all my core subjects( science,math,English) I was the second person she spoke to since joining and we got on well. 3 days later we break up for Christmas holidays. By this point I got a weird feeling when seeing her but I suppressed it. A few days before going back I had a chat with the earlier mentioned friend and came to terms I had a thing for her( we had known each other about a week and a half by this point and talked as if we were really good friends, I showed zero signs of romantic interest). Last Monday we came back from break and I found she was dating the guy she sits next to in math. I was a bit taken aback by this but said nothing. Before going back I told myself to continue not to show and interest until at least 2 weeks into term, good call in hindsight. Everything was going fine until earlier today. We walked into science, had a normal conversation for about 5 minutes until she said” you know my friends think that you like me”. I deflected the question by asking which ons and she responded” quite a few” . The teacher then explained what to do and after she said “ yeah 5 of them have to.d me they think you like me” I deflected again by saying”of so less then I thought. Then throughout the lesson she’d begun acting differently. Every now and then she’d go out of her way to annoy me(not so much as to be an asshole but getting there) she would then forget about, talk for a bit make a few jokes then have remembrance moment and start again. She also at least twice opened her mouth to speak but changed her mind( I only saw her do it twice but was likely more as I was staring into my book most of the time. Also yesterday she told me to message her on Instagram and when I did she said she forgot what she wanted to message me about. At the end of lesson we usually talk on the way out but today she just left and did a slightly exaggerated walk on the way out. If anyone could please advise on what the fuck I’m meant o do tomorrow and what people might say to me/about me that would be great.",09Jan2020,1
852,"Hi, this is a very messy/emotional post, it's also a downsized version of the whole situation I have going on in my life right now, so I'm sorry if some things seem rushed or don't make sense.


It took me quite some time to figure out what i wanted to do with my life. 
Because of me being confused about my future studies and what job I would take on to do I did not attend college ( didn't even have grades for it) and instead started some course that is the closest I could find at the time to what I wanted to do ( work in the entertainment industry ).

I never really wanted to go, but my parents pushed me to enroll on it despite me telling them I didn't feel like it was really my thing. 
 
At the start of it I tried to remain positive and try to see the good side of things, but the more I got involved into the scene the more i hated everything. The way teachers teach, the subjects I had to take that I didn't identify with at all etc.

Also I finally had realized what I wanted to do specifically ( before the course I had realized I wanted to persue my passion in art and take it seriously as a job, but now, i realized what it was I wanted to do specifically in the industry).

So i decided I wanted to quit the course, start working and do another course for what I wanted (I planned on paying myself for the new course ). 

It took alot of courage to talk to my dad about my decision to leave, because you see my dad is quite a difficult person. He thinks of me as someone who doesn't have any motivation, is lazy, never finishes anything, and  as weak. He also wants me to kinda follow his foot steps and work on the same thing as him, and this course is perfect for that.


He told me to finish the course or  get out.  Queued in some comments about what he thinks of me and leaves. 

I know don't know what to do, as I wanna quit and follow my dream but I'm also questioning myself if im not being just foolish and not thinking ahead. If I'm really just being stupid by wanting to quit. In The course I'm in I get payed by the school so its almost like a job.",09Jan2020,1
853,"This might be a bit long, I'll try my best for a TLDR at the bottom.

I'm 25 and started college in late 2018. Due to some traumatic events during my teens I isolated myself for years in my room doing nothing, so I'm only just now continuing my education and I have no experience with jobs nor do I have any marketable skills. I feel lost, I have so little worldly experience or direction and I feel like I'm just now finding my way in life and learning things I should've learned a decade ago.

I'm pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science, but last year I made some pretty bad mistakes and completely dropped two semesters straight and lost my financial aid. The appeals office told me that without solid proof of why I dropped, I had no chance of getting my aid back. I have no proof, nor any precise reason for why I dropped those semesters, I was just unmotivated. I'm enrolled in the current semester and I feel completely different, highly motivated and with a strong drive to succeed this time around, but without financial aid I can't afford my tuition.

I currently work for an online company, as a search results evaluator at $14/hr. It's part time work and the hours are flexible, but they also vary between 10-20 hours per week and anything less than 20 is not enough to pay for my classes. I've been pondering whether to attempt to apply for a different job, but there lies the problem. I have no real skills, so my only options would probably be retail or factory work. In my area these kinds of jobs usually pay less than $14 for an entry position, which would mean a downgrade in pay. I'm also restricted in the kinds of jobs I can take. Most of my classes are only available in the morning, so I can't work morning shifts. I can't work night shifts because I would have no energy for classes the next morning, so evening shifts are my only option. If I take a full-time, 8 hour a day job, I would have very little time to work on my schoolwork. I would wake up, go to class, come home and immediately start work, then come home and immediately sleep to be up in time for school. I would only have the weekend to do a full week's worth of studying and work for 4 classes, if I even get two guaranteed days off to begin with. I have ADHD and it often takes me longer than usual to do coursework because I need extra time to focus.

So that's where I'm at. My options for getting a job that both fits my rigid schedule and pays enough to cover my tuition are very low. I live with my dad who is a retired mechanic, but he's disabled and has a fixed(low) income. He would not be able to provide any significant support for my tuition. I'm worried and anxious about having a career, especially at my age. I've heard that gaps in work history are a red flag to employers, and being 25 with no work history and no real explanation for why, I'm afraid I'll never be hired by even basic jobs. My resume is nearly blank from my lack of history or skills, and after locking myself away for so long I have social anxiety and I'm nervous and stumble on my words around people. I feel lost and pathetic and don't know what to do to salvage my life. Any advice for anything would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR; 25 with no skills, no job history, and no financial aid and unsure if I can pay for college while working at the same time. What do I do?",09Jan2020,1

856,"So I’ve been really relaxed with my new relationship of 3 months, and my boyfriend made me the happiest girl in the world and things were going great...till New Year’s Eve....the problem with my boyfriend is that he’s very into going out and drinking and partying, but he insists that because he’s a fairly big dude he’s able to sober up quickly and stay responsible. New Year’s Eve, I posted selfies to my Snapchat story after a dinner I went to because after struggling with body image for years I was really feeling it!!! At around 1am he calls me, crossfaded, crying hysterically, asking me  “what the fuck is on your story????!?” He called me a whore, said I was stupid, said he was done with me, etc. the next morning he apologized profusely and then decided to set “rules” they are as follows:
-gotta send him pics before I post them
-can’t drink without him
-can’t go to parties without him
-keep my location on
So anyways, he goes to a dance hall within the next few days without me (I was fixin to be in the Bahamas) and while I’m just chillin at home he goes and gets a girls Snapchat and they start talking after they’ve danced. (I don’t know this at this point) but the next morning I ask him if he’s danced with any girls, he says of course not! I asked him how that would go if he wanted to dance with a girl and he said, “as long as everything stays on the dance floor then it’s appropriate, don’t get their number, don’t get their snap, just dance” and so that was the end of our convo. He knows I’ve been cheated on in the past REPEATEDLY so lies strike a nerve with me. He decided to break the news that him and this girl have been talking on snap since that night, and that he still loves me, but it’s my fault that he lied because he knew I’d freak out if he told me. Despite my efforts to tell him I’m cool with it if he doesn’t lie, he still maintains that it was my fault that he lied and he did it because he loves me.

859," 

A work colleague of mine who I care very much about has lost her mother just a few days ago. I have already reached out and offered my condolences and support in any capacity that she might need. However; I already know that when a person suffers a loss of such magnitude, they probably won't have the energy or be willing to pick up the phone and call. I know that I have to be proactive if I want to be there for her.

However, she is also married; so for example I can't call her up and offer to come in and cook dinner for her family, I think that would be very weird and intrusive. What are some practical ways I can be of support without there being a misunderstanding of me ""intruding"" in someone else's family life?

Hi Reddit, I Need your help with a little something.

So, tomorrow will be a really fucked up School schedule for me. Basically I Start my School day off with Two lessons. All good right? Well After that I have to wait 4 HOURS until my next two lessons.

 Of course I could wait those fucking 4 hours if I Wanted, but if I am honest, I don't have the fucking patience to wait 4 hours just for Two sports lessons. The reason Why I don't have many lessons tomorrow is because my History teacher is Away in Poland, so thats Two lessons gone and then I literally have 90 minutes of nothing.... 

Yes you read correct. Every Friday I get the 5th and 6th lesson off. But having the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th lesson off is too much for me. So why Not just pretend to be ill? Well tomorrow I have an English oral exam in the First Two lessons so thats out of the question and also going up to my sports teacher to tell her that I don't want to participate in the Two lessons she will be like: ""Oh thats okay don't worry ! Just sit on  the Bench for the Two lessons !""

Moreover the fact that we are doing Yoga as a Topic doesn't make it worth it for me to wait 4 hours. Does anyone have a Good Excuse so I can leave School After the Second lesson ?

Any Suggestion would really be appreciated !",09Jan2020,1

This text came out of no where for me and it has brought questions to my mind that I have never had before.

Before I continue I guess I should give some information about my boyfriend: 

He’s 21, in college, and he struggles from depression. He used to get high a lot behind my back, had a fake med card that he willingly gave me to destroy. He went through THC withdrawal and was seriously tired and sick because of it. That’s gotten better. My main concern is that he’s resorted to other outlets to escape his problems. He sleeps a lot mainly but lately he’s been getting drunk by noon and he’s stolen adderall from his friend twice. He can’t control himself if it’s in his presence; although I will be moving in by March, I can’t baby him and be controlling. 

He just started therapy and has been on his antidepressants for some time now, yet he still feels like he can never get better. He wants to sober up, he always feels guilty when he gets drunk or sleeps a lot which creates this loop of escaping his problems in the way he does and feeling guilty. I’ve tried being there for him whenever I can, and some days he feels better than others. I try to remind him that it takes time to get better and that no addict really knows when or how to start getting better, that it’s gonna be trial and error until he finds something that works for him.

880,"I (23M) have been friends with this girl, Grace (22F), for almost three years. We first met as a one night stand through a Tinder. When I got to Grace's place I didn't think she looked much like her photos and I just wasn't attracted to her, but she made it clear she wanted to casually hook up so we did. Pretty soon after, I told her I had a good time but I didn't see a relationship going anywhere, so we stopped talking for a while.

A few months later Grace called me and told me she had moved closer, so she wanted to hang out as friends. I agreed, and I learned pretty quickly that when we had first met, she was really, really into me and was crushed when I said I didn't see us going anywhere. I told her I couldn't explain why I'm attracted to certain people or not, I just didn't feel it with her.

We continued hanging out platonically. I wanted to make sure if we started to get closer, my intentions of remaining friends were clear and we were on the same page. In a previous relationship I did not feel I had a lot in common with my girlfriend, both in our interests and in our values. I am non-confrontational so I let the relationship go on for almost a year and we were both miserable. So with Grace, I didn't want to grow closer, be ""convinced"" to be in a relationship, then wake up to find myself stuck and unattracted one day.

She met a few of my friends over the next few weeks and said she really enjoyed the dynamic she had with them, that it was just very different from her own friends and she felt like she could be more open with them or talk about more complex issues. She integrated pretty well into my group, and we ended up seeing each other almost daily. After my undergrad, most other friends moved far away, got into more serious relationships, got into their careers, but Grace was still always there and wanting to spend time together.

We have become very close over the past year. We are always holding some kind of conversation, going to restaurants, watching movies all the time. We have both been seeing other people during this time, but neither of us is very proactive in our dating lives so we end up spending more time together.

There have been multiple occasions where we directly and indirectly addressed my lack of feelings for her. We had a talk a couple months ago about the intimate nature of our friendship. We both agreed it was a bit strange. We are definitely more than friends, but there is zero romantic or sexual component to our relationship. But we agreed that we both enjoy and feel this weird relationship is positive at this point in our lives.

Recently we had our own little winter celebration where we spent the evening together exchanged gifts. My family life is a wreck so my holidays were pretty shit. Grace single-handedly made the worst holiday into one of the best. I have never felt cared for by anyone else to this extent. She is one of the most thoughtful and kind people I have ever met. She has an incredible personality. We get along so well, we could hang out every day and I'd never get bored.

I can't help but feel she still wants something to happen between us. I don't know what to do. I have talked to so many people about how Grace checks off so many boxes. I love her so much for the person she is and the role she has played in my life. But I just am not romantically attracted to her for reasons out of my control.

I feel like such an asshole because it feels like everything should click. What am I holding out for? I obviously can spend every day with this woman. I don't feel like I find her physically unattractive either. I am just terrified that this natural attraction is a vital component to the long term success of a romantic relationship, and if I give in, we might both end up unhappy.

881,"Just to be clear, I consider myself to be in good health (Male, 180cm, ~80kg).

I've noticed that lately I've been getting really hungry usually at night, up to the point where sometimes I just make what I would consider big portions of pasta, ramen, beans or fried rice for dinner. I make my food as healthy and as homemade as I can since I love to cook.

Sometimes I notice that I get really hungry. Today, for example, I ate for dinner a small bowl of spaghetti with mushrooms and meatballs, a serving of porridge and an apple. Sometimes I just eat like two topped small bowls of food for lunch or dinner. 

I guess that as long as I keep being in good health, there is no problem. But sometimes I think if I'm spending too much on groceries due to the amounts I'm eating.

I dunno why but I just feel like this and even thought I don't like the way I am acting now, I can't help but feel that way. I have tried to think positively but there is no point in lying to myself.

888,"Please let me know if this post should be on some other subreddit, I'm new here.

  
Backstory: I've had a new neighbor for about five months now. It's a 1960's apartment complex. Me and my neighbors air vents are connected, one in our bathrooms and one in our kitchens. You can hear the conversations my neighbor has in his kitchen etc. Both of our apartments are about 30m2 studios. 

I think he either has absolutely burned off his nose so he's not able to smell anything and loves to lather his apartment with old grandma parfum or he smokes something weird. After about a week of him moving in I noticed he smokes weed. Thank God he smokes outdoors. Weed is illegal where I live, but I'm not bothered. The stairway only smells like weed after he comes back inside, which is fine for me. 

However after a few months the smell of weed hasn't been there too often. Instead the stairway reeks like old grandma parfum. This time the smell also creeps in to my kitchen and bathroom through the air vents. This makes me believe the source of the smell comes from his apartment. It's like the parfum has gone off like 30 years ago but the grandma can't smell anything anymore so she puts on more just to be sure, causing everyone's nose hairs to burn off and make them pass out.

Is my neighbor just cleaning his apartment with crazy stuff or is he smoking something I'm not familiar with? The smell just creeped into my apartment and it's around midnight here. I've never smelled anyone smoking anything like this, not even in a bong. He doesn't have too many guests over and nothing weird ever seems to happen in his apartment.",09Jan2020,1

891,"so there's a long story to this, but I'm going to try and keep it short. basically, someone my sister(14) knew tried to commit murder. she started getting really paranoid over that and would refuse to go to bed without making sure everyone is home and that the doors are completely locked. 

skip to two months later. she blocked some boy on insta and he messaged her on snapchat to unblock her, and said that he has guns he knows how to use if she doesn't. 

so now my sister believes that if she gets on someone's bad side, they'll try to kill her or everyone in my household. she's been struggling to sleep and I've seen her cry almost every day. she can't even sleep on her own and has been sleeping either in my room or my parents every night.

893,I've asked someone to write a recommendation letter for a political internship. He asked me about the details so he can be specific when writing the recommendation letter but there aren't any specifics. If you were writing the letter what would you address?,09Jan2020,1
894,"I have called my boyfriend controlling and jealous before. And I've told him multiple times that he sometimes acts like my parents with the way he talks to me, or with the things he asks of me. He gets very annoyed by this because he (like me) doesn't like my parents (this is something we're on the same page about).

He's been making the changes per his therapist's advice, and he's always willing to change certain things if I ask.

I only ask for what I think are minor things, or things that by default should be done. If he doesn't comply, I let it go or calmly give him a reminder. Examples would be:

1. Me: ""I got this for you.""  
I present a strawberry soda, which I specifically bought because I know he likes strawberry-flavored things. 

Instead of saying something polite like, ""Thanks, but I might not like the taste,"" he just said, ""Eh. I'm not sure about the flavor,"" then just ignores the soda I'm handing to him. 

I was annoyed and he noticed so I told him what he could have said instead of just, ""Eh."" He immediately started saying thank you whenever I did something for him.

2. He lied for a few months about how he was working on his thesis to finish college. He finally broke down and told me that he still had a few subjects to take, and that he hadn't even started on his thesis. It was an emotional discussion to say the least. 

We agreed that he might be depressed so he started seeing a therapist (for me, I have a psychiatrist whom I've been seeing for a couple years now, and a talk therapist whom I've been seeing for around a year).

Because of this, I asked him to just finish college, which he has been trying to finish for 10 years (we started college in the same school, same year; I'm now taking my masters and he's still finishing college). I even offered to help him out with his thesis and other requirements. I only asked because in our country it's mandatory to have graduated from college in order to get a decent job. 

Also, he has a specific career in mind that he really wants to go for. Basically, it's a given that you have to finish college. He's now on track to graduate this year.

3. Be more considerate of others. Like when he goes through a doorway ahead of me, he used to just let it close, even though he knew I was right behind him. Sometimes he even pulled the door shut ""out of habit."" He was able to make it a habit of keeping the door open if I was behind him.

4. Exercise. (This one he doesn't do.) He's obese (over 200 pounds), and has a lot of health problems because of it. Nothing too serious -- just things that he needs to take medication for, for maintenance.

\----   
These are the things he asks of me, and he gets annoyed and angry at me when I don't comply:  


1. This I've complied with: Tell my psychiatrist and my therapist about my DXM addiction (I used to take 1000mg a day to get a high when the therapeutic dose is around 30mg or less), and lessen/stop my usage of the drug. 

I did lessen my usage to half of what I used to take (500mg/day) and am aiming to slowly take less and less until I stop completely.

Also, on my boyfriend's advice, I told both of them about how I was raped 8 years ago by my then boyfriend.

I told my psychiatrist and therapist about the addiction and rape. My psychiatrist referred me to a woman who was both an addiction specialist and PTSD therapist in the same hospital. I'm now about to start having regular sessions with her (after all the psych evaluations and stuff). 

So I'm now seeing 3 different specialists for my mild-spectrum bipolar II disorder, my addiction, and depression and anxiety, and PTSD.

These are all big changes for me, especially since I'm a very private person and am uncomfortable with being open about my problems with other people (my parents were emotionally abusive and distant when I was growing up--I think this contributed to how I am now).  


2. Fix my sleep schedule. I'm a night owl, and don't really need to sleep early because the classes I'm taking are at night. Still, I try to sleep at a reasonable hour and wake up early; most of the time, I'm able to do this. 

Sometimes, though, I break that cycle and end up sleeping at 5am, then waking up at 11am or 12pm. When this happens my boyfriend gets very irritated, and starts saying that I don't listen to him even though his suggestions are good for me and my health. He doesn't always get all riled up, but most of the time he does.

3. Eat 3 big meals a day, like him. If I fail to do this, or seem to lack energy, he becomes stern with me. I've gotten used to eating 4-6 small meals a day per my former nutritionist's instructions. 

My boyfriend believes that this eating schedule doesn't work for me because I sometimes get sleepy during the day because I ate ""too little."" I'm almost never hungry, though, and have enough energy to stay awake the whole day.

Meanwhile, my boyfriend has to take 2-3 naps during the day when he's not doing anything.

4. Be on time when visiting him (even though he has no other plans and is just going to stay in the house all day). I understand where he's coming from, since I'm sometimes late by 2-3 hours. But I sometimes wish he'd be more flexible, especially since I'm not late for anything important--he's usually just in his house playing video games, and when I'm there he still plays while I do something else; either that or we have sex. I even update him if I stop to buy something on the way or gas up or whatever, which is why I'm late.

\-----  
I'd like to get your opinion on this because I feel like it's an unhealthy, codependent relationship. He needs me to need him. Almost literally everything he does in his life revolves around me--he's said this to his therapist too. 

He hates it when I don't take his suggestions about doing something a certain way. 

He thinks that our relationship shouldn't be two persons being together, both with their own individual selves and personalities. 

He thinks we should be united as one entity that works with the other (or something like that). 

This is why he thinks that the changes we ask of each other should be immediately addressed, even though some of the things he asks of me will take time because they relate to my nature, the habits that I've had since I was a teenager.

What do you think? Am I in the wrong?

\------

TL;DR:

I think my boyfriend and I have an unhealthy, codependent relationship. He needs me to need him.

I feel my boyfriend is asking me to change too much major things about myself too soon/fast. When I don't comply right away, he gets annoyed/angry.

I think I ask for simpler/common things, and if he doesn't/can't comply, I don't make a big deal out of it because I know long held habits are hard to change. The most I do is remind him about it.",09Jan2020,1

Literally every class he flicks me, steals my pencil or calculator or takes my water battle or says a whole lot of shit and then a few minutes later he starts acting nice to me and then afterwards he goes back to flicking me or touching my hair and doing annoying things. He keeps asking me the type of girls I like and weird things like that when we are in the middle of physics.

901,"So a little intro, I've been working for my company for two years now and I'm enjoying my time here a lot. Recently somebody from my team left and since I was already trained for most of his tasks I was told to take over his position until management found a new candidate. I've expressed intrest in the position, but they said that they would rather want someone with more experience in that particular field to take the job. Fair enough, in the end, that's their call.  


Couple weeks later they hire somebody to take over the position that I'm currently doing so that I can go back to my original position. I'm currently training this person and I've found that he/she has no experience and not even the right credentials for this position. This person has the exact same degree as I do, but lacks the 2 years of experience working in this kind of business.

How do I go about telling management that I would be more suitable for the job? They already know that I wanted, should I let them know again?

So John and Sam (obviously not real names) are a couple, they've been going out for near 2 years now. A few months after they started dating, Sam thought it'd be a really funny joke if she told John that she was born in Malta, she was clearly not and had never been there before, but John got really excited and asked her all about it. She made up a story about how her older brother was born in Australia, a year later she was born in Malta, lived there for a month or 2, then her younger brothers were born in Australia a few years later. John told his parents one night which caused them to ask Sam about it, she didn't want to look like an asshole in front of John's parents so she told the story again... she never anticipated that John would believe it and felt bad because of his excitement. So now they've been going out for near 2 years, she feels it's time to tell him. She thinks it'll be fine if she just tells him it was a joke.

This girl proceeded to tell people that I was super creepy and kept touching her when she said not to (only after I stopped talking to her).

So I just finished a few passive income projects that are fully funding my wife and my income needs.  They took me about 6 years and still need about a day a week of attention. I have a company I will start in 10 months, but over the past month I've been driving myself crazy with boredom and lack of human interaction.

I thought that hobbies would be great, but they just aren't fulfilling at all. I've been spending 2-3 hours on music and 2 hours on language learning but it is not doing it for me. I love working and can't imagine doing what I am now for the next 10 months. I am the best and worst 4 hour work week example lol.

I can't travel (wife is pregnant and 40 hr employed), and I definitely don't need any more hobbies. I've tried volunteering a few times but it hasn't worked out. (I would be very open to good volunteering suggestions). I also have found that the online consulting (upwork) world has been unfruitful.

I'm a CFA charter holder, have an engineering degree, and love problem solving.  I don't really care at this point what it pays (obviously more is better), but it needs to be interesting and less than 30 hrs.

My SO (significant other) has a younger sibling who is a few years younger than us, not by much. They have had trouble with bonding with people and communication as far as I know. They have been through a lot, and lack people to really talk to besides their older sibling, my SO. 

I myself am the youngest in my family, and have never had to act like an older sibling or more responsible person towards someone who might look at me for guidance. I currently do not talk to them very often, the occasional text is the extent of our relationship. I do not know them very well myself but they seem like a good person.

How could I be better at engaging in conversations better with them? I specifically want to know from older siblings what they do for their younger siblings that make them happy or get closer. And younger siblings like myself, please tell me things your older siblings do or you want them to do for you to make you feel loved, and happy. Furthermore any advice on how to help them get better at making friends? I have a good few I trust, but he needs someone he can also rely on in place of me and my SO.

928,I recently started a new alternative school where there is about 10 stundents in the whole school and we stay together for each class and i started trying to make some new friends and one girl very quickly started talking to me which you would think would be good but no. First shes a furry which im fine with but it gets worse. Second she smells like a bad case of swamp ass mixed with a case of athletes foot and honestly that might be too nice. Third she follows me around ALL DAY and i cant get away do to us staying together for the whole day and she has “jokes” which is just the SO RANDOM XD type of comedy and me being a non confrontational person I fake laugh and try to get away but it doesn't work. So I need some help to nicely tell someone to fuck off,09Jan2020,1

932,"I need advice for my sister. An older woman was speeding down her street on New Years Evening and barreled into her parked minivan. It hit her car with enough force to push her car three feet into the backend of her friend’s brand new car. My sister has just bought the car a little over a year ago. 

The woman was ticketed and found to be 100% at fault. 

My sister initially had gap insurance when she financed through the dealer and then refinanced for lower interest rate. Not sure that the gap insurance transferred. 

She was just informed that her new minivan is totaled. 

She is pretty sure that she is upside down on the loan because the car was so new. 

Her car was literally parked outside her house on the street minding it’s own business. 

Is there any advice this community thinks that I could give to my sister to help her?",09Jan2020,1
933,"I'm 18 and turning 19 in March. I've never dated and have crippling anxiety. This anxiety means I cannot be myself in front anyone. Which as you can imagine is extremely difficult if you're trying to find a partner. The anxiety mainly stems from my looks. 

The stigma is there but I'm wondering when I should be worried about not having any experience at all. I'm struggling to find confidence in myself especially when I see someone more attractive than me whether it be a man or woman. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I've been to therapy twice and it has zero effect. I've read on anxiety and depression as much as I can yet I still am not getting better.",09Jan2020,1

935,"About two days ago I (F19) was working at the cash register when all of a sudden a reallyy cute guy asks for my snapchat. And naturally in the moment I was like sure why not because I felt flattered and also was just trying to be nice. But by the time I got home and saw his messages I realized it was a bad idea and deeply regret it. 

The many reasons as to why I regretted it were because (1) this dude looks like mid to late 20s and I know ""age is just a number"" but I honestly dont know if I'm comfortable dating someone older. (2) I dont know if I could talk to another guy knowing I have a huge crush on another guy. And (3) I just dont think Its the right time for me to be dating anyone.

He messaged me yesterday during work saying I looked cute and I never responded (mostly due to the fact that the area i live in does not have any signal). Even still I am not sure what to do, he messaged me again today and I still havent replied to or opened any of the messages because I have no clue what to say because I dont want to hurt his feelings.

Should I just reply and talk to him? I just really don't want to lead him on. Can someone please give me advice on what to say or do?",09Jan2020,1

937,"I've been working at my current job, a snake breeding facility, for a year. It doesn't pay well and when I've asked for a raise my bosses have told me I'm not supposed to and they'll give it to me if I earn it. I'm currently at $10/hr right now and work 2 full days a week with 2 half days. I enjoy what I do, for the most part and it has to do with my degree (wildlife Ecology). I also feel I am very important to keeping things running smooth here. I know many aspects of the job that no one else does, but I have not been allowed to teach people what I do. I've been pretty unhappy with this job for a while, but feel I need to stay as it's reliable and flexible with my school schedule (I'm a college student). 

I went to the auto shop today to get my struts changed on my car and I was really hitting it off with the workers there, including the manager. I've been dabbling into cars the past few months (I went from being interested to obsessed) and at one point the manager mentioned he was short staffed  and I said that I wish I could work on cars, but I just don't know enough/don't have money for a project car. He got really into the idea of me applying there and began assuring me they would teach me everything. I would be started at $10/hr and once I got past the training I would be considered for a raise. I would work every day of the week except Monday and Wednesday (when I have my class). 

I really, really want to try something new, work on some cars and see if it's something I'd like to do but I'm really scared about leaving my current job. My boyfriend thinks I should take the opportunity and say fuck it to the old place since I've been wanting to for awhile. I'm just afraid about next semester when my school schedule gets crazy if it'll be accommodated or if I'll be out of a job. I feel like my current boss would rehire me, but if I left now I'd be leaving at a time of year where they really need people. I'm also concerned about leaving a job focused on my career path for something I'm not even sure I want to do. I'm very conflicted.",09Jan2020,1

939,"Hi. I've never been a person to do new years resolutions, so this year I decided to pick something and commit for a month. Anyone can do anything for a month, and being that it's a personal journey, I only have to answer to myself. This is what I am doing this month and next month.

January:  Vow of Vulgarity, Profanity, and Gluttony.

Being the first month, I wanted to start with a reasonably easy challenge. I am not allowing myself to use swear/curse words. This conflicts my belief that curse words are like the salt and pepper of language. You add as needed for flavor. but this month I am now using swear words. I am also not allowing myself to look at any kind of pron, or sexy women photos that would give lustful thoughts. This one is pretty easy, but I had to delete instagram off my phone, and leave MANY subreddits. Just being honest. And finally. No candy or sweets this month. I have a serious skittle problem and not allowing myself that magical rainbow is the most difficult thing of this month, although I have to admit, this month is somewhat a gimmie.

&amp;#x200B;

February: Vow of Silence and Spiritual Knowledge

Basically, I won't be speaking for the month of February. I think this will mature me as a man and show me the value of words. There are exceptions tho, I can text, I will have a dry erase board with me all the time, and I really hope I gain compass and empathy for the mute. Also, I will begin readying the Bible, Quran, and Jewish religious texts. Not because I nessisarily believe in any of them, but I want to be informed on what these religions truly believe. Instead of the fear mongering that occurs with Muslims, I want to find out for myself what they believe. This will be a difficult month.

&amp;#x200B;

I have other months planned. Deafness will be where I wear ear plugs constantly, mainly to understand the hearing impaired. I dated a girl in high school who had hearing issues and I never could relate, So I am hoping this will help me. I'm considering going plant based for a month. Considering going technology free (no internet or television, etc) Although I have these ideas for other months, I only have 8 months of ideas. I was hoping to get some suggestions from you guys on what I could do to grow as a human being.

I have been taking notes daily, and at the end of the year I am going to write my experiences and publish it. So I think its a pretty cool idea. Do you guys have any thoughts on what I can do to grow for the other months.",09Jan2020,1
940,"A little bit about me

* I have 4 years working in IT, and could possibly graduate this July.
* I'm 24 y/o
* Currently unemployed living at home
* I have 30k in savings

Option (A): So I currently live in Utah and this place just isn't for me.  I plan on moving to either San Diego or Chicago as I love both of those cities.  I've been applying for jobs, but it's quite difficult as I'm currently living in another state.  I will likely have to move there and  just rely on my savings until I find any job I can.  It just seems risky.

Option (B): I do have a girlfriend in China, but I can't work there legally (though many of my friends work there illegally and can easily find me a job teaching English).   My girlfriend and I don't really see a future together because of a few things (including distance).  Of course things can change, and I can definitely save money, but it just seems a little sketchy working in China illegally.  

These are my main two options I've been considering.  Making life changing decisions is tough.  I'd just love to hear what you would do in my situation.  I'm getting desperate to just do something rather than live with my parents.  I'm going crazy here.

My college’s D1 baseball team recently posted on twitter that they’re looking for a full time student to throw batting practice for the team, and they will provide lunch every day, team gear, and even pay. I emailed the guy who posted it and he replied and told me he would love for me to meet them at the field during the first week of classes. However, it is an everyday commitment from 1-3 pm, every day. I have classes scheduled during those hours, but I can reschedule them. I’m more worried about how big of a time commitment it would be. obviously I want to allocate the majority of my time to classes so I can redeem my poor gpa from the first semester, but I also want to take this opportunity because this is seriously a big deal for me. so i have to make a decision, and I was hoping you guys and girls could help me make one.",09Jan2020,1

Went through homelessness, in and out of friends couches, sleeping in a tent in the middle of winter.

943,"Hello! I am a 17 year old girl and I am writing this because I don't know how to make a living out of the things I enjoy, I would like someone to help me with this because my family is expecting me to go to university when I will be 18.

*I know this post is long but if you could help me I would greatly appreciate it!*

**My passions**

I love life right now! I homeschool myself, I love love *love* reading books about (I do not like fiction books at all) anthropology, nature, philosophy, the environment, ecology... and here I am shamefully admitting that I also loved to watch conspiracy theories when I was a child, for as long as I can remember I loved the excitement of knowing something most people don't. *ANYWAY*...

I love to walk outside and think to myself about my ideas, I love to travel with my family and have new fun experiences! I love woodcarving, playing piano, singing, planting flowers, shooting bow, I would LOVE to try horse riding! and I love to live the life I'm living now, but in a year I will be an adult and I will have to support myself in some way, so I can continue doing the things I'm doing.

**What I will NOT do**

""If you love nature and the environment so much, why not become a scientist?"" my family asks me. I did consider that a year ago, you know in adventure films when theres the scientist who sits and studies the new place or whatever, and the person who actually discovers/explores it? i'd rather be the one who explores it... but there is nothing like that and I am *terrified* of even minimal danger... anxiety on planes, anxiety when going to the forest (It was okay half a year ago, but the recent reports of wolves in our area has terrified me, I live in the countryside FYI) so I can't do that either!

I don't want to be an author, I never wrote as a child, I just drew stories and acted a lot. University is too ""sciency"" for me and I learn best by doing, not by memorizing boring facts that we have no idea are even true because science is *always* changing. I'm starting to think there is no ""path"" for me... =(

**What my goals are**

Since I am in the countryside and there are no jobs here, I would need to either be self employed, have some sort of business (online, there is *nothing* here) or move out of the countryside, I *don't* want to move out of the countryside, even though my family tells me that here there is no future.

I've been thinking about this for a while, something being self employed or a business sounds like a good option but I don't know what it would be about! I don't want to teach anything... I'm 17 what could I possibly teach?

I want to do something that is important! I also want to make a lot of money so that I can help support my family.

please help me with this! thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",09Jan2020,1

947,"I'm not the most interesting guy. I'm resourceful but not interesting and I feel that may be the reason that my best friend usually shuts me down when I ask her if she wants to hang out or do something. Sometimes she takes an entire day to reply to a message which could easily be replied within a couple seconds: ""Are you free to meet up later?"" and 9 hours later ""No I was busy."" 

Other times I will hear stories from other people how she was doing this activity with someone else even though she doesnt know then well. 

I understand that I shouldn't consider this to be too big of a deal but it is not her normal behaviour. My thoughts may be all over the place so I'll try to organize them. 

1) For years I've been her friend and supported her through whatever she needed and I know her behaviour pretty well. She would reply within seconds or at most an hour if anything. She always wanted to hang out. 

2) For the past 2 years, shes slowly began getting futher away from people in general, although it seems directed towards me especially. I have often heard from other people about her being very social and yet I am told a very different perspective by her. 

3) She has some diagnosed anxiety/insomnia problems and I feel that this may be a reason she feels like she doesnt want to deal with my ""energy."" My energy isn't bad, I'm just not that interesting. She acknowledges me as her best friend and has for a long long time now. 

4) I dont want to probe her much because I have never had any diagnosed problems and I try to help her as much as possible because I dont know how she would react if i told her i felt underappreciated.  I am a very straightforward person and being unable to express my concerns weight a lot on me but I know it's better than causing her unnecessary panic attacks. 

So i come to my final point: I get ignored and to me it seems deliberate. However, I do like giving the benifit of the doubt and always be supportive. I cant bring up anything too serious because I don't want to cause unintentional harm to her well being and yet I still feel shitty. It may be temporary.

How do I not take it to heart that I feel she's taking me for granted? Should I talk to her? How can I apporach the subject carefully if i should talk? Am I overthinking? Any advice is appreciated",09Jan2020,1
948,"Hi, guys! I’m in an awkward situation and unsure what to do. I live in an apartment building. Most of the other apartments are occupied by families and single men. 

There’s a guy (30s) living next to me and sometimes he hosts parties with some of the other neighbors. I’m a friendly person so I’ve been casually interacting with him since moving in. A few days ago, he asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime... I said sure. We exchanged numbers. I figured he’d seen me with my girlfriend enough times to know this was me just being friendly and trying to be “one of the guys”. 

Well.. He texts me super late at night asking me if I’m up and keeps inviting me to 1-on-1 hangouts at his place.

I’d like to keep that part of my life private. I wanted to be friendly neighbors and have someone to share baked goods with or ask for the occasional egg.

953,"
I am so confused what to do, me and my boyfriend have lived together for 3 years now. I have two young children a 6 and a 7 year-old from a previous relationship. My boyfriend has one daughter 14 years from a previous relationship. Last three years have been a bit rough from time to time, trying to join two families can be a hard job. I am a student full time, i have a part-time job and my boyriend has two jobs and works very hard and sometimes he has to go abroad for work leaving me with all the children and the home to care for. Usually i do most of the grocery shopping and cleaning however i am 34 weeks pregnant. Here is where my problem begins. His 14 year old never lived full time with us. They split it every other week so one week at moms and one week at dads. Once we started dating and i was at home all the time she could come live with us full time, i made one exception that i demand being respected if I were to agree that Whenever my kids go to their dads, which is three days a month at the most, except in december, during easter and christmas.. she was supposed to go to her moms. This does not mean that the parents of all of these children do not see their children during the holidays, that is always pre planned in advance. We rarely have time for our relationship since we always save it until we have no kids around. So this christmas my boys went to their father on the 10th of december. She did not go to her mothers until the 27.th of december. After i had shouted and cried at her father ( not in front of anyone) for being a asshole for not wanting to spend the last days of my pregnancy childfree.. i was hurt and i still am. I told him we had an agreement and he should respect it or it will go back to being week and week. He promised to change . Then she came back for new years eve.. and my kids too. Then the day after all the kids were supposed to go to their other parent. Mine did, she did not. So i had to shout and cry. When i say shout i dont really mean shout its more of an argument not a loud one. Didnt know how else to explain, english is not my first language. Then she went to her mothers two days after .. until the 8th of january. But my kids came home the day after 9th.. so on the 8th my anger exploded. I said if he is working abroad she should be at her mothers not with me. I am 34 weeks pregnant he is being disrespectful and i think i just want to leave him. I dont like this person he is becoming thinking its easy for me to have a part time job and getting a uni degree. With two small children being pregnant and having all this responsibility. I feel like i dont have a choice but to do what he says but the thing is do have a choice. So, should i leave him or just go back to the week - week agreement. He says he will never do that. In stead he wants to take one of my childrens bedroom and put them together in bedrooms so he can get an inhouse sitter. So yesterday i packed some things and left, said there would be plenty of room for his sitter now. I am so mad. He begged me to come home, all we did was argue, he is leaving tomorrow for one day and his daughter is still here. I told him i would not take any responsibility for her. However i am really thinking about leaving him. We have been to a therapist it did help a little but he doesnt want to go again. . This agreement was his idea in the first place just to make it clear. Also its been six months since i had sex more than once a week and i need sex every day. So basicly he is uninterested in me and gives me no respect no intimacy treats me like im cinderella when i need intimacy the most being pregnant hurts the selfesteem.. he is not helping.
I just wanted to add. Although we had been childfree from my children from the 10th of december until 9th of january, He spent nearly 10 of these days abroad working so she was at her mother for nearly 11 days i think, and three of those days he was abroad so we got maybe a week together childfree.. The whole week there was no sex. He makes me feel like i am the asshole in this relationship but i cant see what im doing wrong. Anyways im just talking endless now. Can you please give me advice on how to handle this situation i dont want to make any mistakes especially since we are having a child together.",09Jan2020,1

I’ve never experienced anything like this before so I’m not sure exactly what it is, so if anyone has any idea of what it could be or if you’ve had any sort of similar experience with something like this, then I would very much appreciate it, thank you.",09Jan2020,1

I either got no response, or an ugly response about how terrible of a person I was. He told me I hurt him super badly, and everything. He wanted to talk, then got upset, and told me he never wanted to talk. He told me “stop contacting me, leave me alone. Just go away! That’s all I want don’t you get it?” After that I backed off. I tried to move on. I just got on with my life. I did what he wanted, then he out of nowhere messages me this. This was a cool idea for a character, too bad I didn’t do much with it. Still had a bunch of spelling mistakes in it too, I tried fixing it up a little.

I’m writing this as of 1/9/2020, I’m 14 now, and I’m starting to think I’m growing up a bit more now. If you see this then you should try to go on as well, don’t let what happened put you down so easily. I know you’re tougher and more hardcore than that and I’m sure you can learn a lot more from it, use what scares you and upsets you as excitement to get right back up again to face it. Cause I believe you can do that, I usually would believe in you back then too, for everything really. But I need to do stuff on my own for now instead of what I have been doing, it didn’t feel like me at some points. I started to overthink when I wasn’t “Myself”. What I said when I was going to talk to you was true though, I felt like I was gonna throw up when I thought about talking to you, because it felt like so much to handle in just a call. I was also scared and worried about you when I thought about everything you had to go through as well. I didn’t want you to kill yourself or harm yourself. Believe me, I wasn’t happy with myself either and I didn’t do the nicest things to myself, you could say we bear the same scars or something along those lines. I’d rather keep quiet about this whole thing though, this is more so me trying to get some things I wanted to say out so I can sleep at night, and so hopefully you can too. Don’t think I’ve been ignoring everything you say just because that’s how I turned. Cause it wasn’t. I knew you didn’t have intentions to hurt me, you were worried, and I get that. You wanted to protect me because you thought nobody else would, and that meant a lot to me. It spoke to me a lot cause I thought I was some normal boy with nothing special in his life. You made me realize that’s not all there was to life, and for that. I believe in you now like when you believed in me. I may be speaking all stupid like but it might be something you needed. It’s something I needed anyways too. I don’t think it was bad that I met you, I think it was something that became apart of me in a way and my personality. Sometimes I’ll find myself acting like you by mistake, and that’s just on my part.
Anyways, we may meet again whenever or wherever but, I feel like it could be fate that we could meet again. Just like how you had that feeling that me and you had met before, it made you break down and I understood too. If we do meet and hopefully again in this life, that’d be awesome. But for now I’ll seeya, keep your chin up and stare at the horizon for what it has to offer. And if you get the chance to, tell Apps I said I’m sorry. Something I don’t say often, and I shouldn’t have been like how I was when I dated her, I was ignorant and I get pay back for it every night when my thoughts scramble together to hurt me. And for you, I’ll seeya sooner or later Jasmine. -(His full name) 

Which is night and day to the bitter angry things he sent. It’s so different I’m happy that it’s changed, but I’m scared because I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what he’s even trying to say. What do you guys think? I’m just feeling so conflicted.",09Jan2020,1

My boyfriend and I started dating about three or so months ago. Before that, we were hooking up for about 8 months. While we were hooking up, I was under the impression that we were exclusive, mainly because I let him know that I don’t like to sleep with anyone and I’m only willing to sleep with a person who wants to date me, to which he agreed and told me that he did indeed have feelings for me. Well, to make a long story short, after we slept together, I found out that he was in fact seeing other women and we stopped seeing each other shortly after that. 

During that time, he met and started hooking up with a new girl and would often bring her around to hang out (I still “hung out with him” during this time because I am very close friends with his one roommate and we often hung out at their apartment). I was hurt by it, especially since a week or two before he had told me that he wanted to be with me, I just tried to avoid being in the same space as them (I.e. if they were in the living room, I’d go with my friend into his room and we’d hang out there). I even had conversations with her from time to time, and I think she’s a really nice girl. 

Anyway, shortly after that, I realized that I still had feelings for him so we started hooking up again. I knew that they were still hanging out but I have no idea if they were hooking up as well, but I’d assume so. We eventually decided that we wanted to give being exclusive another try and we’ve been together ever since. 

The only problem I have is that he still invites her to hang out with us and I don’t feel comfortable with it. I like her as a person and I don’t want to exclude her from our friends group, but it’s hard for me to separate their past relationship from their current relationship, especially since I know that she had really strong feelings for him and was super upset when she heard that we started dating, to the point where she would look visibly upset/uncomfortable whenever we were around her for the first month or two. 

Some other things: he has a tapestry in his room that she gave him for his birthday and he always talks about how cool it is etc. His friend made up a nickname for her and he started using the nickname for her recently too, which does annoy me. He once made a sexual joke in reference to her around her and our friends (he usually makes those kinds of jokes so it wasn’t solely because of her, but it still bothered me). Plus some other things which all add up to me feeling uncomfortable when she’s around. I just need advice on how to deal with this and if I am being irrational by feeling uneasy about this situation.",09Jan2020,1
957,"So, I just had my twenty-first birthday and got a couple of things that I really liked and one really expensive and oddly-themed coach wristlet thing. Quick backstory: My family has a terrible history of gift-giving. If a gift is not well-liked and people can tell based on the recipient's reactions (even if they try to hide it), my parents make it seem like the world is ending. Likewise, if you don't put enough effort into a gift, my parents get upset (although, less so). I literally cried on my way home from work to celebrate with my family because I was so stressed out about celebrating with them. 

Anyway, the item in mind is a coach brand wristlet that is supposed to be some kind of phone case? It has the words ""game over"" stitched on it and is Pacman themed (I think). I tried my best to stoically accept every gift by saying thank you and showing like no emotions either way. That strategy was unwise and they were annoyed (but not pissed), so I'll have to think of another one for next year. I will probably never use the wristlet case thing for a couple of reasons.

(1) My phone does not fit in the case. They also bought my phone as a gift for me last year and all of our devices are connected, so (should) know that it won't fit. I don't know if they meant for it to be a coin purse or what.

(2) The case looks like a coin purse kind of, but they give me about three or four pouches of similar sizes every Christmas. I have so many of these types of bags/pouches that I don't have anything to even put in them. I got three different coin purse/pouch/bags on Christmas which is only about one week before my birthday.

(3) It is not something I would really pair with my style. I'm not super glitzy and the only reason I would buy a ""name brand"" purse or wallet or whatever this is, would be if it was super durable. I have a fossil wallet that I was gifted for my high school graduation and I still use it because it lasts and is durable.

So I could:

(1) Regift: I've started re-gifting, donating, and recycling some of their gifts from previous years that I never really used. My roommate in college would honestly love this thing. She really likes the whole ""gamer culture"" and the ""game over"" in the blockish font would wow her. My parents probably think I'm still into that stuff as well, but I've stopped opening up to them and just kind of have a minimal contact needed relationship with them. It's not their fault and it's not really what I want, but it's the best thing at this point.

(2) Ask for a gift receipt: The other thing is, this thing is pricey. It's not like $300, but the lowest price I could find online was $50. I'm pretty sure that my parents got it in an actual coach store because it came with the box and bells and whistles that new ""expensive"" things usually have. I'm a broke college student who is supporting myself and I have to work a lot. Just like getting the money back for it could pay for groceries or go to bills or textbooks. Or I could find something that is around the same price that I would use frequently and exchange it.

(3) Forget about it (for now): I could just put it in a drawer and donate it to Goodwill in a couple of years. I hate holding onto material items if I don't need them, use them, or have sentimental value (within reason, I'm not going to hold onto a knick-knack that my aunt gave me, just because she's my aunt. I know that seems cold, but my parents values about material items made me value the opposite).

I know that they probably felt like they were really connecting with me and trying hard. In their minds, money is equal to how much someone cares. I don't want to hurt their feelings and I also don't want to make our relationship rockier than it is. For example, they were pissed that I didn't eat the ice cream that they specifically picked out for me (lactose-free ice cream and they served pizza and cake with milk-based icing. I appreciated the thought, but I just didn't like the ice cream and the lactose part didn't matter with the pizza and icing. I tried really hard to not make a big deal of it but they pointed it out and made me feel horrible). I really do love them and want what is best for our relationship more than a gift receipt or a cool gift for my bestie. I think in a few years, it could really improve, even. The problem is, I almost always choose the wrong thing (I might overthink a bit or underthink, who knows) and they always get really upset.

Does anyone have any advice on what the right thing to do in regards to the gift and my relationship with my parents? I just want them to be happy and to do what is best for them.",09Jan2020,1

959,"Created a throwaway account for this. For a little background, I’m a 16 year old male with pretty religious parents.  I’m doing online school through the district this year, and near the beginning I would procrastinate on it occasionally. I fell behind quite a bit a few months ago. I got all caught up and raised all my grades to 70% or higher. I worked ahead about 3 weeks, but then when the 3 weeks was up I barely did any work. It got to the point where I was failing most of the classes. The semester ends January 20th, and last week I started getting all caught up again. I had pretty much finished one course. This morning someone from the school came over and pretty much told my parents everything. I had been saying I was doing fine when they asked me how school was going before. When the person left I had a couple of very angry parents, understandably. They are very upset with me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more disappointed look in someone’s eyes. My dad kind of lost it when he first found out. He pretty much banned me from anything I enjoy doing. They started accusing me of doing drugs and drinking and all this stuff, when in reality the only thing I lied about was my grades. (I don’t do anything like that)I felt super guilty about it when I was lying. I really don’t know what I was thinking it was pretty damn idiotic of me. They said my projects are on hold. (Restoring a truck and other vehicle related stuff) and took my phone, permit, and said there was no way in hell I was getting my License in March. Also I had saved money to buy another project car and they said I could forget that idea. My mom is saying she’s going to make me go back to public school for half days, which I really do not want at all. I really don’t like public school. At least mine. My main question is, how do I get them to forgive me, and prove to them I won’t do anything like this again? At the time being I just want to convince them to let me stay on online school full time. I’ll talk to them about punishments and all that way later. My plan is to let them cool off for a few days , then ask if I can stay on cyber school after all my grades are back up. Yup, I’m a dumbass. I understand why they are so upset with me but I don’t really know how to talk to them. Hope somebody on here can give me some advice on how to talk to them. Thanks.",09Jan2020,1
960,"I was blacked and ghosted by my ex last week out of the blue. I know it was past time to move on from him but that doesn't change how much it hurt. For the three years we were together, I supported him financially, I helped him through major depression and anxiety (and continued to do so the last year that we have been broken up) and supported him when he confided in me about stresses of getting a job and going to college. He was never a good boyfriend, and not a great friend either, but regardless of that I cared about him SO much. 

He was my best friend and my world for so long. I could relate to the emotional problems he was/is going through and I thought I could help him but he couldnt be helped. We fought when we were and weren't together about his lack of thought about me (not texting me back, bailing on hangouts) but when it came down to it he seemed to really care about me. When I would tell him, ""that's it I'm done, I can't be friends with someone who treats me like this."" He would cry and say he never wanted to make me feel that way. It seemed like he did care about me, but he was just a selfish, emotional wreck. But I was willing to accept that in order to keep him in my life.

We continued to sleep together throughout our breakup, and more and more leading up to when he blocked me. He didn't have the biggest libido but in the past month he always wanted to hookup, sext, exchange nudes, FaceTime, etc. And I was down because, hey I like sex too.

But now it's clear how he was using me. For my money, my body, and my emotional support. I'm trying to move on and forget about him as he clearly was a pretty shit person, and holding me back in life, but I can't help but feel how unfair it is that he just got  to use me for all I was worth to him, then toss me aside when he felt like it. I want revenge. I am so angry. 

I can't help but hold a grudge and be determined to give him he'll, demand an explanation, send his nudes to his mother, or go to his house and smash his windows. I am so angry and hurt.

I want to move on and forget, I want to not care, but I am so angry. I already blocked his number back, but I am still holding out hope that he eventually reaches out to me in another way.

Side note that up to this point this convo included nothing about relationships or anything, but I just recently started dating someone. She's awesome, her and I really enjoy each others company and all in all its been a really amazing first month together.

G: I have a weird question

Me: Go for it

My boyfriend and I had agreed that if I ever got pregnant, I would get an abortion. Well, my family is highly against it, and says they'll disown me if I do. I also become attached very easily, so seeing the baby having small hands and feet made me want to keep it.

\-&gt; TL;DR at the end.

Hi guys, decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle. And I'm really in need of some advice, as well as your experience. 

So a little about me: 

I’m a foreigner that recently moved to a Nordic country, and currently reside and work in a small town(4000ppl) 800km away from the capital. I work for a minimum wage, which is ok, but not enough and decided to sell weed as a side hustle. I do not speak the local language, but I'm learning it. I communicate mostly in english, and because of that I'm mostly known as “The Foreigner” among the locals, which always puts me under attention :)

The Opportunity

Due to the distance from the capital and scarcity in general the price of weed here is x2 - x3 times more expensive \~35-45usd per gram. A hefty profit margin, and since there are not that many attractions, people tend to smoke consistently. The market is under-saturated and I think that 150g-300g a month are easy to manage. 

Already in touch with an in bulk dealer/grower, that could supply consistently and only requirement is to drive once a month to the capital and back.

The Problem

Because i’m new to town, language barrier and the locals being nationalistic selling directly would put me in a very bad spot. Suspicion and rumors spread here like plague and one wrong sale can put the cops on me very fast. Associating with someone is a no-go as with more participants the risk raises, and profit decreases. 

So I came to the conclusion of selling weed anonymously without interacting with the customer. So far I have a few creative solutions, but I'm not really sure if they are the best. So with your help i’m would like to explore your experiences of buying weed anonymously as well as get some feedback from my proposed schemes.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out the flaws in my ideas and complete them with a fresh look. 

Solutions that might or might not work

1. Scavenger method (unsolved cash payment)

Hiding the contents in a bunch of locations around the town, in special containers and in different dosages (0.5g, 1g, 2g, and 5g) and geotag them. Communicating with potential customers by anon apps such as telegram and sending them the geolink + picture where to find the hidden container. 

The problem is how to receive cash from the buyer in an easy and reliable way?! So that the buyer doesn’t go through an overwhelming process and keeps my anonymity at the same time.  

1. Key lock box (unsolved cash payment) [https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O\_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB10O_GkQZmBKNjSZPiq6xFNVXaq.jpg)

Communication will be through an anon app such as telegram, once a deal is made send the buyer to a specific money drop-off point , after quick confirmation send them to another location where the lock is and send them the code after receiving payment.

The lock will be put in a new random place every time, after getting an order or confirming payment. 

The challenge with this method is the cash drop-off point. How to know that the buyer left the right amount of money in the right place without getting in contact with them. 

How to assure that no one is looking after the drop-off point to identify the person who will take the cash… is there a smart contraption that will assure that?! 

As another payment solution that will keep anonymity and less hassle to go and check for the right amount would be crypto currency. But the issue with crypto is that it is hard tedious process, involving registration, deposit of money to exchange accounts, withdrawal and confirmation time. It is a very elegant solution but it won’t compare with the experience of just giving cash to a dealer. 

Please share your experience of buying weed anonymously, and describe in detail how the process of payment(how did the seller get the cash anonymously) and how did you receive the product without compromising yourself. 

And also feel free to criticize and complete the proposed methods. 

**TL;DR**

Decided to sell weed anonymously as a side hustle in a Nordic country with high profit margins. I need advice on how to do it efficiently without compromising myself, in receiving cash payment, and passing the weed to the buyer in such a way that will rival with the experience of buying weed from a dealer face to face. Have proposed 2 methods but are not yet complete. Your experience and criticism will help me a lot.

When this issue was brought up by my friend, I felt like shit because I was just posting pictures privately to friends only where I was in a bikini. I was just mentioning I was going to work out this year. Nothing sexual, nothing overt, just privately saying this. And I felt REALLY REALLY great at that moment. But my friend said these things and I felt horrible afterwards. It's so easy for something small to ruin my mood and I just spiral into my mental illness. 

I don't know how to respond... I mean, what will they do when I post these images normally like when I'm at the beach? What if I'm in front of them? Will they just not look at me?

Looking back on it, i dont think i was ever attracted to her that way, But was very excited about a first relationship and said yes. We lasted about 6 months and broke up but remained good friends. We had lots of ups and downs but always stuck together at the end. As time went on, she started showing attraction again. But this time i knew I wanted nothing more than friendship, so nothing happened. Now, shes very open about how much she likes me and it makes me a little uncomfortable. She often sends me walls of text or bombards me with message after message telling me how much she loves/needs me, how im her only friend, and even talking about marriage sometimes. The only reason I havent said anything to her is because shes going through a really tough time, and i fear hurting her or damaging her trust. On top of this, as much as i hate to say it, ive lost a lot of interest in being her friend. I still care for her tremendously, but as we both grew up, i guess things changed a little too much. Upon realizing im aromantic, ive felt guilty not telling her.. Almost like im leading her on? Even though we both agreed to be nothing more than friends.

985,"So I went to get a big tattoo the other day, filling my whole thigh. Unfortunately, the artist completely messed up, had ignored my design reference and made no effort to contact me with his ideas, so in the end I left without a tattoo and a loss of my \*quite big\* deposit. I'm really upset because it's the studio I usually go to, and I put a lot of trust in them and I was genuinely shocked.

Anyway, I still really want the tattoo. I've looked elsewhere, and been in contact with someone who seems a lot more professional and appears to do what I want. However, as much as I'm convinced, I'm incredibly wary now of handing any money over before seeing a design, but I know this can't be done. I respect this, but I'm so wary, even though I've seen that this artist can do the style I want. 

Usually with my tattoos, I've never overthought them, because it's the one thing in my life I refuse to overthink (I overthink most other things). Since being so let down, though, my brain's gone into hyper-drive. I'm reconsidering the design, the artists, the costs. Anything to be reconsidered is. Despite the fact that I know I want that design.

I asked him if he wanted me to go to a counselor and he also said no, but I still reported him because I really was worried about his safety. He looked awful when the scores came up. The next day, he told everybody about how I “couldn’t handle a joke” and how I was a “snowflake”. People in my science class started laughing and whispering about me.

I like the flexibility of the job, but currently looking for more structure in my life and really want to start preparing for a future. I can’t move up in my current job, theres no benefits and no hope of a raise any time soon either. There’s constantly drama between the owners (mother/daughter) or the employees, and constant complaining between employees and it’s over all just a depressing place to be. I’ve worked with a certain third shift employee for years who has hated me since before I even started the job (before I’d even met her) and is a terrible employee. She lies, she steals, she milks the clock and she is constantly talking crap about anyone and everyone. She’s the type who knows everyone’s business and loves to tell others even if they don’t know the person. This woman has also created a hostile work environment and despite all my efforts to be a loyal and hardworking devoted employee I’ve not been treated as such. I’m just tired of trying to help someone else make their dreams come true while being so unappreciated.

989,"bad formatting warning, i'm on mobile

I'm 17. When I was a kid I was forced to endure arguments between my parents, it was often about alcohol or some shit. Because of that, I became very sensitive and I don't have well relationship with them. I don't have any friends irl, and with time I began to feel lonely and depressed.

So, I was visiting my online friend during Christmas break, and honestly I've never felt so loved. I realised something's wrong with my life. When I came back, of course, there were arguments. I decided to talk with my mom about few important matters for me, but I wanted to wait until she calms down. Guess what, it's been few days and I still can't see myself talking to her. Here's our dialogue from today:

A: How was your day at school?
B: I made it alive somehow.
A: (with angered tone) That's not what I asked for.
*awkward silence*
B: I don't know what to say, nothing new happened today.
A: Ok, I understand, you don't want to talk with me.

So yeah, not cool. One of my important matters is that although I'm male, I want to act and dress more feminine, so that it doesn't freak her out when she'll see me with black nails for example. But honestly I'm scared? I think? I just feel so fake and uncomfortable around her I can't get my words go out.

990,"I‘ll try to keep this as short as possible.

What am I doing with my life? I graduated from high school two years ago. I live in Germany so it is called „Abitur“ here. I was the best of my previous school and one of the best of my last school. After I got my graduation I have choosen Business Informatics, which I absolutely did not like and regretted doing it. I stopped studying for it effectively after 6-7 months and had to wait the remaining time out because I could not change my major before.  

So I changed my major to Mechanical Engineering. Why did I change? I honestly do not know. I wanted to become a pilot in my childhood and thought that constructing planes can be fun. After studying a bit and hearing what an Engineer does usually I really do not like it either….. not at all. Plus it is EXTREMELY difficult.

And why did I have to choose the most expensive city to Study in Germany, which is Munich? My parents pay 900€ for my rent every month (1kUSD) and I really hate me because of that. I could have studied in Dortmund where my dad has his own comfy apartment, so no expenses at all for my parents.

I hate it that I am a burden for my parents. My parents are not rich at all, that is why I really regret it even more. They make together around 3-5k€ per month (my guess). They don‘t have their own houses either, so they are in rent. My parents pay for my remaining expenses as well.

And what do I plan to do now? I plan on changing again to study Medicine in the Netherlands. It would be free for me, except to pay for accomodation. I am 20 now and when I start Medicine in the Netherlands I will be 21 years old…… if I just studied Economics like everybody else I would have been completed in Bachelor in one year…….. but no…. I had to „find out what I would really enjoy my entire life!“

And I am not sure if I will be accepted for Medicine – I will study really hard for the selection exam though….

So, what am I doing with my life? Why did I waste so many years and so much time? I do not want to be a burden for my parents… I want to earn my own Money and care for them.

991,"I'm almost 19 years old and I've finished my first year of biology in 2019 (there are three more). The present is looking fine, I think, but I worry about the future and I feel like certain past experiences still hinder me.

About the past: when I was 11 my parents put me in private college. It was fine in the beggining, I was said to be good student, but over time someone started messing with me (a bully; though I don't really know if he was aware of what he was doing).

I also had a friend; he was the closest thing to a friend I ever had, I think, but he still wasn't very nice.

During the first year, there's was a girl, and there was rumor that I liked her (and she knew about it). One day, she was chatting with two other colleagues and I tried to join in; she said ""Shut up!"" quite loudly when I started talking, and that made me feel something I'd never felt before (nor after): it felt like something had struck my head, followed by dizziness and altered vision; felt very bad.

I stayed there for three years, getting worse as time went by. I asked my parents to change schools after the third year. I have no ideia how I didn't fail (maybe the teachers felt pity? idk), as was doing almost nothing productive because I was depressed.

I only told my parents about the bullying after leaving that place (I don't know why I didn't do it earlier). I ghosted my ""friend"" (I don't think I miss him). I got treatment for my depression (and got discharged last year). I don't feel like I've gotten over everything that happened in that college.

&amp;#x200B;

For the future, I'm worried about not being able to be independent enough (my parents did everything for me when I was younger, but I don't blame them) and I'm scared of having no one and getting depressed again.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's it, I think. I feel like I'm going nowhere. I wish I could have a friend with whom I share interests (like video-game), but I feel like the experiences I had in that college changed me and now I'm very bad at social interaction; I can't even attempt to join a conversation like I did that time. It also doesn't help that I have Asperger's

I want to get rid of that feeling of being stuck; I can never make ""the first move"" and I wish I could fix this.

Should I go to a psychologist again? I know I won't be able to tell them everything (I never could tell everything to the psychologists I went to), maybe I could write it to them, but I fear that it won't be helpful at all and be a waste of my parents' money.

Or should I just keep going on? It's not that bad, but it feels lonely sometimes, like when I hear people chatting or when I ""watch"" people talk on a discord server, not knowing how to participate; I wish it was natural to me.

995,"I’ve been living in my current studio apartment with my boyfriend for going on 3 years coming up this April. The studio apartment is part of a bigger house, sectioned off into four units. When I first moved here, every other tenant occupying the other units were in some way related to the landlord (LL), which I was unaware of when I decided to move in. The landlord and owner of the house lives a little ways up the street from here and so he frequently comes by to visit his son and other family members. 

This past December, my rent check bounced due to a check deposit taking much longer to go through than usual (normally takes about a day, for some reason took a week to deposit). My account was charged $30 for the bounced check, and my landlord’s son (LLS), who acts as a property manager, asked that I write a new check + the $10 fee he received to his account for the check bouncing + $25 late fee since the check was now late. Having had a someone else’s check bounce I knew that in such cases my bank would provide a photocopy cashable as a viable check for when said person’s account was in good standing. I asked him if he had received anything like it, and he claimed he had not been given anything and the bank had not let him know anything besides that the check has “canceled.” I told him that I had not canceled the check and that he should have received something like the photocopy I mentioned or had been told something by the bank’s representative.

After I let LLS know this he became defensive and repeatedly said I had canceled the check and how it would be so much easier if I just wrote a new check. I let him know I did not want to write a new check because I did not want two viable checks that could be cashed from my checking account. If I were to cancel the rent check I would be charged another fee of $30 by the bank. LLS simply responded that he didn’t know what the bank did with the original check, they just said it didn’t work. 

I later called my bank to confirm that this was correct, and the bank let me know that he should receive a copy in 7-10 business days after he attempted to deposit the check. I offered a compromise that seemed fair to me; I could cancel the check for the bank’s fee of $30 but since it was my his request, that the $30 be deducted from the $35 fee he was charging me (late fee + his bank fee). Otherwise, the check should come by mail 7-10 business days after the check was supposed to be cashed. He seemed to become pretty agitated saying that he didn’t understand why I couldn’t just write another one (despite my repeated explanations) and that he “shouldn’t have to wait.”

It was already close to the next due date so I offered another compromise to write a check for the rent the next day once my check went through. Then once the check originally written for December comes in the mail he would have my rent for December and January. I offered this since LLS and presumably LL made it seem like they needed the rent money ASAP, and I figured it would be beneficial because this way I would not need to cancel the other check. Yet once again, LLS claimed the check was canceled. 

LL called today to let me know he finally received the check in the mail. Up until this point, I hadn’t heard from LL at all. However, he said because what he received was a photocopy (despite “this can be used as a viable check” written on it) and he too wanted me to write a new check. Although I explained to him that the photocopy could be used as a regular check, he pushed it off and said if it didn’t go through that it would be put on me. He also said he would come by to collect the fees and claimed I owed another 15% of the check because it had been over 30 days and that this was in the lease. However, after looking over the lease, there is no such agreement that I pay the $10 fee from his bank or 15% of the rent if it is not paid within 30 days. In hindsight there have been more than a couple weird things my LL has pulled such as coming to the house uninvited despite the 24 hour notice written in the lease, adding $30 extra to the rent per month for pet fees last minute, or trying to increase the rent twice while on a fixed rental agreement. There have been many more troublesome things caused by LL’s other tenants/family but the list would be way too long. As much as I would like to move out, neither my boyfriend or I can afford to at the moment so that’s not an option. 

The back-and-forth and persistence from LLS to “just write another check” while seemingly disregarding the fact that the original check was NOT canceled and ignoring me when I was saying the check would be mailed back to him gave me the feeling that it may have been some kind of scam to eventually cash both checks. What do you guys think?

Here’s the link to text convo between LLS and I and basically a TLDR.
