0,"I know it’s pretty backwards sticking this on a public platform for others to respond to, considering the question, but I need help. For context I’m 16 and a guy and I’ve spent my entire life doing anything I can to be noticed. I’m not extroverted and don’t exactly seek attention from strangers or non close friends, but with my family and closer friends I’m constantly seeking attention and I don’t know how to stop because I’m not even aware I’m doing it until I look back.

For example when I was 13 I thought I was depressed and suicidal and tried to off myself a few times, but I’ve realised recently that none of that was real. I think I just wanted to be unique in some way so I managed to convince myself I was depressed and when you convince yourself your depressed for a bit, you start to mirror the behaviours of a depressed person: self isolating, not eating, CONSTANT crying and eventual suicide attempts. What I was feeling wasn’t depression though it was just ordinary teenage emotion that I had twisted to be abnormal. This was even confirmed when my mum made me go to the doctor who said I wasn’t at all depressed. And after the doctor said I wasn’t depressed I felt a sense of hopelessness, which I now realise was because I only wanted to be depressed in order to put a label on my feeling so I don’t have to attach it to myself and when that label wasn’t put on it I had to take responsibility for my own emotion. Not just was that an insanely shitty thing to do, but at the time my sister was experiencing genuine depression and one time I brought up the way I was feeling to her, despite knowing her situation and she rightfully had a go out me and called me out on just wanting to be different and I didn’t realise how right she was until really recently and blamed her for the entire situation. 

My attention seeking habits are insanely toxic to those around me not just to my sister but to my parents. I used to tell my parents if I’d been crying, as if that was beneficial to anyone. I think the fact that I’d been upset put me in this “boo boo, I’m so sad, look at me” boat, when I know now it’s not incredibly uncommon to cry regularly and I know my regular crying habits are most likely of a result of my need for attention, but I don’t know how to stop it. I can stop asking for help, but I don’t know how to stop my subconscious for doing all it can to make me seem sadder then I am. 

I know I’m just looking to be unique and it actually depressed because whilst it was a suspicion of mine, people in my family began to point it out, how I would use my emotion when it was uncalled for in order to seem more unique. I had a therapist for a while, who I abruptly cut ties with because of course it wasn’t helping because it was just proving to me that I wasn’t actually suffering from anything and when to another therapist for a day but only once because it was obvious how bored she was while I was talking. I even had a friend who I was genuinely only friends with so I could completely unload onto them and half of what I said to them about how I was feeling felt made up in order to make them think I was special.

I know I’m toxic and I’m doing everything I can to stop myself from being toxic in the moment, but when I look back I see how my behaviours were still toxic. So how can I stop my subconscious from always wanting to be special, when I know as a fact that obviously I’m not special, I’m just some stuck up middle class white kid.",10Aug2020,1

15 Weeks ago I fractured my rib, worst pain I’ll ever experience in my life
Anyway, the pain has gone and has been gone for weeks but occasionally which is becoming more frequent I’m getting uncomfortable pains where the fracture was.. it gets bad where I have to change position to kinda ease the pain (it doesn’t) and then it goes away on it own.. there’s no actual pain when I lie on it or when I touch it
Is that normal? I’m afraid it’s healed incorrectly because of the nature of the fracture, it couldn’t be casted

4,"tl;dr - my parents exposed my relationship with my girlfriend to her ultra-conservative religious parents after kicking me out for a night. It's been a while since then and I want to try to apologize and talk things over with them to hopefully see her again. What do I say?

&amp;#x200B;

A while ago, my parents found out I've been with my girlfriend at our house through texts on my phone, among other private things. They didn't know we where together because I've had issues in the past with relationships where they would interfere and harm it, so I decided to be more low-key. However, as a result of finding out, they put me out of the house and I had to hike to her's to ask for shelter. But before I could manage to get there, my parents had informed them of the nature of our relationship, and what was occurring. The issue with this, beyond the obvious, is that their family is very strict and religious, and my girlfriend had been playing the ""perfect daughter"" card until she could leave for college and and be herself. Because of her culture, her parents disapprove of her dating outside of her own race- let alone have sex out of wedlock as well. 

When I arrived, I was told by her she couldn't help me then, but come back tomorrow. The following morning, the police came to her house looking for me at my parent's wishes and, under the assumption she could help me, I came too. They took me home alongside my parents and I havent spoken to her since.

It's been a while (I cant say how long for the sake of privacy) since then, and I've (relatively speaking) smoothed out everything with my parents. Now, I'm going to try to talk to their parents to apologize for what happened, and hopefully, *hopefully,* see her again, even if it's just to say my goodbyes.

My head is pounding trying to understand what I'm going to even tell her father. I dont know where to start or end.

What should I say?",10Aug2020,1
5,"My family and all my friends are safe and sound; my GPA has never been better; I haven't been as fit as I am now in years; yet, I have never felt this empty. It is not that I am dissatisfied with my life, it's just that nothing really brings me joy anymore. I sleep 10+ hours per day lately. I don't have enough money for therapy, although I'm dying to give it a try. I cannot open up to my friends, because I know they will ask what's bothering me, and I can't tell them how I am jealous of them and their happiness, how I can't look at people anymore because I envy them - what do they know that I don't, since they all are so happy? Looking back at my life so far (21F), I feel like I have never really been happy and satisfied, which brings me down even more. What can I do?

I told her I found it in the bed of my truck and that three dollars where missing so someone must have took it the money and then thrown the wallet in the bed of my truck. I then realized that I still had the three dollars so I temporarily put the wallet somewhere for safe keeping and I've been looking for it for six hours. I need to have the wallet so I can pay for materials for my job tomorrow. How can I remember where I hid it? 

Also I'll mention that my house is for sale and that an elderly couple looked at it with their realtor today but I don't suspect them. And I was drunk when I hid the wallet.  

I remember walking into the house from the garage and then thinking that I need to put the wallet somewhere so I don't have to worry about explaining the three dollars being in there and that's it. I've looked at memory techniques online and even tried hypnosis and meditation. I seriously need to find this wallet.",10Aug2020,1
8,"Newish to Reddit.  pls excuse any annoyances. 

So, unfortunately due to COVID the Travel Industry has taken a huge hit. Me (25F), my friends and pretty much everyone I know in the industry has been laid off. 

I’m not too sure where to go from here. Travel was already my second choice of career (the first being the film industry which ain’t doing well at the moment either). Do I try going back to school for something else? Do I get a random job to pass the time before things start booming again? If I do that I fear that it’ll be 2-3 years before things are ‘normal’ and places start hiring again.  

But then again I’m not sure what I would go back to school for... I’ve always had a sort of childhood dream of publishing a novel. But it’s not a realistic goal to make a career or steady job of it.

I am a female (27) in a long term partnership with a man (30). We are both healthy &amp; active. I don’t drink or smoke and have no pre existing health conditions, except that I had my appendix taken out when I was 19. I have a copper IUD that was inserted about 10 months ago. Since insertion, my periods have become heavier and the cramping has become more painful- this is all normal according to my doctor. What does not feel normal is that my period ended two days ago, and starting today, for about the past two hours I have had a dull cramping feeling, similar to menstrual cramps and moments of sharp pain that have been increasing over the last hour. The most recent cramp was so painful that I felt a wave of heat and slightly nauseous. I have no appetite as well.  I recently took a Tylenol and some pepto bismol to see if that would help with what is going on and am now holding a heating pad to that area. 
Yesterday my boyfriend and I had sex and after we had sex, there was about a tablespoon of blood that came out of me (this is two days after my period ended) and it was bright red.

I am Abdul, a 10th grade student in Brisbane, and I have to select 6 subjects for my senior years of high school.

I have selected these subjects so far

Maths Methods

English as an additional language

Biology

Chemistry

Business

I want to do an atar pathway so I can go straight to university from high school, I am not exactly sure of what degree I want to do in university but I aspire to become a doctor/dentist one day as both of my parents are doctors and I guess I have also picked up a deep interest for science, they are very supportive of my decision regardless of what career pathway I select.

But I have to convince the interviewee and teachers to let me do these courses for year 11 and 12 because only selecting a subject does not guarantee a position, how can I convince them that I am capable of performing well even if my grades are not the best? all of this has really given me a reality check and I want to work hard for the remaining senior years, I want to outwork everyone but I don't think the teachers will listen to me and I will end up being placed in random subjects.

Any advice would be appreciated 😊",10Aug2020,1

It basically messed me up emotionally since he was the first person I truly ever opened up to. I became sad, sadder than expected. I cried almost everyday and every night over that boy for  7-8 months, while he was already with someone else. Those months were horrible and terrifying. I had a lot of anxiety and I was extremely miserable. Now I'm scared to get sad, as in I can't watch sad movies or read anything sad. I'm scared it might trigger past emotions and past anxiety. I'm scared to cry or express sadness or stress. I try to forget about sadness through other things(nothing dangerous ofc).

Just wanted to get that out of the way =)

I own a discord server of about 400 people. Because of the topic (Undertale, a game I very much enjoy) it attracts a lot of minors. We have all sorts of age gates up to keep out anyone who may be breaking the TOS.

That said.

Through this server I met a good friend of mine, who just turned 17. I’ve known her for two years. (I am 20 as of June).

Recently I’ve been accused of being a pedophile because I’m friends with so many minors, but most of them I’ve known since *i* was a minor.

25,"Hey there. I’m fairly new to Reddit but I’ve used this page a numerous amount of times because let’s face it we all need advice.

My issue lies with the fact that I was told to reach out to the -canceled- customers via phone and offer them a service for coming back to our company. 
My CRO came up with a game plan and I got to work. 

3 days later 5/672 had actually answered the phone and no luck. 
So over the weekend I decided to be proactive and pitch a mass email to my supervisor (also an owner) and he gave me the green light. 
So I did just that and copied all 672 with a super personalized email not sounding too blanketed, BCC’d it. Sent it and thought all was right in the world. Then Gmail responded with an error email that I had sent too many contacts at once. So I went back to my spreadsheet and did the first 450 pasted the email and sent it off. 
2 minutes later, pure panic set in.
I had just emailed 450 people into the same chain email, forgetting to BCC.
oh. my. fuck. 
What did I just do.
I just stared at this company maybe a month ago. I have so much pressure on my shoulders at this point I knew I was getting fired.

But did I mention it was 12:00 A.M?
Couldn’t call my bosses without waking them. 
Then boom the emails flooded in, first one read “smells like a class action lawsuit..” one after the other bashing what I had just done. Telling me this was a major security breach. All that was exposed was the emails of the recipients.. but they were furious rightfully so. 
I spent hours crying trying to google any possible way to recall the email but no luck. 
7:30 A.M rolls around and my boss calls me, I jump out of bed answer and immediately start crying explaining what happened but he had already gotten wind of it. Someone had already threatened us with a lawsuit. 
I. am. TOAST.

He told me to email everyone replying and apologize and to call the man threatening to sue as well. My CRO texted me not long after and ripped me a new one about not checking with him and that my supervisor had no authority. I can’t tell you how much I’ve apologized. 

They all talked me through it and now it’s damage control at this point. I’m terrified to be in the office tomorrow. They said they understand mistakes happen and it’s not the worst that’s happened with them. I still feel so guilty and depressed that 450 people told me I was stupid and to resign, and that my career is over. 

My boss said a spotlight is on us now and also asked me to stay about an hour longer for a while every day. 

How should I handle this going forward? I can’t help but feel upset and angry at myself. I’m so embarrassed :(",10Aug2020,1
26,"I'm unemployed in my early thirties. I've squandered many chances in life, not for lack of talent. I've got a twin brother who has relied on me for many times in  life as well as a mother who depends on me sometimes as our dad is becoming very maladjusted (severe OCD).

The easy thing to do would be to get a job, to move out and there you have it. I know my parents would even pay for my food so I could hold on until I get a better-paid job.

My brother lives at home too, but he's got a job. But makes not enough to go live on his own. He didn't get higher degrees. I did.
Sometimes I fear he wants to move in with me when I move even though I've told numerous times that I want to live on my own. It makes me highly anxious. He's got friends of his own though.

My dad has got a sister who's had a mental breakdown decades ago. She lives at a nursery home. I fear that I might be predetermined to go off the hook to. I might be already. I remember as a kid how our dad would sometimes take us with him and his sister for a walk. I couldn't stand her talking.  She seemed to be always singing with an opera voice. 

I've had an incestuous incident with my brother when we were still kids. It still haunts me and I still feel so much guilt even though it stopped prematurely. It happened in a trance, but without drugs or alcohol.

I've rejected or ignored any attempt from women for my attention. I've had many, and still do. I cannot understand why they see me, even when my brother is around and looks so much like me.
I feel like a fraud.  

I worry about going crazy. I've gotten so lonely. The few friends I've got seem to like my company but we don't speak often and sometimes I fear that my loneliness will show clingy.

I often go alone to a pub just to get rid of my ego. But then someone looks and I feel proud for sitting alone and getting interested stares.

 Nonetheless when I get home , I feel how the house has lost its splendour. Conversations between mom and dad are forced. And my dad often snores while he falls asleep in front of the tv.  
And I loathe to go into my bedroom which is the same since I was 12, just different decoration. Then I imagine moving out. But immediately I feel guilty when envisioning my brother there alone. I realise this is a mental construction that has yet to be tested.

My brother gets home from a drink with his friends and I question whether he'll follow suit to move out when I do. Even though he got a job earlier. 

Sometimes I see in my brother's eyes some reveration for me, in my  mother's too, and in friend's eyes or merely stranger's.  It's because I try to be kind or look kind I think. But I only do it because I feel so much guilt and I feel horrible like a prisoner out on probation.
I hate that look by the way. I cannot stand it. I like it better when people look inimpressed or even challenging than when they give me a warm hopeful look.

I don't know if I make much sense. In any case, it's most noteworthy that whenever someone comes close to me (especially a woman) I feel like I ought to tell them my whole life to see if they would still 'buy the product' so to speak. I feel like I could infect others with my presence and defile a woman with my contact.

I have no good memories. Seems like my childhood has gone by unnoticed. Sometimes I still am a child and other times I see children all around me with cars and playing house but not noticing how they're heading for divorce and broken families.

I've started meditating lately as some last resort, but it seems to get worse. Does it get worse before it gets better? Often time there's a little glow in my belly when meditating and my mind seems to broaden. Who knows.

Have I fucked up? My mum was convinced that these two kittens in my back garden were abandoned by their mother. I on the other hand didn’t think so since the mother kept watch on them.

We fed them via syringe watered down soy cream since thats what we had at the time. Over the course of the day my mum and i fed them. At some point they stopped wanting food and started sleeping. My mum saw it as a good sign, I did not. My initial suggestion to my mum was to get a local kitten fosterer to come collect the kittens and maybe take the mum with them. My mum wasn’t sure about this and said we could care for them and god will keep them alive. So I trusted her. It’s now 1am and they’re just breathing.

41,"I think it boils down to the fact that I am struggling to find a balance between thinking rationally and following my emotions.

Pressures to succeed in society have I think changed my behavior drastically, and I fear am losing my sense of self. My fears are: 

A) I might be lying to myself into thinking certain thoughts/behaviors are what is natural to me to avoid embarrassment, push myself to succeed, and/or convince myself that these behaviors are who I really am instead of me trying to mimic behaviors of a certain person I want to be. 

B) I am making decisions base on logic in place of how I feel– listening to my head and not my heart. 

C) I am forcing myself to do certain things that are more conducive to success and purposefully ignoring my aversion to these tasks and more or less ignoring my natural wants and desires too much, thus creating a very very real misalignment in what I want vs what I actually do everyday.

There is a further disconnect when I think about how I am with my friends vs. how I am when I'm alone. With my friends I am free-thinking, free-feeling, and feel no pressure to be logical or have this robotic productivity. I am present. But when I am alone, the opposite happens, and I feel disconnected from myself.

Pushing yourself to be better is a great thing, and trying to incorporate who you want to be into who you are is important, but I fear I'm going overboard. This misalignment is causing constant anxiety and depression, and I fear I'm wasting my twenties. Has anybody felt the same way, and do you have any advice?",10Aug2020,1
42,"Throught all my childhood he has been nothing, but a n abusive both physically and mentally. He used to corner me when I was alone in a room, that stoped when I reached the age of 16, because then I had some strenght to stand up for myself.

I would take 5x times more the beatings to not endure whag she has went thru. Lately.. For 2 years tho, he has started his routine with ny sister, although since she a girl, he only calls her things. He is the complete definition of a piece of shit.

I can go into detailed explanation in how he is actively making our lives worse and miserable, but I dont think anyone would bother reading it, only for it to gwt deleted after 10mins.

43,"Hello everyone, 

I’m (21,M) Vietnamese American. My father is kicking us out because he was being abusive toward my mom and I stood up for her against his bullshit so he’s kicking us out because “his house, his rule”. So now I’m in the process of finding a new place. We are not planning to stay either way. 

I have is I only have $1,500 in cash right now because I have worked for him for more than 3 years without getting paid. He would let me use his car, live in his house, pay for my insurance and pay around $2k every year for my tuition and I know with the amount of hours I work for him I can easily pay all of that but of course he doesn’t want me to be independent so I could be his slave. My dad wouldn’t even let me open my own bank account but instead I can only use the bank account he opened for me so he could see how much money do I have. 

My mom is independent so finding a new place is not a problem for her but I’d like to help her out with whatever I can. 

I do not have an insurance that means I wont be able to drive. He already took it away and I’m not sure if my mom would pay for my insurance.

I cannot create a bank account right a way because we have not moved out yet so I do not have a new address. And how do I use new address as proof when create a bank account if all my letters come to my dad’s house. 

I think he will remove my line from t mobile so I will be left with no phone, insurance and money in the first week of moving out and I cannot apply for any of these without an address first. 

My background education: I’m a Finance major in my 4th year at a university in Denver. I do not have any experience because I have worked with my dad since I started college. 

If any adults can guide me through this hard time I would appreciate you a lot and never forget. Thank you",10Aug2020,1
44,"Looking for some advice on how to handle a recent argument with a neighbor. 

My neighbor and I have been generally good friends since I moved in to our Massachusetts home two years ago. My wife and I are in our mid 30s and have found our neighbors quite interesting. His name is Steve, he’s British, and he and his wife (Lauren) are recently retired and in there 60s. We’ve always had nice chats whenever we pass by each other. I especially enjoyed time with Lauren who had such a good soul and is a pleasure to chat with on an almost daily basis. I’ve considered her to be a close aunt who routinely helps me out whether it be making a run to the post office to help us get a piece of urgent mail to any number of little things.

Recently my wife and I have spent a bit more time with Steve and his wife trying to get to know them a bit better. Usually there was lots of alcohol involved and it was a hugely good time. Just recently my wife and I had decided to move outside of the area and Lauren and Steve hosted us for a good bye picnic. We used the opportunity to tell them how much they’ve meant to us and to invite them to visit our new home in the months / years ahead. We were looking forward to continuing the relationship.

Anyway, we were having a nice time until the subject of politics was brought up. I had wondered allowed about the question, “if trump were to lose, where will his supporters go? Will they stay loyal to him or something else zzz”. (Not super intersting I know :) 

Anyway, I thought it an honest question and a conversation starter but Steve did not. He said, “i can’t believe you’d hold such a ridiculous view...they’ll drop him like a rock”. He went on for a bit before turning to my wife ... and asking something like, “how can he be so wrong”. At that point I felt fairly insulted but whatever, things happen. The conversation went on for a not before the same thing happend again. On a similar subject Steve basically called me a nitwit and started telling my wife how wrong I was. Second time around I told him that that there was no need to throw around insults...Around that time another neighbor walked by and I used that as a stopping point for the evening. 

In any case in writing this out this argument obviously is fairly small and petty, but I find myself now having zero desire to
Talk to Steve. I don’t really want to spend time in the company of people who call me names. I adore his wife — and I still like Steve somewhat — but the idea of having my neighbor chastise me for differences in political views again bothers me.

I am moving in a weeks time and am looking for advice on how to close this chapter gracefully. Ultimately we weren’t the closest of friends but it saddens me that I’ll now look back at my time in this place and this shadow of a friendship turned sour will cast a negative vibe on what was otherwise a nice time of my life. So what to
do?

My child side wants to ignore Steve, make the move, and look back on the positives of the friendship. Another side wants to be straightforward with him on the fact that he was a dick to me and atleast give him an opportunity to say his piece. But he hasn’t apologized thus far so not sure what this does. I’m honesty inclined to move on.

How would you handle this situation? 

Thank you.",10Aug2020,1

46,"
I am 16 years old M and I was always big since I was a kid. During the quarantine I wanted to change mainly of how my freshman year and sophomore year went. 

In my freshman year I was so shy and I weighed 260 pounds. I barely had any friends. Sophomore year was when I lost 30 pounds and I began making more friends guys mostly. After every year of school I go back and see how the school year went. Sophomore year was great. 

During sophomore year tho covid broke out and we had no school. The optimistic me saw this as a great opportunity to work on myself. First achievement of quarantine was telling this girl I liked her but sadly she did not like me back. So I took this as a positive at least I tried. It still kinda hurts because I thought we were compatible but she just posted something last night which basically meant that she liked someone else. It gave me this feeling of not being enough you know. Like im trying to become the best version of myself but still im not enough. 

As the months go by I still lose weight and now I broke my 200 pounds mark. With this I became confident and wanted to talk to more people especially girls. This is because I have the girl I confessed to in my mind 24/7 and thinking im not enough. Im pretty sure other girls would like me but because I cant meet them the situation with the girl just haunts me. And here’s the problem I can’t because I don’t have any female friends and covid stops us from making friends. 

I am so disappointed because I crave being with someone as I never have been in a relationship before. I used to feel bad feeling like this but I feel like all humans feel like this. I am so lost like. 

And I don’t want to hear “keep working on yourself for now” because that’s gonna happen regardless. Or “you’ll have plenty of time for relationships” I find these so annoying because I want to experience it because I haven’t. I just don’t know like I really just wanna hang out with friends. Maybe quarantine is taking a toll on me but it just sucks. If you guys have any decent advice on how I can make life in quarantine a bit more enjoyable and worry less about having a gf and not being enough for the girl I liked..",10Aug2020,1
47,"I’m feeling rather frustrated within some of my family and friend groups at the moment. Maybe I need to be more attentive to my them and how they feel but at the same time, I do not feel I can open up to them as carefreely as they seem to be able to with me. Not even that, at the moment my mind is caught up with other things. I’m in my first committed relationship, just moved out of my hometown and am dealing with my depression and anxiety. I hate to say it but I do feel that they need me more than I need them. My sister is 30% too much mom, she treats me like a bold child she can scold when she wishes while at the same time she craves my attention, time and approval when it simply just does not go both ways. Should I feel bad about that? I have had close friends move on in their lives, who barely check in with me and it doesn’t bother me. I understand and am okay with not being their number 1, 2 or 3rd priority. I am not a fan of these sort of terms and conditions friendships. Like if I don’t go to the last 5 group meet ups, to them it means that I am out of the group and don’t care for them anymore. Which is not how I feel at all. If you want to speak to me, come speak to me, if you wish to see me, come see me, if you need advice on something, I’m happy to give it. It is as simple as that. 
The way I see it is, do not feel like you are able to demand these things. If friendship isn’t given freely and willingly, it is not friendship. It is debt collection. Do not feel threatened when someone drifts from you, they aren’t severing you from their lives, they are drifting. Pulling them back in, scolding them for drifting and then expecting them to stay close will only lead to the opposite effect. Please tell me if I’m just being a dickhead or if others have felt this way.",10Aug2020,1
48,"My (15M) girlfriend (15F) has told me recently that she has been feeling a certain anxiety (keep in mind she's struggled with self confidence, anxiety, and other similar issues and I've been helping her overcome these things). She said that she saw either an anime girl or a pornstar (she didn't remember, she told me a few days after this happened) and she found her attractive, saying she got turned on a little bit. This worried her immensely as she's 100% straight and this new feeling seemed wrong to her. Over the last couple of days I've been assuring her that slight feelings of attraction towards other woman as a straight woman is normal, and that this didn't make her gay. The issue has since evolved from her being anxious about this slight attraction to a woman once to her being anxious to tell me she loves me or to think about me or see me. 

What I think happened (though I'm not sure, I'm no professional) is that her anxiety about having a slight attraction to a woman twisted into being anxious about being attracted to anything at all. She said she got nervous looking at any girl after the event, which then turned into getting anxious looking at any boy, which they turned into getting anxious looking at me. I'm not angry, upset, or worried that she's going to leave me as she's very upset herself, saying she loves me and just wants these feelings to go away. I want to help her but I'm not quite sure what exactly would help her cope or change her mindset.",10Aug2020,1

50,"We broke up about 2 weeks ago. I (24f) initiated the break up and he (29m) didn’t fight it or anything. We have lived together for over a year and a half. I hope that by next weekend I will have another place to live, I’m just waiting to get approved for a rental. 

My ex and I continued to have sex after the break up. I know, horrible idea. I think the last time we had sex was Wednesday. Otherwise, we have been really friendly and nice with each other. It’s very different though. 

Basically, as you can probably imagine, it’s really hard to live with him and lose all boundaries. I still want to ask him where he’s going and when he’ll be home. Things like that. I just want to hold onto what’s familiar and it’s been really hard. 

He has been leaving the house tons. Sometimes he goes to his friends house, other times I suspect he’s meeting with a girl. When I suspect he is meeting with a girl he will shower and “dress up”. When he’s seeing his friends he literally leaves the house in swim trunks and a ratty t-shirt. Even though I’m speculating, it wouldn’t be a stretch. He was messaging other girls the entire time that we were together. Even if he says he doesn’t care about losing me, he’s probably somewhat upset about the break up and wanting a distraction. 

I totally understand that I shouldn’t be upset about this. We’re not together and I understand that. I’m just getting really emotional about it and I feel hurt. I don’t plan on having any hook ups at all. I’m also just wondering why he can’t wait a couple weeks until I move out.

A little over 5 years ago I left my job to travel the world. My job was in customer service for the gambling industry.
I worked hard - as I do in every job I have, and earned several promotions to Supervisor level. I loved mentoring others, but despised the customer service side - I often had to deal with escalated complaints or suicidal addicts on the phone at all hours. I was great at my job, but I begun to think of ways I could cause physical harm to myself to avoid going to work.... So I left.

I travelled the world for over 2 years, working in NZ. It changed my life, and I only returned to the UK due to an illness in the family, leading to a loss.

I had new ambition, and on return to the UK I spent almost 3 years pursuing a career in the outdoors. I gained numerous qualifications and much experience in leading/coaching outdoor sports and was lined up with work through 2020 to begin my career self employed!!

Then Covid-19 happened.

I lost my job, my home and 5 months later the career I've built - and I'm need of 
1. Money/security 
2. Some future prospects (I'm now 31) 
3. Something to support my studies - doing an open uni BSc degree and want to do voluntary work to support this.

Job market is impossible to navigate, I've had endless disappointment, but jobs are looking more plentiful. I am waiting for replied from various jobs - including a few admin roles with environmental organisations that would be perfect. But I know it is super competitive out there.

HOWEVER...

I have been offered, without asking, my job back as a customer service supervisor for the gambling industry. 

Back in't day I was DEPRESSED doing this job, I hated it. But it's what I know, and I know I only need to commit 4-5 years to support my studies - should I say yes?!?!

My other end is, I don't want to say yes - then leave because of a better offer and burn the ONLY BRIDGE I have! 

Corona has made things very unpredictable and difficult. 

For more info, my partner is due to begin full time work next week finally! He is able to fund us alone, but we are not truly free until we are both earning, so there is still some pressure.

One friend (who is otherwise fine) becomes an asshole when losing and it is unpleasant to be around.

I'll be the first to admit: i'm not good as first person shooters. I've been ""forced"" to play them enough over the years as other friends have asked me to play ""CSGO"" or ""Overwatch"" with them, but I fully accept that i'm not good at them, nor do I claim to be.

I've made this known to my friends and it is also evident simply by playing with me, but said friend still gets frustrated with me and is just an all around dick about it: yelling at me, saying how the AI is better than me, calling me anything from ""slow"" to ""dumb"" (using the family friendly versions of what he calls me) and rubbing in every death I take. I can appreciate that I can probably be infuriating to play with and perhaps my plays don't make sense, but at the same time...it's a fucking video game; get over yourself.

He said he'd never do GTA V missions with me and the tone implied that I was missing out, when really I responded ""thank fuck!"" and he seemed almost confused, as if he couldn't understand why I didn't want MORE of playing on the hardest difficulty in a game i'm not good at while he yells about how not good I am.

In a game we played earlier; 2 v.s 2: He made his stance on games clear: He made it to the goal and I was in need of healing, but also literal steps away from him. He said and I quote; ""It doesn't matter about teams, it's about winning"". After we were done and logged off, the other two friends told me that they were sending each other and laughing about how salty/toxic he was being; they said they felt sorry for me having to put up with that.

They've dealt with a lot of irl stuff so I don't really expect them to get online all the time or anything, but it seems anytime I offer to hang out something always seems to come up or they'll find something else to do, but everything's completely fine to go hang out with everyone else and not even mention a thing, but there never is time to do anything if I offer. 

I thought maybe its just coincidence, or maybe she just didn't feel like playing or was busy, I didn't think anything of it a while back, but there's no way I've just been getting unlucky 'coincidences' for *2* months straight now? 

And I'm not entirely sure how I'm supposed to bring this up, I already told them I wanted to talk later, but I didn't want to just kill the mood since they were with someone else at the time. 

I'm not mad, just it hurts, quite a lot honestly. They're the only one I actually don't feel alone talking to for once, it just feels different. I'm just really worried about losing another one, again.",10Aug2020,1
66,There’s this I’m trying to talk to we met at a party and she came into my room and we didn’t do anything but I felt like she was testing me. This is over the span of a week I don’t message her everyday I waited a week to message her yesterday and I said Hey What’s up all she said was I’m at work which is understandable. I then messaged her today asking if we could talk and get to know each other and all I got was I’m at work rn. I then asked well when you get off maybe we could kick. Did I say something wrong? I wish not to sound like an incel but I wish females would just say fuck you I don’t want to talk and not send mix signals. So should I just give up on this girl or a just be patient,10Aug2020,1
67,"Hi, I graduated a year ago and started working full time afterwards. I'm 22 years old now. All I do in a week is wake up, work, go home, eat, shower and go to sleep. I am not even kidding when I say that... That's literally all I do that I get scared whenever weekend comes because I know I am not gonna do anything again. like today, all I did was wake up, eat, nap, stare at my phone, stare at my computer, and here I am now...

I have my boyfriend that I meet once a week that helps with the loneliness/repetitiveness of my day to day life and I'm very thankful for him. but at the same time, I'm getting to dependent on him and I don't want that.

There's also things that I noticed that ever since I graduated, I started losing friends and most of the college friends I had are too busy to hangout nowadays so I'm left alone. I didn't grew up in this city so I don't have any highschool friends compared to them.

Anyway, I'm losing 'life purpose'.. I'm not sure how to properly explain it but I have nothing to look forward to and I don't have any goals anymore. I know I want to buy certain things but that means saving and buying stuff that I currently cant afford.

I read few stuff about this and the advice that I kept getting was, go to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) (please stop with this haha this never works.. it's mostly older people and I want to meet people my age), bumble bff (i've been in this app for months, talked to few people, follows instagram, talk for weeks but never end up meeting up), and some active hobbies that sometimes pretty expensive or I just don't know how to get into.

I need advice in my life... I really don't know what to do. I am really losing it and It's just so fucking depressing. This is not about the pandemic that's going on anymore because this been happening in my life for so long. anyway, thank you for reading this.",10Aug2020,1
68," Hey Reddit strangers! So, as a Christian, I have always been taught that living a  homosexual lifestyle is a sin (ie, being attracted to the same sex is not a sin, BUT actively pursuing a relationship with the same sex is).  I've always accepted this until really recently. I've realized I am bisexual, but have never dated a girl (I'm a girl). I really want to explore this whole other side of my sexuality that I haven't had a  chance to until now. I live in the Bible belt and have a conservative  family, so they don't know about this and I'm afraid my pastors in my home town will rat me out if I ask them for help. So, how do I deal with what I've been taught and what I think the Bible says about homosexuality and what everyone else is telling me?

69,"So I've (19F) been quarantined with my parents for the last 5 months. Our situation here has changed a bit through these months, as in the beginning we were 7 in the house, then a friend and her daughter left on April, and last month my sister and her boyfriend left as well. Now it's been the hardest of all times - I'm so tired of my dad and blablabla family acquaintanceship stuff.  


Anyway, I'm getting really exhausted of the whole thing, as we've been very strict with our social distancing and still things don't seem to change a bit. With the realization that probably we will spend the next months at home as well, I'm getting **really sad**. On some days I can't stop crying and deal with everyday stuff. I miss my gf a lot, I miss my close friends...   
  
And sometimes we meet, like yesterday, as it was my birthday, my gf and 3 friends came here, we stood outside and chatted a bit, **it was great... but I still get sadder later?** How to deal with this sadness and this feeling of missing everything and everyone, especially knowing that my country is being a piece of shit during this crisis and we definately won't be safe until there's a vaccine?",10Aug2020,1

71,"I am 22 days away from being 23 and I am hit with those.. what do i want out of life questions. And what makes me happy? Right now I am inspiring to be a game developer. But at times trying to learn it can be very frustrating and sometimes I even dislike it...usually when I am stuck on something or cant figure out how to get something to work in a game I dislike game design. But am I suppose to like things all the time? I have researched the job a million times and personally know alot of people in that career field. And even then I still would like to be a game dev.  Do you like your dream job all the time? Whenever I get those moments of discouragement I think to myself ""is this something I really wanna do if I am feeling like this"" 

I am living away in Montana in a beautiful place working as a tech support rep online I really dont like it so it drains me mentally every day to the point where I dont wanna design games or do anything like that, I am looking for a new job but during these rough times applying for literally 100+ jobs have not given me one interview even though I more than qualify....I would also like to be a helicopter pilot but I know next to 0 about the career. So i cant say if that is something I want. Even then its a very very expensive and competitive field. With 0 job openings within a 100 miles of me.

I hear some people say you wont ever like your career which is very disheartening since that will take up a massive portion of life. Id rather not be stressed or sad during that time when I have enough to worry about. I am considering making game design a side passion instead of a career at least for a while..but as of now my current job is full time and very stressful making it hard to do that. All i ever want to do is sleep after work, i don't wanna overstimulate my head after having that overstimulated for 8 hours. I am worried I will be stuck in this hole forever.

What have you done in a situation like this? Did you pursue your career? How did it turn out? What advice would you give someone who does not really know for sure what they want out of life. I want to be happy really. That's it and game design makes me happy a good chunk of the time. But I don't know for sure. Now I am not asking for someone to tell me what to do or how to feel.

The neighbor that lives next to me keeps feeding him so now he camps out on our shared concrete step. My dog goes nuts when she see’s the cat. We can’t keep our door open, we have trouble walking her, or knowing when she needs to go potty, because she can smell him. We’ve asked our neighbor to stop letting the cat out and all she’s done is laugh and ignore us. The cat will sit on our side of the concrete step, sleeps under our car, and sometimes hangouts in our backyard. The cat is aggressive with our dog and even tried to scratch her. The cat food left out by our next door neighbor has even attracted slugs and frogs, they now live in a hole under our front step, and even brought more cats to the neighborhood. They get into fights and hurt each other over the food. I don’t know what to do anymore, when we brought up just taking him to the spca they put a collar on him, so they just don’t care. He’s out in rain, snow, and storms. I’m afraid my dog is gonna hurt herself over this cat. We’re going to the HOA, but if that doesn’t work, what are our options left?

75,"This is causing me some frustration and stress. I'm 30 and trying to learn to drive. I first started this journey at 16 when I got my beginner's permit. However, I was unable to take driver's ed. and my parents weren't much help (only taking me driving once in awhile). I never got the practice I needed to feel confident enough to take the road test, so my license expired.

I renewed my license when I had some people who were offering to help me learn but life happened and they were not able to be much help. I don't want to hound them about it when they have more important priorities. I feel too old to humble myself and go to driver's ed. It makes me think of a grown man having to go back to elementary school or high school and it'd be embarrassing. 

I've thought about just buying a beater and taking the car around a rural area nearby. Basically, I'm so fed up that I want to teach myself. I've had enough practice to know I wouldn't cause an accident or hurt anybody. Just want to work on the basics and get more comfortable behind the wheel. Obviously, this shouldn't be an option for me because it's illegal.

76,"Back,  a couple years, ago I used to dream of college. I fantasized about  attending one of the colleges on my ""dream spreadsheet"". I was excited  about the prize winning faculty. I was excited about the top 10-15  program in my major, each of these schools had. I was excited to work on  the ground-breaking research projects undergrads worked on. I dreamed  for one, just ONE acceptance from this list. I went back and re-read my  texts, chcking all of the portals every day.

Then  it happened. The first one came. I was shocked to see a  Congratulations. That was the happiest day of my year. Then came the  next one. Then the next one. Then one more after that! I was on top of  the world. The very first one was significantly cheaper than the rest. I  was astounded that these schools wanted me. I convinced myself that  despite my subpar performance, I was worthy of making the cut, and  getting good grades.

I was SO  wrong. This school has amazing faculty, and they write exams that I can  barely understand, let alone answer. The school is notorious for weeding  and deflation of grades. Well, I want to go to medical school and  become a doctor, so I need good grades.

I  study for hours for the exams, and score AT the median. I don't deserve  to be here. My lab group spends more time on other classes, yet they  all do way better than me on exams. I studied 20+ hours for the last  physics midterm. My reward: A score 2 points above the median. Which at  my university, is a very low course grade.

I  hate this. What's the point of renowned research if I'm too stupid to  do it? What's the point of me being here if I didn't deserve it. I knew I  was unqualified to be at a fancy school. I wish I hadn't gotten in to  be honest.

That one day, I cried  tears of joy. Every day now, I cry tears of sadness. I asked my parents  if I could take a break for a semester since I had an employment  opportunity for an internship at an amazing company I was excited about.

They yelled at me, and basically told me I didn't have a home if I took a break from school. I can't handle it all.

I wish I chose a ""worse"" but easier school. Now, I'm not becoming a doctor, and I'm working myself too much. I can't sustain.

He has an older sister who had three kids when we met, youngest was 7. I love his family as my own, especially the boys, they are such a joy and I love to have them over. I myself have one child and they all love to spend time together. Anyways fast forward. The sister we'll call her (M) is in a new relationship with a women who moved from out of state to be with her, though they were friends for a while prior to dating. Things went super fast relationship wise. (M) had the kids call the new gf mama, and about three months in they decided they were going to have a baby together. (sperm donor obv) and in 2019 we welcomed my newest beautiful nephew. (I see all four boys as my nephews). Well a year has passed and gf has tattooed the baby's footprint, name, and bday on her. It's cute, yes. But seeing as there are four kids, it pains me that they were left out. They oldest is a teen and may or may not care, but the two middle kids are very sensitive in their feelings and I'm afraid they'll feel sad or left out. This makes me upset because I feel it's kind of messed up to say that all four of the kids are ""yours"" but then only tattoo the name of the one child you helped bring in to the relationship. I already feel like they show favoritism towards the baby. But I don't want my nephews to feel like they are left out as step kids. Maybe I'm just overreacting. But I have six kids in my family.

79,"We broke up 10 months ago. It was legitimately mutual at the time. We just agreed we weren't in the same place. 

A month later, I realized it was a really stupid decision and I was still in love with her. I told her that, and we got back together for two days when she just told me it's not going to work out and we can still be friends. 

She knew I was still in love with her, but I accepted it. She still wanted to hang out though, so we hung out as friends from time to time. I would always pay for everything when we hung out. 

About four months after we broke up for the second time, she told me she was way behind on rent and in credit card debt, and provided documents to prove it. She needed $3,500 to get her out of the hole. 

I told her I'd loan her money, but she needed to pay me back plus interest and I was going to get it in writing. The terms were interest rate of 6%, compounded monthly with $200 monthly payments. If any payments were missed, the interest rate escalates to 20%, compounded monthly. She signed the agreement and I sent her money. She has generally been on time with her payments, but all of them have been at least a few days late. Her most recent payment was due August 6 and I am yet to receive it.

Today, I saw her walking out of a coffee shop holding the hand of some other guy. She noticed me, said hi, then kissed him right in front of me. I was really pissed. I realize my anger is strictly emotional and not rational. We are not dating, and she has the right to see any guy she wants. However, she did not have to rub it in my face by kissing him in front of me.

I'm currently filled with a ton of emotions as I still love her and that really hurt. I have an e-mail typed up informing her that the interest rate has increased due to her late payment, as is my legal right. I know it's blatantly obvious what the real reason is if I send it.

87,"So I have a group of friends who I've known for a while, one girl in particular I had a crush on, however she ended up getting into a relationship. I wouldn't ever try to interfere in terms of harming that relationship in any way however as I do like them all I really did was hangout with them one on one, mine you nothing ever happened and I never tried to initiate ever but we were close friends before this regardless so I didn't see much of a problem, she was with another guy, I acknowledge that and won't make that an issue. However, mutual friends in our group who know I like her came to me out of nowhere, sitting me down and basically telling me bluntly I was doing something wrong, hanging out with her all the time and trying to get in the way, I didn't perceive it that way however I did come to the realization that for my sake it would probably be best if I distance myself until feelings went away, fair enough I respectfully realized that and will adjust my actions accordingly. However, they didn't just sit me down to tell me that very simply, they talked on and on, how ""You and her will never work, get rid of these feelings, you're being clingy, you're selfish, etc"" and it kind of pissed me off, if they had a problem and it was the first time they came to me it should've been simple, I would've realized the error in my ways and moved on, but they just drilled it in to me despite the fact they never once spoke about it to me before. So they asked me to not hangout with her one on one as much anymore, I thought probs a good idea make boundaries, so for a small trip up to her lake house in a couple weeks I decided it was best if I didn't go to it, but when I suggested I don't go they get mad at me saying I'm overreacting to everything and being dramatic and to come with. I tell them I'm confused they want me to distance I agree and decide to do that, but then they turn around and get mad when I adjust my behavior. I was being pretty immature overall but honestly not with malicious intent, however no matter what I do they seem upset with me.

88,"TW: sexual assault

So this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. So here is some context, I was molested by a cousin when I was around 8-9 years old. The cousin was around 12-13 at the time. Her family had always made a lot of bad choices including drugs and encouraging teen pregnancy. And at the time my parents were trying to help them get back on their feet because they have always been financially unstable, the cousins mom has around 12 kids. So they were around a lot at the time. 

I'm not going to go into the details of my assault because its very difficult for me. But it only happened once. Then a few months after, my mom cut that side of the family off because they managed to fuck up to the point where they needed my mom to pay a large amount of money to unfuck the situation. So my mom gave up on trying to help them and they were no longer in our lives at all. 

I had never told anybody that I was molested by the cousin. For many years I thought it was my fault that she did it and I thought I was dirty and broken. For a few years I had completely shut the memory out, I refused to think about it or acknowledge that it happened at all. And as a result I now get intrusive thoughts and struggle with being emotionally vulnerable with people. I am suspicious of people I know would die for me in an instant for no reason other than I had trusted her too.. 

When I got older I realized what she had did was sexual assault and that it wasn't my fault. But I still was terrified of anyone finding out. I was certain that this was going to be something I took to my grave. That was up until 8th grade. This was when I had really started to realize and acknowledge what had happened to me and I was struggling a lot. My best friend had noticed and was extremely worried and I ended up telling her at a sleepover. This was the first time I had ever told anyone and I was so scared that she was going to see me differently or think I was damaged or worse, tell my mom, so I had tried to end the friendship a few days later. Luckily she didn't let me, and she ended up being very supportive.

So skip to now, 2020. A month ago we found out my grandpa's cancer is back, and this time it is going to kill him. And so we are spending as much time with my grandparents as possible while we can. And my parents came up with the idea that we should drive them down to New Mexico to visit those cousins (the cousins had moved a while back). My mom just told me this today and I told her that under no circumstances was I going on this trip. And she went off on me about being there for my grandpa, and that I needed to go. And I just walked to my room without explaining myself. She keeps asking me why I don't want to go and I just don't know what to say. 

I'm not sure if I should tell her what that cousin did to me? I don't know if it is too late to tell her because it is something that happened years ago? And I don't want her to see my differently. I don't want her to look at me like I'm broken. Or even worse, I'm scared she won't believe me. What if she tells me I'm making it up, or remembering wrong? I am very close with my mom and I don't want that to change.

Another thing is a guy issue. long story short, I met a guy in December on a dating app who became a ""more than friend"" guy to me (no relationship, long distance) but i realized soon after the honeymoon phase he was toxic/narcissistic and had to cut with him. In fact, he was the one who ended up ghosting me 2 weeks ago, I'm assuming bc I started distancing myself via text. For context, I wasn't looking for a relationship at the time. Was just in a new city for internship and was looking to meet/talk to new people.


He was probably the first guy I ever had romantic feelings for. I didn't love him though, but his texts and facetimes just made me feel so super special as someone who doesn't have much confidence in themselves, nor many friends in life. So when we ended up stop seeing each other romantically, then move to friends, then ended up ghosting me, it hurt me so much. He was my first kiss and everything so it was special to me. I never thought I'd trip myself up with this stuff, because I've always been strictly ""books over boys"" and career oriented. And after he ghosted, I just have a tough and existential crisis now, wondering what if im always gonna be single..etc because literally everyone around me is in a relationship (hence busy with their s/o) and has someone to spend time with. Because of COVID, it's hard to go out and meet new people to call actual friends. University is online, so I've just been in my room 90% of the time during the past 4 months for school and things being closed. I live at home during uni, so I also feel like i've missed out on so much in life (travels, experiences, exploring..etc) and now that I'm done uni and have my career laid out, I'm having doubts of myself in terms of not feeling like i was stupid to not have made more friends or dated more and how i'm never gonna find a bae.

I want to get out of the mindset that i need to be in a relationship to feel happy. I am an introvert, but I want to improve on myself. Things include: learning to be more confident, take more risk (ex. I have my liscense but barely drive bc i'm still scared and overthink but i realize driving = go places = have fun/explore/meet poeple), improve my self-esteem, grow a back bone, pick up some hobbies (i don't know where to start with this one, esp with covid-19 shutting shit down), be happier with being on my own, not being codependent...etc

Any advice on how to be a better version of myself, and be happy with myself? Because I realize, I am not equip to even being in a relationship right now when I'm not contempt or love myself. ""Can't be a complete 2, if you're an incomplete 1""",10Aug2020,1
90,"Is the word “r*tard” (censored just in case) a slur? I said it not too long ago, but I don’t think this question needs much explaining. I personally don’t think it is a slur, and the people I said it to aren’t very fond of slurs, which is normal, but I don’t know if it’s just them who think it’s a slur, or I should refrain from saying it to anybody else, or not say it to anybody else just in case",10Aug2020,1
91,"Ok so i’ve had a knee injury for a long time now, and in the last several months it’s gotten worse. I now find it difficult to walk without it giving way or crunching really painfully.

 It’s pretty random; It could hurt walking to the bathroom and back, or it could be fine all day and suddenly give in after 3 hours of walking. It’s not predictable, I wouldn’t actually need the cane all the time, but would have to carry it all the time anyway..

So i’m 20, I shouldn’t be needing a walking cane like a grandma... but the NHS will only give me a walking cane, not a crutch or anything less... old lady-ish.. (I mean no offence by this, it’s just how I feel...)

Should I? I want to lose weight and get out more. I miss being able to run and stuff, but that’s going to have to wait a while. 

Having something to share the weight on my bad side would help physically, but i’m ebarrassed and insecure enough about my limp on it’s own. 

I usually hold my friend or parents arm, but I wanna be able to go about on my own again without fearing faceplanting into a hollybush or down stairs or something.

Because i’m overweight too (only since the injury happened and my eating habits took a while to catch up with the sudden decrease in excersize. I’ve started steadily losing a pound or so a week though.)

I constantly feel like people are thinking my limp is just because i’m fat and unfit, which it partly is, but that alone would be helped more by standing on my own two legs. I don’t want to look like i’m being lazy or something.

Anyway, from what she told me, both her and her dad told this person to back off many times over the last 5 years but to no avail, and her mom side  constantly mocking her for that.

I am a 15 year old teenage boy who has struggled with severe depression/suicidal tendencies for months now. A month or two ago my parents separated and I haven't really been the same since. I've also had relationship issues with my Dad; we never really got along. I've cut off all my friends, they make me weak, and have started to care less and less about life in general. Currently I spend the majority of my time with my Mum, and recently I did some things I sincerely regret.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time ever I feel like my own Mum doesn't love me. I was being rude to her all weekend, slamming doors at her, yelling at her and screaming at her. I was in her room on Saturday when she was in bed and I was looking through her jewellery. There was a beautiful ceramic container with an elephant on it and a small old tin in which were her earrings. She started explaining this was her Gran's and she was given it when she was young. I threw it on the ground and said ""I don't give a fuck"". Then I found an old cracked mirror and threw that on the ground too. I said something like ""What a dogshit family"". Then I ripped up a card from all of her friends wishing her a better life and good luck in the future (the divorce hit her hard). She was crying by the time I left. After hours of ignoring her and being rude and neglecting her I told her if she didn't do what I wanted I'd break the TV. She didn't, so I hit the expensive TV (we don't have much spare money) and put a small crack in the LCDs. She then went out ""to buy some bread"". After she left, I threw the ceramic container off the balcony of our high up apartment and snapped her old family tin. Then my actions finally caught up with me and I attempted suicide. I gave up. I apologised again and again and it doesn't feel like we're ever going to recover from this. Please, if you're reading this, I really really need help. I constantly feel guilty and cut off.

104,"So last night we were leaving my sisters house and I wanted to drive my bf’s truck. A group of maybe 4 or 5 18-21 year olds were riding side by sides. It was dark when we left and a friend of ours was in front of us. This was a dirt road so it was dusty. We saw headlights so i slowed down and got over thinking it was just a car passing. I couldn’t see until we got right at them that it was the group that was riding around. They were stopped and a couple of them were in the middle of the road. It was a split second decision that I had to make. I had to swerve off the road so i didn’t hit the guys in the road. I looked in my rear view and they turned around and were following us. I thought maybe they were just riding more. Then they threw a beer can at my bf’s truck and flashed the lights. I stopped and a guy yanked open the drivers side door and grabbed my arm and said “you just ran over my fucking dog.” I had no idea I hit the dog and they said i need to slow down but Life360 confirms that I was not speeding. My bf and I both texted to apologize because at the moment we were kind of froze bc we didn’t know anything about what they were saying. After my boyfriend apologized, the guy said “call me motherfucker.” While on the phone the guy said he would beat my boyfriend to death and leave him laying on the road. He also said he would kill both of us. We have no proof though because it happened during the phone call. I texted and apologized, thinking maybe they’ll realize that it was truly an accident and I would never do anything to hurt a dog. He then texted me back saying “it was me standing in the road. and if you were a guy you’d be in the hospital.” I understand that it was his dog and that I ran over it but it was in the road. They are all blaming my boyfriend but he wasn’t even driving, i was driving his truck and they know that. The group of boys included family and friends of my sister’s husband. It has caused a huge argument between my sister/her husband and her mother in law and father in law. My sister and her husband are on our side but no one else will even listen to our side of the story. I don’t believe there is any defending making death threats but there is nothing I can do.

105,"Hi guys, I need some advice...

My mum is WELL and truly stuck in a victim mindset. I am in no way qualified to confirm this but I will give you the low down - she works in a job that involves counseling and rehabilitation, and she is well aware of the victim mindset, and recognises that she is IN this mindset!! She portrays the following traits:

1. She sees every thing that happens in her life as ""bad luck"" or something she has ""lured with her curse""
2. She makes hysteric jokes out of every negative incident...even if it's not that bad
3. She FINDS a problem...even when there isn't any problem
4. She's convinced she deserves what she gets because of the bad decisions she's made

SO....my problem isn't this as such. I've researched and spoke alot about victim mindset and how to deal. BUT, my problem is that her job involves psychology, she understands her predicament...but moreso she does have GENUINE issues/trauma she has not dealt with. The past 3 years...

A) Her mum (my Nan) passed, whom she was extremely close to
B) Her very best friend developed a rare but rapid degenerative disease leaving her incapable of any real conversation
C) After a lifetime of searching, she finally found her only sibling (adopted) who recently died in a horrific fashion

She was already a little unhinged, but alongside her age related hormones and the above issues she has become completely embedded in a victim mindset, put on uncomfortable amounts of weight and has alienated herself from many of her friends.

What do I do?!?!?!

I desperate want to help her, and whilst she is receiving work related counselling, it doesn't seem to be helping (it's free) and we simply can't afford for any more in depth help. 

I've started taking her on frequent runs, and I call her every day to try and motivate/support her... But I must be honest, my covid-19 situation has left me in a mental state where I feel incapable of helping her.

I would love any advice or insight guys x",10Aug2020,1
106,"Me and my boyfriend are in a LDR. I live in Colorado and he lives nearly 2000 miles away. His parents are abusive and narcissistic.

	His parents have kept him dependent on them, they have not taught him to drive, he has not been able to get a job. I have been helping him plan and I am saving money on my end to help him leave and get on his feet. 

	I don’t know if any of his family members use reddit. His brother has been viewing cp and trading it with people online, my boyfriend found out and planned to report him. Instead his parents found out what he planned to do, took away his phone and any way to contact me.  They did not know about me now but now they do so they will never let him use the internet again. They were going to let my boyfriend’s brother get off with no consequences and punish my boyfriend instead. They destroyed all the CP on my boyfriend’s brothers computer so he old not get prosecuted.

I ended up calling the police and while they confirmed to me that he was safe, that was hours ago.  They then asked my questions about the CP and I could only tell them what my boyfriend knew. 

My boyfriend’s family found out about him calling the police but now they want to press charges against my boyfriend for doing so. I called again an hour ago and they told me he was still at the place where they had left him. I have a friend of his from high school coming to see if he is still there so he can pick him up and take him to a motel. 

I worry that they found my boyfriend and forced him to go home, they will never let me speak to him again and he will be stuck there. What can I do if he is forced to go back home because he can’t get in contact with me.  I am so scared for him, I don’t know what is going to happen to him and I cant reach him because he doesn’t have his phone.  How can I help him?

I recently grew a strange habit of expecting character twists.

A character twist is shocking and meaningful because it changes something big in the story, therefore it is only meaningful when it is thought 'inside' the story.(Frozen, Harry potter etc)

But nowadays I suddenly got a strange habit of stopping and thinking 'maybe he\`s the villan' at every character, and it bugs me.

Before than I saw conutless character twists and I all enjoyed it. So I believe this habit is harmful when watching movies, even stupid because when you theorize when watching movies you should do it with 'inside' foreshadowings, not mere(Obsessive) guess.

113,"I tried to break up with my live-in boyfriend last night. But then he said that I’m his meaning of life, and I lost it. I still feel it’s better for me to be alone, but I was weak to stand my ground. How can I do that?

We have been in this relationship for 10 months, living together for 6 months. He moved in to live with me at my place from another state. I want to mention right away that he still has his old place to live as well as he is still working for his old job, since he’s a freelancer.

Everything was going well. He’s sweet and nice, and I care for him, and he always calls me love of his life, but as time went by I just realized we are different in many ways. I don’t understand his sense of humor and some of the jokes he’s making and not funny, but silly or even borderline unacceptable to me.

I do all of the work around the house, I pay all of the bills and rent, I also spend a lot of time working and I’m also in a grad school. He’s sleeping half of the day, and never notices if there’s anything that needs to be done (feed the cat, take the trash out, throw cans or candy wrappers in the trash after he’s done with them).

I was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression, because I started feeling worse couple months ago. Whenever I work, it’s a way to hide from the world and be by myself for a moment. He starts showing his upset and sadness in a childish way, or makes another borderline joke, and if I don’t laugh, he demonstrates his upset again.

I was not able to find an outlet to be in my own since we started living together. He wants me to watch the shows that he likes. I can do that sometimes, but now it feels like I only watch what he wants. Whenever I go to another room to try to watch something on my own or read a book or listen to a podcast, he follows me asking what happened. This drives my anxiety even more! He plays his music every time, and I was never able to play my music for myself. In a way, I stopped feeling comfortable in my own home.

I also told him about my anxiety and depression, and that I’ve started taking antidepressants. He never asked me about it after that, and only mentioned it one time saying that seems like my antidepressants have a bad side effects of lowering sex drive. That’s partially true. But even before that we could go for 4-8 weeks without sex, because he wasn’t into it, even though I tried. So I felt offended that I respected the time when he wasn’t into it, yet he got upset when I couldn’t because of medication.

I’ve been thinking of breaking up for some time. My anxiety is just going insanely up because of work, school, finances, family, and this relationship. I feel like I need to be on my own for now, that it would be better for me, and I wouldn’t drag him.

Thing is, I know that moving from his previous home and meeting me has helped him in some way. He had a drug addiction, and he keeps saying that I saved his life, and if not me, he would be at a bad place. I know it’s partially true, but I also know that he needs to do it for himself, not for me.

So I eventually decided to break up. I started the conversation, and said that I just need to sort my life now. That I care about him, and that he is an amazing person, but for my own sanity I don’t see myself in any relationship in the near future. At first he was quiet, and I thought we are over. Then he left to smoke, came back crying and saying that he doesn’t understand. He begged me not to do that, that he doesn’t want to leave. That he’ll end up in a bad place. And then I just broke. I started ugly crying and eventually had a panic attack. When he asked if I want him to leave, I said no, even though I’m my head I immediately started blaming myself for not doing what I wanted.

When it was all over, I calmed down in a bit, and went to lay down because of a headache after the panic attack. He walked in, asked to never do this again, and then asked me to get something for sex drive from my doctor. He started hinting towards sex, and when I said I don’t want to, he made a joke that he would just rape me then. It wasn’t funny for me at all, but I ended up doing it even though I didn’t feel anything at all. That made the whole break up day worse.

I still know I need and want to break up. But I wasn’t emotionally ready for his reaction. I don’t know what to do.

TLDL: Wanted to break up with a live-in BF who lives at my place. I do all the chores, pay rent and bills, cook, while dealing with anxiety and depression and a lot to deal with, and not being able to get a minute just for myself. I care for him, but I don’t see us together in the future, and I feel I need to be by myself for now. I started a break up talk, but eventually he started begging me not to do that, and kept saying that he’ll go back to drugs without me. I had a panic attack and couldn’t tell him to leave. Soon after that he wanted to have sex when I didn’t want to because of my meds, but he joked about raping me. I still want and need to break up, but I’m not emotionally ready for his reaction.

118,"I got my wisdom teeth pulled a few days ago and I’ve been to doing a whole lot of nothing and thinking about life. The last two days though I’ve been thinking about my past with my parents (mainly just my dad) and have realized that I don’t think I was the son he really wanted. I’ve snuck out a few times , gotten suspended at school, got some bad grades my first two years of high school, lied to him, and overall was incredibly rowdy. He was a much better student than me and did a lot of things different and I just feel that the way I made my mistakes are not the way he wanted his son to end up. Lately I’ve just been waking up and feeling just dirty and terrible all over, I’ve gotten almost all A’s and haven’t gotten into any trouble the last few years but I feel like I started caring at the wrong time and he just thinks I’m worthless. I don’t talk to him much at all anymore because my stepmom takes care of things, but am I overthinking this?

119,"I’m slowly starting to give up. I feel like I should end it. What’s the point in being alive if I can’t have a friendship? All I desire is a friend who won’t betray me or treat me horribly. 

It starts like this: Ever since I can remember I’ve been bullied. I was bullied relentlessly in elementary school. By a group of girls and even a teacher. Every single day at recess, it was always me trying to find ways to “enter” their “cool club” and they would bully me every single day of the year. Not exaggerating. 

When I would spend the night at my neighbors house when my mom was at work, my neighbors daughter would bully me and tell me she wished I would die. In 5th grade, a guy I had a crush on partook in the bullying and touched me inappropriately and thought he could get away with it because I liked him. 

When I got to middle school, the bullying was more subtle. People I was friends with would still ostracise me and make fun of me. I remember one time I told my best friend I really liked this guy (and he liked me too), and she dated him just to spite me. In 7th grade, all my friends turned against me and spread rumours about me being gay and would call me slurs. The bullying got so bad that I ended up switching to online school for the rest of 7th and 8th grade. I couldn’t take it anymore, I was really suicidal. 

When I got to High School, I only had one best friend (who was my only friend, and he was a guy) and he slowly turned on me too. He ended up replacing me for the girl who bullied me relentlessly in middle school after using me for his own benefit (no one was able to hang out with him on his birthday, I was the only one who did). Things started to get better during Junior year, I was really good friends with this girl. But all of a sudden she started being rude and nasty towards me and completely discarded me and talked sh*t about me behind my back. My “new” set of friends pitied me and only talked to me just because and only used me to their own benefit.

I’m a senior now. I’ve never had one stable friendship in my life and it makes me really sad. I’ve never been invited to a party, and only went to homecoming once. I’ve even skipped school a few times during pep rally days so I wouldn’t have to stand there in the crowd of people and their giggling friends while being alone. Having no friends it humiliating and it hurts badly. What do I even do? I’ve tried to be more amiable, try to find common interests, everything. I honestly feel like ending it because what’s the point of life without closeness?

121,"So, a couple months ago, I broke up with my ex girlfriend. At the time, it was mutual, and we decided to stay as friends, so we texted each other every week or so, just to check up, and we both were doing fine.

Around 3 weeks after we broke up, her mood changed drastically. (she struggles with anxiety and depression) she said she wanted me back, and shes rethought her decision. I wanted to be alone, so I had to reject her, which was one of the hardest things i had to do. Had to reject her again when she begged me again after. Very rough stuff. Absolutely awful to have to do to someone ive loved so much.

Anyway, she is at the lowest low of her entire life basically because of me. She sees no happiness in her life anymore, and her entire worldview has gone nihilistic and bleak. She also comes from a broken home and has alcoholic parents.

I feel guilty for causing so much pain upon a human being, as she loved me so much. I still support her, and talk to her every week. I'm never mean to her, and I always make sure shes doing ok.

But everytime we talk shes even more depressed and lifeless than the last, and I'm worried that shes gonna turn to suicide, as she says she barely has anything left, and I was her last hope.

I feel like I've ruined a life, and made a girl from a broken home's life even worse than it was. How do I cope with the guilt? How do I deal with this situation?",10Aug2020,1
123,"My friend of 10 years, friend since high school. Her boyfriend is possessive of her and kind of see me as a trek. He always calling her or texting her when we hang out.

Always making comment to her “I know you guys have something going on”. There a lot that been going on. They been together for like a year. When I went to meet her in her house(she keep texting and even facetime him when we were eating out), and went to the bar to have a girl night.

One time talking on the phone, she got upset and told me that I been disrespectful toward him. That every time she bring him up I said “ let change the conversation”, that I need to begin to respect him as her boyfriend. That he is always going to be on her lives and that if I ask her how was her day she would always bring him up( cause everyday she spend time with him).

126,"

Many years ago I was best friends with this girl. She was like my twin in a way. But several years ago, I hit a very bad place. And I was sick and at home. However, she didn’t bother to call besides one time. 

Now it’s like she will talk to me once in a blue moon. I don’t know what to make of all of this, but I do know that I’m still hurt, but also kinda want to wish her happy birthday. Even though she never wishes me one anymore. 

In fact, she went as far as to comment on a post that involved me the day before my birthday, (and we very briefly chatted when I asked a question). So I was kinda hoping she would wish me a happy birthday the next day so that we could at least be on speaking terms, but she didn’t. And I doubt she would just forget after the many years where we would both call each other on our birthdays to talk. 

I’m just so hurt and confused on how to feel. I’ve tried for years to let go but I’m just so sad and angry. 

She probably didn’t know, but I suffered the most I have ever suffered several years ago. And I tried to reach out, but she didn’t really understand. So I just stopped trying. And then my world fell apart. It was like I was dying every single day. 

I’m better(ish) now. But I’m still haunted by the memories we shared because I don’t know what to do with them. They still mean a lot to me even though she isn’t in my life anymore. 

I thought for awhile we could rekindle our friendship when she called me up one day out of the blue, but then she didn’t remember my birthday but DID remember her friendship anniversary with another friend of our ON THE SAME DAY. 

I’m just so mad and sad. I just wish I could move forward. But I also wish that those other friends of her could realize the hurt she has caused me.",10Aug2020,1

130,"A bit of background on my mom. I have a good relationship with her and don’t consider her to generally be a controlling or bad parent, but this experience made me question things. About 7 or 8 years ago, my mom(F53) got very into clean eating. She gave up processed sugar, gluten, pretty much all things processed. Her and I were already vegetarians and had been our whole lives. Throughout high school she brought me to holistic “doctors” and put me on restrictive diets under their advice, one of which included eliminating soy, flour, dairy, and eggs from my diet. Anyways, this is not what I’m complaining about, I know she was trying to help me and I’m not mad about that. 
Beginning in May, I(20M) started to develop an eating disorder. I’ve always been skinny, but due to anxiety I focused on my eating as something to control. I would exercise frequently and eat as little as 400 calories per day, if I ate at all. My diet became increasingly restrictive to the point where I was only eating two sugar free protein bars per day. I lost 25 pounds in the span of two months and had a bmi considered “underweight” (I don’t want to focus too much on scale numbers because that can be counter-productive). With the help of my therapist, I’ve started to eat again and am trying not to label foods as “good” or “bad”. My mom is the only person in my life I’ve trusted enough to confide in about my struggles with eating, and for the most part she’s been very supportive (though she at times does push that if I were gluten free and all that I wouldn’t have gotten an ED). 
Anyways, here is the incident. I was over at my mom’s house because I wanted a break from my dad (my parents are divorced and I’m living with my dad currently). I was hungry, so I grabbed some hard pretzels and peanut butter as a snack (the glutinous pretzels were there because I bought them while house sitting for her). I start eating, and she comments that I “shouldn’t be eating bad food.” And “shouldn’t fill up on junk.” Natural Peanut butter has been a great source of protein and fats for me as I’ve been regaining my weight. As I had told her, I’ve been trying hard to combat my judgements on foods as “good” and “bad”. I tried to ignore her and keep eating. That’s when she came up to me and snatched the bag of pretzels away from me. But it did set back my recovery slightly, as I felt she was validating my negative food thoughts. I feel like she was just trying to help, but I found this incident upsetting and I’m still not really sure what to think of it. I’d love to hear others’ perspectives. Should I confront her on this? (Sorry for the rambling, this is my first reddit post. I just don’t know how to deal with this situation and I really feel like I need to tell someone).",10Aug2020,1

I have a wonderful friend in another state (we met in person a few times before, we're literally just a few hours apart) who seemed to come into my life at the perfect time for this about 2 years ago. He is even offering to let me stay at his place as a roommate.

137,"It sounds weird I know it does to me too. For the past few years i’ve known someone mutually. Other friends and school and such. Never directly friends more on the brink of enemies just tolerating each other for the sake of their friends.

However I can’t get them out of my head since I met them and it’s the weirdest thing. They’re in my dreams, in my thoughts almost always, just constantly there and it’s really bothering me. I haven’t told anyone I know because they’d think I like the person which believe me I don’t. 

The person annoys me A LOT. When we talk it always ends up in a fight and we never last long in tolerating periods before we fight and not talk till we have to. I don’t like them I know I don’t I hate everything about them personality wise. 

I also don’t know what to do it’s been years. It’s really weird and awkward to even acknowledge why I’m thinking of the most random person at all times when I could be thinking of someone I actually like. 

It legit feels like a witch’s curse on me to have the only person I’ve hated always in my head and I can’t help it. What does it mean? How do I stop it? We haven’t talked in months and we won’t ever again probably so reaching out to them isn’t an option. I just need anyone to explain why this has been happening.

145,"I’ll start off my saying that I used to like my job. I’d give it a solid B. (Always room for improvement of course. But since covid it has changed *dramatically* and 5 months into the new changes, I am at my absolute breaking point.

Let me start off with what I actually do for a living. I do diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s. This involves me reading words to them, having them repeat back to me, and then later on in the test ask them to tell me them again. Along with various other types of tests that hit every part of brain function. (Mental processing, language, visual processing) the testing takes about an hour. 

Since covid, I have had to completely adapt the way I conduct tests to make them suitable for testing. This includes even cutting out certain tests entirely. (written portions) 

What other issues come along with virtual testing? Patients cheating (writing words down so they can recall later) audio completely cutting out, videos freezing, being completely kicked out of a session entirely. So many factors play into it that render my evaluations  invalid and practically useless. Many times I have had to end appointments due to the tests being completely invalid for one reason or another. 

I try to trouble shoot with my patients the day before to make sure they understand how to navigate their phones, computers, iPads and make sure they are able to use the program we use. (Our hospital requires us to use a cheap ass program that is super picky about what time of device and browser we use) it can take 2-3 hours out of my day on top of my regular scheduled patients I see.  Sometimes I don’t even get to take a lunch. 

On top of all this shit, my boss (neuropsychologist that I report to) is working from home. He barely recognizes the blood sweat and tears I put forth to make sure our appointments run as smooth as possible. If he does *actually* know how hard I work, he doesn’t care which makes it a million times worse. Our work relationship has become strained due to only speaking through a messaging program. He also has a “get as much data as you can no matter what” attitude. Even if the audio and video is cutting out, even if I have to restart the appointment session 4 times. 

And to make matters worse, the lady that scheduled our appointments, who has always been a bitch but I’ve been able to deal with her because for the most part, I’ve enjoyed other aspects of my job, is still a huge pain in the ass. She pushes tasks on me, bitches when I do them wrong, even though these things she has me to I have done only a couple of times. She schedules appointments during times she knows I have lunch (and just tells me to “adjust my schedule”) she has no respect or regard for my work.  I have brought her up to the assistant clinic manager, but she has no solution for me as she has the same issues that I have with this lady. 

I want to wash my hands of this place so bad. The only thing keeping me here is this place pays me better than any other place would and that’s important during these uncertain times. I want to bring this all up to my boss. How can I effectively bring this up to him when he has been so out of the loop from working from home? Since most of my complaints are largely out of anyone’s control (like video appointments. We want to keep our patients safe) I’m afraid that it’ll look like just that—complaints. But I need to tell my boss these things because they are eating me alive.",10Aug2020,1

147,"I'm not exactly the type of person to do this, but I desperately want advice because I don't understand. So, a little background information to start: I've met this guy online when I needed help learning his language, he was extremely nice and helpful and we soon started to develop a pretty good friendship. He's one of the only people I've met that can keep a pretty interesting conversation with me for hours. I soon started to develop feelings for him without even realizing that I did. Soon after, it almost seemed like he was too, he hinted occasionally and made many jokes like usual. I didn't really know how to react to that, so I tried my best to show my appreciation. It all seemed pretty good at that point.
And here is my current problem: one day when I was asking him a question about something he was curious and asked my race, he assumed that I was white, but I wasn't. My parents always spoon-fed information and stereotypes about the people in his country and that ultimately scared me into thinking that he genuinely cared about it, I nervously told him and he told me that everything was fine and he didn't care about race at all. From that moment everything seemed awkward and felt off in a way. He made less jokes, stopped trying to hint anything at all and overall just seemed like he wasn't interested. My friends have told me and even made me ask ""what are your thoughts about me."" But I keep thinking about every possible thing that could happen and feel obligated to do some sort of research to gain an understanding on things that my friends would think are common knowledge (flirting, behavior, etc). But they tell me to stop and I force myself to stop. They say that if I'm too cautious, like right now, then I won't have a chance.

148,"Sup peeps, posting this on my semi throwaway/side account for reasons :I 

Long and complicated story but, for context, I’m a bisexual male, 21. I’ve never somehow developed feelings (other than sexual) for a guy so I’m literally new to this in every way possible. 

So a few years back I talked to this guy when I wasn’t supposed to (military and stupid rank “rules”) I was actually supposed to “haze” him but I didn’t and told a bunch of people to fuck off. Well, I never intended for me to develop feelings for the guy since as I mentioned, at this point I thought it just wasn’t possible. Idfk I’ve only been in romantic relationships with girls and up to this point guys were just kinda a sexual thing. 

So fast forward a couple years, we got pretty close etc. one day I was doing my usual insomnia routine before sleeping, “I wonder y rectangle pencils exist” etc then I started thinking about said guy and I realized, “fuck” at some point I realized I had stopped seeing him in a sexual manor (like I usually do for everyone, female and male) which meant I “like liked” him.

Its suuuper confusing and i moreso wonder why im like this rather than what to do. 

Ive told her multiple times that i dont wanna be in a relationship and i know i should probably just stop talking to her just to keep her from being confused and getting hurt. 

And im not just trying to use her or anything i mean ill get seemingly genuine feelings for her that just stay for a bit then ultimately dip :/. I just dont want her to feel like im using her and being a chode cause thats not the case im just too confused",10Aug2020,1
150,"My best friend of 10+ years has always struggled with mental health issues, mainly anger and emotional regulation. This stems from a messed up childhood amongst other things I’ve never been able to fully understand. 
Her history with drugs has always been rocky, with stints of I guess addiction to various substances, but it was always some what recreational. I myself have done plenty of drugs which turned into addiction for a few years too, but she was actually the one to help pull me out of that.
She’s started dating a guy who’d she’s been friends with for years and years, and it’s been months and months now of constant alcohol and drug abuse. 
His history is similar to hers, he’s been to rehab for addiction a few times, and has gone into full blown drug psychosis for periods of time, multiple times.

There’s been physical abuse from both parties and she’s told me she’s scared of him. I know her very well tho and I know she’s throwing out just as much abuse as him, physical and mental, but then I also see him gaslighting her and messing with her head, which is already messed up from the drugs, and I don’t know how he acts to her behind closed doors, cause he’s great at putting forward a “good guy” vibe when they fight around me. 

I don’t know who’s the toxic one, or if they are both toxic, or if I can even try helping, or how. Being around all of it drains me, worries me and I’ve told her before I can’t be apart of her life anymore, but then had a friend who was on a similar path be murdered for some fucked up drug situation, and I fear that something horrible could happen to her and I would never forgive myself for not trying to help.",10Aug2020,1
151,"Hello reddit!

So, I've been living in this apartment since April. My lease ends on 31st August. I haven't had time to look for a place and have too much schoolwork to do. The landlord has already found a tenant to move into my apartment. By the way, the new tenant is currently living in another room at our apartment and wants to move into mine in September. The landlord said that we cannot renew or extend our lease and I need to move out. Do you think that I have a right to my room and should be able to extend or their new lease takes precedence?",10Aug2020,1
152,So the reason I said I think my bf sexually harassed me is because I don’t know if it was his fault or mines. So I was on a date with him and I was going great but towards the end I had gotten some very bad news through text from my mom. I had gotten upset and we ended up leaving the mall. I was driving him so as I was driving him back to his house he was touching all over me and I started getting uncomfortable because I was still upset but I did calm down considerably. Now I kept telling him to stop and pushing his hands away I normally wouldn’t mind or care but that day I just couldn’t do it. When we got back to his house to drop him off he convinced me to go in the back to “cuddle” because I was sad and I believed that and basically to speed the story up he started groping me and dry humping me aggressively after I said no about ten times and tried to leave but he kept closing the car door and holding me to him ...I Eventually said fine and stopped fighting because I really wanted to leave at that point and even gave him a slight bj so he would shut up and stop staring at me and let me leave but after that I started to get naseous when I was driving back and kept gagging it felt like something was stuck in my throat and when ever I see him make a certain face or see him shirt less I start to feel sick and gag . I did talk to him and he apologized and I did see him once after and he didn’t do anything and I didn’t get sick but then again he didn’t touch me but on ft and selfies he sends makes me really uneasy I need help I really love him but this is really getting in the way.,10Aug2020,1

154,"I started a new job last Friday and last Saturday night, my new supervisor called me when I was out with my friends. I ducked into another room to take the call but it ended up lasting two hours as she started telling stories from childhood. The evening ended up wasted by this, and I considered it a one-time thing.

Then we spoke for another hour on Monday, then on Wednesday. On Thursday we spoke for an hour and a half. I’m posting this currently on a call with her at 10:45 PM on a Sunday night, and she’s talking about her friends and her life experiences but it’s a Sunday night far outside of work hours and I don’t really want to listen to my boss monologue for two hours.

The problem is, she’s in an authority position and I can’t stop her from speaking for risk of looking like a bad employee. So I politely listen and nod along, but as I said it’s nearly 11 PM on a Sunday night and I’m in my 91st minute of listening to my supervisor tell me about her childhood.

I’m 32 (M), straight.   



I’ve had sex with women since I was 21.   With girlfriends, one nights etc. etc.  



Never ONCE...EVER.... after reaching orgasm.... have wanted the women in bed with me thereafter.  


I don’t feel human.   I’m very considerate about people’s feelings; I’ve even loved and considered marrying a few of these women.   However.  No matter who it is or what type of relationship we have.... I feel disgusted towards the women.   Not to myself, but at/towards the women.    


Sometimes after sex, I can’t stand to look at their faces.  


I’m sorry, I don’t want to offend ANYONE.  That’s not the premise of this question.    It’s just I want to be normal.  

My girlfriend of 5 years, of whom I’m with... doesn’t know.   I don’t want to fuck things up because I want to have children and a life with her.   I want to purchase a house and have her be the love of my life forever.     She’s a 20 out of 10.... and I just don’t know why I can’t look at her after sex (or any other women).

Should I see a psychiatrist/psychologist first?

160,"Hi, my name’s Nico, I’m 17, my pronouns are they/them (or he/him I guess I ain’t here to start a fight or something) and I’m not sure if this was rape or not. There’s a TLDR at the end with bullet points if it’s to long. 

So I met this guy named Ramar. I’m a trans guy. Non-binary actually but I ain’t explaining that shit right now so for context purposes I’m a trans guy. He thought I was a girl and in an awkward exchange he got my number and we started talking. Eventually we became pretty good friends and I came over to his house. Things got heated and one thing led to another and next thing I know he’s on top of me saying “if you want it, kiss me.” I wasn’t sure, but I was lonely as fuck so I just kissed him. I have that consent, but he pulls out his dick and I say “I’m not on birth control so do you have a condom??”   He went on about how he didn’t like condoms and how his “pull out game was great.” After arguing for a bit he finally put on a condom. Later on some of his family comes back. His room is pretty much in the living room except it has the equivalent of a blanket in between his room and the living room. So when his family is sitting there he’s still insistent on fucking me despite me asking “should we stop?” He said “I’ve never been caught before and I sometimes wonder what it’s like.” That’s not all though...

Tonight was different. I came over to his house believing we were just gonna draw and watch anime, but he’s a horny I guess. I was drawing and at first it was kinda funny. He kept trying to pull down my pants but couldn’t because well, I was just sitting there. I didn’t mind, I thought it was funny sense he hand to move by body around like I was a rag doll. It was all fun and games, until a bit later. I had to pee and I came back downstairs to his room. He kept trying to get in my pants again but this time he noticed my self harm scratches on my thigh. He asked me what it was. I told him I didn’t wanna talk about it. After a back and forth I felt like I was presented with two options. Tell him about what the scratches were from or bend over... so I bent over. It kinda hurt a bit but I didn’t care as long as I didn’t have to talk about my scratches. Eventually I heard him say “fuck the condom” and I spun around. I freaked out and he said “no it’s fine it just broke” so I freaks out some more and he said “no it’s cool it broke like right as I pulled out it’s fine.” I said “ok but I’m putting my underwear back on.” He said “I’m getting another condom.” I agreed to “one more thrust” sense he put a new condom on (it was more like 12 but whatever) and went to put my underwear on but he kept saying “hey I’m not done yet” so I was practically wrestling him off of me. Him trying to pin my arms down but I took self defense. I didn’t use anything that could hurt him but I knew how to get out of grips like that so I did. Eventually he gave up. We talked a bit more and now I’m home... 

TL;DR
- Had to argue to get him to put on a condom
-Didn’t care his whole family was dangerously close despite my concern 
-He found my self harm scratches and I felt I was given either two options 1. Talk about my scratches or 2. Bend over and fuck. So I bent over. I got trust issues I’m not saying a word. 
-He said “fuck the condom” and when I freaked he said “it’s fine the condom just broke.” (More freaking out) “it’s fine it broke like right as I pulled out”
-I was done after it broke and said “I’m putting my underwear back on” but he put on another condom and I had to wrestle him off of me till he gave up.

2. Do XPS devices last a while? What is your opinion on its long term reliability? I've never owned a high-end device before hence the question.
3. Is there anything else I should know about the device before purchasing it that might not be very obvious to the average consumer?

context is that i remember my mom being abusive when i was littler, making me feel terrible for things that were even accidents or weren't even big deals. i have adhd so i wasn't the most perfect kid and her just making me feel bad i guess contributed to my depression and poor self-esteem later on. 

she's since gotten better but only after certain events like me actually saying i wanted to die and refusing to even leave my bed when i was 16 or so. shortly after i came out as trans too. 

there's things i'm still picking up on that she does though, that i only just now realize are still just as horrible. i was sobbing earlier because she guilt tripped me into making me feel selfish for asking for a small thing. it shouldn't have been a big deal but suddenly i'm terrible for it especially after she's done a lot for me ( most of which is trivial stuff i didn't ask for )

167,"So I have been working as an Aerospace Engineer for 3 years now. I make a little under $70k per year. After graduating I had about $100k in SL debt, though after 3 years of regular payments it's around $80-$90k now. 

I genuinely like my job, but to me, it's a job not a career. I can't really make a name for myself in my current position and there is no room for growth except for promotion to management. 

Naturally, I am having a quarter-life crisis (patent pending ;)).

After spending some time thinking about where I want my life to go, I have come up with four choices. 

1. **Stay at my current job and pursue an MSAE.** My boss has mentioned that the company I work for would pay for me to get a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering (MSAE). Once I graduate, I would get a significant raise. However, I'm not sure that I want to go back to school for an MSAE because, while I genuinely like my job, I am not passionate about engineering. 
2. **Leave my current job, move away, and get an MS/Ph.D. in Astronomy/Astrophysics.** Before deciding to go to school for Aerospace Engineering, I wanted to be an Astronomer or an astrophysicist. My parents convinced me to go into engineering instead because ""I wouldn't make any money as an Astronomer"". I'm sure my parents are right, it would be difficult to get a job, but I am passionate about Astronomy/Astrophysics and I sometimes regret selling out and switching to engineering. Unfortunately, this would require quitting my job and moving to go to school (no online programs - that I can find). I am willing to do this, but I wouldn't make an income to pay off my student loans (I know they would be deferred) and I would be accruing *a lot* more.
3. **Stay at my current job, skip out on grad school, and spend my spare time writing.** I am also passionate about writing fiction. As you can probably tell from this post, I need some work and I know it's very difficult to make it as a writer so I may unintentionally end up staying in the same spot my whole life. But, I could keep my job and continue to pay off my loans while pursuing something that I love.
4. **Stay at my current job, pursue an MFA in creative writing, and spend my spare time writing.** This may not be the best decision financially as I would have to pay out of pocket but I could pursue an MFA in creative writing at a local university. So, I could keep my job and go to school at night. This would help me improve fast and since I am passionate about it, I don't think it's a waste of money. 

So I have my four options. I think options 1 and 3 are the best financial decisions and my current student loan debt makes this super important. I think option 2 is what I would most like to do, however, if I fail, it would be debilitating financially. I also really like option 4 because I can continue to pay my student loans and work and I can mitigate the chance of failure as a writer by learning from professionals and establishing some connections with like-minded individuals. Thus my dilemma. 

You can probably tell that I am not too keen on engineering. My current job is more project management than engineering, which is why I enjoy it. As for my other passions, I can't choose between writing and Astronomy/Astrophysics. Though, I will say that writing is free. 

So I am not asking you to make a decision for me, but I would love some input on these options. I would also appreciate some tips on making a tough decision like this. 

For those of you who say I am overthinking it, I agree, I hear you, but how do I not overthink a decision that will change the course of my life? 

I know this is a lot but I really appreciate everyone's advice. Thanks in advance :).

171,"A little backstory. My ex (F19) and I (M19) dated for about a year and a half back in high school starting my junior year and her sophomore year (she's only a 3 months younger than me, but a grade under me). We were each others first time, but not just physical we were also each others first love; we had a few problems in the first few months, but after that there was never anything between us that we really fought about or anything that we were at intense odds about. Mid way through my senior year her junior she broke up with me. She said it was just a break for school and that in a few weeks she would give me an answer as to what we would do. After a few weeks we officially broke up, however, we continued to be FWB for a few months. I was always ok with this because I was still in love with her and I figured FWB was better than being nothing. At the beginning of my first year of college I stopped talking to her because I got really depressed and couldn't stop thinking about her and I thought she might be the cause. In my first year of college I was in and out of a few relationships, but they went bad one way or another and none felt like mine with her did. After the year ended I began talking to her again because I missed her and we hooked up. This made me realize how much I missed her, but we still didn't talk because she didn't want to be with me and I didn't want to torture myself like that so for about 3 months we didn't talk at all. The other day for the first time in a year she messaged me first and started a conversation with me. I thought it was just going to be about wanting to hook-up again, but she genuinely just wanted to talk to me. So we talked and ended hanging out. When we hung out we were at her house and just ended up cuddling and talking for a few hours. This made me realize how much I still missed her and loved her, however, when talking about it to her I made it seem like I was over her and didn't want a relationship with her. Today she moved for college is now hundreds of miles away and doesn't know how I really feel. I know that life doesn't work like it does in the movies were I can just tell her I love her and she'll stay with me and reciprocate the feelings and life will be great. But all day I've felt really down about losing her without telling her how I feel. What I want to know is should I tell her and risk what little friendship I have left with her and hope I could maybe make some long distance thing work, or should I just go to therapy and try to forget about her?",10Aug2020,1
172,"Okay so about two days ago I (19F) went to my cottage. A family of mice had moved into my cottage as well, so my family and I were not alone. 
At about 4:00 after I came back from the beach (it’s empty even during Covid, don’t worry) and I checked out the bedsheets because Spiders and saw a bunch of seeds under my pillow. A mouse nest. I have found their home. I told my father and he shook out the sheets. Done. Still sketchy but whatever.
At about 11:00, I saw a mouse run under my bed and ya know this kind of freaked me out a bit because it’s a small animal that could be carrying a disease and it is under my bed... where I sleep. My father kind of brushed it off, but placed a trap in the room because I kept bugging him. About a half hour later, my sister was going to bed and saw a mouse in the kitchen. I did not know at the time, but the kitchen mouse is the second mouse. There are two at this point. I am arguably more of a tomboy and I figured that she wouldn’t be able to sleep until it was gone, so I went in the kitchen and tried to catch it with a cup (it was on the counter). Didn’t work, so I grabbed the trap from my room and saw a mouse there immediately under the night stand. I figured it had just travelled fast or something. To make my sister feel more comfortable, I moved the trap back into the kitchen. 
I got comfortable and started falling asleep when I felt something brush my finger. I jolted awake and didn’t see anything so I figured I must of touched my pillow or something. I almost fall asleep again when I see it. A mouse was chilling right beside my face on my bed. I didn’t scream or anything, but I got out of bed and turned the light on. I didn’t tell my sister because I didn’t want to freak her out. 
At this point, there is no way I’m falling asleep. We hear the mice running around again, my sister is also not going to fall asleep. My father is out cold by sleeping pill, so it’s just the two of us. 
I set up a box trap with a cup and my phone charger and the mouse trap is near by. The mice go for the trap multiple times, but they are so young and small that they didn’t set it off when they ate the peanut butter. After about forty-five minutes of waiting, we realize there is a second and third mouse. At one point there was a mouse on the ground, on the counter running all over our utensils and food and another little asshole running on a light bar. Chaos ensues and we are just watching these tiny buggers jump and run around. Keep in mind my cottage is no more than 400 square feet.
Every little sound is critical because they could be anywhere. At around 1:30, I placed the mouse trap on the counter. One of the mice was going for it, but instead of waiting to see it take some of the bait and leave, I caught the mouse with a frog net. Before it could bite through the net, I slammed a clear cup over it. To my horror, the mouse started bleeding. I have no idea where it was bleeding, but I can tell you that the counter looked like a crime scene after I picked up the mouse to let it go outside. 
The other two mice seemed to have disappeared after that, because we didn’t see them again that night. We decided to call the hunt off because it had been another hour and the two mice were a no-show. I went to bed at around 2:30. That night, I had horrible dreams about the mouse and I had a nightmare about killing another one... I won’t go into details because it was so disturbing and it makes me cringe just thinking about it. I feel so bad for hurting that little dude. I was just doing its thing and I hurt it and maybe killed it.
I practically begged my sister to drive me back to my house the day after, because there was no way I could sleep in that bed again knowing the mice were still in the cottage. I can’t explain how bad it feels to be exhausted but being unable to feel comfortable where I sleep. It’s just so gross. 
Every time I hear a little noise, I’m like hey is that a mouse? Did it climb into my bag? Is there a mouse in my room? Even shadows have been freaking me out when I see them in the corner of my eye.
Honest to god, I can’t believe I’m so freaked out by a stupid mouse, yet here I am flinching at every noise when I know full well there are no mice in my house. I feel like it’s reasonable to be afraid of a rodent infestation, but am I taking it too far? Part of me is saying I should just chill out, but the other is on red alert for anything that moves.
So am I overreacting or is this fear rational?",10Aug2020,1
174,"(FL) My manager says one thing, friends and research say the other.

**BEFORE YOU READ** This post was structured and written for r/legaladvice. I also happen to be a lazy shit and don’t want to re write it, but I wanted y’all opinions and thoughts on what to do in this situation.

Let me start by saying, I’m a male 14 year old. I work at a fast food place I know I’m young. Heard it 1000 times. I got this job through a family member who works there, and have had it about 2 or 3 months. 

I was very clear in that I wanted this job a lot and would work hard for it. I will also say, I’m not sure how “legal” this advice would be, but I figured it would be remotely legal. I have been getting a lot less hours recently, and have started to wonder why. 

I come in early, clock in, do what’s expected of me and more of what’s expected of me when possible, which is a lot, am generally a good worker, and am nice to everyone. The first few weeks I worked there I did a lot of standing around because you don’t know what to do, and they yell at you for doing so. I know (mostly) now what to do, however have noticed that someone who started working here about a month or so ago, and is the same level as me, generally knows a lot more and was clearly trained a lot better. 

I have also noticed that my managers and sometimes co workers treat me like shit compared to other people. They scold me for shit I haven’t been taught to do, yell at me if I make a small rookie mistake, and more, however even though this may put me in a bad mood, I try not to let it effect others, or how I’m working or treating customers. 

Where I’m going with this is that I am generally a good worker, and they have throttled my hours to generally about 12-15 hours and say that they can’t give me more due to child labor, and there is already a red flag in that because they have already given me 30 hours in a week, the max for someone my age (I’m also aware that they can’t give me as many hours during school, but I’m not in school right now) 

there also even happens to be a sign near the managers office that says most of what I just said, and this is where what I suppose the legal part would come in. I texted my friend about an hour ago, (he is the same age as me, I’ve been friends w him for a while and he works at The place with me) and asked him how many hours he’s getting next week, and for sake if someone at my work sees this so he doesn’t take the blame, I will say an approximate amount, but he said he got 25-30 hours this week, where as I have 15. 

Again, this may not be 100 percent legal advice, but what am I to do? If I call them out or say anything, I will most likely be either treated worse or most likely fired, and I don’t want to be treated this way. Where as, if she’s right, and I can only get 15 hours a week, does that not mean I could take legal action against her? 

Do your thing reddit, please help me out on this situation because it has really been stressing me out recently and been making me fell down.",10Aug2020,1
175,"Live in an apartment complex and walking down the stairs the next door neighbors have their dog out and he starts jumping and barking on a leash. I start to go around and he slips his collar and bites me on the calf drawing blood.

The dog apparently belongs to the 16 year old daughter and her brother (?) said he’s fine and has always lived in good homes, but had no paperwork. Daughter says she found him and has no shots.

We called 911 who reported it to animal control and I went to the ER and got treated for rabies. Now the advice, do we report this to our apartment complex? The neighbor says they’re getting rid of the dog regardless and I’m happy if that happens and if they pay my medical (~$300). My fiancé thinks we should tell the complex potentially bringing more trouble for the neighbors, since they’re absolutely not allowed to have it with it being aggressive and no vaccines.

176,"Years ago I (m23) used to talk to a friend (f) who I had a massive crush on, and we'd talk every day, but this was a time when I was a virgin and insecure of sexuality. At the time I lacked social skills and was awfully shy, and whenever my crush would mention her sexual experiences involving sex or something, I'd grow mildly depressed. Wasn't sure why, all I knew was I didn't want to hear her mention those stories. I was never jealous or anything, never felt hatred, or called her out about it (why would I?). I just felt really bummed out. Was wondering if this was a form of being sexually frustrated at the time, or something else. Years later, I'm now the complete opposite person from before, I've always thought back to what was my problem back then, and why I had this issue?",10Aug2020,1
177,"Hey guys, this is a strange one as I usually can figure this out myself but the last month has been non stop feeling like this.

For context I work a mill job, 5 days a week with usually 12 hours a day, I applied for the army a month ago and it’s still not come through due to a certain international crisis that is going on right now.

Now up until June I was doing pretty fine, I picked this job up back in February, pays ok, not enough to move out yet but we’re getting there, aside from a few depressive episodes here and there I’ve managed pretty well all things considered.
But then I turned 21 in June and man since that day everything has been so damn grey. A blur almost. Now to remedy this I tried to spoil myself a bit, see if I could rekindle a spark of myself that was all energy and happy go lucky stuff, I’ve even started a small YouTube channel to review video games on.
But unfortunately I just have not been able to get out of this funk I’m in. I think it’s all this waiting around to get away from this small town and my job. 

I know this is probably a lot of people’s problem right now but it’s just really hard. I barely have any time for myself and unlike my father I don’t like working this much. Which is impossible to cut back on unless I move away, which I don’t have money or friends to do.

Advice, similar stories and motivational messages are all welcome. Thank you in advance for your patience in reading my rant and your time.",10Aug2020,1
178,"So me and my boyfriend have been dating for over 6 months now and hasn’t said I love you to me. I said it to him and didn’t get a response. We had a conversation about it and he said he felt the same way but wasn’t ready to say those words back to me. I guess I should just take his word for it but it’s a bit more complicated than that. 
So at the beginning of the relationship he told me that I wasn’t his soulmate. I wasn’t the “one” for him and he couldn’t see himself being with me for more than 6 months. He also said he doesn’t think he’ll ever love me and when I say “I love you” to him that he won’t be able to say it back. So I said it and he didn’t say it back. 

To clarify a few things, the things he said early on where a HUGE issue for me. It caused me to block out my feelings, put up walls, and be dishonest with him. This caused many issues between us. I felt like I couldn’t fall in love with someone like that but I was convinced to stay. 
This relationship confused me so much in the beginning. He would buy me flowers, cook for me, take me on trips, and we would spend almost everyday and night together. But he swore he didn’t feel for me in a deep way. 

Things finally popped off and I said fuck you I respect myself too much for this. And I broke up with him. The next day he calls me and wants to talk. He said that he feels the same way I feel towards him and the things he said were lies. He said his last relationship messed him up and he had walls up because of it. 

Now I’m the relationship he’s talking about moving with me and living in a new city together. We talk about our future and what we want together. He’s helping me accomplish my goals so I can get where I want to be. Moving in is a big step for someone who can’t say I love you to me

Because of what happened in the beginning I still have some walls up. Every time I get closer with him I have to urge to jump back. What it there was some truth to what he said in the beginning. What if I’m not the one for him. Maybe he won’t ever love me back. But he’s been amazing to me ever since that conversation. He’s so sweet and kind. We never fight. He handles me well when I’m having a hard time with mental health. We go on cute dates and looking in from the outside things look amazing. And they feel amazing. But what if I just got caught in his trap.. I’m not entirely sure. 

I’m pretty sure not many people read through all that but do you think he loves me? Should I stay with him? 

At this point in the relationship I don’t know what to do. The words he said before often repeat in my head. I know I’m many instances it’s good to let go of the past. He can’t erase what he said and he might be talking the truth now. His actions show he cares for me but I can’t forget those words. Now he wants to move to another city and live in the same house as me. That’s a big step and I don’t know what to do

Could someone give me advice please? 

I know this is a very complex situation and no one knows his side of this. But I’d like to hear your thoughts",10Aug2020,1

181,"I  am pregnant and I think my fiancé is going to think I got pregnant on purpose and kick me out. We are 27

We have been together for 7 years. He works full time I work part time, we could afford a baby (especially if I worked full time) but we didn’t want to have a kid during the virus (in the USA which is a shitstorm) and we’re gonna MAYBE talk about MAYBE wanting kids in 5 years. He was totally on the fence and I was ok with waiting or not having any at all.

4 months ago I had a series of illnesses that led the dr to take out my IUD and switch to the pill. Because of other health concerns it was a pill that has a 13% failure rate. It’s not all that surprising but it is still something we didn’t plan for. 

Long story short. We always said I would get an abortion if this happened but now it has happened and I’m not sure I can abort... however I also rely on him 50% because he makes most of the money. 

When I tell him about the baby he’s going to be upset, I don’t know if he will want to be a father. Would it be better to abort to keep him or keep the baby and risk losing him?

I know deep down he would be a great father but it would take a TON of time and effort and I don’t know if he’s prepared to put forth that effort. 


I don’t know what I can do. I will have to tell him soon but as long as we have been together I think I know what will happen next.",10Aug2020,1

She was concerned because she didn’t want him swearing infront of us, even though most of are teenagers (youngest is 12) and we all hear swears on a consistent basis. She started thinking that he was a bad kid just because he was swearing, even though he seemed pretty nice. She doesn’t let me and my sister swear, even though she swears in front of us.

183,"As the title suggests, I work in a call centre and am losing my hearing. I am profoundly deaf in the left ear and my right ear is at about 60% and deteriorating. Given that my role is 100% customer focused, I organised a meeting back in February with my bosses to explain the situation, and I told them that I was concerned that my hearing issues will take away any value that I have to add and am worried about my future with the organisation. At the time, they were very supportive. They gave me a more flexible roster so I was able to fit in some sign language classes into my schedule, and spoke about organising some deaf awareness programs for the rest of the team. They also spoke about moving me into another, less customer focused, department where I would be able to play to my strengths. We spoke about what sort of role I would be interested in. About a year before this, my old boss had set up a career development thing, where we sat down and spoke about how we would like to grow within the organisation. I expressed an interest in moving into a HR role and so my boss at the time allocated some resources to me to get some qualifications in that area. So during this meeting in February with my current bosses, I told them that considering I am already working on my HR qualifications, and that it wouldn’t be customer focused, this would be a logical career path for me, which they also agreed. They asked me if I would be willing to relocate for the new role and I said that I would be happy to. At the time, the organisation was going through some structural changes, so they mentioned that this new position would not be available right away and they would need to work on having it tailored to both mine and the business needs, and they would get back to me in 2 months.

After 3 months of not hearing anything back, I emailed my boss to ask for an update and if there is anything I could do to assist. Obviously at this point we were in prime COVID  time so I understood that there could be delays with having this organised. My boss apologised for not getting back to me sooner and said that she was looking into ways that my current role could be altered (i.e having my role change from answering phones to opening the mail). I expressed that I do not want my role to be reduced to just being the person that opens the mail as I felt the would be a step backwards in my career and would also be somewhat demeaning. I reminded her about the conversation we had in February and that they were looking into developing a new role for me in a HR space, and she said she would look into this some more. This conversation was repeated a few more times over the last few months with no progress. However, last week I had another meeting and my boss told me that they are going to be focusing on moving me into a sales role. 

I don’t understand how I am going to be expected to make sales to customers if I am incapable of hearing them. I don’t want to have another customer based sales role on my resume. If I apply for any jobs in the future, all I will have in my job history is sales and customer roles which will be of no use to me, or any future employers as I cannot hear. I feel like my employer has been dangling this carrot in front of me this whole time, leading me on with this career development opportunity that never actually existed, only to send me into a role that takes me two steps back rather than forward. Ideally, I don’t really want to quit as that will bring me right back to square one. 

This whole thing has taken a pretty heavy toll on my mental health as I cannot see a way forward. If anyone has any advice for me on how to deal with this situation, whether it be how to approach my boss with my concerns and actually have them heard, or how to adapt and progress in a career as deaf, or hard of hearing person with a customer service dominant job history, it would be greatly appreciated. (I am based in Australia if that helps)

Thank you.",10Aug2020,1
184,"First off, I don't particularly like my mom, but I don't necessarily heavily dislike her either. Just a lot of baggage there due to a very messed up home life growing up. Was it her fault? Maybe. But was it her responsibility to do something about it? Yes. Am I over it? I guess. I moved out more or less at 16 and for real for real at 17.

Now that that is out of the way, here's the situation.

My father is planning on divorcing my mom and marrying a younger woman. He told her straight up. 30+ years of dysfunctional marriage gone, just like that. Honestly, my parents might as well not have ever been married based off the dynamic they shared but still. My mom has no skills or education past high school, can't drive, and hit or miss english. No money rolling around either. Plus, the reason I moved out never really resolved so it's not really the most safe for her there either.

She can't go live with either of my siblings because one is deployed on a ship and has no housing and the other one just got engaged and I guarantee her relationship will blowup if my mom suddenly is living with them lol. I want my sister to have the best chance at a good marriage haha. Exploring the option of my mom living with one of her sisters but I doubt it will pan out. 

Cash isn't too much of a holdup for me make this work. IF my wallet taps out I can just guilt trip my siblings. I just don't really have a desire for my mom to live with me. IDK. Not everyone can have a great childhood and I guess many people take for granted that there parents are self sufficient. Do I have that luxury? No. Do I wish I could just ignore the situation? Sure. But could I morally do that? Probably not. 

I mean, I'm f\*&amp;king a few weeks shy of 21! I'll keep grinding to bring my master plan to fruition but, for real, this is F'd up. Me, my mom I don't particularly like, cage match in my 2 bedroom apartment. Bruh I know WWE is an essential business but for seriously haha. 

I guess here is my question: How do I spin this so eventually my mom can just take care of herself and not live with me, (until she hits that mad old decrepit where you eventually gotta start making some real choices).

And before you say, stop making it all about yourself, have some heart, just know you can go shove that where the sun don't shine. You've got to take care of yourself before anyone else, and just because someone is technically your parent doesn't make them entitled to jack. I know this sucks for my mom and that she's probably sad about it but hey, writing has been on the wall for years.

This is going to be an interesting few years.................",10Aug2020,1

Driving Class Pros  

\-More well learnt

\-can ask questions

\-Can drive sooner (I’d have to wait \~5 months to start driving w/out) 

Driving Class Cons

\-Waste of time (officially has to be 50-60 hours of sitting in front of a computer watching the driving instruction PLUS the driving itself you have to do 50 hours or something and it might be raised)

\-Waste of money

\-Too late to start

Knowledge Test Pros

\-Have already read the booklet (2001 version so I’ll need to read the new one as well but I like reading so it’s good)

\-I’m a fast learner and can comprehend pretty easily (the classes are said to be boring) 

Knowledge Test Cons

\-less safe???

\-Have to wait to drive

\-Someone said something about insurance costing more??

190," Hi everyone. I (17f) am going to be starting my first year of college in the fall. Due to coronavirus reasons, I will not be able to go to campus but will have to learn remotely from another country, likely for the entire year.

My family is extremely dysfunctional. I have a sister (20) with mental health disorders, a brother (10) and dad with anger management issues that regularly turn things violent (nothing extreme but still), and a rowdy toddler in the house as well (my mom crumbling under the pressure of keeping things together). We have been stuck together all quarantine and there have been fights every day, constant screams, making it very difficult to have a livable space. Our house is quite small, I share a room, I do not have any privacy and struggle to understand how I will be able to successfully learn from home.

Furthermore, my parents are extremely controlling. I will be 18 in less than a month, yet I still need to beg for weeks in advance to go out with anyone, my technology use is extremely monitored, they often go through my texts, communications and social media accounts, I am not allowed to spend any part of the money I earn through my job, I can't wear makeup or clothes I like, and they have even asked my 10 year old brother to ""watch over me"" and report back to them any suspicious activity on my part. I am a straight A student, an elite athlete, I have never had a sip or a drag of anything of any sort (not implying that this is bad but you know), am involved in my community, have won multiple awards and am very social. I have tried everything to gain their trust and more freedoms with no luck.

I have also recently come out to them about liking girls and they are having a really hard time with it. They have grounded me and taken away my devices in order to stop me from seeing or talking to my girlfriend, and have tried multiple times to guilt me into breaking up with her.

I simply do not see how I can live like this for another year, and am looking for different options. I cannot move out of the city for various reasons, so if I left I would have to rent an apartment pretty close to my parents' house. My university has offered me grant money that I could use toward paying rent for the year but my parents said that was out of the question. Other than that, I have no other money to move out with. Talking to my parents to relax their rules has also been done many times to no avail. I do not want to be on bad terms with my parents or leave abruptly. So, Reddit, should I move out and risk ruining any relationship I have with my family but be free or should I bite the bullet and live in prison for another year?",10Aug2020,1

192,"Okay here’s the spill- 

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years. 
I gave birth to our son 6 months ago. 
My boyfriend started being distant and starting fights a lot. 
My boyfriend left me. 
About two weeks after we broke up, we had sex. 
Exactly 7 days after that, I got an outbreak on my buttcheek, hand and arm. I believed it at the time to be bug bites. They were so, so itchy and red and inflamed. For two weeks. 

Then, I got a cold sore on my lip. Granted, I already knew I had cold sores. I am completely aware of the HSV1 because I had a baby six months ago. They make damn sure to test pregnant women for HSV1 &amp; HSV2. I only had HSV1. 

Anyway, now we have been having sex here and there, but we just had sex maybe 4 days ago and I have those same “bug bites” on the inner buttcheeks. I’m reading more and believe that it is HSV2. Which I absolutely did not have 6 months ago. 

How could this happen? Is my baby’s father fucking someone else who gave him herpes, then turned around and gave them to me? Without him showing signs? 

Is there any possible way this could have happened without him fucking someone else?

Even when i try to narrow it down to one issue like i did in r/advice it still gets removed because, well idk ""trolling"" i guess.

VERY brief version of situation im tired of talking about, typing about, and thinking about to no avail because i guess im too dam poor to do anything about:

I have a pedofile next door to me. We were great neighbors. He got creepier everyday. We got protection order after he showed his genitals to my and my sis multiple times (Yes i know NOW i should have filmed him jacking off but at the time i was younger and felt very uncomfortable filming a person i trusted jacking off. I told my parents and they just said close the curtains when he did it. Please dont bring up how i should have filmed it, i sometimes feel like shooting myself for not filming it as it would have prevented all the rest of the shit it escalated into) and kept filming us and surveiling us with his countless devices. I dont think reddit can even help with anything besides this one issue which is the fence he put up. He put it up so it prevents us from using our driverway fully and we cant fully open our driveway gate. Im just wondering if I ""happen"" to break his fence while trying to open my gate all the way who will be liable. Or any other suggestions. Im in Ohio USA. Whatever this is probably just going to get fucking taken down too or just have the people commenting that they dont believe me.

PREDICTED SUGGESTIONS THAT WONT OR CANT WORK:
1) moving. We are poor as fuck which is how he has been so successful at targeting us.
2) survalance system. We are too poor to afford one and when i put up a fake camera he made his fence taller and use it for cover for listening or recording. Also it seems the rare times i get video evidence the cops say ""well i cant tell its him or not"" because my phone camera isnt a hd fucking movie camera where you can count the hairs on his eyelasshes.
3) calling cops. Wont work. Idk if i put why somewhere else or mentioned it earlier but im tired of re reading what i post only to have it taken down after but it wont work because he lives next door and can just retreat inside before i call the cops and WAY before they get here and by then he can just not open his door when the cops knock and when they leave all is back to normal for him. He uses a police scanner or something to tell when someone called the police and leaves before they get there usually. He claims ""God tells him when the police are coming and when to leave"" which i never even understood why he left because he could just choose not to answer like he sometimes does when the police get there.

Whatever idk why im putting effort into finding a solution anymore. This will probably just get taken down soon so whatever. Im going to charge my phone and after this last resort attempt leads to another dead end ill probably just give up for good trying this time. He has won after all, just like he always does. Being retired really gives you a lot of time and financial resources to figure out legal ways fuck up your neighbors life.",10Aug2020,1

Tonight I got a job offer. My stomach sunk, I panicked, and I said no.

My parents and I have a very close relationship, in fact we live together, we all own the house. We all take care of our own stuff: I do my own laundry, I cook my food, buy groceries, pay my own bills, etc. My parents don’t do any basic necessity for me so that’s not what makes me feel attached to them.

I moved back in after my divorce a couple of years ago. One part of me thinks I’m scared of change, though I’ve dealt with it before so I’m not sure why it would be a problem now. I want to live my dreams but also I think I’m scared of being away from the safety blanket that is my parents.

Cw/tw// disordered eating, self-harm, medication, poor mental health, abusive living situation 

TL;DR at the bottom

I (23x; they/them) have...anorexia, I guess you would say? It’s strange for me to even say that or put a name to it, as I don’t really take myself seriously. But at the end of the day, I know that other non-disordered people eat daily and don’t think of themselves the way I do, and also don’t lose weight as quickly as I do. 
I’ve never really eaten properly, and have suffered with food and other means of self-harm since I was at least 10. 
I don’t talk to anyone about these things since I know I won’t take help on them. When I was in high school and I tried to be honest with my best friend, I quickly realised that (obviously) they would not just let me starve and cut myself and not say anything. So I’ve just kept quiet now about the parts of my mental health that I won’t currently work to change. 
I wanted to add this part because if your first reaction is to tell me to “just eat,” please know that really does not help. It’s unfortunately not that easy. 
I also want to say that I’m not “pro” eating disorders, and another reason I avoid telling others about myself is due to how many friends/people I know have recovered from things like this and I don’t want to impact them negatively by being a hypocrite. 
On to the advice: I currently have to take a few medications for an unrelated health problem, and I’ve been feeling pretty terrible ever since starting them. I’m post-concussion with a lot of lingering effects, and the medicine is to help with the anxiety and migraines. I’ve tried to eat a little when I take it so it doesn’t cause so many problems, but some days when I take it I nearly pass out. I can’t stop taking the medicine, but I’m too afraid to tell my doctor. Does anyone know doctor protocol if I just tell my primary that I don’t really eat and the medication is becoming an issue? Even just the tiny bits of food I have with a pill freak me out, and the abusive living situation doesn’t help. I’m constantly berated for eating, or for how I look, and can’t collect unemployment or work, so moving isn’t currently an option. 
I’ve been drinking more water and continuing with the bits of food as much as I can, but I take the meds 3 times a day and some times even when I have more food than usual I’ve almost lost consciousness a couple of times. I know it probably sounds like it’s just from not eating properly, but when I say I haven’t truly eaten well in 13+ years, including when I was working 60+ hours  a week with maybe one snack per day, I’m serious. My body seemed very acclimated to how little I give it, but now with this addition of medication it’s struggling. 
Besides just the doctor’s protocol, I’m also not sure if there’s a more subtle way to find out what sort of issues the meds are causing from me taking them this way. The same with my concussion healing process in general. 
My household isn’t safe for the people I’m with to know, and local mental health facilities are not safe right now with the pandemic. As an immunocompromised person, I’m also terrified of being forced to go to one, which happened once when I was younger, and also afraid of being forced to eat. 
Is that my only option? I’m not sure what to do.

TL;DR: I’m 23x, they/them, and I rarely eat but have to take medication now due to a concussion. This is causing me to almost pass out, but no one knows about my eating disorder and I can’t tell them. What would my doctor do if they knew I don’t eat? Is there another, more subtle way to find out what to do or to find what this specific medicine is doing when I take it this way?",10Aug2020,1

Every day I try to ignore it by doing stuff I like, but it just doesn't work and it always looms over me just sitting there making me feel down. It sucks because whenever the feeling starts to kick in its happening whenever I am around people I call my friends or acquaintances and it just comes in and grows bigger and bigger until I just stop and sit there for a few minutes staring and listening as negative thoughts roll in and it is getting harder since I stopped biting my nails or pulling my hair so now I am starting to distance myself from my friends and I don't know what to do.

208,"Hey guys, hope everyone's well.

Basically at the start of this year I decided I needed a break from uni, it was all just getting to be a bit too much so I thought I'd take a year off. I'll admit this was kind of a rash decision on part, but I told my parents and they eventually came around and within a week I was out.

Cut to april, classes go online and my mom tells me I should take classes so I'm not wasting time at home. Now I thought that's fair since I was having trouble finding a job too, but then I just got hit with the worst existential crisis. The last couple of months have been really hard for me just trying to navigate my place in the world, school just started seeming so pointless. In that haze I'll admit I severely neglected a lot of my work. I know for a fact I failed 1 course, there'a chance I failed another 3 too making me fail a grand total of 4/5 classes. This sucks because I've literally never failed a class before.

Anyway, I'm not sure how to break the news to my parents. But more importantly, I dont know what to do about the following semster. It's also online - so my parents expect me to enroll. I don't know if I can drag myself out of this pit I'm in in order to do well. Honestly I'm just feeling so lost, I don't even know if it's worth it to continue - what's the point?

So it boils down to - should I suck it up and try to get through another semester or do something else entirely?

210,"So I'm in a house of strangers who know each other and everyone is nice  - but one.  This person's room is beside mine and whenever I'm around they make it seem like I am a massive problem. I would consider myself a fairly clean person but if I don't put away a cup or something it is pretty much instantly brought up by them (will continue to refer to the singular person as they/them) - I don't think they've lived with others before and don't think they realize that . In fairness I have had something go bad in the fridge, missed a garbage date etc.  but I've never outright done something antagonizing.

 They don't have any self awareness that they are also making messes and leaving the laundry room packed with their things, as well as playing a fitness game above my room at 11:30 pm (just general uncourteous behaviour). I'm pretty sure they see it as a tit-for-tat thing but I've been nothing but nice and apologized for any issues I've caused, they have not when I confront them.

Lastly, when I confronted them about blasting the TV  in the same room while my friends were over, as well as the fitness game thing, they said they didn't know this county's customs - no apology or anything. In any case, I don't want to have a shitty year or walk around on eggshells in my own house so I'm looking for suggestions on how to basically tell them to stop trying to bully me around/ make my life miserable.

211,"So this coworker and I have been friends for the last month as I started this new job. We’ve been hanging out every single day, often go get dinner and drinks. He kinda built this friendship where her and I would chill, curse at each other etc. (nothing out of the ordinary for me). 

So the other day she was asking me to join her and some other coworkers for dinner and I refused.She was persistent and after her begging me to go, I asked where dinner was at. She named some pricy joint and I jokingly said “u psycho b-tchhh noooo wayyyy”. And she got incredibly angry at me on the phone and hasn’t talked to me since (3 days of no reply).

Although I do understand I shouldn’t have said that, I didn’t think twice because she and I have constantly called each other words like this before without any conflict. I’m incredibly confused as to why now she has ghosted me and is so mad at me. What should I do? I want to save the professional relationship at least.",10Aug2020,1
212,"Alright, it’s kind of a long one, so stay with me. 

I went out with a group of friends. My one friend has been feeling a little depressed and hasn’t been acting like himself lately, so I thought going out would help take his mind off of things. 

We went out to a bar and just started drinking for fun and talking. We talked about a variety of things, I won’t go into too much detail, but it was revealed that my friend was going through a rough patch in his relationship: he’s upset because his girlfriend doesn’t trust him. He’s caught her many times going through his phone to the point where all trust is really gone at this point. 

Now, I had my suspicions, as some things just haven’t been adding up lately and he, again, was acting kinda weird. So, to learn this wasn’t too much of a surprise. I tried to comfort him as much as I could without bringing too much attention to it. 

Now, we were a few drinks in when this happened, and this particular friend can get kinda flirty when drunk, which is why he hardly ever drinks outside of his home. The group decided we were going to go for a walk around to just spend the last few hours in the grass talking.

This is where the trouble starts, and where I need opinions:

As we were walking around, my friend would either wrap his arm around my shoulders, mess/fix my hair, pull me closer, or start to walk closer to the point where we were shoulder to shoulder. I didn’t really think much of it until the end of the night. 

The only other female friend there made a comment to me after the guys left that it seemed to be a little flirty the way he was walking with me and touching me slightly. After thinking about it, I kind of agree and now I don’t know what to do. 

I’m not in a relationship, so that’s not the problem. I just don’t want this to ruin our friendship. He hasn’t been in the best of head space lately either, as his depression is a bitch and mixing it with anxiety isn’t helping, but I worry that things could be awkward now. 

What do you guys think? Was he stepping over a line with his actions? Or do you think this was just because he’s not in a good head space and probably didn’t think through what he was doing?

(this kind of thing has NEVER happened before. he has never acted like this towards me and planned on marrying his girlfriend)

Any advice, whether from personal experience or not, is completely welcome!",10Aug2020,1
213,"Me [18M] and my twin sister [18F] never really had anyone else growing up. We were costantly moving to live with new people in different states. Some of the people we lived with were abusive. If they weren't abusive, they were still cold and neglectful. We didn't have many friends at all. We always relied on each other. Because of this, and us being twins, we are extremely close and have had little boundaries with each other. 

Our living situation has been relatively stable lately. We both have jobs and started living together in an apartment. Nobody else live with us. I've started really making friends for the first time, but my sister hasn't. We have always spent a ton of time together and are usually together but I have spent some more time with friends which upsets her. We still spend tons of time together. I've come to realize that me and my sister are too close in some ways so I made a mental list of boundaries I want us to abide by from now on and I discussed those with her.

-She is used to me cuddling with her in her bed for almost an hour every night before I tuck her in. I think we should stop doing this but I know its really important for her and helps her go to sleep. So I told her we should cut the cuddling down to just 15 minutes for a while and slowly go down to it just being one goodnight hug I give her. But she needs start wearing a shirt during the cuddles or I will cut out the transition and just end them. 

-No more cuddling while we watch a movie.

-No more occasionally falling asleep in the same bed.

-She can't come into my bedroom or the bathroom when I am in it without knocking.

-We can't both get ready or do something in the bathroom at the same time if one or both of us is naked.

-She can't be around me or in common areas of the apartment while she is naked for extended periods of time.

-No more shirtless back massages, but shoulder rubs with shirts on is fine.

-Kissing each other on the cheek should really not be happening more than like twice a day.

-If I tell her sometimes that I want to be alone, she needs to respect it.

-She asks me a lot to wash her back while she is in the bath/shower. I already stopped doing that but she keeps asking so I reaffirmed I won't do that anymore.

-She needs to always wear a shirt when she gives me hugs.

I framed these boundaries as something we both have to follow, and not just rules for her. She is guilty of doing these things a lot more than me. I am guilty of a lot of thess things too but not as much lately. I still framed it as boundaries we both have to follow though.

This made her very upset. She cried a little too. She said she is ""loosing me"" and that I don't want to be close with her anymore or do things that make her happy.

Should I have tried to establish these boundaries, do these boundaries make sense? How can I go about enforcing them? How can I make it easier for her to abide by them and not be too sad about it?",10Aug2020,1
214," 

throw-away for obvious reasons. Please tell me what you think I should do. I have a plan at the bottom.

TLDR:  My dad is cheating, I don't want to ruin my own family. I don't want to  risk my future career or college education. I plan to ask the women(s)  to stop talking to him.

I realized  my dad is currently talking to at-least one other women other than my  mom. I realized it by accident when I glanced at his phone (while he was  on it) during a movie. I could see that he was asking for her pictures,  and sending heart emojis and shit. After about a week or two, I've  certainly seen enough to be 100% confident.. This kinda shattered me, in  that I love my family, and kinda want to have a huge family for my kids  one day. One that would hopefully include my parents.

I am in quite the pickle now.

I  am almost certain neither of my siblings know about it, and they are  unlikely to find out in the next few years. I feel i bear a  responsibility to ensure that my family stays together, which would get  destroyed if this news comes to light. I know that I can control how I  act, but I can't control how my sibling or mom does. My mom has got to  know, however, there is now way in hell I'm gonna tell her I know. That  would hurt her very deeply, I think.

This  is personally quite devastating because I really look up to my father.  He is(was) everything I aspired to be. A father of a big family, a  breadwinner, healthy kids, plays video-games, ect... I'm not exactly in a  position to say ""fuck you,  you aren't in my life"" because he will most  probably pay for my college (big emphasis on education, no matter the  cost in my family). On top of paying for college, I want to work in the  industry/career that he has; therefore, staying close with him would be a  MASSIVE boon to my career. Even outside of family life, he would be  extremely useful. He is incredibly smart and well connected, atleast for  what I want to do with my life.

All  this has built up alot of stress in myself, the other day I was looking  at myself in the mirror while I was brushing my teeth, and I just  started crying (this was a few minutes after an argument between my  sibling and him). Whenever something bad with him happens, I immediately  think about the subtext of his infidelity. I can't hear a complaint  about him getting detached from us without thinking about how REAL it  is.

I need help in figuring out  what to do. I can't tell anyone in my family, I can't tell a friend  (because I don't want their view of me or my family to be damaged, and I  don't want my family's financial stability risked), I can't tell a  therapist (because they would know my parents)... I can't tell anyone  who could or will know my family.

My  plan: My only resort is to get onto his phone, and text all of the  women he has been talking to. I'm going to nicely ask each of them to  please fuck off, and not ruin my family. I hope that appeal will work,  as it is the only way I can address the issue with some anonymity. My  dad will probably realize SOMEONE did it. But he'll probably not know  who, there are alot of suspects.

217,"TW: s\*xual assault

My uncle (dad's sister's husband, not biological) touched me inappropriately and would take very gross and creepy pictures of me (especially in bathing suits) many times throughout my childhood, the last time being when I was 15 and I am 19 now.  It had happened a few times already when I was about 11 or 12 and that's when I finally told my father and I never told anyone else in the family.  He told me he would take care of it and a few days later he told me that my uncle apologized and said it wouldn't happen again, though that's clearly a lie and it still did happen multiple times after.  As a kid, I didn't fully understand how awful what was happening to me was, I could just tell that I really really didn't like it and my parents said that if anyone touched my private parts to tell them.  I trusted them of course so since they never took me to the police or anything, I guess my thinking was not to call them either.  Over the past few years, I have slowly found out that my mom and all of my aunts and uncles know about what happened to me and obviously they did nothing to stop it or even make sure that I'm okay.  All five of my dad's sisters and their families, and my family, live in the same city so we would see each other at least every Sunday prior to COVID.  I'm still forced to see my aunt's husband that assaulted me at family gatherings and it makes me so angry and scared.  I guess as I grew to understand what he did, I hoped my family didn't know so that would explain why they didn't reach out to me or anything like that, but now I know that they all did know.  I'm so angry and hurt at all of them, my parents, and my aunts who are all like second moms to me, and I want them to know that.  I'm so mad about it I want to make them feel guilt and shame that haunts them every day to the point that they can't cope.  At this point, I haven't just because of a little fear of a sort of ""public"" meltdown/call-out, fear of shaming and isolation from the entire family for shedding light to this, and my financial dependence on one of my aunts whom I now live with.

I'm sorry this post was a mess.  I guess my questions I need advice on are, how do I deal with this anger and hurt?  Should I call my family out on this?  How can I go about doing that if I do it?  Any advice you can give would be really appreciated.  Thank you.",10Aug2020,1
218,"so my (16m) best mate (16m) started smoking weed  about a year ago. I didn't care bc it wasn't rlly hurting anyone. a few months later I head about him being off his face on pills at a party, I was slightly concerned but it was only one time, or so I thought. he started taking md (ecstasy if ur american) but it wasn't regularly and there was no physical or mental change that was apparent to me, so I ignored it. I've heard rumours that he was dealing but I didn't really believe them, but they've now been confirmed. a 16 year old girl overdosed and died literally a few months ago near where I live and I'm concerned that my friend is going down a similar path.

220,"My sleep schedule is all sorts of messed up so recently I’ve taken to walking my dog later in the night (around 11pm) to hopefully tire myself out.
I listen to music when I’m walking but keep it on a low enough volume to the point where I could hear someone approaching me. Recently, I swear I’ve been hearing footsteps in the dark tree line beside me or seeing an extra shadow. 

I’m not stupid so I never follow the noises but it’s alarming nonetheless because I never take the same route twice or walk at the same times to avoid someone recognizing and taking advantage of my pattern. 

I feel like I’m going crazy or maybe I’m just paranoid because the other night I felt as if I was being followed and my dog was growling at the dark field behind me so when I passed through a squeaky gate, I closed it behind me thinking that if someone followed me through it I would hear it. Well, I DID hear it but then turned around to see it was never opened.

The simple solution would be to stop walking at night, but I’ve started feeling like this and hearing people “following” me during the day too. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I don’t suffer from any mental issues or paranoia but I’m starting to feel unsafe in my small, friendly village even when I’m carrying a pocketknife.

Until recently I wasn’t really friends with the other two but I wanted to be. They both seemed cool and I was the only broken link in group as I never really talked to them. Apparently my friends sister thought the same and we started talking but it gets really awkward sometimes and I feel like we have trouble acting natural when talking irl or even texting. Same for the other girl but it’s even worse. There’s been a handful of moments that are very cringy to think about. They both want to be friends with me but I don’t know how I’m supposed to fix this.

226,"Rehoming is not an option because my kitty is nine years old and very timid. She gets sick when she's at other people's houses and she stresses out. I don't think she could get used to another home as I've been with her for a very long time. Also a lot of cat people have told me that this would most likely stress her out to the point where it takes a toll on her way of life, or how much longer she has to live.
I also have a small dog a chihuahua. They are both house pets however I can definitely probably make him an outside dog. I'm a really concerned about wildlife in my area however. Such as coyotes, not only that but if I get a kennel for him where he is safe from coyotes... the winter is coming and I don't want him to freeze, and summer is so hot that it would be abuse to have them outside during these seasons.

Is it selfish of me and my husband not to want to get rid of our animals since we are having a baby? Are we obligated to take care of our current babies?   Can I make a house cat of 9 years and outdoor pet or will that also stress her out? 

Even though it is perfect I'm not sure if I should as the landlord seems super strict. Does not even want thumbtacks in the wall.seems like she will not budge on anything which is not good for future compromises if something comes up.

234,"so I meet this girl one year ago, I didn't give a shit about her (like other my classmates in university) but suddenly she started to get closer and closer to me. I am really sure she was in love with me in March but the pandemic started and I haven't seen her in 5 months.

I express my feeling for her about two weeks ago, she said that she loves me but she don't risk to be with me (friend).

I know her a lot, I know she suffered very hard for her past relationships, and suffer really hard for other stuff in the past. I am the only person that she wrote a book to tell me her story (and damm she let me shocked but I lover her and accept her past).

the thing I wrote a book for her this week, more than a book is 4 pages word about my thoughts, and reading those thoughts are very sad and some little parts I think even pathetic, but it's the true. 

Do You think that I send her the book? the motivation for me to write it is for her, that she read it, but I don't know. she is very scared about relationships again and I know if see her again I could (possible) made the things differents about her saying but I feel if I showed her the book she seems me as a pathetic looser who is in loved with her.

pd: in the book, in my thoughts are certain things that I if told to her (and 100% no one ever did it) and I am really sure that saying those things she would remind her own life style that she sometimes complain.  

Pd2: I really like her and in my heart is a difficult topic, the reason say that I should quirk her of my life but beyond a bf/gf relationship I really really like her I am wanted she in my life but seems her probably broke my heart every time. I'm fact we discuss this (keep talking or fuck it all) and she let me all the power of decision but I am really confused right now

242,"So my little brother's addicted to playing Fortnite. And the first thing he would do when he woke up was play Fortnite (not even brush his teeth before he played). And I just got my xbox last Christmas but my little brother was spending all his time on it and I only played with it from time-to-time because I got all my chores done and I had some free time. He it too little to do any house work but he didn't spend any time with my mother and father, he would only want to play Fortnite with his friends from school. And over the course of time from Christmas to right now, I see that he has became increasingly aggressive towards the rest of the family, but since I was playing only a little while my attitude stayed the same and I liked playing 2k and COD.
Now a few days ago my dad (he's a pastor at the church we go to so obviously he is gonna tell us it) told us a ""true"" story that his friend told him, and my dad's friend owned an xbox too so that just made me more mad. He told us a ""true story"" about a kid, 13 years old that was addicted to playing Halo. And when the kid's father saw him playing Halo, he said that he saw demons coming out of it and the father took the video games away from him. After that when the kids father went to go pick up his kid from school, he saw him playing Halo with his friends, so the father took his son out of the school.

245,"tl;dr My Mom blames my best friend for a traumatic event which derailed my life at 17. My best friend was in no way responsible but my Mom's ongoing reaction is driving a massive wedge between myself and my best friend of over 20 years, along with being a constant reminder of the worst thing to ever happen to me.

When I was 17 I experienced an exceedingly traumatic event - think along the lines of a horrifying violation which would totally shatter your sense of self, bodily autonomy and view of the world. My best friend was present just before the event, but a small nonsensical argument (which I don't even remember to this day) led to us going our seperate ways that evening. My best friend was under the impression that some other friends who were in the area were coming to pick me up when we argued, so she left. These other friends never showed and I ended up walking back to my accomodation alone. At some point in the following weeks I told my Mom what had happened and her hatred for my best friend - who she'd previously liked and approved of - was born.

**I'm going to point this out right now - what happened is in NO WAY my best friends fault. NO ONE is responsible for the events of that evening but the perpetrator.**

This was 8 years ago. Over the years I've suffered multiple breakdowns and hospitalisations. The trauma of that night has infected and derailed every aspect of my life and my loving parents felt helpless - all they could do was watch as I fell apart at the seams. I also sustained physical injuries as well which have required ongoing specialist medical care.

Over the years my Mom has done absoluetly everything she can to support me on my journey to healing, along with my Dad, except forgiving my best friend. They've taken me to see a myriad of mental health specialists, forked out an eye-watering amount of money and they've NEVER pressured me to ""just get over it"". **Please do not say horrible things about my Mom in the comments, she is a saint who is hurting and feeling helpless to protect her child.**

This has inevitably driven a rift between my Mom and my best friend. Best friend can tell Mom blames her - snide comments to her face, actively ignoring her at family BBQs, pretending she doesn't exist etc. As a result my best friend has slowly been pulling away from me. I always made sure to de-escalate the situation and defend her if anything was said, but there's only so much a person can take. I don't blame her but it's breaking my heart. I've tried talking to my Mom about it but she just says she doesn't think she can ever forgive and that she's allowed to be hurt by what happened to me. I've tried asking her why her anger isn't directed at the other friends who just left me to walk home. She said they weren't true friends and didn't have the responsibility to look out for me (and I her) like my best friend did.

As a result of ongoing medical issues, I had to move back home with my parents. I've tentatively floated the idea of visiting to my best friend but she said she simply can't do it. She can't be the butt of someone's anger for something that isn't her fault. I've tried telling them both that everytime they argue it's a constant reminder for me of what happened. Even the fact that in the back of my mind I know my Mom hates my best friend is a constant reminder. I feel like the actions of one person from nearly a decade ago are still having ripple effects on my life which I can't escape. I feel trapped and helpless all over again.

My long term partner and I are talking about getting engaged soon, and of course I want my best friend by my side when I get married. I want her there for all the big milestones and celebrations that are to come because she means the world to me. But I also want to share these moments with my Mom, who aside from this one thing has always been a fantastic and supportive parent. I am terrified of the rift between them overshadowing these moments of celebration and forever being a reminder of the most horrific event of my life. I don't want all the happy memories that are to come being tarnished with trauma from the past.

I don't want to lose either my Mom or my best friend, but my heart is breaking and the constant reminders are killing me. I feel like this monster still has a hold on my life and is still actively destroying it. How can I help my Mom heal and reconcile with my best friend so I can finally move on with my life and heal from this awful period? I've been thinking about inviting them both to counseling with me but I have no idea how to even broach the subject with either of them. Any advice is appreciated!

INFO: the event was reported to the police but despite DNA evidence no one was ever charged. I think the lack of closure is contributing to the inability to heal for both my best friend and Mom.",10Aug2020,1

250,"My boyfriend has cerebral palsy that affects the right side of his body. Because of this, he has more trouble doing things that require two hands. 

As an example: He loves video games and plays on PS4 because console controllers are the easiest for him. He can't play on PC because of his right hand.

This has led him to generally hating all PC players. He is jealous that they can play on PC when he can't, because PC is generally ""better"" and easier on most games. He trash talks them and actually gets aggressive when he plays a game with crossplay that he can't turn off. He also refuses to knowingly play with anyone using PC. Part of it is because of the fairness, but most of it is about his jealousy and insecurity.

This impacts our relationship because I play on PC. We're long-distance, so playing video games is one of the only ways we can do something together. But he is refusing to play anything with me because it makes him upset that I'm on PC. He has also been toxic to me because of it.

This is just one thing; there's many other things that bother him and he avoids. I've told him I understand why he feels the way he does, and they're valid feelings to have, but just avoiding any reminder of his insecurities isn't the right way to cope with how he feels about himself. But he doesn't think it's bad and he doesn't want to do anything about it.

He's increasingly becoming more depressed in that he just doesn't care about anything anymore. I also deal with depression among other issues (that I can also relate to his avoidance issue with), so any advice I try to give, he comes back with things like ""you're one to talk.""

He has also told me that he has nightmares several times a week about me cheating on him. He told me he doesn't really think I would cheat on him (and I never have and never would), he just feels like he isn't good enough for me. I tell him I love him several times a day, and he knows his disability doesn't impact my love for him, but he doesn't understand why it doesn't bother me. I've told him many times he's more than just his disability, but his thoughts never change.

I don't know how to help him be more comfortable with himself, or how to help him realize he needs to get profesional help. I'm running out of things to tell him, and I can't get the help for him. What do I do or say at this point?

I do feel the need to note that I have autism, so I'm already dealing with a lot of mental issues myself that I can barely handle. I don't know how to help both of us.",10Aug2020,1
251,"So I go to a really small school and have been super close to these 2 guys for all of high school (i'm a girl). We have the same interests and we have always stuck together but now they are starting to act different and I'm not sure what to do, so I will break it down

Friend 1: I have known this guy since I was in year 6. We have been best friends for a long time and love the same things. However, he has a really arogant attitude all the time (other people dislike him for the same reason) and says a lot of stuff that really bothers me. For example, I am a really quiet person and have a lot of trouble talking and connecting with people because of some other stuff thats happened in the past, but he always makes comments like ""I hate quiet people"" and ""Why can't people just stop being quiet and talk"". I know it shouldn't bother me that much but it just gets on my nerves a bit because its something that really bothers me. He also said something the other day along the lines of this: ""I love it when people cry about having no friends because I can sit with my friends and laugh at them"" which really bothers me because I have been in a lot of situations where I haven't been able to connect with people and its deeply affected me in a lot of ways. He's also just makes me feel like shit all the time. I'm incredibly athletic and played soccer for many years, but he loves to call me shit at it and a lot of the other stuff I'm really good at. He doesn't understand the concept that people may have different interests than him and gives me shit about my music taste or the shows I watch all the time and its really frustrating because I get more and more nervous to say anything when we hang bc I feel like if I do, it won't blow over well and I already get nervous in social situations. 

Friend 2:

This kid is just generally an ass. He is really flakey and will make up obvious excuses to cancel plans because he doesn't get what he wants like we will say we are hanging out with someone with a big house and if they say there is a reason we can't go, he will cancel the plan completely. Everything is always dictated by his terms and he feeds into the other friend's God complex, always agreeing with what he says with everything. One of the things I used to just talk to the first friend about was anime, but of course friend 2 had to jump on the bandwagon and now they both give me shit for my tastes or the rankings I give to certain shows. 

The biggest issue I have is that I always feel as though there's no reason for me to be at the hangout whenever we get together. Like last year, friend 1 and I both liked anime and friend 2 didnt, so we could talk about it together and it brought us closer. Now, because friend 2 watches it as well, everything I say is automatically wrong and I can't ever have my own view about something. I just get more and more scared to say anything at all because I feel like anything I say doesn't have any value which is super frustrating. 

I guess I'm just so sick of feeling unappreciated all the time. Because I've been trying so hard to get over other social issues, I feel as though this is driving me deeper into that hole where its going to be really hard to make friends when i go to college. I hate that I have trouble talking to people, but I don't know how to convey how much the stuff they do feeds into that issue. If anyone has any advice as to what the best thing to do is, it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the rant, but I just wanted to see if anyone has any advice! Thank You!",10Aug2020,1
252,"*Delete if not allowed* 




So uh... I don’t know how to really describe what went down moments ago but it is not sitting right with me. I feel kinda disturbed. 

I’m at work (in fact I’m writing this on my break) and talking with my co-worker about life to life stuff. Typical conversation like, how’s your kids doing? And what did you do over the weekend? And then we get into the topic of co-workers and my co-worker said she was very, very close with this one lady (let’s call her Amanda). I said yeah I just met her the other day, she’s quite religious, I feel sorry for her daughter because she’s gay. She told me it was as bad as murder or stealing in her eyes, I’m Pansexual and gender fluid so as you can imagine, it did not sit well with me. Amanda told me this on her first day of knowing me. My co-workers faced drop and was like “no way” and immediately texted Amanda. 

I work in a house with four people living with disability. There is only me and another co-worker allowed to be in the house (because of covid). One is upstairs and one is to be downstairs. Later on in my shift, I hear the door open and close twice but think nothing of it as my co-worker smokes. Five minutes later my phone rings, it’s Amanda, I’m busy with things so it goes to voicemail, the phone rings again and it’s Amanda. I sent her a text telling her I would call her later as I am busy. Next thing I know Amanda is coming down the stair, reeking of alcohol, and smiling at me and inviting me upstairs to talk with my co-worker and I. 
She begins with saying that “I can’t believe you would tell her that my daughter is gay.” I said sorry, that I assumed because she told a random stranger that someone who she “deems as a daughter would of known”. She then starts talking to me about everything me and my co-worker discussed and demanded why I did not answer her call. I said I was busy with a clients meds. 
She is smiling the whole time and was like “no, I told you this in trust of my beliefs.” She then goes on a tangent about homosexuality and I tell her that I’m pansexual and don’t think it’s right to judge others. 
Her and my co-worker look at each-other and go outside for a smoke for 30 minutes and I can hear her talking (loudly) about her disproval for homosexuality. 

The clients need to be ready and in bed at 9pm and it’s 9:15pm and their routines have not been finished yet. This women is drunk, drove here intoxicated, and is bad mouthing me at work when she is not even supposed to be here. She continues smiling at me and tells me “I’m not mad that you told a co-worker about my daughter. However, if you tell anyone else then we are going to have some problems.” Then she laughs again and is extremely passive aggressive towards me then takes off outside with the co-worker again. 

I don’t know what to call this? I can totally get why she would be mad, I just assumed my co-worker would know because they consider each other family. Perhaps I’m overreacting to this situation, I’m just disturbed and this whole scenario is not sitting right with me. What should I do?",10Aug2020,1

257,"Very weird subject. I’ve never posted on this subreddit before. Basically me and my girlfriend had some drinks.  We started talking about George Floyd and a new video that was released that showed that he was on drugs (Possibly). All I said was that he was arguing with the police over him paying with a fake 100 dollar bill. On the video that I saw the cops were talking to him about him paying with a fake hundred dollar bill. I get that dude, maybe he didn’t know that the dollar bill was fake, I’ll play devils advocate. Somehow my girlfriend flips it on me and is then saying that ohhh so he deserved to get choked out? I never in my life said that someone deserves to get choked out. Like I don’t even know how else to respond guys. I’m Hispanic my family struggled too growing up with poverty up until I got my own job all my clothes was either from a thrift store or passed down too me. I made a comment as well saying “Just because your struggle is different from someone else doesn’t mean that your struggle is irrelevant”. Something that I had heard hear in hear in regards to depression I believe. Like I don’t know what to do guys. I’m completely thrown off. She then makes a last comment saying I don’t have any black friends. I have black co workers I have never in my life mistreated any black person because of race you guys get me? Idk I’m confused guys I just need help and I don’t even know what I need help with. I also said there have been other people on drugs and they didn’t get choked out they got tased or their situation was handled differently either way George Floyd’s situation is still fucked up.  I guess the thing that got me is that she said that I’m basically white. Which I am not I’m Hispanic Light skin sure, but even then not even that light skin not enough to pass as white lol. The whole reason why I typed this out was for that reason her saying that I havnt really experienced racism lol. In my head I’m like wtf does she know. Also with the whole struggle thing saying that your struggle isn’t relevant compared to others. That makes sense but it is ok to have struggle you can’t compare your struggle to everyone else’s, someone else will always have a bigger struggle. Kids around the country for sure being traded for slavery or being used for something else even adults maybe.

261,"So I have social anxiety...
Social anxiety is when someone can have fear over social interactions or there can be particular situations that give that person extreme fear or worry. 

For me one of the situations I fear is going out to eat in restaurants with multiple people because whenever I go out to eat and it’s time to pay (especially when were sharing one bill) there’s alway an issue that occurs. 

I mean I know the best way to solve this issue is if I ask for a separate check ... ask the server “one on one” got a separate check for myself. But whenever this happens I hesitate to do it because I feel like it’s out of place for me to ask and I would embarrass myself.

264,"I graduated with a science degree with all my pre-med classes done a few years back. All I needed to do was get hands-on experience in the medical field and take my medical school admission exam to apply for medical school. But what did I do instead? I signed up for and canceled the exam multiple times after having no motivation to self-study. The two times I did take the exam, I did not study due to a lack of motivation and feeling overwhelmed with structuring my time. The sad thing is that I really did enjoy my hands-on experience in the medical field and saw myself being a good provider.

I believe in the idea of a calling and have been praying for God to show me if becoming a physician is my thing. I have heard nothing directly(but even that relationship I don't do a good job of maintaining) and am starting to feel like these failures are the signs I've been missing. I could still become a nurse practitioner or physician assistant but a part of me hates the idea of giving up on my physician dreams knowing I didn't give the test my all. So I signed up for the Sept 4th exam and have barely made a dent in my studying. At this point, I just feel lost, and frustrated.

However, my parents, especially my dad, are strongly opposed to me doing that. They argue that I can't get an Honors Diploma, and the coursework will be too easy. They also say life needs to go on.

Now, I would like to get an Honors Diploma, but I care about my health and safety more. I am also in a high-risk group for coronavirus. 

We are planning on calling the school counselor for specifics later today. 

The website says specifically that the curriculum standards will be the same as in physical school, but different assignments, and will have all the core classes, but limited electives. Also, it says we will not have access to our full schedules as planned in the Spring.

Almost two years. Sometimes he flirts with me and we joke around together, but other times, it’s like he doesn’t want to acknowledge me. He mentioned he’s very insecure, but he talks bad about peoples weight. I would assume it’s because he’s super insecure and it makes him feel better. He should work on not doing that though. One time he messaged me “hey” after a get together and we spoke over text. Then, I texted him next and he told my friend he was getting annoyed of me because I doubled texted him. Yet, he quadruple texts me. We get in trouble together, but it’s fun. (Not illegal stuff) one time on A social media, I asked him a question, he got annoyed, I got annoyed, then I blocked him. I spoke to him yesterday and he was using laughing emojis and being super kind to me by answering the questions I had for him. (The questions involved dmv stuff). I expected him to be rude to me, but he was actually being nice. I believe it zodiac stuff as well. I always get messages about a Gemini (him) liking an Aquarius (me) and just that things will happen between us. I still really like him, it’s just that I don’t think he likes me back. Should I message him more often? Should I let him go? Should I add him back on Snapchat and if he adds me back that means there’s potential of him wanting to communicate with me? Should I gradually ask him question through iMessage about himself or how he’s doing? Or, should I just leave him alone and let him find the girl of his dreams? Thank you in advance.",10Aug2020,1

272,"My love life (or lack there off) is a complete joke!

I’ve never actually had a proper girlfriend and any attempt ends in either rejection, drama, or worse. I’m not good at flirting or picking up signals, and can read the 2 Red Wolves (Canis lupas rufus?) at my local wildlife park better then I can read women, and I hardly ever see them. I had no experience in high school because my high school was basically a sausage party. I’m not hyper attractive, muscular, or anything like that! (If you must know what I look like, [here](https://go.tinder.com/3EScJ18wwQQ-Andrew)) I still live with my mom and she’s both distant (emotionally) and controls every aspect of my life (including my bank account, which she mixed with hers, she treats me like I’m 16).  I flunked out of my first attempt at college and I don’t know when I can start again (don’t do well with online courses).

And I feel like I’ve done too many shitty things in my life to ever deserve any form of love like that in my life! (The worst thing I’ve ever done was grab a girls breast at a pool party once)

All in all, I feel like a joke! All of my friends have lost their virginity years before, and are now in “perfect” relationships, are getting married, and starting families with babies to boot! 

All I want in life, is to make it through college, open my Wildlife Park somewhere in either the Eastern United States or in Italy and impact the world of Wildlife Conservation and Research, get married to a beautiful woman, and start a family together! Maybe one day, I could pass the legacy onto the kids! 

But I have a long way to go before that! And I’m not sure if any of this will happen! Or even if it should!


I guess I’ve hit a low point in life. And I’m not sure when I’ll leave! I just want to experience love, sex, etc. I’ve tried a lot, but it’s not enough. Online dating has been pretty mixed, and I find that I’m hardly attracted to most of the people who like me. There’s exceptions, but they’re rare and I usually fall flat on my face! 

Everyone praises sex and empowers it, and I feel left out.

So that’s why I’m looking to just buy a prostitute and getting on level with everyone else! They message me pretty much all the time on every dating site I’m on! So they’re not too hard to find!

I’d have to be sneaky with money, and slowly build it up overtime, because mom doesn’t just let me take out money (she’ll just refuse if she figures out what’s going on).

But part of me feels like it’s the single most shameful way to lose my virginity and I don’t even know if I should. It is illegal in the US!

I’m split down the line, and I’m not sure what to do. This is the only place I can talk about it, because my family is on virtually everything else I’m on and they’d tell mom as soon as they see something slightly worrying to them.

280,"I will try to keep this as brief as possible as this is a truly long story that has been going on for the last 7 months and in recent days I have been finding no bottom to the madness. Short background, my wife of 5 years went on a trip to Asia in January 2020 and around April she arrived at the island of Bali in Indonesia and became grounded due to COVID commercial travel restrictions. On this island she became noticeably more distanced towards me and became less responsive to my inquires on her well being and safety. On my end I actually developed a depression at some point because I had no idea what I was doing wrong; we were no longer having video conversations and I suspected infidelity and asked her if she was hiding things. We have always been honest and regardless of what people reading this may think have never had any secrets or lies in our relationship. This is why I knew that something was out of character and I made it clear to her that the stance I have always had towards her remains the same. I know when something is wrong or off with even the smallest details. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and things on my end eventually delved into a point where she convinced me that everything was in my head and that I was mentally unstable and that I was the one causing the divide. Throughout this time she was still saying in public and to mutual friends that she would be returning as soon as possible, I found confirmed flights for her via US Embassy information in May, June &amp; July and she became angry that I didn't believe her version that the flights were not actually flying and were cancelled and that she was already doing everything in her power to come back home to me. 

Indonesia eventually put out a mandatory ruling that all tourists were to leave the country in August and my wife immediately found a return ticket for Aug. 8th. By this point her passport had expired already in July and since she is not a US citizen her only flight option was to go back home to Ukraine. Though our conversations were still limited she finally called me at an unusual hour for her time on Aug. 5th and from what I now see in retrospective discussed calculated and specifically chosen topics that she knew would upset me. As soon as I showed my discomfort to the things she was telling me like not wanting to be tied down anywhere or having a home or ever having to work again and she suggested we split ways to which I did not agree and she abruptly ended the call without giving me any kind of closure. Not the way you end a relationship with someone you have been together with for 5 strong years with no issues or serious arguments and doubts present. I have tried to communicate with her at every possible opportunity here but she just says she is not available to talk due to excuses. Again, pressing the point that all this distance is in my head and that I am making things worse but we can still be friends.

My issues are not the important thing here. I am not looking for relationship advice on whether or not I should continue with my wife, the priority at the moment is finding some way I can help her come back from this mentally. On Saturday I turned on a shared computer I rarely use to look at our pictures together and try to understand where I went wrong. The computer actually synchronized to the laptop she took with her and a personal diary file appeared on the desktop. I have never in my life invaded personal privacy but I was at ends meet and was in complete shock at the out of character events that were happening the last few days and she was not giving me answers. I was not ready to give up working things out and I am glad that I opened the diary, as I immediately learned the truth about everything that had transpired on the island and that I was right about everything and not insane which gave me relief for the first time in months. It is such a bizarre document and disturbing that I cannot believe a human being could have wrote such a thing even as fiction.

Glossing over the details of the diary which contained detailed information with dates and timestamps and vivid descriptions I learned that there was infidelity and to my understanding also a high likelihood of drugging and rape, sex work, orgies and other things of that nature. The sexual things are obviously heartbreaking and devastating to me but she needs help tests done as soon as possible for the obvious. 

Infidelity aside, the more disturbing thing to me is that she describes in the diary how they were essentially taking psychedelic mushrooms and weed all day and almost never sober (why she wasn't able to talk to me or show her face to me via video). And this is the real root of why I am making this post because I learned that the place she was staying in, which I can best describe now as some cult of spirituality they took so many drugs that they have clearly altered her mind and I need to help my wife before she ends up trafficked or dead in a gutter somewhere. There is clear mental deterioration in the later parts of the diary and what in my understanding is suppression of truth and trauma blocking parts of her brain. Some of the mushrooms that they took were apparently picked off the ground and poisonous. 

As soon as I read the diary on Saturday and understood everything I calmed down and collected my thoughts and asked my wife if we could talk when she landed in Ukraine. She has since landed but I don't know if she is actually in Ukraine. I asked her to come clean to me and talk to me, and basically tried to present myself as non-aggressive as possible to help her understand that I want to help her and that she can still come back from this. She immediately became very aggressive and defensive and went back to her story that this was all my imagination, and like an onion with so many layers I had to peel and peel and peel to try to get her to see that it was obvious even without the proof of diary what had happened. I had to repeat things several times and her brain was jumping from one subject to another and then back to previous things. Again, just very heartbreaking but clear to me that there is mental damage. Even when I told her I read the diary she insisted none of these things happened and tried deflecting to me and I had to stress specific points several times to get her to stop telling me that I was wrong and the things I were saying were lies. She acknowledged in the bare minimum way that she did these things and asked what I think or her, how could I even want to forgive her, etc. I want to stress this point again; if I had not read this diary and had it as written proof she would have continued to deny things and this relationship would have ended with me thinking I got too paranoid and did this and I most likely would have never heard from her again.

I think I was able to present my point that I want to help her and that she can come back from this and that there can be reconciliation and forgiveness. Though she was unable to talk to me over video she told me that she was tired and went to sleep. I do not know what else she may be lying about outside the diary, again like for example if she is even in Ukraine or where she claims she is but I do know that her friend who influenced her on the drugs (that she never took or wanted in all the time I have known her) is with her right now. One of the men who was abusing her the most may also potentially be with her but I do not know for certain, and these two parties have since caught on that I know the truth. The female friend has gone into defensive mode and the lover has since blocked me after I told him to leave my wife alone. 

I hope that the next time my wife is online I will be able to finally have a video call to see if she is at her mothers apartment in Ukraine which I would recognize or somewhere else that will confirm where she truly is. The next step is getting some kind of mental evaluation and the tests I mentioned earlier done in the most delicate way possible so she doesn't disappear off the grid into the unknown. Where do I go from here as far as contacting professional help? If she is in Ukraine I could fly there as soon as possible but I do not speak the language and I think there needs to be an understanding between me and the person(s) who would potentially be overseeing her mental evaluation so I know everything. She has health insurance in the US through me but if she does not return to the US by January 2021 her residence card will expire and visa work will need to be redone from scratch. I am also concerned that if her friend is still with her she will try to run off somewhere or the friend (who realistically has been physically with her for the last 7 months and not me) will go into a defensive state to try and sway sympathy over my wife to ignore me completely. I have tried to contact her mother with whom I have always had a good relationship, but her mother has been absent in recent years having gone through her own traumatic events in life and is very frail. I feel if I were to bring this to her mother it would have the potential to kill her from shock as the details are truly so disturbing, bizarre, and out of character for the person we both have known. I do not know if the person I knew is also still left in that head or if there has been permanent irreversible damage. I think it would be best to remove all elements and people of the environment she has been in but I do not know any people who would be able to work as a bridge between the two of us as we are on different continents.

Thank you for reading if you got this far. I never would have expected something like this could happen to anyone. I have heard of people losing it from drugs but to see firsthand it is extremely sad and why I cannot be angry at my wife for wanting to leave me or infidelity etc. As much as I don't want to be true I am preparing myself for the reality that the person I knew is dead, but I still want her to have a chance to live and recover from this and be with people who care about her. These next steps will undoubtedly be crucial and determine whether or not I ultimately get her help.",10Aug2020,1
281,"Every other day usually from 11:20-12:00 I can hearing knocking in quick succession around every 10 minutes. It has only happened on the right and left sides of the house. Usually, there’s three to seven knocks at a time. They sound strong and firm, so it’s likely to not be an animal. It sounds human, as it’s inconsistent and doesn’t have a pattern. It has been creeping me out, and I would like your best guess or answer to what it is to help calm me down so I can at least go to sleep.",10Aug2020,1
282,"I (23F) just recently made a huge change in my life by moving out of my parents house and in with some friends in a completely different state that’s nowhere near where I used to live. I’ve been dreaming of moving out of my parents house since I was a teenager so naturally I thought that this would be the happiest time of my life. Well it’s been exactly a week since I’ve moved and i’m absolutely miserable.

While it is nice to finally be out of my parents house and even out of my home state as i’ve lived there my entire life, i’m finding it difficult to adjust to my new life. I find myself missing home like crazy which I did not expect at all. The house we live in is also less than ideal to say the least. Also as much as I love my friends i’m finding that rooming with them is proving to be much more difficult than I imagined as i’m somewhat of a clean freak and can’t stand there being a mess. In particular they tend to leave their plates and such scattered about and even when they do bring it to the sink they hardly ever bother to wash them, which leaves me to do it because I absolutely cannot stand having the sink piled up with dirty dishes.

It’s only been a week and i’m still trying to adjust in terms of finding a job and changing my drivers license and plates and all that so maybe i’m just overreacting? Sometimes I think that I just need to wait it out until things start to feel more normal and I get a regular routine going but then there are times like now where i’m just laying in bed crying because of how I feel I’ve made a huge mistake and that i’ll never recover from it.

Realistically, I know there really isn’t much I can do at this point as what’s done is done and I already spent so much money, time, and energy into moving and me and my friends signed an eight month lease so i’m stuck here for at least that amount of time. I really just wanted to get this all out honestly and couldn’t think of anywhere else to do it. Any advice or kind words are appreciated though.",10Aug2020,1

285,"I would appreaciate if you read the entire post before commenting. I'm sorry for the length.

My girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) adopted a rescue dog a year ago. It was my idea. When I saw the dog online, I felt in my heart like I had to take her in. We live separately, so she spends every other week at each other's house. She's the best. She's been through some trauma, but we don't really know what happened. She's a 3 legged dog. A few months ago, she was hit by a car when she was able to go out of the house when the electric gate malfunctioned. Now, she's scared of cars, but not to the point where she can't go for a walk. Physically, it's like the accident never happened, even with her 3 legs. She's 2 1/2 years old now. She lacks some confidence, has always been nervous and anxious, but she's brave and has improved immensely since I've been training her daily. She's incredibly sweet and loving to us. She's a happy dog, a little distrustful of people, but always wagging her tail to us. She loves to play with her paws with me when she wakes up and sometimes during the day. She also likes to cuddle with me, I'd say that even more than with my girlfriend. She's been to training a few times and knows sit, stay, paw, focus (eye contact) and place commands. I've spent hours on top of hours training her and taking care of all the confidence and structure building because I've always wanted her to be the happiest dog possible from the day she was adopted.

So here it starts. First, I have to state that she doesn't like men. Her lack of trust surprised me because dogs have always loved me and even dogs who are scared of men have always come to me happily. Their owners are always impressed. When I met her, she didn't behave like the other dogs I mentioned, but I was told I gained her trust faster than other men did. A few months after adopting her and building a good bond, I said ""no"" in a calm, but firm manner when she tried to eat something off the ground. She peed a little. She has peed with my girlfriend too, but considerably fewer times. We never hit or yell at her. After the car accident, she had some skin allergies on her paws, so we had to wash them with a special soap. When I picked her up to go and wash her paws, she peed a little. This happened several times. I tried to show her that washing her paws was good by praising her and rewarding with treats, but it still happened. I have to say that I took it kind of personally because I had always been the ideal dog owner with her.

I've suffered from OCD all my life, which is no excuse for anything ever, but for about 6 months, I've been compulsively thinking and trying to ""prove"" if she really loves me, which I know for a fact she does, but the OCD says no when I see her being anxious during walks when cars pass by, thinking that if she loved me, she would stay calm. Writing this, I feel ashamed by how stupid that sounds.

I've always loved animals, have always been known for being emotionally stable, empathetic, not aggressive at all, and just a nice, stable person overall. Chivalrous, ""people always come to me looking for advice"" type of guy.

But a couple of months ago that perception of myself changed. I was really having a hard time with my OCD in my relationship with my girlfriend and it adhered to my relationship with my dog. I was trying not to check if she looked for me, if she wagged her tail, or any other signs a dog gives when they love someone.

Yesterday, I called her and she came with her tail tucked and acting submissive. She has always done this and we don't know why, so I've been trying to get her to associate calling upon her with good things like praise and treats. It has worked a little bit. This time, she came and immediately turned around to go. I stopped her by grabbing her with my hands, but not aggressively. I wanted her to just stand there and know that nothing was going to happen. She peed. I lost my shit like a real pussy and became so frustrated with myself and the thought of her not loving me, so I succumbed to the fucking compulsion. I smacked her head with an open hand. I began to tremble. She just looked at me scared, but with a ""what the fuck"" look. I tried to get a reaction from her, to finally get her to just be aggressive and show me that she hated me, or even feared me to the point of being aggressive. She didn't do anything other than look at me, even though I tried to scare her with my movements and voice. It was as if she knew I was doing something that I didn't like and, as fucked up as it sounds, didn't want to do. I smacked her head several more times. She whined a little bit, but didn't run away. I tried being ""dominant"" by using my arm to pin her to the ground. She just looked at me. My fucking disgusting hands were shaking and my voice too. I The whole time I felt this dread inside me, like I just wanted to die for doing something that to me was unthinkable.

I sat on the floor with my head in my hands, just thinking about what a total piece of shit I am. She came to me and pulled my hand towards her with her paw. I didn't touch her because I couldn't believe what happened and didn't want to lay my monstruous hands on her. I felt like she was too pure for me to ruin her with my shitty hands. She kept pulling my hand with her paw, as if she was telling me ""hey, it's ok"", which made me cry like I never had before and broke my heart. I cuddled with her, apologized and kept thinking about what happened. She slept with me to show her that she doesn't have to be afraid of me. Today, she woke up as happy as ever, interacting with me as if nothing happened, which only broke what's left of my heart even more. Now, she's sleeping next to me on my bed, as if nothing happened. It made me come here and tell this story.

Events like this one have happened 3 times over the last two months, the first two not being as bad as yesterday's. My girlfriend doesn't know about the last two and I don't wanna tell her at all. I know OCD isn't an excuse for anything and I know I'm the worst kind of human being (if I could be called that) that some of you could ever imagine. I can't ever forgive myself and I've never felt so bad about anything I've done in my life. It feels like a nightmare I wanna wake up from. I really wish it didn't happen.

But it did, and I come to you looking for advice. This whole thing is just not me. I'm not that guy. I don't want to rehome her, I want to make her the happiest dog ever. I want to right this worst-kind-of wrong. I'm crying right now. I can't believe I'm posting this shit. I want to forget this happened and focus on compensating her for the rest of her life, but I'm afraid I might be some fucking psychopath. I really feel the worst I've ever felt and I know I deserve it.",10Aug2020,1
286," Before i start anything, english is not my first language, sorry for my grammar.
 I'm a underage gal, and i crave male attention (my age or older).
 I dont think i had any events in my life that led up to this, maybe my father ignoring me sometimes when i was a child, but it wasn't alot. I was sexually abused as a child, but by another female, so i dont think its related to that either.
 Doesn't have to be sexual, a compliment as simple as ""you're doing great"" ""you look pretty today"" or a pat on the head is already enough. Just the slightest amount of attention makes me happy. Sometimes i step out of my boundaries, do stuff i shouldnt, just for a little bit of validation.
 I think shit gets a little fucked up now. I dont care if i get groomed, used, or anything like that. I like it. I feel fucking filthy because of it, but deeply i want that shit to happen. 
 I dont know what to do, how can i get rid of this mentality?",10Aug2020,1
287,"Hi! I'm a female, 18, who's looking to leave an abusive household and find a new place to live. My partner plans to move in with me (19M) awhile after I move out. My parents never really taught me much about housing, so finally fed up with that I'm looking for advice and just starting my research. 

I only have two requirements for the area I live: 

\- The housing is 1,000/m or less, I'll probably end up working two part-time jobs or full time so I don't expect to make much... my boyfriend will only be able to work part-time.

\- I need to be able to walk to a grocery store and a place to work (although that may be the same place hah.) from the house. Getting a car might be something I have to wait on, and living somewhere walkable is referencable but if the only place I can walk is the grocery store and work, that's all I need.

The most confusing thing is that I asked her a few months ago if she was gay, and she said no. I don’t want to be that person that forces someone to come out, so I have no idea what to do.

293,"I feel like this is probably important so ill say this first. Yesterday we joked about tipping off the cops about a party one of my football buddys were having in a groupchat with one of the people that went to the parties. One of my friends is related to a cop and texted him what was going on. The cop never opened the text though.

This is were it starts. Me and 3 other friends walked by the house that had the party once. After we walked by we thought we saw someone that always beefs with us and trys to start fights all the time. We chose to run onto someones property and hide in some bushes and stuff to try and avoid him. It turns out it wasnt him and was some other dude. He basically asked us what was going on. My 3 friends came out but i kept hiding. They told him what was going on and he said to not mess around on the property owners  property because hes an ass. About 3-5 minutes later the dude speeds to us in his loud ass truck. I don't remember what he said to well because I was scared i was about to get shot. All i really remember is he said he had already called the cops on the party and we were about to be busted. We never said anything about the party so the random guy already knew about the aprty. We weren't involved with the party in the slightest. The cop pulls up like 1 minute later and asks whats going on. We say we were playing a one way game of hide and seek with some buddies. I know that doesnt sound like it makes much sense but its a common thing we do alot. This cop is a new guy so he doesn't understand it at all. Im not really sure how to word it without sounding suspicious or saying anything about the party. He lets us go but as we were talking with him 2 people in a car drive by who were at the party. They relay the message and said we are snitching on the party. The guy who was in the chat told them that we tipped them off yesterday about the party and all hell is breaking loose.

I tend to see all girls as shallow, stupid, and emotional.
I have girl friends and I always get annoyed when they’re talking about their emotions, I see them as weak people, and that they don’t even think. Idk, I think I’m a “not like other girls” person which SUCKS and I hate.

I never express it, but I always feel that deep inside :( I wanna know how to get over these ideas but I don’t know where to look. 
All my life since I was a child my friends were mostly boys too. So maybe that’s related?

298,"Hello fellow people of Reddit. Over the past few months my parents and I have been fighting each other. I feel neglected and needed in life, and literally anything else. They are so intensive about me being the best at academics even though they put restrictions on things like google docs and gmail all as a punishment that I am going against them. I feel unneeded and my parents do not understand that they have done things like thrown away things I have paid for and items I value. I honestly think I have came down with GAD(general anxiety disease) because I have all the symptoms. They think I am just a spoiled brat but they do not understand what is going through my head. To make it worse I have a brother who is a complete jerk. He does things like makes me really mad and he gets everything from my parents. They treat him like a king and me like a peasant. I don't know what to do my parents do not even let me use my own money anymore all because I wanted to express my feelings to them and they do not understand. They are strict parents and make me do their things they have to do. It really makes me want to just hole up in my room and barricade it with cinder blocks. Going back to GAD I said earlier my test results came in and it was a 54/62(62 being the maximum zero being relaxed and normal), and 79 on another test(if the number is over 32 that means you have severe GAD). Still they don't believe me and blame it on me trying to express my feelings and that I would not have wanted to be born if I knew my life was like this.

301,"Recently matched with a girl and made a strong connection. The girls background story is, for lack of better phrasing, pretty damn crazy. We keep talking and we’re hitting it off very well, however she claims she is in another country still until her flight here to start college. First red flag is her flight date is about a week after classes start. Due to COVID, I disregard and figure it was delayed. We keep talking, sometimes pretty intimate conversations. Fast forward to today, watching a movie with my roommates, one of which (F, close friends) I happen to notice picks up her phone exactly and types exactly when my tinder match is typing. This continued the entire 2.5 hours. I try to get up and catch a very quick glance just to see if she’s on the app (not trying to invade privacy im just a paranoid person, also should mention she has a boyfriend who is sitting near and not texting so why hiding the phone in the first place?) but she seems to notice and sets the phone down or faces it away. When she does this the three dots from my tinder date disappear, I sit down, she grabs her phone again and they come back. Her fingers were definitely moving in a typing motion over the course of this. Am I trippin or does this seem a little suspicious? To add to this, I had been keeping her updated on this girl previously and today she tells me she actually had met her in a foreign exchange program at the college. What a strange coincidence. She also happens to speak the same language as this girl. I honestly don’t know what to think. If she had been the one receiving my intimate texts and has been catfishing me, using our friendship as a way to make it easy to know my desires and draw me in, that would be pretty messed up. For now I’m waiting until tinder girl arrives and i can confirm its been her but that won’t be for a bit. Thoughts? 
P.s. tinder location says one mile away, same friend earlier had told me it shows that if they set their location there, however at one point I noticed it say 4 miles while said friend was not home.

302,"So I’ll lay it out. I’m 27, as of like a few days from now. I have about 12 male friends from the main group, since we were like 12 or so years old. Over the years the friend group has grown to around 30 plus. Not every one knows every one aside from us original 12. And even then a lot is just lost. So every one has like 3 besties, but we all still keep in some kind of contact. Now me, the elder, the first, the head of everything since the beginning, the house we all hung out at, the one who listened and helped everyone, the soul, of the group, I’ve left the group a bit as of years now. All of us being adults now and just growing, They are all 20 somethings, young, wild drinking kids, (me still to a point) some well off some not. But I’m the elder, pushing 30, I’m about to get my life together and I’m doing actually very well. So before I leave the state, I’ve sent a few messages to the young ones, a few girls and probably trans kids in the net work. Just giving advice on who they are interested in and just general advice. So far it’s been very good advice I guess, because I know everyone, and I’m trying to set them up for success as much as I possibly can before I leave. But, me doing so, seems to have made multiple people think, that by me talking to them in such a heartfelt way means I’m trying to f. I’ve sent a few messages trying to explain. But it’s all just left on read. I’m fucking 27, dude u actually think I’m out to get in bed with a 16 year old? Come the fuck on. Only thing I can think of is that they want to do it and are jealous that I can actually talk to them like a person, not some fuckable object. But they can’t kus she/they are under age and they can’t get it. Idk, it just bothers me when THE EPDER OF THE GROUP tries just to help the people that will take our place, that they think I’m tryna f. I said this to one of my closest: “yea, she’s hot af, everything u could say about her, yea, but the thought going thru with it? Bro I start to gag. She’s a fucking kid?!” (I nearly hung up the phone) dude she doesn’t even know what taxes are?! You mf! WE ARE ADULTS?! No answer, then just, “I guess.” Beeeeeeeep. Idk. I’m done with this group.

I'm ""quarantined"" from them almost all the time, plus I've not had any symptoms.

Anyone have experience with this? Will they follow up or anything? If my parents find out they will most definitely ask that I do some religious therapy or get cut off from them entirely.

304,"Right so my cat recently learned that there’s another cat in the neighbourhood. So this now means late nights of her coming back late. So at around three in the morning I decided to give up and go to sleep. So I went to bed and watched YouTube for five minutes before going to sleep.

All of a sudden my dogs go of there rocker and I come running in. Nothing but my underwear on and nothings there I give the cat a call nothing so I go to my room see if I see anything from my window and nothing. Then I come back to turn the lights off in the kitchen and boom cats in the window. 

So I let her in and she goes to her cubby hole in the cabinet but as she walks there she walks over the worlds biggest spider I have ever seen. Honestly I was the size of her stomach and she’s a fully grown Tabby. I of course freaked out and ran to my room grabbed my clothes and put my socks on raising them above my pants to stop the spider crawling up tucked my shirt in and put a jacket on tying my sleeves shut. 

I come back in with lynx and a lighter fully prepared to take the house down with it. And it’s gone. My cats sleeping on the other side of the kitchen but the spider is gone. This was 3ish hours ago I haven’t slept a wink I have major arachnophobia so knowing this might be in my house will not let me sleep I have spent the past two-three hours searching for this thing and can’t find it. Either it’s hiding really well or the cat ate though don’t see how without it causing a fight. 

But my problem is if my cat ate it I will never know so I will never know what happened to it and I will always feel terrible knowing that it may still be out there. I live in Ireland where spiders are decently small this thing looked straight out of a horror movie. I know in my mind I’m probably remembering it bigger then it was but it was still huge I know that much that it was freaken huge. So if you a way to tell if the cat ate it or a way to lure the spider out of hiding then tell me please I know I won’t sleep till I can either forget about it or kill it.",10Aug2020,1

Over 20 years of research shows that participants experience improved body confidence and eating behaviors, as well as a reduction in negative mood. Participating in this group will also provide you with the opportunity to develop a support system or community with the women in your group.

*Who is eligible?*  
All women ages 16-26. Tell your friends! 

*What will I be doing during the sessions?*

Groups complete verbal, written, and behavioral exercises together during the sessions. Participants learn about body activism, how to manage societal pressures to look a certain way, and discuss the costs of pursuing a beauty ideal. 

*Who is in the group with me?*

Each group consists of 6 women and 2 Peer Leaders. We randomly assign groups based on availability. 

*How much does it cost?*

**No cost!** The Body Project is donation-based; it's free of charge and those who want to can donate.",10Aug2020,1
306,"Me and my girlfriend, of two years, decided that we’d split up and remain friends. It was a long distance relationship and I believe that was the cause of our decision, she lives in Texas and I, Wyoming. For the past two years I’ve been working and saving up to get my own place there. It feels like my whole reason for wanting to move is gone now. I sit here alone in my room and it feels as if I closed a book and now I’m beginning to write a new story of my life. The thing is, I have no clue what to do. Has anyone else been in the same boat? What advice could you give me on what to do?",10Aug2020,1

308,"For a long time, I was the ""skinny girl"". My waist was average, but my ARMS. They're like sticks. I hate looking at pictures of me as a kid because I hate seeing them. 

So, over the years (I'm 16 now), I've put on weight around my waist. Not a lot of fat, but enough that I look semi-pregnant. I look bloated all the time. My stomach is bigger than my ass. 

(And yet, my friends say ""but you're so skinny!"" when I complain...)

309,"So I(20M) got bored one night cause my friends weren't all online and I knew I had no work the next day. I tried Bumble for once and turned out pretty cool seeing a lot of people on there. The next day I finally had a match (21F), where she swipped right on me and I swipped right. The rules on the app says that women are the first to reply and there is a 24hr time period where they make the first move. All day today I kept thinking like, ""I dig her energy...Did she not see the message? I hope she see's that we match...I hope she knows she has to make the first move...Maybe because she's an introvert she won't message back."" She lives like 2 hrs, 3 cities away. So I took the intitative to be like, ""Okay, every single one of my relationships came to me and didn't last long, what if this time I take the first move and try to reach out to her."" So I went on facebook and looked her first name up and filtered her town (It helped because it's a small town.

312,"Hello,

My dorm cancellation date is on the 11th so I have a few days to make a decision. I am struggling to decide between staying at home or living in the dorms for this semester, Fall 2020. I would be transferring from a community college so this is my first time in the dorms. I marked ++ next to things that are important to me. I am having a hard time with this decision because I want to be selfish but I also will have to spend a lot of money and I am really torn. I am scared that I might make the wrong decision and regret having to wait longer for my own room (my parents guilt-tripped me into moving states with them and going to community college so I would live with them in college- but we're poor so apartment)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of living at home:**

\- Saves money (room/meals)

\- More comfortable since it's my own home

**Cons of living at home:**

\- Have to share my room with my little brother (13M)

\- No privacy at all basically (overbearing parents)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of dorms:** 

\- Having my own room (++)

\- Privacy (++)

\- Potentially getting a whole suite to myself (It's a cluster of 4 single bedrooms but all of them say vacant right now)

\- It does have a full kitchen (but so does my home)

\- I can get a $4000 work-study grant, work-study jobs pay 13/hr (1 up from minimal wage here)

\- I am paying/loaning everything, my parents don't pay....I don't feel guilty about taking their money

**Cons of dorms:**

\- They doubled the rent price from $3000 to $7000 for one semester

\- Meal plans are $1000 (I can cook somewhat)

\- Dorms/meal plan are now doubled so work-study grant doesn't cover those anymore

\- If one student gets covid then everybody gets sent home",10Aug2020,1

314,"I'm a 16 yr old boy who lives with both parents 
My mom has a business of baking which she sells via facebook

Since I'm 16 and just starting senior highschool
I don't really have a job to begin with 

Although i do work part time on a small shop near the place i live in for some extra cash

I would usually save the money along with my allowance ($2) i usually end up saving alot of money (the highest being $100 if I'm lucky)

I usually save the money so I'll have the opportunity to slowly buy the stuff i want and also possibly gift someone something for Christmas since i usually end up not giving anyone anything during the  holidays because of the lack of money

I bought my first android phone last 2 years ago using some of the money i saved after spending years only having a pc (that i got as a gift from my uncle)

I felt like i was not doing harm since I'm using my money to buy what i want instead of asking my parents to do so

But as soon as my mom found out...
She would usually ask how big my savings are 
And sometimes if it reaches like $10 up 
She would ask if she could borrow it and promised that she would pay me back sooner

At first i thought ""Yeah sure how bad can $10 be?""
Until it started..

Keep in mind i don't waste my money over microtransactions and useless shit
I just usually save it so if i see something that i like such as a shirt , figurine or anything I'll have the money to afford it

My mom would start asking everytime if have some money just so she could borrow it even if it's like only $1

One time i was planning to repair my pc and i have enough to afford the repairs but my mom comes in and asks AGAIN to borrow $50 bucks from me

And you know what the worse part is...
She doesn't pay it back!! (Even the $10 from the first time she asked)

Back then i didn't get mad and just thought she'll pay it back in a bulk one day...but no whenever i try to remind her she says something like ""Oh don't worry I'll pay it back next month/year/week"" (which ofc doesn't happen)


This led me to end up lying about not saving and end up hiding my money in unusual places  (like inside a cut up pillow in my bed)

But it didn't work and until now she still ends up borrowing and borrowing never giving it back

So which is why i lost the motivation to even earn anything anymore since i don't end up using it anymore..

I even quit my job as a worker in the small shop near us and i usually spend my allowance in full now not leaving anything behind (i end up using the remaining money in my allowance to treat my friends instead)


I just wanted to share this story to all of you since whenever i try to remind my mom about all of things she owes
She ends up getting mad at me saying ""You always repeat that thing every single day i told you!! I'll pay it soon!!"" (It's been 2 years)

Is there anything i can do to at least bring back my motivation or just at least forget about this huge mess?",10Aug2020,1
315,"So I(21m) have been in love with this woman(22f) who ive known for years now. We dated once and broke up because her family wouldnt let her actually live her own life until she moved out. We had talked about getting back together for a long time and I really wanted to until she got a BF. The only thing is he doesnt treat her nicely. Talks down to her and doesnt wanna call unless they ""have something to talk about"". She complains about him a lot and the other day I finally told her that I loved her and That I always had. After that she said she loved me too and wanted me to fight for her(Not literally). But then 2 days ago she said she never should have said that. Even though we had sex and she stayed with me for 2 days while he was out of town. I know Im despicable for allowing that to happen but I love her a lot and I wanted to put me ahead for once. What should I do or say if anything? Because I dont wanna lose her in my life but Its painful to just be a friend and listen to that garbage about him.",10Aug2020,1
316,"Here is some context. I liked this girl back in seventh grade (currently 10th) and I asked her out and got rejected, broke my heart, and, even though I never told anybody, I still had feelings for her, not very prominent, but I knew I would date her if I had the opportunity. Over the summer, I lost 65 pounds and am now athletic. I was extremely overweight. I am a bit of a nerd, and that will make sense later, but I saw her when I was hanging out with my friends, and we started texting again. One thing leads to another and I was dating her. I’m generally a pessimist, but I was on cloud 9. My head was so in the clouds that I completely ignored my friends. I know it is a dick move. Big time. And I’m very sorry, but that is how I fucked up. 

I just went offline and turned off notifications. I was spending time with my girlfriend, my first girlfriend. I expected them to be happy for me. After about 2 months of dating, the relationship became more and more toxic until I broke up with her. Though, it was social suicide, because I am still a nerd and she is one of the most popular people in the school. I think I had this notion that I needed to live more dangerously, and maybe the way to do that was to date a popular girl and party, and blow off hanging with my true friends, the people who actually care about me. And now my friends are all very angry. I have apologized to each and every one of them, and have been ignored. I am going to keep trying, but I’m not sure what to do. Without them, I’m just a nerd with no friends.  The people were the only part I liked about being a nerd. Truly genuine people, generally no drama, and strong friendships, but currently, the one thing I like about my social status is absent.",10Aug2020,1
318," I know this sounds bad but hear me out at least.

\*\*\*fake names\*\*\*

So I (24f) have a friend that we'll call Megan(24f) and she's dating a guy we'll call called Nate(24m). Now I didn't like Nate at the beginning of the relationship but we slowly ended up bonding over talking about Megan and the various shitty family situations she gets into. Not like shitting on her or anything but expressing exasperation over how she isn't helping herself out of shitty situations even though we try to support her.

Anyways, skip forward like 2 years and me and Megan have sort of drifted apart so I don't hang out with her and Nate a lot anymore, but she was my absolute best friend. I still talked to her but inviting her and Nate out was always a mistake because they fight so often that everyone gets uncomfortable and it's just not worth the hassle.

So enough context. Megan goes to Europe for 2 weeks and Nate texts me and is like wanna hang out, I got the new video game we were talking about the other day and I'm like that's chill sure come on over. I let Megan know he's coming over and I tell my own bf who was gonna join us but got called into work. Everything is chill. We're both drinking and giggling about how stupid this game is cause it's not living up to our expectations. I snap a pic of Nate and send it to Megan shes like nice have fun. Now we're both very drunk or at least I am and he plops his head into my lap and dramatically demands that I pet his hair cause Megan doesn't do it often enough. Now this has happened before in front of Megan and I thought it was a little weird but she didn't react negatively so I was like alright whatever and petted his hair.

It's now like 2am were both drunk and tied so we pull out the hidabed/pull out bed in the living room for Nate to sleep on and I face plant on it and I pass out. I wake up at like 4am realize I'm downstairs still and go upstairs to my bed and fall back to sleep. For the record, I woke up cuddling Nate which was entirely unintentional because I was asleep but I was already bothered by this.

Buuuut, now its about 10am and Im mostly asleep still and I feel the bed dip behind me. I don't really react initially cause my sleepy brain just says that its my bf crawling in. But its Nate and he cuddled right up behind me spooning me. Now my heart is racing and I'm panicking because someone who I haven't okay--ed is in my bed which is my personal special space that not everyone gets to be in. Hell I don't even let my friends in my room regularly unless I'm really close with them. He realizes I'm awake and cuddles closer. I'm talking dick to the ass close. Now I'm sitting there silently which he obviously takes as the OK and he wraps his arm around me and I just kinda adjust around it because I'm panicking so hard internally that I just froze. Even though I was extremely uncomfortable I couldn't move, I just played it off as being okay. I couldn't sleep after that and eventually extricated myself to go to the bathroom. I should also note that I don't sleep with pants on either so that was extra uncomfortable. I was thinking about how I could tell him that I totally wasn't comfortable with what happened and he says to me ""oh, and don't tell Megan"". Now that set off alarm bells and made the situation so much worse. I acted as normal as possible until he left and then I bawled and told my bf and my other friend. My bf and my friend don't blame me but this is still bothering me.

So in the end I waited until Megan was back from her trip and I told her I needed to talk to her. Now I didn't do this in person, I sent her a very long message telling her what had happened from my perspective. She immediately got mad at me for not telling her sooner (I didn't want to wreck her vacation) and said something about how I'm painting her bf as a rapist, which I am absolutely not trying to do. Yeah, he put me in an uncomfortable position but I don't think it was sexual? Like I'm pretty sure I would have felt an erection digging into my ass with how close he was?

Regardless she was very mad at me and told me I should have said something and pushed him away and the last I really heard from her was that she needed to ""reevaluate our friendship"". I don't know what happened with the bf after that all I know is that they're still together.

So, should I reach out to her and apologize because I think that's what she's waiting for or should I just let her go as a friend?",10Aug2020,1
319,"I feel attacked in a way by my friends and they were the only people I really had that I could call family for the past 8-9 years. They cut me off with no explanation and haven’t said anything since (for the past month or so). I ended up finding out the reason they all cut me off through my brother who one of them spoke to about the situation. 

Long story short, it was basically the telephone game and everyone thinks I said a bunch of things, in which I didn’t. I’ve sent an apology to one of them and just left it at that. I’m unsure if I should just move on from them. They’ve cut me off in the past before for an entire year before one of them said sorry but really just used me for a booty call (one of them is a HS ex). Even with that happening I still stayed friends with them. I loved them and cared about all these people for so long and to constantly get shit on and when I’m the one that’s hurt that’s wrong and they cut me off? 

I’m not one to easily cut people off like it’s nothing and I always give second and third chances. I’m just tired of always being made out to be the bad guy. I’m tired of always being told I’m wrong for feeling a certain way. I still see so much good in these people and our relationships as friends but I’m just unsure on how to view it myself. I don’t want to have anymore self doubt and I do find myself relying on having close friends since I always want to support and love anyone I can. I thrive off of having others I can love and care about haha.

I feel like I’m the bad guy even though multiple people have told me that I don’t have to apologize. Any advice on how to look at this? Sorry for it being so long and all over the place as well. I’ve tried to write this out so many times but I’m just terrible at explaining. If anyone has any questions or wants to know more definitely just ask! Absolutely anything helps!!!

321," Hi, first post here. This might not be entirely related? But I really hope this post doesn't get taken down because I'd love to hear your guys' insight. I've been in a bit of a pickle, and I'd really appreciate any input you guys might have.

The title basically tells you everything you need to know, and this is probably really serious and lame, lol, but the thing is, I'm really just trying to learn how to love my parent better. For context, this particular parent is the head of the household, and basically, it just really is entirely *their* household. It really is just a lot, if that makes sense. Things must be done their way (which is very often the right way, and the most effective and efficient one at that, because ESTJ amirite), or you get an earful - and I mean an earful. On top of that, we just have different love languages entirely. Theirs is acts of service, and mine is words of affirmation (also, I'm an ENFP if you needed to know for some reason). I know this parent does absolutely everything they can - and beyond - to provide for me and my future in every way possible, but it just doesn't seem to amount much to me if this parent can't take into consideration other people's feelings or opinions. Does that make any sense?

Probably the simplest solution would be to just acquiesce entirely, but I'm not sure if I'm capable of that. I feel guilty about looking forward to leaving home, but I know that their influence will probably extend to even when I'm not under their roof anymore. Additionally, for some context, the norm in the country where I come from is to defer entirely to the elder. The society generally doesn't look too kindly on children who detach entirely from their families, as more Western cultures might exhibit. And I also really don't want to cut them out of my life, either, but (and I really hate to say this) it really is just getting unbearable for me, and even if I feel guilty about saying that because of everything they've done for me, it's just how I feel, and I can't do anything about it. And the way I feel is manifesting itself in the way I interact with this person, and I feel I'm becoming unkind, which I don't want at all.

tl:dr; How do I love my parent who demands my deference and who is vastly different from me, without relinquishing control of my life or compromising who I am (assuming I even know what this is, lol)? How can I be kind to someone who is my superior, and make my life a little more bearable?

Thank you in advance for responding! Any insights you guys might have would be really, really helpful. c:",10Aug2020,1
322,"When I wake up my heartrate is incredibly uneven and fast. My stomach hurts and my head hurts (like a headache, I feel like I can't think). I feel incredibly confused and I dread sitting up because I feel sick. I feel like I can't move my body because I feel so weighed down and tired. 

I'm trying to properly explain how I feel when I wake up, but I know I'm not doing the best job. 

My sleep schedule is super messed up right now. I'm sure that probably contributes in some way, but waking up with anxiety and symptoms of having a panic attack is making it even worse. It makes me dread going to sleep. Because when I lay down I begin experiencing anxiety, my heart rate becomes uneven and it gets faster, and my stomach hurts.

I experience similar symptoms when trying to go to sleep and when waking up, but they're much worse when waking up.

325,"Looong post warning

So I (27M) was crushing on a work colleague K (32F) of mine who was also crushing on me hard. We would hang out all the time but she was very reserved about starting a relationship with me as I had just gotten out of a 10 year marriage 4 months earlier. She says she thinks I should date other people and explore whats out there so I eventually and reluctantly install Tinder. Eventually we hook up and she again tells me that she still thinks I should be seeing other people to which I tell her I have been. She freaks out and asks how many to which I tell her I'd hooked up with 4 chicks in the week I'd had tinder.  She gets really upset and asks why I would do that if I liked her to which I told her if she had of wanted a relationship then I wouldn't have gotten Tinder. She says she was scared of getting hurt so thats why she said it. So we have the talk and decide to start a relationship with each other.

Fast forward 2 months and we have a fight and shes giving me the silent treatment for 4 days. I pretty much assume the relationship is going to be over any day now so drunkenly sext a chick one night, nothing else comes of it. Next day having a few drinks with a mate and his neighbour comes over and starts complimenting me on how hot I am, one thing leads to another and we end up making out. I stop it before anything else happens but genuinely feel awful about doing it. I tell K what I did and tell her I feel like a scumbag for it. Turns out the neighbour I made out with had previously slept with K's fiance the night before they were meant to get married. So shes understandably very upset. We talk about it and she says she wants a break. Next day she messages me to hang out and we end up hooking up however she stresses that we're still on a break. 

Shes not feeling to well so she goes to see her Doctor and finds out shes pregnant and also has chlamydia both from me, end up doing a 10 hour round trip to get rid of the baby. 

At this point she says we're still on a break and we go from not speaking for days at a time to me staying at hers 3-5 nights a week and generally acting like a couple. She says she doesn't know if she can trust me after everything but also doesn't want to lose me. I really want things to work out with her, after nearly losing her already I know I would never do anything to jeopardise this relationship again. 

Any advice on what I should do to make this work",10Aug2020,1

328,"I used to date this guy , we'll call him Sam, and he was also close friends with my best friend, lets call her Kim.  Sam and I dated for about two months before I broke it off because I was experiencing some intense anxiety around the relationship (none of it was brought on by him, just some unresolved things) and it was very unhealthy for me both physically and mentally to carry on in the relationship. He understood this, and although we ended on good terms, it hurt him a lot and it hurt me as well as it wasn't as if we didn't love each other..

While in the relationship, I shared a lot with Sam about my past mistakes and traumas. Sam and I are both Christians and one thing that we both valued was saving sex until marriage (not every Christian has this belief, and that's okay! But me and Sam went to the same Christian school where that was very much the commonly held belief and expected). Something I really regret doing is losing my virginity instead of saving it until marriage or at least until I found someone who I loved, instead I did it while in a very deep depression and it was a very very bad experience that I still have immense guilt and pain surrounding. I told Sam that I wasn't a virgin anymore as like I mentioned it's kind of expected that everyone in the school is a virgin and I didn't want him to feel like I lied to him and in our relationship I wanted us to be authentic with one another and because that experience has very much shaped me into the person I am today I didn't want to hide that from him. However, I did leave out one detail: that it was actually a threesome with a couple I worked with. He didn't know this couple, but the detail of it being a threesome wasn't small. I didn't want to tell him this detail at that moment for a number of reasons. I was very anxious throughout the whole relationship and it was already anxiety inducing to just tell him I wasn't a virgin. Also, I was (and still am) struggling with my sexuality and wasn't ready to answer the questions that came around it being a threesome at that point, even though I did tell him a little bit later that I was pretty sure I was bisexual. When I told him I wasn't a virgin I knew he'd assume it wasn't a threesome, but I didn't ever specify that. I just told him that it wasn't a story I felt comfortable sharing at that moment. Our relationship ended about a month after I told him this. 

Someone who did know the whole story was Kim. She didn't know what I told Sam about that story if I told him anything at all. However, after we broke up Sam was upset but he still thought pretty highly about me and even though I told him that I didn't want to hold him back and that he should move on I did hope that maybe if I got my anxiety sorted and we were both single we could try things again. Kim told Sam the whole story about me losing my virginity and she says that she assumed he knew already. When he told her that he didn't know, he apparently told her to not tell me she told him.

Sam felt betrayed and like I lied to him. He quit talking to me at school and I didn't know what had happened. Even though we had broken up for a bit, we were still friendly to one another and all of the sudden it stopped. I was crushed. Even though I wasn't ready for a relationship, it hurt to lose him completely. I didn't know what I had done wrong. 

I got drunk once and texted him a few months later (very stupid, I know) and he was also drunk. I asked him what made him quit loving me and he told me it was when he found out that I had had a threesome. Immediately I asked Kim if she had told him as very few people know that I had in a threesome and she was one out of like three people who knew and she is close to him. She said she didn't. I believed her.

Another month passes and I begin to think about it more and how it doesn't add up and I looked through old texts if I had told him and just forgot or something. I asked Kim once again if she told him and I told her that it was really eating me up. She lied to my face again. I knew it was her at this point as I had no other explanation. One of my other friends confronted her about it and told her that I knew she did it and that it hurt me the most that she lied and she just said that because Sam told her not to tell me she didn't. 

While I understand that it's a tough place to be in as she was caught in the middle, I feel betrayed. She saw how much it hurt me that Sam completely cut me off and that there was no chance of us other making things work again. And even though Sam asked her not to tell me, it was my secret that I wanted to tell Sam on my own terms when the time was right. She also never apologized at all for it to me. She pretends like it never happened. Am I being unreasonable by being upset? 

TLDR: My friend told my ex boyfriend something about me that made him hate me. He asked her to not tell me she told him. It hurt me a lot that he began to hate me and she saw that. I confronted her about it twice and she lied. Now I know the truth I am upset.",10Aug2020,1
329,"I have a bad habit of telling myself I can get better at activities/hobbies/games than anyone who is better than me. This usually results in me getting pretty good at whatever I do, but naturally there is always someone better. Frustration soon becomes a common occurrence when I can't best others in the same activity. How can I teach myself to stop giving a fuck if people are better than me? I cannot stop thinking that I either am/can be better than anyone I see as better than myself. I can see that they are better but somehow delude myself into thinking I can ""beat"" them when I clearly can't. This issue makes me feel like a angry little child which in turn makes me upset for being upset at such a childish mindset. Thank you for any advice!",10Aug2020,1

 For context: 14 year old female here.

 So, to be totally honest, i don't know what i'm feeling. It's kinda empty, sad, or just nothing at all. But at the same time i'm very emotional (hope it makes sense lol). 
 I can be happy or excited, but suddently get sad for no reason. My happines is momentary.

 Went through some things in the past, but i'm living a pretty average and good life now. 
 Struggle with self harm, but i'm not really suicidal (want to die but at the same time, scared of death. more of a ""I want to disappear"" feeling).

 Also, I used to like some things quite a lot (like drawing) but it doesn't feel as good now. I lose interest in things very easily, can't concentrate much. Procrastination is a problem for me, too.

 There's more, but I guess this is good enough :)",10Aug2020,1
331,"We’ve been on and off for a year but our relationship is a bit different. Since I’m still getting over related trauma, we haven’t had sex and I’m struggling with being intimate/affectionate, slowly trying to get into it. He understands it’s hard for me, so he waits, and I understand it’s hard for him, so I’ve told him I’m fine with him seeing other people. The way I see it is: imagine dating someone who hates beer but you absolutely love it. Just because you can’t share the experience of having a beer with them doesn’t mean you should completely give it up. However, he says he’s not interested in seeing others and doesn’t want to “give up on me” because he loves me. 

Yesterday he randomly sent me an instagram post of a really feminine James Charles type of guy and said: “idk if its okay with u to say i find him absolutely adorable”. He thought I wouldn’t feel okay knowing he finds someone else attractive, especially a boy, since I’m his gf. I’ve always known he’s bi, so I didn’t think much of it and told him that I saw no problem with that. He then proceeded to tell me that he’s rarely into guys, but “femboys are gold”. He said it was not even that important, but didn’t want to keep it a secret from me. 

However, him finding this type of guys attractive is not the issue for me. What’s bothering me is why that would matter so much for him to have to announce it. He’s talked to my friend about it, too. And I mean, I like girls a lot, but I’ve never felt the need to say that to him, since I’ve chosen that I will date and love him - so why does my attraction to other people matter? 

I don’t know how much sense this makes, but I started overthinking it and now I wonder if he really likes me, or I’m just a temporary replacement, or a coverup for his friends/family(i’ve met most of them) so they don’t find out he’s gay or something. Maybe that’s why he’s been so patient with us not having sex? I get questioning your sexuality is tough and I would be there for him, but if his feelings for me aren’t as genuine as he says they are, I’d like to be there as a friend only. I now started to feel not enough, and even more scared that if we keep trying to get intimate, he’s not gonna like it or something will go wrong, and it’s really scaring me off even kissing him. He said he’s never questioned his attraction to girls and loves me etc, but I’m really starting to doubt it. Not because of the classic “bi people aren’t loyal” type of stuff, that would be hypocritical. But because of the way he talked about it as if it’s a big deal.",10Aug2020,1

There is a guy in the program I’m in that really creeps me out. Idk what it is but every time I see him ever cell in my body screams for me to get farAway from him. He constantly stares at  me which at first I chalked it up to him not being used to ppl with physical deformities but then I  noticed it just wasn’t me but all the other young women. When he first moved in he’d go swimming at this pool that was I front of the gym and just...watch me and my friend work out. I think the thing that really sets off the bells in my head is whenever I pass the pool and there are other people’s kids in there with him he is always just following them with his eyes and talking to them oddly. Like I get some ppl don’t have experience with kids and therefore don’t know how to interact with them but the way he does is just unsettling.  There are other people in the program who I know are decent people that are ok with him and don’t have an issue with him (or so it seems) and then there are others who have the same feeling as I do, mostly the other women. I tried to be nice to the guy as much as I can but it’s seriously hard because he really creeps me out.

335,My dilemma that I'm currently dealing with that I need some advice in is that I am the kind of guy that could stay home for weeks and be fine with that playing video games watching movies and just chilling and I could be by myself for multiple days with no problem with the occasional necessity to want to socialize but my current dilemma is that my best friend's want to hang out with me which is not a problem but they want to hang out with me more than I would like to. For example they would be perfectly fine hanging out with me for almost every single day out of the week but the thing is being an introvert and sometimes not wanting to hang out I'm the kind of guy who would be more susceptible to only hanging out a Max of three times a week not because of being busy but just out of choice and then another added Dilemma on top of this is sometimes I will get seriously baked to the point of wanting to veg out in my room for 3 to 4 days for like every week or every other week and then during that time I dont want to see or talk to anyone. I also hate getting phone calls and chatting on the phone so I get a decent amount of phone calls from my best friends and I get bothered by it but then what's ironic is that after chatting in the conversation for a little bit I enjoy it and have fun. And I'm thinking that I get bothered by the phone calls cuz it interrupts me from what I'm doing whether it's important or just me playing some video games and that bothers me no matter who does it is. So basically I am choosing to want to ignore and avoid my best friends just because I want to be lazy and hang out in my room and be by myself doing only what I want and not having to worry about anybody else or any responsibilities. So because of this my friends have felt hurt by me doing this and this is not the first time me doing this I have done this ever since being friends with them and I've been friends with them for 10 years and most of the time my friends usually have to drag me out of my house metaphorically speaking to hang out so I'd like to know am I valid in what I want to do and how I just want to hang out only a couple times and then be alone for quite a large amount of time or am I totally disregarding my best friends and just being basically a lazy hunk of cheese. I would be greatly appreciated to get an outside perspective on this get some advice as well.

337,So i had this school interview today and i was pretty confident about it. Due to this whole corona situation all entry tests were cancelled so they were only holding interviews online. I logged in a few minutes before the interview had started. I don't smile that much so i had a serious look on my face. The thing is where i come from people think that others know everything. So the interview started and there was this old lady. The first think she did was that she told me everything about me from my name to my previous marks because of my personal profile i had submitted so she asked me introduce yourself. Now htw am i suppose to introduce when she already did that. Next few questions were normal and i thought hey maybe i can do this. Now being a student i don't have interest in many things like economics and politics. She began asking questions about those things. Now htf am i suppose to reply to that.

We've been friends since highschool, and I genuinely treasure our friendship and know rationally that this is not her fault, but... For the past half a year shes been driving me INSANE. 

Everything she does pisses me off. EVERYTHING. I'm angry when she talks to me, and yet I'm angry when she DOESN'T talk to me. If I even see her post on social media I get filled with this irrational anger. There's probably nothing she could do that wouldn't make me angry. Just thinking about her fills me with rage.

Since COVID I've been living at home for the past couple of months, and I'd hoped that we just needed some time apart. Unfortunately, the space has not alleiviated these feelings at all. But I'm going to have to go back soon for school, and I don't know how I'm going to keep it together without lashing out.

I've been bottling all of these feelings up, and I can't tell any of our mutual friends because I feel like a piece of shit for feeling this way!

347,"So to keep this fairly short I was talking about music with some people and how for the next EP I'm making Im considering calling it Rapeseed(nothing to do with the criminal act of rape), which is one of the main plants used for production of vegetable oil. Now someone basically told me that using that name was insensitive to rape survivors, and while im totally supportive of those people I find that out outlandish. Ive looked up a lot of stuff since that about 'misappropriation' of the word as well as the negative impacts of using it colloquial, but frankly, I don’t understand why its bad. 

To be clear, I understand why people think it's bad.. because there are people out there for whom hearing the word rape will remind them of their trauma and potentially act as a trigger, as well as the idea that it ""diminishes the meaning of the word"". But to the latter point, the word has multiple means(look at a dictionary) so that alone doesn't mean anything really, words have multiple means sometimes. Now to a survivor I can get that it would only really have one meaning in their mind, but I don’t see why someone having trauma should limit my art. Let me be extra clear, i am completely empathetic toward people who have endured trauma, but even though there are words that make me feel bad when they are used, i dont tell others they cannot say them if they are using them in a respectful way and the word has multiple meaning. We use the words ""killing"" and ""murder"" and ""choke"" and so many other colloquial and there is no problem with it. There are former soldiers who get ptsd at loud noises, but we don’t try to stop ourself from making loud noises unless that issue is already at the top of our minds. 

I understand it makes people uncomfortable, but  anything can, and even if it has a higher propensity to, that doesnt mean that there shouldn’t be times when its okay. For example: is Nirvana's ""Rape Me"" bad, immoral, or insensitive simply for using the word rape(yes I know that the song has a specifically anti-rape message, but it still is using the word, and still can trigger people). Or is ""Date Rape"" by Sublime bad? 

Im not trying to be insensitive, but I need someone to give me a good reason why using the word ""rape"" colloquially is objectively bad, because right now I feel this is just snowflake bullshit. I want to be on the right side of this, but being called insensitive and an asshole only has made me more engrained in my feelings that people are being irrational.

Ild like to note, that I don’t use the word rape as many to, such as to describe big wins in sports or many of the other ways, and im not talking about that kind of usage, because I do think that talking about it like that (in a way that is reminiscent of the sexual act is less than tasteful(this to me is being considerate, not any more or less moral)). Im talking about the usage of the word in any form whatsoever, whether that be in a name or whatnot.",10Aug2020,1

I swallowed water for the third time and at this point I legit thought I was gonna die. I thought I was gonna die and never see my family again.

At one point home was never really home.
Home had been between 4 small walls.
One that told lies, one that cheated, one that told me I'd never be enough. And then one that said they would never be the same if I dare to leave. 
Home went from feeling like a safe place, to a place I could never escape or feel safe in. Trapped, manipulated. Where I used to look for comfort, I found two black holes. Where I thought love was supposed to be, had become cold. I didnt see the warning signs until it was to late. 
Until I ran away from home. I ran and ran until finally stopped. When I stopped I had realized that didnt need that home. I needed a house, just somewhere to rest. I didnt need anything but me. Time goes on and you look around sometimes and get bitter at all these successfully built homes. And then you remember, your home looked fine on the outside. But sometimes you look, And you find One building their own home. One that you could build yourself up in, one that proved they are rock solid and could not be blown away by just anything. One that sheltered me and comforted me through every time a big or small storm passed. A home can break down the walls of a house so something bigger can be built from it.
And it took time, and trust, and patience, not once did I ever feel trapped or rushed and Before I knew it, right before my eyes, one day I realized I was exactly where I needed to be.

358,"Warning: pretty long story.

TLDR: I wanna call my manipulative Grandma and my shitty Dad out on their bullshit, but it comes with risks. Should I call them out or keep silent?
Also, my little sister who is 10 years old is living with my manipulative enabler of a Grandmother and being raised to be just like her. My Mom wants her back but won't fight in court because she's afraid it would hurt my sister. What should she do?

(if you're interested by that TLDR, you might just suffer through the whole thing cus there's a lot of context that matters here)

When I was about 12-13 years old, my Mom left. She had been in a bad, abusive relationship and she decided to get out. She says she wanted to take me and my little sister who was probably about 6-7 at the time with her, but she had a pretty bad living situation at the time and she didn't want to take us away from our friends and the rest of our family. Note that our Dad was never abusive or anything to use, so it wasn't like she was leaving us with someone dangerous.

Anyway, they eventually decided that we'd stay with our grandparents for a while so that we didn't have to be in the middle of everything, or whatever. What ended up happening was my grandparents (mostly my grandma) manipulated us into hating my Mom and wanting to stay with them for the next three years. 

My Mom fought for us in court. All she wanted was to have us during the week, she said my Dad could have liberal visitation and he didn't have to pay child support. But apparently that wasn't good enough, beause my grandparents and my Dad decided it'd be a good idea to have my testify against my own mother in court, which obviously my Mom wasn't gonna let happen. So she gave up and gave my Dad full custody.

From the start my grandma had been training me against her. Whenever I questioned my Mom's love, instead of reassuring me or whatever, she'd just say things like ""You're so smart."" or ""You're so mature for your age!""
She indirectly manipulated me. I said crazy terrible things to my Mom, and I remember my grandparents reading the hurtful messages I sent and approving them, saying they're ""proud of me for being honest""

Eventually I learned more about my Mom and I started to go down there more. Now I'm 16 and I basically live with her. I think the reason I made it out is because when my Mom left, I was already old enough to have been taught a lot of things and to think for myself a bit. The same can't be said for my sister though. When it happened she was pretty much a blank slate, and so when my grandparents took her and groomed her, enabled her, taught her that her not to do anything unless it makes her happy, taught her that nobody else matters but her, taught her that she can do whatever she wants even it hurts other people, she was pretty much ruined.

The longer I stay here with my Mom and stepdad, the more I learn about how things really were. My Dad cheated on her up until 2013 (theyd been together from 2004 to like 2016) and he'd always treated her like shit. He also would say incredibly racist stuff, he wouldn't ever do anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and he sold meth to the man who is now my stepdad, who was a veteran that went to drugs after getting severe PTSD. There's way more stuff but this is already wayyy too long.

My Uncle has PTSD and struggles with a lot of other stuff and he's currently living in my Grandma's house.
He's 41.
This is what my Grandma does. She makes people feel like they are defined by their disabilities, and then she tells you it's okay that you can't function, because that's just how you are. My Uncle is such an amazing person and seeing him go to shit like this makes me FURIOUS. He deserves so much more.

My sister, like I said, has pretty much been ruined. My Mom can never get her to come over. My sister was supposed to come over for two weeks each month during the Summer. Instead, she's here right now for the first time in five months. My Mom tries and tries but they always find some way to make it not work out, and it's been even tougher with covid-19 and all.

I can't just sit idly by and let the people I love be ruined, but what can I do?? I feel helpless.

I want to confront my Grandma on all of it, I want to confront my Dad on all of it. But as shitty as they are, they do love me, especially my Dad. Plus, my Grandpa is one of the coolest people ever, and so is my Uncle. If I just straight up go off on my Grandma and my Dad, they won't talk to me anymore. And, I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure if I'm mentally prepared to leave them in the dust. But all I want to do is to just fucking call them out on all of it. And I want to never have to be there longer than a weekend ever again. But I don't want to end my good relationships. Should I call them out and risk losing the people I love, or should I just keep quiet?

And one more thing: I want to see my sister grow and be better and learn, but that's not happening it she's at my Grandma's. My Mom definitely has more than enough against my Dad and grandparents to win in a court battle, but she couldn't do that, it would leave my little sister with permanent trauma. But then again, wouldn't leaving her there to rot be worse? If somebody could tell me what the correct course of action would be for my Mom to take, I could help her do it, because she listens to me.

Sorry this is so long. I just had to get this out. pls help",10Aug2020,1

360,"Hi, I’m 15M and around 5 months ago I started seriously talking to a friend (15F) again, we both had crushes on each other through almost all of middle school but we didn’t have the guts to advance anything, but fast forward a year, I realize my mistake of not making a move so I start talking to her almost everyday, and I noticed some strange things.

1) Some days I get abrupt responses that seem like she’s only replying to be polite, but most of the time things are fine and she seems like she wants to talk to me

2) I start the conversation most of the time, and 80% of the time we have a convo that lasts for hours, but I had my hands full with online school and I was pretty depressed for a week, and she made little to no attempt in talking to me 

3) she’s not a fan of small talk but if the topic is something we both like or care about we talk for hours

Idk, to me all these things puzzle me cause I can’t figure out if she still likes me, or if she just wants to be friends/doesn’t want to be rude and ignore me. I asked my friends what they thought but they were no help so I thought I’d get some other opinions on it, I’m willing to answer any questions because there’s definitely gonna be some info I left out, plus this post is getting too long anyways. Any and all help is much appreciated = )",10Aug2020,1
361,"Hello! So my lease is up September 1. My landlord and I mentioned going month-to-month in person (talking) after my lease ends but I never ended up signing for a month-to-month lease. Another place popped up that’s much better for me and I can move in there last week of August. 

I looked at my lease and it doesn’t mention having to give 30 days notice unless we had signed a month-to-month lease. However I am still going to give notice tomorrow (21 days notice haha). My landlord lives on the property and has a tendency to take things personally. I am going to tell her tomorrow it’s nothing personal I just need more space to set up a home office for work in case we go remote again (I’m a teacher). 

Another thing is she’s leaving the country on Friday for a few months so I’ll have to move when she’s not around. I know it’s an inconvenience for her but honestly I’ve been trying to find another room since I moved in for many reasons.

This being said does she legally have any right to stop me from moving? Could she legally keep my deposit (honestly  she can keep it I just want out)? I know she’s going to be pissed because it’s an inconvenience but I have to do what’s best for me.",10Aug2020,1

363,"For reference, I live in India, divorce and dating at my mom's age (45) is fairly unusual. I'm 17F, would've left for college in September but this has been delayed to January. My mom and I have a rocky relationship, I stayed with her for around 3 years since her divorce from my dad in 2012 and we fought a lot. I had some of my worst possible times from staying there. Since my dad has full custody, I could move to his place - stayed with mom earlier as it was closer to school etc, so I moved schools too. When staying at my dad's, I would visit mom on the weekends when again we would fight a lot.

One of the weekends, we had a major fight which caused me to completely cut contact with her for around 6 months. This was immensely hard on me but is something I'm glad I did. Since getting back in touch, I learned that my mom has reinvented her life, finding friends that care for her, really moving on from yeh divorce, and getting a boyfriend. She is a much better mother now and a generally happier person. As a result, I'm staying at her place more often. Generally, I'm spending half my week here and half at my dad's. This really is the last time I'm going to be with my mom before I leave for college.

While I'm staying here, she'd often be out with her boyfriend. I got back from a friend's place late at night (she knew when I would get back etc), and she wasn't at home so I had to wait outside till she came back. In the morning she also had him over and snuck him out when she saw I was waking up (PS I sleep in the drawing room at her place). He also often picks me up (with her) if I ever need a ride from my friend's places etc. He's a very nice guy and I'm glad he's willing to help out. But she doesn't realise I'm uncomfortable with it.

I'm happy she's happy, but I don't open to people easily. The most I can comfortably do is hi yeah I'm good how are you. I really don't like having a new dad figure who I need to accept as is. Right now, it's still okay, but my mom is thinking of asking him to move in. She obviously asked if I'll be fine with it (and my brother who is in another country for university too), and asked me if it'll mean I'll stop coming over. I told her I'll come over less and that it shouldn't matter if I'm comfortable or not as I'm leaving very soon.

It kind of feels like she and I have a new relationship where for once in the past several years I can say I have a normal, loving mother and now it's not gonna be that. It just feels weird. Barely any people I know have step-parents or even divorced parents as it has never been a thing in India. I've seen it in movies and all, but don't really know how to deal with it myself. I do want her to be with him, she is happy. How do I adjust to that?",10Aug2020,1

There's so many complex things to know and be a part of in the world of corporate America where if you don't know it you will just be working a  meager 9-5 getting huge taxes deducted leaving you with a barely liveable income. 
I want to know everything and this includes, taxes, investing, Social security, loans/ interest rates, mortgages, credit and credit scores, checking accounts, savings accounts, insurance policies, stocks, markets, supply-demand, income, debt, tax rates, and how to read a damn Excel spreadsheet. Clearly these are things the average individual needs to know of regardless of not if they major in business or finance. 
They don't teach this in school so how does the govt. Expect people to pay their taxes correctly??
Do people learn to do all this after getting their first corporate job or after they get married? Not everyone's going to be working in taco bell forever.

368,"In the beginning of quarantine I was going through something that really got to me. I didn't focus on my grades all that much and some teachers would assign so much work that really stressed me out. I had mental breakdowns which made me worry about a lot of things. I had a hard time realizing who my ""friends"" were and what they did behind my back. I found out I was being manipulated by a lot of people. I panicked a lot. And I ended up getting 1 or 2 F's in that quarter (and I never get f's). I started (virtual) summer school late because my aunt came over to stay with us for a while with her 3 year old son. It was never my choice if I wanted to stay home and study or go out to do this or that. I was dragged out out of the house multiple times to ""have fun"". I ended up not being able to complete it all before the deadline. And I'm scared. I've already disappointed my parents so much this year, and I can already see their faces. I'm afraid of failing. But I think I'm probably overreacting, because I've heard stories of people in my school who got an F each quarter and managed to pass without summer school. 

I'm also just so disappointed in myself. I feel pathetic and stupid. I kind of want to die but I don't at the same time. 

I'm glad I'm able to get this off of my chest because I don't have anyone to talk to about this. And I don't like asking for help because I feel like I'll just be a burden on them.

he was my first sexual experience &amp; so i feel like i’ll always have a special attachement to him, but i’m worried if it’s progressed into something more, and if i should end it or not.
he’s made it clear to me many times that he does not catch feelings easily, and both him, and several others who know us, have told me to “not get attached”.
but i can’t help thinking about him all the time, and get so upset when he leaves me on read. i’m trying to tell myself to move on, but i don’t have anyone else to replace him with.
the thought of him with other girls doesn’t really bother me, unless he choses them over me. and when we hang out as friends, it’s nothing special ... it’s mainly just the sex and intimacy at night that make me catch feelings for him. 
i just don’t know if i’m overthinking too much, and that airing messages from me isn’t that deep to him, or if i should get the message and back off for a while. it’s just a shame because i feel like this is gonna be the last “relationship” i’m going to have for a while, and so i don’t want it to end yet, but part of me knows that’s probably the right thing to do.

have you ever experienced your mind being blocked for weeks? With blocked, I mean not being able to focus on almost anything. I have a hard time trying to work (programming). It started last week.

374,"I will go into a bit of detail about the situation because I’m really doubting if I’m overreacting or if this really a long term problem. 

So there are three big instances which led me to feel hurt and be quite worried. The first was an important medical appointment. I used to have these appointments every few months and afterwards I would definitely be in pain. I asked him to go with me to support me and so we could use his mothers car. He said he would be there for me that day. 
But, the week of the appointment I reminded him and he said he had completely forgotten about it. He told me that he had this amazing day at his internship planned that he didn’t want to cancel. He said he felt very horrible about it, but he left me in a stressful situation of figuring out if I could still get someone else to come with me. (I actually have amazing friends, so one of them said he would support me. And even though he had a slight fever that day, he was there to pick me up.)

The second thing was my graduation. I have been working my ass of for 5 years to graduate from this school. The day of my presentation came and I hadn’t heard from him for quite a while (which isn’t super unusual, we don’t text much). But the evening before my big presentation, he texted me if I wanted to hang out the next day. I told him that I had my final presentation and all he responded was “ah okay, let me know if you want to hang out anyway”. 
I feel like anyone would check in right? Just ask if I was nervous, or if I felt ready. At least something. I called him to confront him about it and he was quite defensive. He did apologize but kept saying he had forgotten about it and was going to wish me good luck tomorrow anyway. 

The final thing, which is happening now, is another medical appointment. I have been dealing with quite extreme chronic pain for 7 years. I have to say he has been a great support overall. When we are together and I get an episode of pain, he is great in helping me get through it.
But now, after 7 years I am finally able to make a medical appointment to hopefully get rid of this pain. He kept saying he was going to be there. I was a bit reluctant because of the first medical appointment where he cancelled last minute. I did create a back up plan, then I called him if he could be there on the date of the appointment.
He said he would check. Then he called me back with the words “I have to work those days. Too badddd”. 


His tone was insane to me. I mean, I’m not difficult. I asked him about a specific date, so I’m aware there is a fair chance he would have to work. But this tone... I couldn’t deal. 
We are talking about the most important medical appointment of my life, and that is the only thing he said about it. After telling me for days that he would “definitely be there”. 

I don’t know anymore. It just hurts me. Please, please let me know what you think! It would help me out so much.",10Aug2020,1
375,"A bit of backstory. I (22m) have a (18f)emale best friend, who recently had a mutual breakup with her ex. When she was with him, she spent a lot of time with him, practically every day. We drifted apart slightly because of this but still talked once in a while, but of course, I didn't prod much into her life, as I knew he was a sort of ""jealous bf"" and he knew I once had feelings for her. During their 2 year relationship, she was more or less happy, but as time progressed, they started fighting and eventually came to a decision to break up rather than keep fighting.   
At first, she was more than okay with it. She started saying how it was for the better, and how she knew that even if they love each other as people, they're not good for a relationship, at least not yet. It was their first relationship in both cases (none of them ever had a proper bf/gf before). I did start to notice that she spent more time drinking and around friends but attributed that to the fact that she had more free time.

After two weeks though, problems started appearing. I noticed she gave me more attention than anyone's ever actually given me before (before you ask, I've had one girlfriend before, she was never this needy for attention), constantly face-timing me and telling me how depressed she feels. She called her ex for a booty call twice (yes, he came both times). She told me about how he said that it would be better if they didn't talk to each other for a while. Of course, she was heartbroken but still tried to keep her cool about it. I kept being there for her, being the person who'd put his hand in the oven for people I care about. I listened to her, constantly told her how everything will get better even though she's in a bad place at the moment. I kept encouraging her, but eventually, this became a bit draining. I saw that some old feelings might come back because of all this attention, so I tried to initiate some boundaries. I asked her to at least ask if she could face-time me instead of randomly having my phone vibrate. Note - I really don't use my phone much, nor do I use a lot of social media. I might be young but I leave my phone on the shelf and forget about it for a day at times.

That's when stuff started going downhill. She started to call her ex randomly, at one point she called me at 2 AM to ask me if I could call him and see if he would answer my phone as he had blocked her number. I kept telling her that even though this would be hard for her, she'd be okay. I told her she had to respect his wishes even though she didn't like them. I was, again, still there for her. At that point she wanted to go see him so bad, she told me she'd go take a bus and walk to his house (4hrs walk from the bus station). After that, I told her to stop and write him a letter. She did. She sent it and told me she felt better because of some form of closure. I was happy for her and thought she finally made a small breakthrough.

The past few days she's been giving me more attention again. Today she told me she was feeling so bad she was gonna take a taxi to his house just to see him. I tried talking her out of it but her stubbornness is just too much to handle sometimes.

After telling this to my friends, one of them told me that she is so starved for attention and, me being hungry for affection as well (I'm the guy that had very few good friends over the course of my short life and didn't go out much, so I guess I know where he's coming from, I really do want some kind of affection now and again, but honestly I don't think it's THAT bad...), that she was using me for attention because I give it so freely.

She's one of the few friends who won't handle my bullsh\*t but still not judge me. She listens to me vent sometimes when I'm having a depressive episode and tries to get me to better myself. She tries to listen to my problems and wants to help me better myself. She isn't one of those ""only talk about themselves"" kind of people...her neediness has taken a toll on me though. Also since the breakup I've had plans to come and hang out but she gave me a raincheck twice, because she wanted to be alone, then went drinking with her other best friend who lives much closer to her (I live about an hour away by car).

My question for advice is...well, it's two things. One, how do I help her not make these stupid decisions. I'd still throw my hand into the oven for her but the things she does are overwhelming. And two - I need some objective thought into my friends' statements - is she just hungry for my attention because of the breakup or is she actually reaching out to me as her friend, as I'm there for her a LOT these past few weeks...  


TL;DR: My best female friend is still not over her breakup, my friends think she's just using me for attention. How do I handle both issues?",10Aug2020,1

My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about 5+ years ago. In her early stages she refused to see a doctor, and as it progressed she continued to refuse help and would even get violent. This means it progressed, rapidly. I never saw eye to eye with my grandmother, she was old fashioned, from a different time. Now her body isn't functioning as well and I'm told she will pass soon. I've never been one to grieve heavily because I believe in the fact that this is life, all things that begin must come to an end, and it's just how the world works. Everything has reason. 

My mother wants me to go in about 6-7 hours with her to the hospital so that I can say my goodbyes. I'm unsure if my grandmother will even recognize me at this point, and I'm definitely not sure what to do or say. Most of the time with a relative passing I've only known after the fact, never before. Much less in a situation like this.

Society here is just the same as it is anywhere else in the US. Just wanted to point that out before I explain what happened. In Alaska we have trails next to the highways and roads all over. I was at this part of a trail where it gets cut off and I was just trying to go to a gravel pit where people ride sometimes. I had to get off the trail and go on the road to get there but it wasn't that far I was only on the road for 2 minutes. A trooper saw me and I turned on his lights when he turned and followed me and the gravel pit was already right there. I didn't know what to do, I basically panicked so I turned around and went as fast as I possibly could. I went through a neighborhood and he chased me there until I found this bridge that curves to the left and I went between a rail and the trees and went down this gravel road and I saw him leave and turn his lights off. Later that night it was dark and I had to get home. My goggles on my helmet are tinted so I couldn't see very well. Again I I was on the road only because there was a small bridge with a creek under it and I couldn't go through the water so I went on that and just my luck the same trooper found me at that exact moment. Turned his lights on and began to chase me again and of course I panicked. I tried to go around a middle school to lose and I ended up doing just that. My house was half mile away I was on the gas going as fast as I could and I turned into my neighborhood and my was only the 2nd off that turn and of course a different one caught up to me and I had no choice but to pull over. My Dad came out and starting cussing the trooper out and he threatened to take him to jail too and he said ""no I'm not doing that"". He went back to the house and more came by and they arrested him and me. We got into different jail cells. I didn't even know that he got arrested until I got out. He got out sooner than I did. I spent 20 hours in that jail cell. They held me in there longer than they needed to. I went to a room where you talk to the judge on the computer because of covid. She said it could be up to 5 years of jail time. I hope I misunderstood that because I myself think that's a little too extreme over an 18 year old kid on a dirt bike.

383,"So this is a strange story.

I (21M) have been seeing the same thing at different times during the day for the past month or so. First time I was laying in bed, the next few was when I was at work and today was the fifth time I have seen it and I was in the shower when it happened. I noticed I am still able to move and stuff but not much. I am still aware of my surroundings but can’t really focus on them. However, I’m not really able to talk when I see these images. It’s similar to when I zone out, but I can actually move and I’m aware of my surroundings unlike when Im zoned out.

What I see is I am sitting in my college dorm lobby, I am playing Minecraft with some friends while other friends are across the room doing that stupid tick tock thing, when suddenly it turns 6:00P.M. and a random person shows up and after distracting the person behind the desk, they pull out a gun and shoot them in the back (they live) and turn around and randomly fire hitting my friend who was doing the tick tock thing in the chest killing him (every time I see it my friend stops turns around to the front desk to see what happened before he starts running but he gets shot before he is able to go far).

After seeing this I automatically get angry and attack the person who was shooting. I get shot multiple times before I get to the shooter (once in my left shoulder, once in my right arm, and finally the third one is random each time) but I eventually attack them, get them to the floor and kill them. I then either die or I get my wounds treated go to bed and wake up the most relaxed I have ever been. All that is the same stuff I see. 

There is other stuff I have seen that is different though; sometimes the shooter grazes other my other friends as they run away after the shooter kills the one friend. I have also seen how I attack and kill them. Sometimes I just straight up run at the person grab the gun wrestle it out of their hands and shoot them. Other times I beat them to death, other times what I do is worse than beating them to death. Sometimes I live and go get my wounds treated while others I also die after killing the shooter. The shooters gun is different sometimes too, most of the time it’s a pistol but it once changed to a rifle before going back to a pistol the next time I saw it happening.

But everything that stays the same is basically a shooter shows up at 6 and kills my friend and I kill them out of anger. It’s always at the same time, the same friend dies, I get shot in the same places (besides the third shot), and before the shooting happens I’m surrounded by the same people playing Minecraft.

I don’t know why I see this stuff but it worries me. I’m not a violent person and don’t play shooter games and I also have never hit anyone before. Every time I see it, it’s always so detailed and I don’t know why.

Am I going crazy or is this something that happens to other people as well?

I don’t know why this is happening and it just started randomly so if anyone knows how to make it stop please help.",10Aug2020,1
384,"Hi,
recently I've looked up online some dogs in shelters (mostly in foreign countries), who are searching for a home. Most of these dogs never had a real home, a real family or experienced real love. If I could, I would adopt like 30 or 40 or 50 of them and dedicate my whole life around them - so they can just be happy and get what they deserve. So but the reality is, I am a student, still living with my parents (who never wanted a dog - we got a cat, that's enough) and I've always wanted a dog. I got the capacity to give one dog a chance of a wonderful life. I got enough dedication, love for animals, time, money, room. So yeah, I started looking up dogs, some of them are even emergency cases because no one wants to adopt them. But I would. I would really want to adopt them all and I know that this will never be possible, there will always be dogs who suffer, never have a family or know how real love feels. And that brings me to tears, as stupid as it sounds. I have the opinion, that I should adopt a dog now, not only because I desperately want it, but because it would make the life of atleast one dog better. And yeah so I fantazise about adopting one specific dog (it's a fluffy big 8 year old boy, who never had a real family, but is cuddly and full of love) - I would even move out of my parents, to adopt him. I've thought about adopting him so much, that I would feel guilty, if I didn't. But it would be totally understandable if I couldn't adopt him, because my parents will probably be against it and it's hard to find an affordable flat in our area, which allows dogs. But it wouldn't be impossible. So yeah. I got time, money and I would even have enough room and that's an opportunity for the dog, to have a wonderful life - which he really deserves. But after all all dogs deserve this.
Ah I don't know, if I really need any advice, maybe I just want to cry like a baby haha, but I seriously want to adopt that dog... how can I not feel guilty (for the dog - who hasn't even seen me yet), if I can't adopt him in the end?",10Aug2020,1
385,"so first off, I ate frozen mangoes a few hours ago... Maybe 11pm? (Almost being 1am as I type this) and I took an 2 advil around the same time since my legs hurt (i’m a teen, so I’m still growing)

Just a few mins ago, my stomach hurt and I went to the bathroom and I had diarrhea. 

I googled it - It may be nothing. But apparently I should talk to a doctor “immediately” if I show any symptom out of like, 20. Those ones are the most common, then it shows less common, and rare symtoms which if I have one or more (i assume) I should go to a doctor. 

I’m feeling anxious now bcus theres this weird bubble on my hand. It’s super tiny, like, really small, and it’s the same color as my skin, but it never hurt until earlier today. I’m an overthinker and I can easily get paranoid so... Ik this might just be nothing since it usually is. But there are some situations where it isn’t nothing.

388,"Hello,

My fiancee (28F) and I (28M) have been together for almost 2 years, and we still haven't had penetration sex. My soon to be wife still has her hymen. Every time we're intimate, we do foreplay and enjoy it, but when I approach her vagina, she automatically, and perhaps unknowingly pushes me away. When I give her cunnilingus, or play with her clit, she enjoys it for a while, then asks me to stop. Aren't women supposed to have multiple orgasms?? When I ask her why stop, she tells me she's had her pleasure (although I suspect non-orgasmic) and her clit becomes too sensitive.

It's also hard to introduce any new positions in bed, as she feels really awkward about it... I've had to insist a lot on doing it doggy style, or getting a fellatio... I hate having had to insist, but it's just so frustrating...

We originally come from a country where it's generally frowned upon to have premarital sex, and it's especially so for women. I understand that, and it's why I'm patient as we have had a very slow, yet some progress in bed. I'm just afraid that once married, the situation wouldn't change, and it would endanger our sexual life.

She's been trying to get to see a gynecologist but haven't been successful yet. Which is really frustrating. 

My fiancee told me she never masturbated before, and she doesn't feel interested in doing so.

I'd appreciate your advice, especially if any ladies ever experienced this... My fiancee doesn't communicate well on this issue, and I feel frustration getting increasingly critical every day.

I want to say, this is probably the only issue we have, otherwise it is a blissful relationship.

I'd be happy to provide any additional information.

Best regards.",10Aug2020,1

391,"I have worked at my job for about 10months now

This summer we have been extremely understaffed and as a result I got thrown into a task that I had not done before. I got told to do what I can and ask if I needed help.

First week it was me and college 1. College 1 started to shove stuff over to me that I was not certain on how to preform so I asked alot of questions but in the end I started to get a hang of it. I got told I did really good

The week after it was me college 1 and 2. Same thing again but college 2 did the stuff with me, guiding me through questions that was a bit new but still letting me do all the work. She also started to let me take on stuff that I felt that I could manage myself while college 1 kept on pushing me outside my comfort zone. They even contacted my boss to tell him what a good job I was doing 

Last week both of these colleges went on Holliday and college 3 and 4 arrived - both are seniors. First thing that happens is that college 3 takes one of my tasks and makes it just before I make it, ending in both of us solving the same issue with different methods and creating a bit of chaos. Second thing that happens is that I make an error in an calculation. Before I make anything permanent I double check with the Costumer of I understood him correctly (which I didn't do) and I then contact college 4 that just takes the whole thing from me and does the whole thing herself. I have also asked them small questions but everytime I do that they just go ahead and makes the whole task for me, sending me links and equations and contact that I do already have 

After these incidents they are now not letting me do anything unless they explicitly tell me to do that task and that I send my results to them for check before I'm allowed to make it real.

Just this morning we were chatting and I told them I was working on solving a smaller issue, saying ""no worries, I'll probably find a solution soon. I just need a bit of time"". 5sec later college 3 send me the answer

I feel so small and unimportant. How can it be that I was doing a great job two weeks ago but now I'm not even allowed to look at the task list but only do stuff they send to me? I know I'm new and they know more then me but I still know stuff. I can still be helpful...

How do I deal with this?
What do I say to the others when they come back ""sorry, I'm no longer allowed into that list because College 3 and 4 took away my access"". 

I really like all my colleagues and I don't want to say anything bad about them but I'm also so discourage from doing anything now and I feel like they are going to tell my boss that I'm horrible",10Aug2020,1

394,"I don't know why my title is capitalising like that when it doesn't seem to for everyone else. For the record, I know some of those word shouldn't be capitalised!

Side note: This might be a little long. I talk a lot, and it's a weird situation with some weird details, and I feel like I need to back my weird anxieties up for you all.

I have a friend, Kennedy, who I met online about five years ago through discord. I have other online friends, but she's the only one I've gotten close with. I'd consider her a best friend at this point. We've never met in person, we don't even live on the same continent, or hemisphere actually, and we're not planning to meet at any point.

I'm a grad student studying marine biology. Of course I'm biased, but I think the field and my research is pretty cool. Without getting too specific, I study shark conservation, and how climate change is screwing up their hunting. The conservation bit is important.

When we first met, Kennedy told me she was a commerce student. Eventually, she transferred to a new school and switched to marketing. I don't know much about either of those, but I think they're pretty neat, too. Maybe a little boring, but I'm sure that's just because I don't know much about them. I mean, everything can be interesting if you give it an honest shot. She's the only student friend I have who isn't in the biological sciences. At least according to her, I guess.

A few years ago, Kennedy confessed that she had lied when we first met, and that she wasn't actually ever in school for commerce. She had just been working, but the other people on discord and I were all in school, so she said she was too. Neither of us talk to anyone from that server anymore, and she didn't expect that we'd be friends for so long. I understood where she was coming from. It didn't really change anything, even though she had spent a year lying about classes and exams and stuff, but I'm sure that sucked for her. I'd imagine telling me was a weight off. In any case, I wasn't upset by it.

Even before this, though, I had suspicions that she wasn't really in business? I know this sounds weird and paranoid, but hear me out. Like I said, I don't know anything, but I'm interested in learning more, so I ask her stuff about marketing (and commerce, at the time) sometimes. Not just because I think it could be cool, but because I nerd out about sharks a lot and I don't want her to feel, I don't know, left out? But she's always been vague about it, almost standoffish. She says it's boring, but I mean, I'm asking, so I'm clearly interested (also, why take a program of something you think is boring? Is that a thing?) Honestly, when she first confessed about the commerce thing, I expected it to be followed up with ""Also, I'm not really a marketing student now."" I was surprised when she didn't.

Later, she got an internship working for a company in something completely, 100% unrelated to marketing. Like, I know marketing is involved in everything, but there really wasn't any reason she'd be taken on there. Again, not being too specific.

Things get a little weirder here. I had told her stories about this kind of annoying guy Robbie in my marine ecology class. One of those people that has 150 questions, knows the answer to every question and doesn't give anyone else an opportunity to contribute, argues with the prof and other students about everything, etc. If you've been to university, you know the type- just doesn't know when to shut up, you know? Anyway, shortly after that, she sent me a screenshot of her tumblr, and out of curiosity I scrolled through the first few pages. There were tags about being a woman in STEM, as well as a post she had reblogged about annoying classmates and had tagged it ""Robbie in marine ecology"". I didn't mention it, because it was kinda weird I went to her tumblr. I haven't gone back since, but it stuck with me.

More and more, she started just sort of knowing conservation-related things that she didn't really have reason to know. Like, I know conservation is a super popular topic, and lots of people know at least a bit about it, but I'm talking about oddly specific theories and biological mechanisms and such that I wouldn't even know if I wasn't taught them in undergrad. It's not the sort of stuff you look up because you're curious, it's the gritty and kinda boring stuff you learn because you have to for a credit. I thought maybe she was taking an interest in what I was studying, but it was a little strange.

But when put together, it stood out enough that I did some more digging. Read: I googled her name lol. I found an article she had written for a semi-popular (pretty shitty) popsci site. It was related to marine biology, and she had talked about writing it for her internship. I'd even edited it for her. The article had a brief bio. It said she was a conservation student at her university. I asked her how that paper had gone with her job, and she said she didn't know and it hadn't been published. But it had. I mean, I was looking at it. But I let it go, and she later said that she was worried because they had mixed up her major with another guy at her job, and she was too nervous to correct them.

However, I also found her twitter account, and it's very obviously biology-oriented. Again, her bio says that she's a conservation student at her university. The thing is that her boyfriend, roommates, and some friends I know of follow her on there. She's either lying there or lying to me, right? And I feel like it's more likely that she's lying to me, because it'd be a lot harder to keep up that lie in real life. I mean, maybe she's done that because she thinks her job will see? She retweets them a lot. It seems like an easy thing to tell her friends that she's doing, I guess.

This all came to light a few months ago, and most of the time I don't think about it, and it honestly doesn't change much if it is the case. But sometimes (right now, clearly) it bothers me. And it's so strange. Like, it's such a weird thing to lie about? Why lie about something we have in common, and also say you're doing something that's less interesting- in my opinion, not to insult any business people out there! I wish I was capable of doing what you guys do. It sounds entirely terrifying to me, and a lot harder than whatever I'm doing.

I guess I'm just worried that if she's lied before, had the opportunity (a few times) to fess up to this, and didn't... you know, she could be lying about other stuff, right? And I don't love the idea of that. I'm not lying to her about anything. Maybe it's just another situation where it's gotten out of hand, I guess. I couldn't be *too* upset, but at the same time, this is a long time to lie, and a lot of lying on top of that. Like, she's told me about what classes she's taking (always vague here), her professors, assignments I've seen occasional screenshots of- stuff like that that makes me think she isn't lying, but if they are lies, they're pretty effortful ones, right? But why, though? But it just doesn't add up. Plus, this is someone I consider to be one of my best friends, I obviously don't want her to be lying to me.

One more thing, for the record: I feel weird as hell about having googled her at all, or gone to her tumblr. Like, I feel creepy, and I wish I hadn't done it. For more reasons than one.

So I guess I'm kind of lost. Am I being too suspicious, or do you think this stuff is weird too? Should I even bother bringing it up? How do I even bring that up to begin with? I'm absolutely terrible with confrontation, and so is she.

Thanks for reading all of this if you made it this far, and thanks in advance for any advice you have. Sorry it's a bit of a mess.",10Aug2020,1

397,"Hello. I’m a 27 (M). I moved back into my mom and step dads house about 5 years ago. When I came back home, my little brother and little sister were only 3 years old. As the years went by, I grew an attachment to them and now I have this huge fear of moving out of the house. It feels like if I move out, I’ll be leaving them behind (if that makes sense). They’re 8 years old now and whenever I think about moving out, I get major anxiety, and the first thoughts that come to mind is my younger siblings. 

Has anyone ever dealt with anything similar to this? The reason I’m asking is because I have an opportunity to move out of here in the next month or so and it’s starting to stress me out. The thing is I know moving out will be good for me in the long run, but I also love being around my family and where I would be moving is far away. 

Another reason I feel a lot of anxiety about this is because of the guilt I feel when it comes to my family and my siblings. I haven’t been the best big brother or son in general. I’ve made a lot of mistakes and didn’t learn from them and I hold myself accountable for everything I’ve done wrong. No excuses. But I will say this... I love my family very much and I always want to be a better person for them. 

This why it’s such a catch 22 because I know moving out would be great for mental health. But then part of me feels guilty because I haven’t been the best person to be my family and I want to continue to be here for them and help them out and make up for the things I’ve done. 

So again if anyone has been through anything similar and has any advice for me. I would be really grateful and thank you for any advice!",10Aug2020,1
398,"I (f28) have a strained relationship with my family (mum, dad and older sister). We have been somewhat close in the past but over the past year or two, I had a few realisations that some of their behaviours when I was younger had a very negative, lasting impact on me and they still do some of these things which have a negative impact on my life now. I recently communicated this to them in a long letter after barely speaking to them for 8 months and they have been very receptive to it and want to open up a dialogue to deal with it, each writing me a letter back. 

However, my family are polar opposites from me and my fiance in their political and social views and the way that they vote (they are right wing, don't want independence for our country and are a small part anti-LGBT whereas I am left wing, want independence and my fiance and I are part of the LGBT community) which makes it exceptionally difficult for me to respect them, have any conversation with them that isn't very, very charged, or even want them in my life sometimes. 

The problem I have though is that my fiance hates my family (understandably so, other than their political views, they have not been overly welcoming to him or his family) and he refuses to ever be part of their life which I can't blame him for. While I find some of the things they say offensive and the way the vote to be very frustrating, I have an overwhelming desire to fix the relationship because they are my family and they are sad without me and they miss me, so I feel bad. 

My fiance doesn't ever tell me what to do, he's not controlling, but the way he feels about my family is making the whole situation very difficult for me because I feel bad about trying to fix my relationship with them.

Tl;Dr my family are opposed to me and my faince on very important core values and political voting and my fiance doesn't like them at all and I feel very bad about trying to fix my relationship with them but also bad about not trying to fix my relationship with them and I'm not sure what to do.",10Aug2020,1

400,"hi reddit, this is probably a very private thing and some may consider it too private, but anyways I'm 14 and I live in Asia. My mother and my father are divorced, they split a long time ago. My father's job was an attorney and my mother's job was at Red Cross meaning they had to travel a lot, so my mom was rarely present in my childhood. I have an older brother, he's 21. When I was younger, my mom and dad were already on the verge of being separated. I lived in my Father's house, but because my mom wanted to separate I would always be shared by each parent, so during school days I was with my father because my school was the closest to his house and during weekends my mom would take me to her grandparents house, mind you they're very old so there's no way they could've known about this. My brother and I formed a sort of bond with each other. We used to play with each other's toys, go to places together with our mom and shit. But then my mom finally decided to leave my dad and that was when everything went to shit. It traumatized my brother because he wanted us to be a happy family. He got depression from that. I was way younger than him so I was very ignorant and my parents had to focus their attention on me. I guess he got jealous of me because he was the first grandchild my father's parents had so they spoiled him. It all started when I was with my grandparents house (mother side). My mom bought us a laptop and we had to take turns sharing it (2 hours each) well, it was already 5 hours and my brother was still using it. I wanted to play with the laptop but he refused and so I was a bit upset because mom said 2 hours each and that's when the first time he abused me. He slammed me on the bed and punched my stomach and my chest, it hurt a lot. He was smart, he beat me but not hard enough to bruise it so my parents wouldn't know. I was young at the time, so I thought it was normal that siblings did this. But it started happening frequently. I was crying because I was hungry and my grandparents weren't around at the time, he pulled me into a room and choked me. I tried my hardest to fight back, but when have you ever seen a grade 2 student win against a sophomore? One time I was angry at him because he stole my money that I saved up and I was about to tell my parents when he punched me and kicked me I wanted to scream but he covered my mouth and my nose. There were other instances of abuse but I don't wanna remember those events. Like I said, I thought it was normal that siblings did this, but as I got older I realized that this was absolutely fucked up. I told my parents about this when I was in 6th grade but they didn't even do anything. They excused it as ""it already happened"" ""it was in the past"". They basically took my brother's side because he had depression. Fast forward to now, and they expect me to take care of my brother (I live in my mother's house currently). The reason I wanted to get out of my Father's house currently was that I didn't like my brother. They excused it as being petty, and you know what maybe it is, but what do I know I'm just 14. They want me to forgive my brother when he's been an asshole to other family members as well. There was one time he yelled at a kid at MY bday party because the kid was ""being annoying"", he hates my aunt, and this is the most recent one and why he's even living with me in the first place was, he threatened to stab my father. I know this is just a threat and I shouldn't worry about it but I just can't stop being paranoid when I'm around him the abuse is all I remember, he tried to fucking kill me and it almost worked one time. I dont want  to be around him I'm scared of him, does his depression really excuse his actions? what do I do? because of him I have symptoms of anxiety and a bit of ptsd but I don't wanna self diagnose myself, I'm not that stupid but I do know that his actions really fucking scarred me to the bone. Anyways, I'm done, I'm sorry for this long ass thread, it's so pathetic.

She is really nice and we always blend together nicely. However on text she’s a totally different person. We used to FaceTime. (My mom said stop calling her if she’s not calling back). We eventually stopped texting each other frequently. One vacation she was asking to hang out with me so much I asked her if she liked me and she said no.

Physically, psychologically, and at the end, mildly sexually. The second time I was hospitalized was due to her. She is now falsely accusing me.

All this, compounded by a sexual assault in early June, has resulted in me being a fucking loser. No friends. Don't take care of myself. Dropped out and got re-admitted. Finally been able to hold down a job for longer than 3 months - working as a busser at a high end restaurant for 6 months. Spent a lot of time as a recluse, enduring my ex's abuse. Addicted to Reddit and YouTube, on my phone all day. No hobbies or attempts at self-improvement. By every meaning of the word, I've been a fucking loser. The worst is that after my sexual assault I developed a serious alcohol problem, and have blacked out 5 times in the past 2 months - having never blacked out in 7 years of alcohol use.

I'm starting to eat and sleep again and have already gained 5 pounds of healthy weight, from lifting heavy and eating like a normal person. I start school in 7 days and I'm excited to take my first class for my major, and to learn Spanish. 

The world beat me down and for a long time I fucking hated everything and wanted nothing but to die and to isolate myself completely. I spent 2 years doing nothing but being a fucking loser. Lost all my muscle mass that I am slowly regaining. Lost all my friends. Decided to take my hatred out for myself and the world by abusing drugs and alcohol.

I'm taking steps to recover, but - how do you not let the past haunt you? How do you forget every fuckup, every blackout, every stupid text, every 3 days spent in bed without eating, every night wasted. How do I clear my head of that, and more importantly - how do I make up the time?

Thank you,
Quinn from USA",10Aug2020,1
405,"The conversations I have with this man are in all ways platonic. We recommend each other music , books , we talk about our lives , share anecdotes , joke around and debate about all kinds of subjects , regarding ethics and different sorts of hypothetical questions -  he clearly stated that he is not interested in me in a sexual manner. I know what it is like to be manipulated , as I have been before. He does not put me in positions of guilt, nor does he ask me to do any sexual favors or anything illegal and immoral of that sort. He spends hours writing about his daily life , and things that have nothing to do with predatory actions. I know of his identity , and he knows of mines - he could reveal just as many things about me as I can reveal of him, and we both trust each other’s intentions (he even told me - « Let’s not be naive - there will always be a universal assumption that is not in our favor»).
 

2 days ago, my mother found out that I was talking to him. We got into a huge argument and I was so scared that I started getting sick and throwing up. It made me wonder if it is wrong that I am talking to him, and whether I should continue doing so. I would feel bad hiding things from my mother , but at the same time I really enjoy talking with this individual. I’m not sure what to do, I really feel lost. If she finds out of this again, i will be dead. Am I at fault for any of this ? what should I do, in such a circumstance ?

Thank you. I apologize if my question sounds idiotic.",10Aug2020,1
406,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I was hoping to get some guidance/advice. I just started my second semester at a Caribbean medical school and I’ve been feeling very anxious and unable to sleep for the past few nights. I think it stems a little from the fact that I lied to my friends and family about why I was dismissed from another Caribbean med school. I told everyone including my parents that I was dismissed because the school lost my records but I was actually dismissed for failing step 1 too many times. They think I’ve been working with a lawyer to fight the school this whole time, a lie I managed to keep up for 4 years. I’m scared I might fail again since I’m not doing too well in my classes right now. I’m worried about what to tell my friends and family if that happens. If I fail again I don’t know if I should try at another school or give up. I feel like I gave away most of my 20s (I’m 29) with nothing to show for it so it’s hard for me to just step away from this career path. I see all my friends with great jobs, getting married, having kids, buying houses, traveling to great places, basically just living their lives and here I am, almost 30, with no wife, no kids, no money, living with my parents, and probably won’t be able to buy a house for another 10 years at least. I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m at a crossroad. Please give me some guidance. Any advice would be appreciated.",10Aug2020,1
407,"I am 20 years old as of this year and I wonder when I will be able to take action on my own decisions. To this day I continue to be my family's daughter, where it's not safe to go out by myself, it's not safe to drive, to do this to do that. I have been stuck in my bedroom for the past 20 years, and I need permissions for every time I want to go out, every time I want to do something. ""We as a family work together as a family,"" but in the end mainly prioritises my father's schedule for our livelihood, to follow him to his workplaces or wait for him at home. Any other ambitions beyond his work seems to be unimportant and unsuccessful, but I'm so suffocated. I continue to be restrained for the sake of safety, in fear of the what ifs and what thens, fears implanted in me to inhibit me from moving forward. 

I tell them my worries, and they reply ""when did we ever stop you? we let you do things you want."" But when I begin making plans for my life there's always something new that comes up that I have to follow them. 

I'm so tired of being this puppet, that I need to follow them wherever, that I have no other route than the one they have for me. Things I want to do are always overshadowed by their reasons, that of course as the daughter I need to do what my parents want me to do as it is common sense and filial piety. That accepted internships are just mere shenanigans  of a girl that doesn't know anything of the world. That they provide me this college education solely for the benefit of the family business, like I have no other choice but the family business. I've lost my passion for this college life, this facade of false freedom to do whatever I want, that I'm just in an extended birdcage left for recess for a while.

But how else do I set free? I'm not allowed to go out unless my dad drives me, that I just add another thing to be worried about over all the stress that already exists. To reject accepted internships because of transportation troubles, that I have no other choice but to depend on them else I get hit or yelled at. Perhaps I really don't know anything about this world and how scary people can be, that we will only work in our self interests at heart. That someone will hurt me when I do something I want to do. To always question myself whether I'm merely being selfish for trying to do better for myself, to pity my parents that truly work so hard, and hole myself back into my room because it would be better if I didn't interrupt. But obviously it has done its mental toll on me. I feel like there is no outlet other than them, that my friends are of no help either, that I'm being rebellious, that I need to depend on someone to get out. 

How do I get out myself?",10Aug2020,1
408,"So, I may be a little stupid. I am 21 years old and I have been craving change, adventure. I reconnected with a very old friend from high school who I knew maybe 4-5 years ago at New Years this year. He invited me to come to the coast where he lived and he would show me around. I was actually quite intrigued by this so I took him up on it. Oh, and I invited my brother (18) with me.

Part of this is my fault because I did virtually no background research and just went with what he said, thinking everything would be alright since we were friends in high school.

Today I drove 14 hours to the coast. We woke up early and drove non-stop to get there in time. We arrived late at night, to which we found that his apartment was a literal crack house. He had several people sleeping on couches, trash and drugs everywhere and clothes laying about. It smelled horrible and there was literally raccoons in the trash outside.

We were to sleep on a mattress beside his own on the floor with rotting food and other trash everywhere on the floor and beds themselves. My brother and I lay for 10 minutes before we decide to find the cheapest motel and get out. We tell him we can't sleep and we bail. It's about 2am right now. I'm sleeping in a terrible dorm motel/hostel with someone else in the same room as us. 

We were supposed to be here for a week. It's not even a day we have been here and we have no clue what to do. We planned to do hikes, but that was hinging on the likelyhood that my friend would have a normal livable household. We are so far from home and don't want to do a massive roadtrip again tomorrow. 

We want to somehow make this trip worthwhile. Anything to save it. We have limited funds and have little knowledge of the area.",10Aug2020,1
410,"So my boyfriend(19 m) and I(18 f)are long distance usually but I’m visiting for about two months staying at his parents house with him. It’s been about a week and things have been great I’ve been helping his mom with some accounting stuff while he’s at work. His parents are very private people and don’t talk much about personal stuff so I haven’t gotten very comfortable with them yet.

Usually she knocks and waits a second before coming into our room but we’ve always been decent when she comes in so she’s gotten more comfortable coming in I guess.

So last night we were watching a show and it was so hot in his room and it was about 8/8:30 pm so I took my clothes off and was just laying on my belly on top of the blanket watching the tv. My bf was just in his boxers as well and he was sitting up right. His mom came up to the door and said his name and he just blindly said yeah not realizing I was only in a thong. Somehow I was so sucked into the show I barely realized either until she came in and looked at me. I had no idea what to do so I just stayed in the position I was in and stared back at her. She set down his sheets she was bringing in and just said “whoo it’s hot in here isn’t it?” and walked out. It was so so awkward and I was so fucking mortified. 

I still am it’s almost 10 am now and I am avoiding her and my boyfriends at work. There’s no way either of us are gonna mention it I just need a way to feel less embarrassed before seeing her.

412,"So with the lovely coronavirus going on, my wife and I, like everyone else, eloped and are having the big wedding next year. The issue lies with my stepbrother, who is autistic. I have absolutely no issue with his autism, in fact my wife and I are constantly trying to include him in everything and make sure he just gets treated like anyone else. I don't look at him and just see autism. But he's very low functioning, which is no fault of his own, but moreso his parents fault. My step dad doesn't do anything with him, constantly just leaves him at home to watch ESPN. Has made 0 attempt to get him involved in sports, summer programs, a job, NOTHING. And it annoys my wife and I, also the rest of my family, to no end. We all went to the lake and he got left at home because my step dad wanted to fish in peace. It's sad and I kind of hate him a bit for it. 

But because he gets no attention from his dad, he has seemed to latch onto my wife for attention. Constantly yelling her name, following her, just yelling towards her in general. Not to mention he was never really taught how to eat, so it's generally a mess. He's never corrected or taught how to do anything. I would almost equate it to letting a toddler just roam free and do what they want. Again, it's horrible and he's 19 at this point so I'm not sure what more can be done to help. Whenever we're all out, responsibility seems to fall on me and my wife, my step dad is too busy drinking, talking with anyone but his son, to say anything or just spend time with him. My mom has been trying to help the last 6 years but she's exhausted and tired of fighting a losing battle. 

But knowing how little to no discipline there is, we're both weary about him being at our wedding. It's supposed to be our day of happiness and just spending time with family/friends and celebrating and neither of us wants to babysit. Which is what we both fear what will happen. Are we in the wrong for not wanting him there? Or is there a better way to approach this with my parents? I've tried laying everything out for them and they both get offended and act like we're the worst people on the planet. But my stepdad only includes him when it looks good to the public, and I don't think our wedding is an appropriate place for you to try and be a perfect dad.

417,"I’m a 23 year old woman who recently moved back home. Growing up I studied in 4 different schools because of my dad’s job and I’ve always found it difficult to get acquainted to people quickly. I’m quite introverted by nature and I don’t like spending time with people outside, unless I really enjoy their company. 

I’ve made a few friends over the years, most of them in college, but now that we’re out of college and not in frequent contact anymore, I feel like I’m able to see through how shallow our friendships really were. 

Although I trusted them completely I feel like I haven’t received the same level of sincerity from their side. For instance, whenever they go through personal issues, I’m happy to listen to their problems but when it is my turn to vent it out, they’ll judge me for my problems or they’ll altogether be absent.

I have been in a really loving relationship, for the past two years, but even then sometimes I feel like I can’t trust my boyfriend and that he’s trying to manipulate me. My parents are loving too, but they’re mostly detached because they have a lot of personal problems. 

For the past two years I haven’t had anything good going on in my life. I’ve gone from failure to failure trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. My friends on the other hand seem to be doing really well, moving to different countries, finishing their masters, getting good jobs etc. And I get that some of them might be putting it on for a show, but what I don’t understand is why they feel the need to fake it with me. So whenever I talk to them I joke about how there’s nothing much going on in my life and their responses make me feel like they do not have any respect for me because I’m not doing as well as them. 

It hurts me, because I feel like I have no one who genuinely cares for me. And even if there is someone, I feel like they’re trying to get something from me. And even though I have met new people, it’s so difficult for me to go beyond the surface level interaction and get to know them better as individuals. I don’t know if it’s something about me that pushes people away. 

Something good that has happened to me recently is that I have been accepted into a Masters program at a really good university. And I feel like when I break the news to my friends, no one will be genuinely happy for me.",10Aug2020,1

I have been browsing FDS and I honestly think that for a college student Im ""high- value"" but the intrinsic evidence (my romance life) suggests the opposite. I am constantly reminded that the greatest marker of a man's value is his sexual prowess. High Value Men have high sexual prospects, ergo I am a Low Value Man, despite how damn hard I've been trying for so long. 

I am saving up for an escort, but I have a feeling that my luck will make it impossible for me to get what I want. I have resolved that if I don't lose my virginity before my 21st birthday I will kill myself. Because a 20 year old virgin is a ""late bloomer"" whereas a 21 year old virgin is a guaranteed incel- loser, and I can't say ""I'm saving myself for the right one"" because I know that I would throw myself to any hot girl who gave me a chance. 

I know my suicide- pact seems drastic. I don't honestly think I'll do it, but I cannot live with the shame. I have come to realize virgins are truly the lowest of the low in terms of societal value. I think virgins are even lower than rapists: because rapists at least have the power/ value necessary to get what they want- unlike me. Dw I won't rape a girl, I'm a ""nice guy"". I wish I wasn't tough, if I was stronger maybe more women would be attracted to me.

I have truly given up hope that I'll ever find a partner, and that's okay; I've been forced to be okay with being alone for almost all of my life. Now I just need sex to prove that I have value. I just needed to get this off my chest and maybe talk to someone",10Aug2020,1

428,"**TL;DR;**

I'm a 18M and I have been born with red hair. My dad left my mom and later abused me emotionally and physically. I have no contact with him.

I was bullied from my 7th to 12th, didn't have friends after a year.

I found some friends with gaming but my mom marked that as addiction and I couldn't see them a lot.

Later found a friend but he was only friends because he felt bad. Next year I found my best friend. Everything went well but after 1.5 year I was again bullied a bit by my friend group at the time. The kind of split up and me and my best friend became a small single group.

Next year I went to a school did the study really expedited and switched classes every month. Next year again different school was better but then covid hit.

View Closing paragraph for the end.

**Introduction**

First I would like to introduce myself. This is not my primary reddit account. I'm a 18 year old male. I was born with red hair, not bright red but more to the brown side. But you can in normal conditions, you can clearly see that it is red (this is important for later). I also don't live in the US but in a country in the EU. I try to use the US terms like high school etc... I'll try to tell my story in chronological order.

This all started when I saw the following instagram post: Links don't work. ""It was a girl crying and telling that you should never cheat on someone while in a relationship, people deserve to be loved and not their heart ripped out"".

Lately I have been very emotional, about small things. But this could be due to stress of me recent exam. (that was 1 week ago) imminently after my exam I went on vacation (with friends of my brother and my brother). Today I got back from vacation and saw the instagram post and imminently I bursted in tears.

My dad left my mom when I was 4\~5 years old. He abused me and my brother emotionally and physically for a a bit less than a year and then I never wanted to see him again and I told my mom. I have no contact with him since then.

I'm being randomly was called ""ginger"". This can be by people shouting to me from across the street or a classmate trying to be funny. This happens about once a week. Also I feel like wherever I go people are looking at me. (My friend confirmed this about a year ago, that he also notices if he is with me).

In middle school I have been bullied from my 8th to my 12th. I was bullied by someone that got into our class when I was 7. This bullying consisted of the following:

* Purposefully sabotaging my work
* Getting rejected at every group assignment
* Saying I was ugly, fat, a ginger, had no friends
* Doing everything in their power to shut me out of every group They even wen't as far as breaking me and my GF up (remember I was pretty young at the time, but it was really devastating). I later found out that she was also (a bit) bullied by them but her friends protected her.

I have been playing games for a long time, and I have met a lot of people on the internet. This has been going on for a long time. I always play with friends. I think I was around 9 when I started playing games. A lot, but always with friends. After about a year my mom forced me (after many fights) to go to a clinic for game addicts. And it is true that I was playing a lot but it was my only time to feel accepted. But I had to stop with that due to promises I made to my mom. (Which was 1/2 a hour a day gaming and in weekends 1 hour).

But then I wen't to high school (high school starts @ 7th grade and everything went pretty normal, I couldn't connect to anyone because I simply didn't know how. And it also didn't help that I got Pfeiffer's disease and was at home for 3 weeks. Then I got a friend who was just friends with me because he felt bad for me. I found out about a year later. And again was on my own for half a year. But then I met my current best friend. He is the only one I really connected to and could have fun with. I think I will them him soon my whole story soon and ask him a couple of questions. I had been socialising more since the 8th grade and everything wen't well. But then in the 8th grade everything changed again. My friend group (including my best friend) where shutting me out. The instigator of this behaviour bragged about having a ""Fuck Insert My Name"" WhatsApp group chat. And I totally lost it. It felt like I was back on square one. I told my teachers and then had a chat with the instigator and their parents. The other participants where also punished a bit but they where nice to me, I also told the teachers that. And yes, one of the participants was my best friend. The next year went great and passed my final exams and graduated (this was 10th grade and it is normal in my country due to different levels of education).

The next school was great to go to. The only problem is that It turns out that the study I'm eligible is way below my skill level. I did this 4 year study in a single year. The downside is that I had to switch classes every month or so. And I didn't go to school for half of the year because I had to do internships. Where I only socialised with adults. I couldn't really make new friends.

The next year I went to a University Of Applied Sciences where I met a lot of great people. I had a lot of dispensation for courses so I wasn't there half of the time. And then COVID-19 hit and the other half of the year had to be done @ home.

**Closing**

And then we are back at where I'm now.

As a result of the previous

* I have a fear of commitment to any relationship
* I have social anxiety, *but this is getting better*
* When I walk past strangers (this can be i.e. in the bus, on the street) I have a fear of being judged and sometimes I get tears in my eyes because of it.

I have seen some other videos on instagram where people tell that they are grateful that they have someone they can really talk to. The only one I can talk to is my Best Friend. But not about this. I don't feel comfortable. I don't have the best relationship with my mother, this is due to some excessive fights we had in the best, and sometimes still have.

I just don't know what to do anymore.",10Aug2020,1

430,"Honest advice on potential treatments please 

I’m an 18 year old male. 

Over the last year or so my hair on the front has receded slightly. This may be a mature hairline but I’m not sure. 

On my crown I have one thin spot from when I used to pull out hair, I think it’s gotten thinner. 

All over the top of my head I have lines of thin hair which appear when my hair is moved a certain direction. 

The whole idea of treatment that me a bit mixed. 

I’m very self conscious about my hair. I’m working with a therapist and aim to try and remove all emotional charge from it. I want it to be just another part of me. 

My main fear is that girls won’t find me attractive because of it and that I’ll be judged heavily for it over other aspects of me. Because of my age I feel like an outsider. 

I don’t know whether this is where it’ll stop or not. No one in my family went bald and most only experienced the same hair loss that most men get with age. Some thinning and receding but not before age of 50. 

I don’t want my happiness to depend on me taking expensive drugs every day, but then I also don’t feel happy with my hair atm. 

The drugs are expensive. I could afford them but given you take them forever it’s a heavy investment. 

I’d like honest opinions from people who have gone through what I have. In a perfect world I’d be able to reach a point where my hair doesn’t affect me, and if it reaches a point where I need to shave it off I can do so without worry etc. However, the process is very hard and I don’t know whether it’s better the take the route of treatment. 

My brain tells me it’s better to stick the long road and work on becoming happy with myself, as that will benefit me more over time and won’t be dependent on drugs. There is also a part of me that wants to spend the money and have full hair as possible for idk how long. I’m just so conflicted. 

Any advice",10Aug2020,1
431,"I use rent a room in a house, but moved out July 1st. I asked my landlord about getting my security deposit back, and he said I should get the check 30 days after the utility bill came in. (I’m assuming so he can deduct what I owe for June). I text him since it’s been 30 days since I moved out, but he said he just got the utility bill. (Which technically means I’d have to wait 30 days from now). If he just got some portion June’s utility bill, that means the billing cycle has to start toward the end of month, right? 

I can’t tell if he’s holding out on me or if this is a normal thing that happens. He said I should the check ‘probably this week’) and now the week is over. I feel awkward about bugging him about it and I only want to be pushy if I know his excuses are bs.

432,I'm (21F) a full time University student and was working as a part time copywriter for a media firm. Today I got dismissed because my boss (he told me) hasn't been happy with my writing for a while. Honestly I am still in shock and feel like this is the biggest failure of my life. Ive never had the best self esteem and I'm so disappointed in myself. Just looking for advice on how to get back up on my feet and deal with these emotions?,10Aug2020,1
433,"I am from Canada, my husband is from israel. We live in israel although we were in Canada when the pandemic started (for 3 months). We got back here two months ago and since getting back the numbers here have sky rocketed. We are now the worst country per capita for how quickly it’s spreading. Yet.... everyone keeps getting together in groups without masks, dinners, parties, beach, etc etc etc. daycares are in full effect and everyone working. There are 30,000 active cases, 2,000 new a day. Masks are mandatory everywhere but NO one stands two meters from you and everyone still hugging and kissing... like everyone.

I have a kn almost 2 year old son and I am 30. I am borderline OCD from the virus and had previous issue with anxiety... I also have Liden factor 5 making me prone to blood clotting (my dad had it and died from a stroke at 52).

I am SO AFRAID of getting covid and not being able to take care of my child (I’m with him 24/7..he won’t sleep unless I’m there, he’s very attached) or that I’ll get sick and he in the hospital or much worse.

A month ago when it started getting bad again here I told my husband I didn’t feel safe seeing his family for now. He had 3 brothers all in the army and his parents still hug and kiss people, DONT wipe down groceries, they touch doors, elevator buttons etc and don’t sanitize right away. I feel like their phones have never been sanitized...

So this started a huge fight with my husband. He could bare the idea of only seeing them in social distancing way. His parent said they understood but they continued to get too close, high five my son, hand him things, get their face too close.... I tried ignoring it though I was digging my nails into my arms in anger. 

TODAY we went to their house where we were only going to be outside, I had mask on the whole time.. they continued getting too close but nothing out of the norm and then as we were leaving THEY FUCKING KISSED MY SON when they know I am NOT OKAY WITH IT!! 

I feel sick. Like I’ve just exposed him and myself to hundreds of people... I have been being so careful and now I’m freaking out. 

I want to go back to Canada because here is my worst nightmare. I’m stuck at home all the tome because the few times I’ve tried going out, people have completely ignored my rules and fucking disrespected me! Now I feel I have no choice after being ignored and disrespected this many times, to go. In Canada people actually keep distance WITHOUT ASKING!! And here they deliberately go against what you say! I’m so tired of it. They all think I need therapy because I’m over reacting. My husband keeps pushing me to go out because it “will be good for me” when I’m fact it’s physically damaging me from the extreme level of stress it’s putting on me. 

Israel has 30,000 active cases vs Canada has 6,000.... Canada is also the second biggest country in the world... Israel is the size of NJ!! 

If I go, my marriage will be on the rocks EVEN MORE THAN IT IS NOW, but at least I’ll have some peace of mind and stress free life....

What do I do? The virus isn’t going away... it’s only getting worse here..",10Aug2020,1
434,"TL:DR I was written up for operating under the guide lines the same co store manager(CSM) set for me, and would like some advice on how to frame my complaint. 

       Hello, beautiful people of reddit. I come to you a humble but severely inexperienced man(20). I ask simply for you to lend me your wisdom, as the ones close to me also lack insight. before I get into the events that inspired this post it is important to understand previous events that directly contributed to today’s debacle. I apologize for this posts considerable bulk in advance I just like to be thorough. 

      I work at a Walmart. I am what is called a cap 2 associate and I am apart of the truck crew(the 4 people who unload the merchandise off the truck and sort it for other cap 2 associates to stock). I work the single truck we get every day. Every so often a CSM(Co-manager) will sit in and “motivate us” to finish faster. On one such day I was told by let’s call her, CSMX to put a large pallet(large being taller than your average man and square shape with the side lengths being about the size of a bathtub) of merchandise in a walk way where we would have to be pulling(with a jack) other large pallets. I told her that I did not think this was a good idea and explained to her that we would have to be working there and it would be directly in the way. She told me to do as I was told. Which prompted(regrettably) the response of “I do not agree with you, but you’re the boss so I will put it here.” After which upon completion of the unloading and sorting of the truck, I was pulled into the administrator office by her. There I was told i am to follow orders and not ask questions.( she used the phrase “follow orders and not question them” no less then 4 separate times) I was also told that It was disrespectful to question an “order” in front of other employees. I apologized to her and explained that I worked in the construction industry my whole life before retail and I had no inclination that that statement could be considered inappropriate at work. As anyone who has worked construction knows it’s almost always a collaboration of minds and bodies to complete the daily job. She then gave me some guidelines that consisted of three main points. 1.) when a superior gives me an instruction it is to be carried out without question. 2.) i am not to challenge in anyway a superior in front of other employees. 3.) i am not to reason with my work, I am to do what I am told, no less and no more. This happened about three weeks ago (19 days) 

      
       Today when I arrived to work it became apparent to me today was one of the days that a CSM would sit in with the truck crew. I go to prepare the loading station for the truck. This is not an official duty but as I am the only employee who is working the truck everyday, i am the most skilled worker in my store regarding unloading and sorting. Consequently I usually set it up as other employees are rotated in and some have little experience on the truck crew. This consists of ensuring there is a pallet(s) for all the non grocery merchandise and it is zoned accordingly, ensuring there is enough grocery carts for the grocery merchandise, ensuring all associates know their job and there zones. The freight comes through a sorter and along a conveyer belt where it is then sorted into a lane by department autonomously. When a lane becomes full the sorter makes an announcement “lane X full” Today I immediately became aware of the fact that there was a severe shortage of pallets and carts alike. I made CSMX aware of this and asked for more pallets. She told me to make due with what I had(other pallets were available and I offered to go personally retrieve them). I then did not question this order as I was in front of other employees and also was given an order by a superior, just as she mandated I do. We then proceeded to start the truck and about 1400/3000 individual pieces of freight into the truck. The grocery carts I was working had completely filled up. Causing me to leave the freight in the grocery lane of the sorter. At about 1600/3000 she told me to pay attention to the grocery lane and clear it, at which point I informed her that I had no where to put the freight. She ignored this statement, and told me that the line cannot stop because the grocery lane is full. So again without question I stopped sorting the grocery freight and starting loading it into any available cart with space.(this freight is usually sorted by aisle to easier be stocked) at about 2000/3000 i was now completely out of room having no space to put any grocery freight into. Now without option I left in in the lane. She scolded me for the sorter announcing that the grocery lane was full twice more and ignored my attempts at informing her that was the only option without additional carts or pallets. Then at about 2600/3000 when the grocery lane had been at max capacity for over 25 minutes, she told me that I was now allowed to add pallets, for the remainder of the truck the machine did not make an announcement of any kind for the lanes I was responsible for, as once I am granted the space I need I am very skilled at my job. Then the truck concluded and I thought nothing of what had happened because this is typical behavior for her and it usually does not particularly bother me. Until about 5 hours later when I was summoned over the intercom to the admin office, upon arrival I was greeted by three managers of varied rankings the highest ranking being CSMX. She informed me I was being written up for decreased productivity. I assured her this must be some kind of mistake, for since I permanently joined the truck crew the time till completion has dropped an entire hour when I am on shift. She then informed me that I was to not interrupt her and that I was being disrespectful during the completion of the truck as I continuously refused to clear the grocery line, and that I should have put the freight on the floor(something against store policy). I tried to inform her that this was only because of the lack of space I was allowed and reminded her that I asked for more pallets and told her it was going to be a problem before the sorter had even been turned on. Again I was told to not interrupt her. She then after being combative asked me why she sorted more freight then me today. I told her I believed that was an exaggeration as I sorted over 1000 boxes that day and she sorted somewhere around 10. She told me I was again being disrespectful for disagreeing with her. At this point I stopped trying to explain myself and just let her give me this write up. This entire time I was being very submissive was not challenging her in anyway and even stated I do not mean to sound argumentative. 

Upon completion of this meeting the two lower ranking managers approached me and said that I should approach the store manager, and talk to him about this. So now here is my question, how do I frame this conversation with my store manager without coming across as a salty employee who’s upset he got in trouble? Thank you so much for your time and effort.",10Aug2020,1

448,"Throwaway account because my friends know my actual account, and obviously, this is a personal topic.

For some background, I was in a pretty healthy relationship until my partner broke it off pretty randomly. I had taken it to heart and it made me totally disinterested in people. Even so, I made a move to try and get with a girl two months or so after the fact when I had moved on and was turned down. 
No big deal, I was mostly just attempting. But my ex had came around and asked if I wanted to talk things over. Being naive to how I felt, I agreed and we went on a few dates.
Sex was okay. I wanted to initiate it a few times but was mostly ignored afterwards and was kinda just pushed away. Angry and fed up, I sat back and thought about my next move when my partner asked for a open relationship. She had ignored pretty much how I felt and this acted as a slap in the face.!I was totally caught off guard and angrier then I probably should of been. I broke it off not long after, and I took it very personally. 
I guess you could say I’m still pretty affected by it. It weighs down on me. I have tried exploring a little bit because I thought I might be a different sexual orientation, but it’s just turning out that sex is more and more disgusting. I mean, sure, it feels good, but I’m just uninterested. Most people are not really attractive and I have given it a shot and nothing. It’s not like I don’t think people are cute, but most of the time, when sex is brought up in my mind, I’m repulsed because of my last relationship, and I’m incredibly uncomfortable.

451,"I (18F) have known my friend (17F) for about 2ish years, completely online because we live very far apart but we have talked pretty much everyday since we met and have shared basically everything in our lives.

She is very depressed and has many other issues as well as being in a very emotionally abusive family situation, i made the mistake of deciding to be someone she could always rely on and thinking that i could bring her through her depression, i didn't understand that you have to help yourself with you own depression the most, and that people can be there to support you but that is all. because of my mistake we slowly descended into a very dependant relationship where because i am maybe the one person in her life who doesn't judge her and who she trusts. she has extreme abandonment issues and that makes it really hard for her to not panic when i don't message for like a day or makes her think i hate her and obviously that is very draining on me.

One thing i want to highlight is that this is not a one sided toxic relationship, i have been a complete dick to her because i tend to bottle things up to try and help her and then we argue and shit just isn't good at all between us even though sometimes we are completely normal. 

Anyways a couple days ago i decided that i believe that we are probably best off without each other, she will take a long time to be okay though because of her dependancy on me and because of how much we have known each other, it isn't easy for me either but that isn't the point. i told her this and she broke down and begged me not to go, she wants us to like try again but the problem is we have had this conversation before and tried to be better before and it doesn't work so i stood my ground. she stopped messaging for a a couple days and then yesterday messaged me again and is begging me to come back. 

I still care about her and it is really hard for me to keep telling her no, i am not coming back because i can see how bad it is for her but i can't be her person anymore and i think that after a while she will be better without me but i don't know how i should handle this situation.

So if anyone can give me some advice on this situation please do? also i really don't want to block her because i don't really like how that works but we just keep having the same conversation all the time so i don't really know how to properly stop us talking.

460,"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum that will result in us breaking up

Me(16M) and my gf(16F) have been dating for about a year and a half. She has severe depression. This was known from her diagnosis when we were 7 months in the relationship. As time went on in our relationship she started cutting on and off. She has a therapist now, but my gf has now convinced the therapist she isn’t suicide and self harming, but she is. Tonight she said “don’t worry *my name*, you won’t have to worry about me anymore in a few days.” This scared the crap out of me, but she has said this stuff in the past too. She’s not emotionally abusive or anything, and I do really love her. 

Here comes the part where I’m unsure if I’m right: Tonight, after our conversation, her repeatedly saying that I don’t need to worry about her, and her telling me she’s fine( especially that tonight she cut 6 times behind my back and then started doing it in the call) I worked up the effort to tell my gf to tell her therapist everything about her on Tuesday( the next therapist appointment ) or else I’d break up with her.

Ive worked dead end job after dead end job and I feel like im stuck. I know ive my full life a head of me but I often get very suicidal thinking about how helpless i am and my inability to get any where. I really need a plan to sort my life but I dont know where to start. Ive tried college but was unable to finish because my job overlapped with it.

So ive (19F) been seeing this guy (21M) for 3-5 months (depending where youd start counting) and I feel so much for him, but over the past couple weeks he has gotten really busy with work, studying etc, and thats completley fine! I totally get it and i support him anyway i can, motivation and stuff like that. We havent seen each other for about 3 weeks now, and I miss him alot, and i want to tell him that but i dont want to annoy him cause he has alot on his plate and i dont want to be another thing that needs taking care of. 
We used to text alot too, he would talk to me just randomly during the day but now he only really texts me late at night (i dont text him first much lately cause i dont want to bother him) when im about to sleep so i stay up later to talk to him a little before he gets busy again or sleeps aswell.
I guess i am just insecur about his feelings toward me cause its been a while since seeing him. I worry about everything so im probably just overthinking about it like everything else.
Does anyone else feel like this? I feel so stupid overthinking my overthinking, is ridiculous and emotionally tiring.
Thanks to r/advice for giving me a place to vent a little and get my thoughts sorted.",10Aug2020,1

So my (ex) boyfriend and I have been having a few fights lately, and we both have been feeling alittle insecure with eachother, so the other day he suggested that we go bowling together (I was excited because we don’t usually do stuff like that together) but when the day came to go bowling, he wasn’t clear to me if we where going or not, so I ended up just asking other friends to go with me, 
So when he found out I went bowling he flipped out, saying that I ditched him and that it was equivalent to cheating (he was upset mostly because he suggested it, but then I went and did it with other people) so he broke up with me (but is still hanging around me etc) but his still pretty upset, I know I hurt his feelings but I don’t know what to do now?

474,"This is going to sound weird but uh- it gets weirder ig     
I'm a lesbian. Me and my dad are both VERY liberal. I know he would accept me, I really do but I just have a few concerns.    
A) I have mostly female friends when it comes to real life, I'm scared he wouldn't let them come over or make me keep the door open. He's never done anything like that (I'm pretty sure he knows anyway, will explain later, but if he just didn't want to assume it seems like coming out would be the way to trigger this)  B) The rest of the family is very conservative and I'm worried he wouldn't see a reason to hide it. I love my family but I'm not sure how they feel about LGBTQ (I know they support Trump so I can only assume they don't feel great about it) C) He might say I'm too young. Very unlikely but still. D) I'm not sure how exactly he would respond, I can only assume it would be awkward.  E) I'm in the yee-haw part of the US. That can't go well.   
Anyway, as stated in A I think he already knows.     
For YEARS (even back when I thought I was straight) He wouldn't ask if I had crushes on any of guy friends and wasn't really concerned about me hanging out with them. Simple but I know my friends were interrogated by their fathers when they had guy friends.    
Also, if someone we saw in public (Cashier, Waitress, etc.) Was LGBTQ (After we left of course) He would point it out to me. Not in a rude way, just like a- ""Oh hey, our waitress had a girlfriend!""    
He always talks about LGBTQ forums that I'm supposedly on (I am, but he shouldn't know that). The other day we were talking about the LGBTQ Panic defense laws and he says ""Did you hear about this on all of those LGBTQ forums?"" I said ""What makes you think I'm on those?"" he didn't reply.     
He's also on a lot of social media platforms. including Reddit. (Dad, if you're seeing this, Hi.) He keeps up with the memes and all. I don't exactly hide my 'lesbian' behavior (I am a walking stereotype) so I can only assume he has caught on to that.     
And this is the weird part, I know it is quite silly but I had this dream (told yall) where my stepmom was asking me to do something but I couldn't hear her so I said ""what?"" They assumed it was that I was confused about what I was meant to do so they tried to explain. Something about a box in the garden. I didn't do whatever the hell they were asking me to do cause I had no clue what it was. Later he calls me into the computer room and he's playing a game. He continues to play it and goes ""Op, are you gay?"" So I said ""Actually, yeah. I am."" He says ""Ah, that's why we wanted you to put your love interest in the box. We had a suspicion."" (Great choice of words, I know)

475,First and foremost I'm her child. Not her friend. My entire life I've never had a mother. Not a normal one. She's not like other mothers. I've never had that. All she does is drag me everywhere when she's bored. When I clearly said no. But she doesn't take no for an answer. All I hear about is her complaining about every single thing. I literally get depressed when I'm around her because she's always telling me shit I don't want to hear about. I wish she'd stop. You have no idea how my mother has single handedly fucked up my mental health. I'm not even allowed to say no or complain. I must just take it. It's so unfair. She doesn't treat my siblings like this but that's because they escaped her and now I'm stuck with her. I wish she would get a life and stop interfering in mine. I'm so tired of her.

478,"I have really bad anxiety when I buy things mostly online. I think most people experience this when buying online at some point but mine is really bad.

Most posts I’ve ever seen about people with purchase anxiety or buyer’s remorse is always about big purchases like buying a car, house or « luxury » product etc or articles advising websites how to reduce customers feeling purchase anxiety on their website and stuff like that. However, when I buy anything no matter the price I will start to breakdown a few minutes later. I’m not even financially independent, have ever struggled with money or have to worry about money right now because I still live with my parents so I have no idea why I get the anxiety that I do after buying something with my own money.

I once bought a pair of earrings for only €6 from Etsy and immediately after I started feeling anxious which got worse a few minutes later. After about 10 minutes I immediately contacted the seller begging for a refund whilst I was panicking and crying which is really embarrassing to admit. I have no idea why I feel this immense anxiety and panic because I wanted to buy the earrings and they were only €6 so it’s not like it was a massive loss or anything and once I received them I was fine.

483," I am an 18 year old boy who grew up with both my father and my grandfather as construction workers, so my whole life I've practically been groomed to continue on the tradition. I love to work and get my hands dirty, I have experience running equipment and doing all sorts of manual labor along with equipment work. My whole life all I pretty much have known is construction, as well as agriculture, growing up in a small town in Connecticut, USA. I thought that I would want to spend my whole life working in construction, but recently I've become rather disillusioned with construction, which is even more of a problem because I am about to start college majoring in civil engineering. Now, I don't know for sure that I want to call it quits on construction, but I certainly have realized that I don't really enjoy it as much as I thought I did. I think the reason I stuck with construction was because it was a sort of safety net for me, it wasn't a dream career of mine, it was something that I knew I'd be safe with and take little risk, at the cost of not enjoying it. Once I realized this, though, I finally thought about what I really want to do, and I remembered back to when I used to want to join the Coast Guard, and although I no longer want to do that, I think that I do want to find a career working with a small, rural police department, perhaps out in the West, maybe Wyoming or Montana.

485,"(Novel ahead!)  

I have had a bad dating history, where I've always found the bad apples. I finally discovered a good one, though he's 8 years older than me. I've dated one older guy previously when I was 18 and he was 26.

I ended the relationship with the 26 year old because he wanted me to try a drug and I told him no.  He started trying to convince me daily to try it, and eventually we broke up because I kept refusing. We were in a broken-up/not-broken up state where we were trying to find a happy medium... until my mom asked me to fix something on one of her Facebook games and there was a chat open with him, going on about how he'd really like to ""do it again sometime"" - with a wink face - after saying he was sorry he touched her butt.  Her response was a ""sure thing!""  I confronted my mom about it and (we all worked at the same store at the time) she said he took her keys for something and returned them and his hand grazed her butt by accident.  I lost my shit and cut off all contact with him, even though I still have to see him at work from time to time. It's been 3 years since then.

I've dated younger guys and my mom has never bothered with them besides a friendly hello - and trying to break us up. She'd tell them bad things about me (a lot of which were fake), regretful things I'd done in the past, make stories out of my bad habits, etc.  Sometimes these would start fights between me and the boyfriend of that time and she always seemed so satisfied with it.

Whenever I'm with someone older than 23 though, she flirts with them like crazy. I've really noticed it with my current boyfriend.  Although I trust him explicitly (and actually think he might be 'the one',) I've noticed a lot that my mother has weird behavior around him. I've talked to him about it before and all the stuff she's done in the past. If she says something about me, he tells me right away.  He has given me no reason not to trust him. He's done so much for me to help me overcome my past fears and doubts. He's helped me gain confidence and learn a lot about myself.

I live with my mom and brother to help her with bills. My boyfriend and I plan to move in together within the next year or two and get an apartment out of state somewhere after we've seen the area and decide if it's right for us. But all the time I'm here, I get agitated when he's alone with her (like when he comes over from his house and I'm in the shower, or when he's leaving to go home and I stay up in my room. Most days I end up going down with him even though I should be going to sleep for work.)

I trust him. I don't trust her. I already have a strained relationship with my mom due to the way she has always treated me and talked to me. Last month, I was actually looking at a 3-bedroom house for rent (for myself!) Because of an argument that happened with her. It was really bad, but we somehow patched things and are... OK right now.

I love my mom and I have always wanted to have a good relationship with her but every day she makes me lose a little more patience with her.

So, her behaviors. She's always looking at him. Always smiling or grinning up at him, even when she's in conversation with me. She'll direct conversations to him. Always try to be standing close to him. When he and I are in the kitchen cooking during the day, she'll come over and say ""why don't you do it like this?"" and try to take the pan or utensil from him until he tells her ""no thanks.""  She looks for any excuse to be near him and it disgusts me and makes me seethe with anger. The only reason I haven't gone off on her yet is because I've been trying to somehow salvage our already severely strained mother-daughter relationship. She says bad or rude things about me in front of him, and when I give her a look she says ""I'm just kidding!"" And then makes a laugh at him.

I've confronted her once before about this behavior.

She asked him one day when I was getting ready to leave for work, ""What is your mom's name on Facebook?""

And he told her, and she said, ""Oh! I didn't recognize her in her profile picture.""  And she got up and walked close to him to 'see me out' and added, ""But then, I'm not nearly as *handsome* in my profile picture either, am I?""

I said ""(Boyfriend's name,) don't. Let's go.""

Later we talked about it and how uncomfortable it made him. So I sent my mom a message saying he didn't appreciate the flirting and that it made him uncomfortable and needed to stop.

She said ""I was joking!"" And then told him the next time he came over, ""I'm sorry for making you feel weird,"" all sad-like. But she continues to do this crap.

I hate getting into arguments with my mom because I hate, hate, hate seeing her sad. She left my dad over 10 years ago, lost the 2 men she dated (to death) over the next couple of years, and hasn't dated since. She also lost her parents a couple of years ago as well and I think about all that when I see her sad and it upsets me. But I'm so tired of just sitting back and biting my tongue and watching her do this. Always flirting with my boyfriend. Every time I bring something up like this, she says ""I'm only joking!"" And then looks sad for a while but then continues to do it even more. It drives me up the wall! 

I don't know how to bring this up to her. My boyfriend said if she doesn't stop, he'll confront her himself but I don't want her to have any reason to say she doesn't want him coming over to our house. He is in the process of moving out of his house and into another with his brother and then he and I will get a new place down the line shortly thereafter, but I'm still stuck in this house for another, what, at least 6 months minimum. I'm so tired of watching her flirt with him and getting away with it even though it makes him and me so uncomfortable.

I need advice on how to go about this.",10Aug2020,1
486,"26 F

I was the one who wouldn't stop saying we should breakup if our relationship didn't work out. I was the one who called too late at night or went to sleep to early when we planned on calling. I was the one who had a hard time explaining my thoughts and usually passed as offensive. 

He ended up breaking up with me saying we weren't made for each other. The month following our breakup was hard because we hadn't stopped talking to each other, there were many calls where I said I miss you, and others where we both expressed our regret and I said sorry for all the hurt and all the bad things I did during our relationship.

At the end of said month I reactivated my social media (I only use it every once in a while to see my school groups and delete people). As soon as he saw that he deleted me on Facebook. I thought I was the one who deleted him so I said sorry could you add me again please and we had a talk about being unable to be friends right now as he thought that me reactivating meant I was already over him (not the case at all), and me seeing his posts made me think he was the one that already moved on. I said I respected his choice even though I don't want to stop being in love with him and I was really scared of losing him even if it was the case already, he thanked me and I redeactivated all of my social media to start no contact.

We agreed on talking again someday without a precise moment because that would make us cling to that. I am really depressed right now and I don't know what to do to move on? I still really want to talk to him and it's hard to lose hope and I can't stand the fact that he is not in my life anymore.",10Aug2020,1

I live with my mother, who is a single mother to me and my young siblings (2). 
She has always struggled in controlling her answer, especially with me as a child. She is abusive, physically, emotionally, mentally.
I've always cut her slack since she's always had such a hard time dealing with things, but now it's escalated.

I turn 18 in one month, she's tried to give me two ""reality checks"" this year. It's where she pretends she's going to kick me out and then also tell my grandparents im lgbt.

Last time she did a reality check, I had to end up agreeing to stay for two more years because otherwise she was going to make it so I would be homeless after turning 18. 

It's been really hard since then, she's gone on a bit of a power trip with me. She makes messes that I have to clean up, she's often yelling and scolding me for random things (example: I didn't do all the chores on a list that she made that she didn't even GIVE TO ME.) 
She's also been taking my computer away more often, limiting my time to two hours a day but kicking me off when she feels like it as well. She said she's doing it because I'm ""leaving soon"" but then when I asked, she said I'm not leaving for another two years. She knows I have an online relationship, and I've spoken to her about how her not letting me on my pc that was a Gift from my grandparents is affecting my relationship (it makes me and my bf very sad that we can barely do things together anymore) 
She doesn't care. I try my best with her and it never helps. Even my brother wishes he could run away and he's only seven.

It makes me very anxious to leave, she often tells me how I'll never make it in the real world and how im just a stupid kid (I'm 17)

Either way, would it be good to leave? My grandparents aren't like my mom but if I move I'm betraying my own mother. I feel sick because of how complicated this situation is.",10Aug2020,1

I try and help my friends, family, and even coworkers out before I take the step to help myself, I always want to see them succeed in life and see them being happy.

At my job, I feel as though I'm being underpaid and overworked. I work basically in three separate divisions of finance, labor, and project management and I work for 6 days of the week. I'm constantly being pulled in different directions but I'm trying to do my best to appease everyone and make sure everyone's happy. I also try to make sure morale is up for the guys that are working in the field by bringing them food, coffee and some  shirts, masks, etc. I started doing this when I saw and heard how the actual project managers treat them by only caring about results. Again I just want everyone to be satisfied and happy so we can all work together.

I need to get away from my family. I definitely need to move out of my family's house. My older brother had a long time ago but I know in my heart that it's time for me to go too. I can't handle the family drama when I'm there anymore and I want to prove to myself that I can manage my own life with my own support. 

I'm also realizing that I haven't done much with my life aside from going to school and work. I haven't really had the opportunity of traveling which I really want to do (I finally did book something but it happened right when the COVID pandemic started). I want to go to certain events and do stuff I've always dreamed of doing (skydiving for instance). I have hung up those dreams because I'd want to do it with someone and also because I have almost no time with work having been my most time consuming thing. 

I feel like a stick stuck in the mud that's fighting a constant barrage of rain and just continuously being pummeled deeper into the mud. Also most view this island as beautiful and as a place for fun and happiness. I do not share those views as all I see it as is work and stress. I'm having a lot of mixed emotions thinking about all of this and I just don't know what to think. I can't find the time for myself to learn new things or go out and do something since I would only usually have a couple hours before I'm back at work.  I'll most likely sleep on it but in the meantime, let me know what are your thoughts and all kinds of advice is appreciated.

Thanks for reading my rambling,

495,"I’m 19F, and my mum tried to control me. I’m living here until Feb and can’t move out sooner since I’ll be living on campus for university. 

My mum’s always been controlling, even towards her younger siblings before I was born. She’s currently forcing me to be part of a religion I wish to leave and I can’t think about leaving until I move out. 

An example of how she acts is this afternoon. I hung out with a friend then came home, had dinner and spoke to another friend on the phone for an hour before hanging up to watch TV with mum (if I don’t do it with her every night, she tells me off.) When I came out, she told me that I had ditched her to spend time with my friends (despite her being at work part of the time I was out) and told me that I would be moving out next year and her life wouldn’t be worth living when I do (she’s actually pulled the suicide card on me multiple times since I was a kid, it’s always jarring because what if she’s serious this time?)

I tried to explain that she’s entangled her life too much with mine, but she justified it by saying she’s my mother and it’s pretty much her right because she carried me for 9 months.

I just feel like I’m not being respected as an adult and that she’s too dependant on me. She never moved out of home and heavily implied growing up that she expects me to do the same. My mental health is being severely impacted by this situation, to the point I’m considering just staying here, but then I personally feel like my life wouldn’t be worth living when I did

So I guess I just need advice on how to handle this, on how to establish the boundaries (which I’m trying to do) and let her know how she’s acting isn’t okay and that I’m an adult capable of making my own decisions. And that moving out would be best for me (I’ve even tried telling her it’s a sign of good parenting). I’ll only be moving 3 hours away anyway

TL:DR: My mum’s controlling and trying to manipulate me to not want to move out for uni. What would be the best way to handle this and help her see me as an adult?",10Aug2020,1

498,So my friend's friend invited us to a party on her house last night. We didn't know any of the guests except my friend's friend. They seemed nice people until one of them decided to pore drinks. (they brought liquor and we brought weed.) he came to us and asked : oh you don't drink right? In a tone like it wasn't a question and it was like a statement.  I was so uncomfortable right away. I mean if they didn't want us to drink their liquor they should just told us. We stayed about half an hour and left for my friends party. Did i overreact or was i being rude? They were ignoring us so bad the whole time.,10Aug2020,1

500,"Long story short: I (m17) have only gotten a few but very good friends (m&amp;f 17-19). So, that's fine and I'm generally content with that. The problem is we don't live close to each other. When we meet it takes around 3 hours to get to one another's places. This results in that we don't meet quite often (maybe every 2-3 months sometimes longer). I feel like they are the only ones who really understand me. I live in a rural area and I'm one of the few interlectual people there, while all my friends are pretty interlectual too. Every time we are going to meet I'm super joyful etc. Then the day or two we meet are almost always the highlight of the month/months. But as soon as we leave each other again I become overflown with the feelings of emptyness and lonelyness. How to cope with that?",10Aug2020,1
501,"Last week I (23f) moved out of my parents house for the first time from the Midwest to the east coast in preparation for graduate school. This graduate school is difficult to get through to say the least. I live in a house with 5 other girls (I have my own room and bathroom) that are also in the same class as me. One girl in particular definitely has an alpha personality.. let’s call her Amy (23f).

None of us know each other well, and as house mom I basically handpicked all of these roommates via Facebook/Instagram profiles (thanks covid!). Most of them moved in before I did so I was definitely behind in the social aspect. The first day I got here everyone get very drunk at a party, especially me. At this point I only knew my roommates for a day. While at the party on the first night, I was chatting with another person who I found very attractive. let’s call him Jake (24m). 

Jake &amp; Amy are good friends, it was clear to me when I arrived. In a drunken stupor I asked Amy if it was inappropriate to sleep with him. She said yes, and I was confused by the answer. Jake and I hung out later that night at the same party we were all at and I told him I couldn’t do anything. He basically said he is not her boyfriend and isn’t interested in her and she can’t call dibs on people/against people who she’s known for less than a month. Long story short, we hooked up that night. 

Well, the next morning on my walk of shame back to my house Amy saw me. All the housemates were eating breakfast together and she proceeded to rip me a new one in front of everyone. She said she doesn’t want me to look in her direction or try to talk to her ever again... and that was the milder part of the conversation. I understand I was in the wrong, but it felt weird to hear such hurtful things from someone you barely know. It was incredibly awkward to get yelled at in front of other strangers i live with and I ended up just going to my room and crying the rest of the day. 

It’s been a week and I am excluded out of all roommate activities. I am basically shunned. This is incredibly overwhelming for my mental health and I feel lonely and extremely homesick. I honestly can’t believe everything got ruined before it even started over a stupid drunk hookup. It’s hard to make friends with other people because covid prevents us from getting together. I feel like I live in a toxic sorority house and am considering moving back home. I know I am in the wrong but what could I possibly do to restore house dynamics? Anything would be appreciated.",10Aug2020,1
502,"Right now I've been working as a security guard for 4 years with the same company, and it's pretty much dead ended for me in terms of advancing and wage ceiling. I've been doing 3 years of that working night shifts (0000-0800) full time, and I'm starting to burn out. Management and my direct supervisor have been doing things that give me the inkling that my future with the company is limited. They've also taken actions that I didn't agree with or thought weren't ethical (although not illegal) that negatively effected me. 

So I did the smart thing, I looked for other work to shore up my options, and I got a call for a job with another security firm. They're offering $20/hr, 12hr shifts (OT after 8hr), 4 on 4 off rotation, with $30/shift travel reimbursement. Benefits are the same as what I have now, except they're offering Optical. It's also unionized (although I don't know what union).

The initial call that set up the interview made it sound like they were looking for someone right away (considering that this is for a health care facility with COVID-19 going on, I'm not surprised), asking for my uniform size and photos of my credentials (Security licence, various certifications, etc). And when I mean right away, it sounded like the same week.

Reviews for the company are mostly positive, with only gripes being about the union being toothless in some cases. 

That would mean I would have to quit my job no notice, which I'm not comfortable with, but the nearly triple pay increase is to much to ignore, but the desperate is throwing some red flags. 

I'm worried that if I take this job, burning my bridges with my current employer, and the new one falls through, I'm up shit Creek with no paddle during a pandemic and depression level unemployment.

503,"English is not my first language, I apologize for any grammatical inaccuracies.

I (M21) will be graduating in December. I have worked long and hard part-time through various jobs throughout high-school/college, and have accumulated about $30k. I will be graduating debt free (I paid off my car, have a full-ride, and actually get over 6k in scholarship refunds that I can use for rent/bills/food/etc. semesterly). On top of my job, I make several hundred dollars weekly trading US equities and options. Money is not an issue.

I personally would like to take this last semester enjoying college life, interviewing for full-time jobs, and focusing on school (I am taking courses that my peers rate as ""the toughest undergrad courses you'll take""). I only work 25 hours weekly, but feel like my time in college is coming to an end, and would like to enjoy what little I have left of it before graduation as after graduation I will be working full-time...

Although yes, this internship looks good on my resume, I have been working here since January and have held several other outstanding internships in the past. I also have held several leadership positions in my community. Suffice to say, my resume looks fantastic.

Although the above looks like I can simply quit with little to no worries, here's my dilemma: the economy in the Fall. I'm worried that I will not be able to find a full-time job in the area that I live in before graduation (yes, I've already started looking), and will need as much money as possible to hold me over while my lease ends (in July 2020). Given, I'll definitely have enough liquidity to hold me over until then if I don't find a job, my bank accounts will take a big hit.

For those of you who may recommend I cut hours... this is a job that I cannot cut hours in. 25 hours a week is already the bare minimum I can work to get my projects finished.

I may be able to continue working full-time at my current internship upon graduation - my manager enjoys my work ethic and the quality of work I produce and we have great rapport, however, our company has taken a heavy hit during the COVID-19 recession and we are not sure whether or not we'll have money in our budget to onboard a potential new member. My manager will be able to find out late September. This is a job that historically has only had college students (cheap labor for maximum profits), and thus has had a limited budget.

tl;dr - Should I quit my part-time internship, if I want to focus on school and enjoy college? I'm worried about the economy in the Fall and being able to find a full-time job, so should I save up money while I still can?",10Aug2020,1
504,"Hi, I am currently experiencing an emotional turmoil. You see, we live in a third world country, and the fact that my dad was able to go to a first world country and work, albeit minimum wage was a one in a million chance. We were dirt poor before but now life is at least manageable. 

You see, I discovered that he has been talking to his old highschool sweetheart and being very sweet and all, while he yells at my mother and tells her horrible things like ""kill yourself I don't care,"". Thing is, the woman has asked him for money several times and the amount based on the receipts is almost 1000 CAD. He even put off buying my brother a decent laptop for school for almost a year, and he only bought him one since I pestered him so much about it. That's when I discovered that almost half of his income goes to that woman, who in their conversations, know that my father is a married man , and leads him on while asking for cash. 
I am very worried. My mother has sensed something and when she mentioned it, she was met with the threats of abandonment and my father remarrying abroad. 

The question I want to ask is, do I confront him about it or not? He is the breadwinner of our family and I am afraid that he will abandon us and leave us for good. My mother can't work and I might have to drop out of school so my family can survive.

515,"Hi all.

This is a tough one to post I just thought I'd never have a conversation like this in my entire life- but I'll dive right into it.

Basically my ex and I dated for a year and broke up 3 months ago? But have been talking the entire time since/ still hooking up from time to time. Anyways- She was abused as a child by her adopted sibling- her and her two sisters (they're 2 years younger). From when my ex was from about 7-13 years old he would abuse her, rape her, assault her, force her to suck his dick, throw her into walls, and the parents did nothing- she claims that the 'mom' knew but didn't do anything and the dad just didn't know, happened to her sisters as well. Seems like he kinda singled them out. She told me all about this in our time together and would often cry about it and say how her dad does nothing about it and nothing's ever going to change even though the abuse stopped around 5-6 years ago. She lives with her dad and the two sisters as well, the guy lives around 2 towns over but it still 'around' as the dad supports him and has bailed him out of FOUR different DUI's.

Regardless, I knew a lot about this guy and he knows nothing about me, I have such a severe hatred for him after all that I've heard, its just the most horrible thing I've ever heard, I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. However, today- I saw him. Right in front of me at the gas station waiting for the checkout line. He looked familiar and I say ""Hey you remind me of somebody what's your name?

""Douche"" (names changed for legal reasons?) he says,

and I go ""oh, Douche F\*ck?""

He goes ""Yea how do I know you brother?""

I said, ""oh I dated your sister,""

I watched the expression on his face drop behind his mask, he turned around and went silent. My blood is absolutely boiling at this point, I am fuming on the inside and want to see the worst things imaginable happen to this POS. He checks out and I give the teller my cash and walk out, but I ask him, ""hey man question for ya.""

""How do you live with yourself""

he said, ""oh you've probably heard a few rumors about me"" and chuckled a bit.

I was so goddamn pissed off at this point but I stayed calm and collected the entire time.

I replied ""You shouldn't be let off the hook for brutally raping 3 girls for a decade and getting four DUI's, people know about this""

He just walked away and got into his GF's car. I just kinda starred him down as they sped off. I Immediately call my ex and say- hey so I met him today, this is exactly what I said. I know I probably shouldn't have done it but this is what happened.

I'm at work and a few hours later I get a call from my ex and her dad together basically threatening legal action against me if I ever contact any of them again- I straight up told the dad that his adopted son shouldn't get away with that and that he needs to man up and take care of his daughters who are all his dependents still.

I said ""You let this guy rape your three daughters in your home for over a decade."" (definitely overstepping all boundaries, even the dad had told me he loved me in the past)

to which he basically started yelling that's enough and that he couldn't handle it and to not contact them again. I hadn't been talking to her at all except for when she called me two nights ago and we ended up talking for around 3 hours. the last time we talked was basically 3 weeks ago when we was freaking out this for other reasons and I left a bottle of champagne for her birthday the next day.

So I don't know what to do, Im in my mid 20's and talked to my friend's mom who's a lawyer and basically said that I'm totally in the clear and it wasn't harassment or anything along those lines. I'm just still so pissed off about the whole thing, my ex would freak out because her dad wasn't doing anything for her. I'm the first person to ever confront this person about this outside her family to even at that point was discreet. My lawyer friend basically if anything did happen the dad would implicate himself for a ton of different neglect crimes and more, as well as other things and that's why he threatened me with that? They just don't want to expose it? So idk what to do, She's blocked from everything, we were never on the best of terms especially recently (last month or so), after we split it was basically her being mad at me all the time (I'm not perfect either) and things about this guy- super toxic environment which all my friends told me to get TF out of.

Is posting this against my best interest? Could I get in trouble for anything along these lines? I'm just not sure what to do here besides never talk to any of them again.

Am I the asshole here? The biggest thing that I can think is that it's just not my business, but I involved myself inadvertently so here I am. That relationship is 100% down the drain but I'm just still so mad about all of this and just pissed off even more that nothings gonna change in their lives. My ex is usually very sweet but has just gotten so bitter with all of this understandably of course but I wish it didn't happen to her, let alone anyone at all. She's very upset that he's still around walking and wants to see this guy in prison for the rest of his life, as do I.

I'm just confused you all, thanks for reading and thanks for the help.",10Aug2020,1

-getting confronted but still denies everything she did even though there's solid evidence suggesting otherwise.

-doesn't talk with anyone in this household at all. literally.

-only talks to my mom when she needs something (sometimes even asking me do the requesting for her)

-wakes up every night after everyone is asleep

-threatened to kill me once

-laughs at me when I'm in pain

-don't understand or chose to ignore what my mon did for her 

-her pride. oh my her pride is ridiculously high

-doesn't want to be embarrassed yet some how it's okay when she embarrasses other people

There's much more but this will give you an idea of how she is. Her actions is only got more and more ridiculous as time goes on. My mom did all she can to help her but no avail.

-she'd rather talk to people online rather than her own family

My mother pays for everything. The house, the food everything. My sister is downright ungrateful for anything she gets. She gets a lot of things she wants, even if it's expensive as hell from my mother but any line of advice from my mother will be met with eye rolling from hers. She only talks to her whenever she needs something and ignores everyone most of the time. Not only that, she would occasionally lie about things and deny things even though there's solid evidence that says otherwise. She used to at least talk to us but now she ignores us all. She's also very rude to my mother and this is very taxing for her. I'm very worried of my mom as she is very upset of her behavior towards her and the whole family.

519,"So we had some heavy rainfall last week and we have been having leaks in the house ever since. I looked into quotes from different roofing companies. I got one for $4,500 and I willbe paying for this initially. 

Now I share the house with 3 other people (my mom, brother and grandmother). My brother has agreed to pay me $500 on a week by week basis. My mom wants to set up a payment plan with me and my grandmother says she will pay me her share. The only problem is that I don't believe my grandmlther will pay me back and neither does my mother. 

I confronted my grandmother and I asked her how she intends on paying me her part. She just told me she would pay me back. I asked her how she intended on doing this and I listed off examples like a payment plan or to have her write a cheque made out to me. She repeated her answer by telling me she would just pay me back. This didn't fill me with confidence and now I refuse to call any roofers until my fears are settled. 

My grandmother has been the most vocal in the house about me getting roofers here and she is insistent that I get them here as soon as possible. My issue here is that I am trying to save up money so I can move out of here and buy a house of my own. I don't make a lot of money and $4,500 is really going to set me back here. The house belongs to my grandmother and I want to get the roof done, but not at my own expense.

I don't know what to do here.

Tl;dr I have to pay a lot of money to get my roof repaired. I am splitting up the cost with my family but I am concerned that my grandmother won't pay her share.",10Aug2020,1
521,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I´ll probably have to delete my profil after this, but whatever.   
I live a pretty decent life from the outside, I dont have to go into detail here, but you know the drill. Health,job, woman, money and tons of the usual shit we buy to stuff our homes with.   


So everything basically IS fine.   


But how do you fellow guys above thirty deal with the depression of knowing who you are? I for myself found myself and I know in which direction my life is going. I´m on a career path that will make me the guy with the house, the kids, Porsche SUV, the wife and the golfing. Thats fine with me, I have my obscure hobbies and so on, so thats not BAD!  
But it makes me depressed. Knowing that this is the life I chose. That this will be the way I go. The former phantasies of different lifestyles fade further away and I´m basically bathing in reality now.   


I know this is some growing pains shit, but I´m barely above thirty and I simply question the ""why"", just like anybody else...  


Can someone give me advice of how to get rid of these feelings of frustration and anger? This ""it is what it is"" mood that seems to take over my once fascinated mind.",10Aug2020,1

523,"My boyfriend (24M) was added by a girl (~18F) about a month ago. His profile said he was in a relationship. But he chose to call me his ""baby momma"" instead of his girlfriend when she asked if I was home (what she wanted to do is implied). He didn't block her right away like he should have despite it making me uncomfortable. I didn't tell him to block her because I trusted him. I trusted that he would come to that conclusion by himself if I let him know how uncomfortable it made me. He didn't. 

Instead, he decided to talk bad about me to her. We got into a huge fight over it and he broke up with me (20F). It was temporary, we made up, he blocked her. Two days later, he picked another fight that ended with him dumping me again. 

Apparently during this second fight, he readded her. He didn't stop talking to her after we got back together AGAIN. Less than two weeks go by and he breaks up with me for a third time after I lash out over some horrible things he was saying to me. I chose to take him back this time, telling him it was the last time. He had told me he was no longer in love with me but wanted to work on things. 

Side note: I know I'm stupid but I love him. I'm in love with him. We're having a baby and we were so happy before we moved out of my mom's house. Everything started to get worse with pregnancy hormones and hundreds of dollars of added expenses a month.

Well... two days later, he goes out with one of his friends. Or so that's what he tells me. He's texting me about my day, telling me he loves and misses me the entire time they were out. I didn't see anything on snapchat like I would if he were with his friends so I started to question him a little. He asked why I didn't trust him and I dropped it. But I mentioned it to one of my friends and she assured me he wouldn't lie to me or cheat on me. I agreed. 

Another fight because he wanted me to stay in a town near mine for an extra three hours so he could hang out with his ""guy friend"". He broke up with me for fourth time in three weeks. I was miserable. We fought a LOT over the last two days. 

He left once more today after a smaller argument. He claimed he was going to his mom's house. He texted and we agreed that I would pick him up and we'd get dinner and talk about our future in a public setting where we couldn't argue. I did my make up, put on a cute outfit and some heels... and he never texted. Five hours go by before he rolls up in a car I've never seen. I figured one of his family members brought him home. I was wrong.

Finally, after I heard him making me out to seem like an awful girlfriend on the phone at 3AM when we had both previously been sleeping, I went for a drive. When I came back, things escalated and he wanted to leave. I asked him not to as he doesn't have a car or anywhere else to go. 

He says to me, ""You know what? There is someone else!"" He threw our dining room chair into the ground so hard it bounced up and left a dent in the ceiling and broke the leg. They were brand new. I begged him to tell me who. But I already knew. Just this sinking feeling they were still talking. He was always touchy about me being on his phone after I asked him to block her (I didn't go through it, just to make calls, text someone back, transfer money, etc). He would always demand he do it himself. No matter what. 

He finally told me because I was crying so hard I was throwing up. He told me it was her. He told me they never slept together. Never kissed. Never cuddled. But that he has feelings for her. I was vulnerable and low on sleep. I'm in love with him and let him kiss me and hold me. But now I just feel like I need a shower and a pap smear. 

I don't believe him. But I'm in love with him. How do I move on from this? How do I trust him--or anyone--ever again? I don't want this to be the end of us because we all make mistakes and I love him so much. Please don't tell me to leave him because complete honesty, it's a waste of finger power to type it. I just want to know how to move on and trust again.

TLDR; My boyfriend lied to me for weeks, sent/received nudes to/from another girl and broke up with me four times in a month. How do I trust him again?",10Aug2020,1
524,"I’ll start by stating I work for a company that just has been open 4 months. I’m considered a bar manager and our store is projected to make 12 million this year. We have 7 managers including myself. Last night we were celebrating a wedding and all of us managers sat at the same table and talked about how things are going at the store. A argument started between another manager at our store and a manager at a mother property we own. During the argument I kept trying to interject and put in my opinion, this other manager kept putting his hand on my shoulder to keep me silent during the whole thing when only I was trying to add some positive ideas to the conversation. This happens maybe 7 time. After the argument concluded a few us were leaving and the manager that kept silencing me whispered in my ear that I didn’t have a place in that conversation because my opinion didn’t matter in the store. I’m a 27 year old male. I felt so small. I stood up and waved. Congratulated my boss and said good by the second I turned around I had tears in my eyes. 

I guess idk where I’m going with this but I think I should quit. I was so happy to be here but it’s had to be confident when I think I don’t account for much at our store.

525,"Our house is rather small, so we only have one bathroom in the house. My dad hogs it and makes a mess in it every single time. When he takes a shower, he leaves his dirty underwear in the shower and throws his dirty clothes on the floor. He sings really loud, and he sings off-pitch as well. He never closes the shower door all the way, and there is mold growing everywhere in the bathroom. My dad also leaves the shampoo bottle open, and I'm worried that bugs will get into it. There is a sponge in the shower, and my dad uses it to clean literally everything, even his rear end. He then throws it on the floor and it's disgusting.

After he showers, he uses 4 or 5 towels to dry up. Each towel is only remotely wet, so he probably just dabs a limb with each towel and then throws it on the floor. Every time he finishes showering, there is shaving cream and a dirty razor on the floor of the shower, and it's super gross. When he comes out of the shower, his hair is still dripping wet.

Then when my dad brushes his teeth, he hums really loud, and I can't stand to hear the nasal, grunting sounds. He leaves his dirty toothbrush in the sink, and he never screws the cap on the toothpaste tube. Every single time someone has to clean the bathroom after him, and nobody likes doing it. My mom has confronted him countless times about it, but he just says that it's his house. When she asks him to clean up after himself so others can use the bathroom, he starts to get really angry. The bathroom is totally unusable because the shower is a mess, the sink is a mess, and the toilet also smells terrible because of him.

Background - 22 , Skinny fat . I have been a gamer / geek who always procastinated fitness. Thin arms , Bloated stomach and some man boobs, Relatively strong legs due to some football ( soccer ) in early days.

I used to notice pain in shoulder while throwing punch / or things.
Last year I decided to hit the gym. Always had trouble with exercises that demand shoulder strength ( push ups , pull ups , infact most of the effective exercises / workouts i knew). Since starting, i have had 3 shoulder dislocations ( anterior ) in my right shoulder. Finally have decided to undergo arthroscopic surgery for the shoulder.

Even after the surgery, my overhead shoulder movements will be restricted as far i understand , as will be the amount of stress i can put on them.

I still dream to have a tight core, no man-boobs and bigger forearms. Is all this still possible with restricted shoulders like mine ?

John recently messaged me about another friend we had (let's call him Jack). 
John, Jack and myself used to live together but friction started between us and Jack (the homeowner). 
John leaves due to this friction, I left sometime later after Jack asked me to amicably move out.
Jack had a nice job, a nice car and the house and seemed like for the most part he was happy. 
Some years pass and myself and John still speak, but we both don't speak to Jack anymore due to this friction.
John then messages me saying he is worried about Jack, he received messages about Jack saying that he has quit his 8 year job and is going to walk roughly 60miles (the rough distance from one city to another) to clear his head.

Now the question I ask you fine people is,
Should we be worried about Jack? Could it be that he is just wanting to think about what's next for him? Or is there something deeper involved such as depression seeing as he has pushed everyone away from him?

533,"(phone, formatting, sorry)

Where do I start? My sister has 4 kids - a 9yo boy, 5yo girl, 4yo boy and 7m boy. My sister suffers with multiple mental health issues and her husband has anger issues - they've never had the best relationship and I believe they use children to try to fix their marriage. They live in a 2 bed house, 9, 5 and 4 sleep in one room and 7m with parents. 

Their marriage had always been rocky ever since my BIL cheated on my sister when she was pregnant with 9yo - there were complications in childbirth which resulted in both having to stay in hospital in intensive care, and it had been found out he had been with this other woman whilst they were in the hospital. Disgusting. Eventually they decided to stay together, but it was and never has been healthy. My parents had been called whilst 9yo was around 6m as my sister had held a knife to my BIL, whilst 6m was crawling between them. BIL also has very bad anger issues and there's a lot of damage to their house from him punching/kicking things. He has also hit my sister. She has also hit him back. It's not healthy. 

They've both been to therapy, and social services have been involved but somehow all have been discharged from care. 

Last year, 5yo had told my mother she wanted to stab 9yo with a knife whilst he slept.

I found out yesterday that 5yo had hidden a kitchen knife under her pillow in ""hopes"" to stab her 4yo brother. I don't know why nobody else is wanting to do something about this. I'm worried for my niblings - what if she threatens 7m nephew next? What if she follows through?

Is this a learnt behaviour? Is the past violence between her parents not necessarily in the past? Has she witnessed something? 

I want to report this but I don't know how or who to - also, without evidence. I have been told this information from my mother and my other sister. 

Additional info:
 - 4yo has been pooping in the garden, running it through the house, throwing it at 5yo, and even eating it. plays with himself often.
- 9yo has shown my other 5yo nephew how to pull down his foreskin.

I want to be a nurse and have been looking into different programs. The community college that I go to has a nursing program but it isn’t very good. I’ve talked to my parents saying that I want to go to university for my studies and they have agreed saying that I should do what’s best for my future. I am going to finish my associates this fall and during the spring semester I have been looking into different universities and doing my research. I’ve settled between two universities and applied to both of the schools, they are 4 to 6 hours away, but have good reputation when it comes to nursing. I told my parents that I applied and I showed them the acceptance letters. They didn’t say anything and just brushed it off. A couple of months later they act shocked and surprised that I never told them. Even though I did and I called them out for it. Now every time we talk about college they argue with me saying I should find a college closer to the house. I’ve told them time and time again that the colleges that I chose were the best and that I wouldn’t go into much debt. They have yet to let that go. 

Now a couple a days ago me and my mother were arguing about another situation. She was throwing a tantrum and I sat there quietly like I always do. She then said to me that I was a selfish child and that I never asked for their opinion when it came to college and that I never ask for their opinions in anything. That I only tell them what I’m planning on doing and only ever asks for money. She then stormed out saying that I ruined their parental experience. Now mind you, I have never asked them to pay for anything. Me and my dad came to the agreement that while in community college he would pay for it as long as I got A’s and B’s and any class that I got a lower grade in would come out of my pocket. We also talked about the university and they told me that they wouldn’t be able to help me pay which I completely understand. The only thing I asked them was if they could help me by giving me their old cooking pots and pans and things like that.

Am I in the wrong and is my mother right? Am I a selfish child? I’ve have been communicating with them throughout the process, but they are always upset with me saying I’m going to ruin my life.

I found some friends with gaming but my mom marked that as addiction and I couldn't see them a lot.

Later found a friend but he was only friends because he felt bad. Next year I found my best friend. Everything went well but after 1.5 year I was again bullied a bit by my friend group at the time. The kind of split up and me and my best friend became a small single group.

Next year I went to a school did the study really expedited and switched classes every month. Next year again different school was better but then covid hit.

View Closing paragraph for the end.

**Introduction**

First I would like to introduce myself. This is not my primary reddit account. I'm a 18 year old male. I was born with red hair, not bright red but more to the brown side. But you can in normal conditions, you can clearly see that it is red (this is important for later). I also don't live in the US but in a country in the EU. I try to use the US terms like high school etc... I'll try to tell my story in chronological order.

This all started when I saw the following instagram post: Links don't work. ""It was a girl crying and telling that you should never cheat on someone while in a relationship, people deserve to be loved and not their heart ripped out"".

Lately I have been very emotional, about small things. But this could be due to stress of me recent exam. (that was 1 week ago) imminently after my exam I went on vacation (with friends of my brother and my brother). Today I got back from vacation and saw the instagram post and imminently I bursted in tears.

My dad left my mom when I was 4\~5 years old. He abused me and my brother emotionally and physically for a a bit less than a year and then I never wanted to see him again and I told my mom. I have no contact with him since then.

I'm being randomly was called ""ginger"". This can be by people shouting to me from across the street or a classmate trying to be funny. This happens about once a week. Also I feel like wherever I go people are looking at me. (My friend confirmed this about a year ago, that he also notices if he is with me).

In middle school I have been bullied from my 8th to my 12th. I was bullied by someone that got into our class when I was 7. This bullying consisted of the following:

* Purposefully sabotaging my work
* Getting rejected at every group assignment
* Saying I was ugly, fat, a ginger, had no friends
* Doing everything in their power to shut me out of every group They even wen't as far as breaking me and my GF up (remember I was pretty young at the time, but it was really devastating). I later found out that she was also (a bit) bullied by them but her friends protected her.

I have been playing games for a long time, and I have met a lot of people on the internet. This has been going on for a long time. I always play with friends. I think I was around 9 when I started playing games. A lot, but always with friends. After about a year my mom forced me (after many fights) to go to a clinic for game addicts. And it is true that I was playing a lot but it was my only time to feel accepted. But I had to stop with that due to promises I made to my mom. (Which was 1/2 a hour a day gaming and in weekends 1 hour).

But then I wen't to high school (high school starts @ 7th grade and everything went pretty normal, I couldn't connect to anyone because I simply didn't know how. And it also didn't help that I got Pfeiffer's disease and was at home for 3 weeks. Then I got a friend who was just friends with me because he felt bad for me. I found out about a year later. And again was on my own for half a year. But then I met my current best friend. He is the only one I really connected to and could have fun with. I think I will them him soon my whole story soon and ask him a couple of questions. I had been socialising more since the 8th grade and everything wen't well. But then in the 8th grade everything changed again. My friend group (including my best friend) where shutting me out. The instigator of this behaviour bragged about having a ""Fuck Insert My Name"" WhatsApp group chat. And I totally lost it. It felt like I was back on square one. I told my teachers and then had a chat with the instigator and their parents. The other participants where also punished a bit but they where nice to me, I also told the teachers that. And yes, one of the participants was my best friend. The next year went great and passed my final exams and graduated (this was 10th grade and it is normal in my country due to different levels of education).

The next school was great to go to. The only problem is that It turns out that the study I'm eligible is way below my skill level. I did this 4 year study in a single year. The downside is that I had to switch classes every month or so. And I didn't go to school for half of the year because I had to do internships. Where I only socialised with adults. I couldn't really make new friends.

The next year I went to a University Of Applied Sciences where I met a lot of great people. I had a lot of dispensation for courses so I wasn't there half of the time. And then COVID-19 hit and the other half of the year had to be done @ home.

**Closing**

And then we are back at where I'm now.

As a result of the previous

* I have a fear of commitment to any relationship
* I have social anxiety, *but this is getting better*
* When I walk past strangers (this can be i.e. in the bus, on the street) I have a fear of being judged and sometimes I get tears in my eyes because of it.

I have seen some other videos on instagram where people tell that they are grateful that they have someone they can really talk to. The only one I can talk to is my Best Friend. But not about this. I don't feel comfortable. I don't have the best relationship with my mother, this is due to some excessive fights we had in the best, and sometimes still have.

I just don't know what to do anymore.",10Aug2020,1

I'm into him too &amp; we've been flirting a little. I'm honestly tempted to go for it, especially since it might be the only safe hookup I can have in uni, but I don't want to make things awkward if things don't go to plan. at the same time I feel like it could get more awkward if we avoid it ?

551,"Hi, 18 F here, going to college in about two weeks.
For college, I’m going to be staying with my grandparents so I don’t have to spend as much money on room and board.

I’ve been living away from my extended family for about eight years. The only family members I’d seen in person during that time (besides my parents and siblings) were my maternal grandparents. I haven’t seen my aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. in eight years.

I went to visit my grandparents and set up my room in their house a couple of weeks ago, and it was fine. I’m comfortable around my grandma and grandpa. But we made surprise visits to my aunts and uncles, and it was EXTREMELY awkward. I was okay with my aunts, but my uncles and cousins were very hard to talk to.

I was alone with my grandpa a few times, and it was really awkward. I think I’m just more awkward around men in general. I’m not sure why, though. I don’t have any trauma associated with men.

But anyway, to make a long story short, I NEED advice about how to keep a conversation going and not be awkward around my family. I’m going to be seeing them very often, and I deeply want to reconnect with them. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much!",10Aug2020,1
552,"Hello, newcomer here! Any and all advice here is apprecated :)

So I (17F) have been exhibiting a lot of symptoms of ADHD for as long as I can remember. I've had memory and attention problems since forever, and I almost always cannot sit still nor can I really ""fit in"" with my peers (I know that sounds cliche, but I really do struggle to associate with others and talk/act like a ""normal teenager.) 

Back when I used to see my therapist, she brought up the symptoms of ADHD and I discovered that a lot of the problems I was having with myself were coinciding with it. I did a lot of extensive research, as well as doing a lot of medical tests online (Again, I know it's not the best idea to do tests online but I wanted to be positive) and every single one said I should consider getting tested.

So, I brought this up to my Mother and asked if I could get tested to see if I had it. She was extremely adamant that I did not have ADHD, because in her words ""she would've noticed if I did."" (She is not a medical professional). I keep asking her to at least get me tested, because in my eyes if I have it, great, there's a reason behind my behavior! And if I don't, great, we don't have anything to worry about then!

But she just won't budge. She's started acting like she's thinking about it, and then doesn't bring it up again until I do. I just don't understand why she's so hesitant about getting me tested, nor why she doesn't seem to believe me? Anyway, if anyone has any advice on how I could possibly get my Mom to take me to see a professional and either confirm or deny my suspicions, please do so. Thank you!",10Aug2020,1
553,"I know that the title might sound a little forced, and i'm sorry for that, English isn't my main. 3 months ago, i met this girl on a game, i got her Discord and we started talking.

I tried talking with her everyday, the only problem is that she dosen't really open up to me. A few days ago, it was the first time she did. We had so much fun, we talked for like 4 or 5 hours, but today, it looks like everything was forgoten, all the fun we had and everything, it feels like she forgot everything..

554,"My childhood cat has been sadly pushed aside when my parents got dogs. The dogs would kill her if they caught her, and so she is relegated to a certain area of the house, and she can't go in the main part of our garden.

I've always had a strong bond with her, so when I come back from Uni, it's like she's trying to caught up on lost love with me. I cherish our bond but she (being a cat) does not respect my personal space at all. She'll meow at my window in the AMs, try to squeeze past me into areas of the house she shouldn't go, rub against my legs if I just want to go outside and have a solitary cigarette break from my work, etc. etc. etc. I let her climb into my room but then she's jumping on my desk, meowing at me for what feels like forever, again rubbing against my legs and just generally not giving me space.

My family and dogs are away right now, and she's taking the opportunity to practically stalk me whenever she gets the chance.

I feel bad because this leads me to get angry with her, and I never hurt her but I will hiss at her to get her to piss off, or end up having to grab her aggresively to stop her running into dog territory. Is there any way I could teach her that we can have some cuddles but then she needs to let me do my own thing?",10Aug2020,1

557,"I have a problem where I become super-addicted over an anime/youtuber I like, and this is becoming very unhealthy for me. I'm not talking about days here. When I say addicted, I mean *months and years.* As a kid, I used to take as much positives as I can from my obsession and thankfully it has built some good in me. Being an adult now, this is not the case at all.

I cut off my social life, I don't seek information, I don't do any of my hobbies, I just waste hours to rewatch/open my socials to revisit my obsession. It's so bad to the point I don't do anything else but that particular obsession.

I hope to build a balanced lifestyle if I can get out of this. Anyone has tips/routines/advice? I'm scared thinking that I may be delusional to some degree.

558,"The idea of graduating from high school is terrifying to me. Mainly because I really love my friends. I had a bit of a rough past and now I’m finally in a place where I’m happy and I love the people around me. I am so scared I’m going to lose that.

I don’t know what I want to do as a career because my relationships feel like the most important part of my life. They make me incredibly happy and I would honestly *probably* be fine with doing almost anything as a career as long as I could stay with the people I love. I don’t have a dream job.

After high school did you stay in contact with your friends? And is it as scary as it feels? I have really bad anxiety and I am a big over thinker. I have to start applying to schools in 2 months and I have no idea what I want to do or where I want to go. I just want to be happy.

Does anyone have any advice?",10Aug2020,1
559,"Hey I’m a 22F and I have this strong discomfort around men. I think it stems from being molested when I was younger but I just want to get rid of it. I avoid eye contact and go completely silent. I don’t know how to carry a conversation with them. If I’m left alone with them I want to run. The only times I feel comfortable is if I know the person is younger than me, if the person is married to someone or I know he has a girlfriend because it makes me feel like I can trust them. I’m sorry I don’t even understand it because It’s complicated and hard to put to words. Another thing I’ve realised is, sometimes ill feel comfortable with a guy, like at university, ill feel like maybe I can finally have a guy classmate that I can study with in the library but when I notice he starts liking me it really upsets me... I can’t be in a relationship at the moment, it’s really gotten in the way. 

Another thing is I’m really not sexist I promise. I respect men and I love men and I can’t wait to marry one someday. But see how I mentioned the trust problem? I keep thinking what if he molested his siblings, what if he molested his niece or nephew. It’s not really something I sit long and hard about but it’s a thought that pops up into my head. 

Has anyone gone through with this? It’s an honest struggle I’ve been dealing with for so long and now that I’m older and want to get to know a guy soon, I want to get rid of these overwhelming feelings where all I want to do is run. Also interested in what the guys have to say about this too. 

Thank you",10Aug2020,1
560,So I have this feeling that my family only wants me around anymore so they can take advantage of me. They have never been supportive of things I want to do with my life. They treat me like I'm incapable and incompetent. If I make any decisions they will be bad ones that'll cost me all my money and ruin my life. If I make any decisions without their opinion I become the  traitor of the family. They don't even talk to me anymore unless they want something. Nobody asks how I'm doing or how I'm feeling. They only come around if they want something. If I want to do things like get outside on the weekend they get offended if I don't include them. If I include them they hijack my plans and I end up taking them places they want to go or they completely flake on me and ruin my plans for the day. There is something wrong here. I feel like it's mostly related to money and that they only want me around for their own financial security.,10Aug2020,1
561,"Let me (18F) start off by admitting that I’m not too trustful of many guys and this could all be me being paranoid and overthinking. My family has a seasonal campsite for the summer. We moved spots this year, but we still keep in touch with out neighbors from last year. We’ll call the neighbor Mark and Mary. My dog absolutely despises mark and will actually try to bite him whenever he gets near. She gets nervous all of the time, but she has only ever bit one other person (my uncle, and don’t worry, he 110% deserved it). Silly as it is, that’s when I started getting suspicious of Mark. Last time I was at the campground he did that thing where he would pat your on the head. And that’s kinda weird considering I barely know the guy? And then when my parents went on a walk, he insisted on staying behind with me and my sister? And when I mentioned coming out to the camper again, he asked me if I planned on going out alone? I don’t know, he’s always been friendly and maybe I would trust him a bit more if I went out to the campground more often. It’s just he does so many weird little things that it makes me uneasy. And if he is in anyway creepy, I haven’t heard anything about it, and the campground is an absolute cesspool for gossip.",10Aug2020,1
562,"So college online classes started today, and I had planned on how to study, how to divide my time for my personal projects and all. I was very excited about the studies because it also gave me work to do instead of spending my days idly. Problem is, my dad's moods are unpredictable. He'll never agree about it. In fact, he'd have a screaming match on how I'm the over-complicated person. According to him, he walks on eggshells around me because I'm very sensitive. I am sensitive because I feel very afraid when he raises his tone and I try my best not to put him on a bad mood. He and mum hate each other, so it's like a divorced couple living together while barely acknowledging each other's existence while I'm stuck in between with my lil sis.  My dad has beaten me before (typical of an Indian Parent) though the last time he's done that was about 4 to 5 years ago.  Anyways trying hard to please him when his mood looks like it's not good has almost become ingrained into me. And I fucking hate that part of me. Did I make sure to ""see"" him today? Did I make sure I didn't do anything that appears like I favour mum? Did I make sure to fake myself in front of him so he doesn't think I'm depressed? Should I avoid him in case his bad mood might somehow explode on me?  Did I make sure the way I talk doesn't seem ""arrogant""? I have to tick so many boxes to have a normal day.  
Two days ago, he seemed stressed due to work and then pissed at my sister for not studying. My fucking lil sis behaves the same way I do when he's mad (avoid him). His fucking anger isn't even directed towards me and I'm afraid to enter his view. I'm stopping myself so hard from running to him and trying to please him and make his mood better. I fucking can't. I try so hard to immerse myself in my studies but then I start hyperventilating. I slept in the afternoon to help myself relax but after waking up too I can't calm down. I can't seem to bring myself to do my personal projects due to this weird fear that if he sees me doing that before I finished my studies he'll start nagging on why I didn't finish my studies before that. I am literally crying right now from all these negative thoughts and moods that even if I text my boyfriend I don't feel any better. I don't want to tell mum either because there's not much she can do anyways and she'll end up needlessly worrying over it. I am fucking tired and in complete shambles over fucking nothing and yet I don't know how to stop and divert my focus completely to my studies. I guess this was more of a rant/vent but seriously any advice is welcome at this point except therapy. Cuz the last time I went to therapy and got diagnosed with depressive disorder, I was pushed a lot by him to get well ""faster"" as therapy isn't cheap. Oh, and also that's the time when he beat and kicked me so much I ended up having bruises on my arm and sides of my waist. Oh and also him being dismissive that I was self-harming during that period. yeah... just wonderful.",10Aug2020,1

566,"I hate my job. Its my first full time job right after high school and I've been here for 3 years. I'm not really sure if all jobs suck to this extent or if I'm really in a bad spot. I've never worked any other ""real"" job. 

I work at a local newspaper doing customer service. Mostly subscriptions. The main way people contact us is via phone so I feel like this is basically a call center job sometimes. 

My boss is a condescending, entitled, princess. The minute you ask a question about ANYTHING she will take her time to say ""Don't you remember us talking about this? I already told you how to do it. I'm not sure how many times I have to go over this with you"". Its possible to say those things in a nice way but she essentially announces to the whole office, which is basically a bunch of desks in one big room with no walls, in a snobby tone that she did in fact do her job and teach me, but I forgot. 

She has an issue with having conversations that could be considered private, or even quiet, very obviously to the whole office. She noticed that I began shutting down programs on my computer at 3:59 when Im done work at 4. I was approached one morning and was asked about it. I claimed I would shut down some programs I was not using in order to make logging out at 4 a little quicker. She then asked me very obviously ""What time do you work until? Do you know? Because I'm pretty positive its 4pm"". I stayed quiet and was unsure what to say. She took this as me arguing(?) and said ""We can continue this in my office if you have anything else to say"". Perhaps this whole conversation could have been had in your office? 

Our office is currently shut down due to COVID. Yet at least once a week someone approaches an employee in the newsroom or business office when they're walking in and they let the customer in. No mask, no plastic guard or anything. Hence why we haven't opened back up to foot traffic yet. And we're expected to just help them. God forbid they say outside that we aren't open, because...we aren't. 

The icing on the cake is the customers. I've been called every name in the book. Told im incompetent. Even been threatened that they would come into our office with a gun next time the paper was missed. I had a man tell me I was a no good pathetic piece of shit, and I hung up. He called back and boy did I get it for that. She seemed dumbfounded as to why I hung up. I simply stated that I had given him a solution to his problem and at that point we had strayed from anything related to my job and I was just being used as a punching bag. I dont even deliver the paper. I just get the shit for it. I was told that no matter what I was never to hang up on a customer as it is my job and I'll just need to learn to deal with it. 

I'm underpaid, have gotten a total of 0.75 raise since I started here. We struggled due to COVID and being a newspaper in the first place. But instead of any recognition whatsoever they sent out a mass email to encourage us to buy new merchandise they had made. 

I want to do tattoos eventually. I'm working on building up a portfolio and improving my skills but this job leaves me so mentally drained by the end of the day my creativity and motivation is near zero when I walk out the doors every afternoon. 

Its an entry level office job with literally zero opportunity to move up in the company until the current manager retires in 10+ years and I have an offer elsewhere. But im not sure if I should expect anything better than this because this is all I've known. Are there people that are happy at their jobs or should I just settle in to being mentally exhausted and underappreciated. Recently someone asked me when they called if I was ""somebody actually important, or just a nobody that answers the phone"". About to just walk out because I definitely feel like a nobody here. 

tl;dr my job sucks. Should I get my hopes up about finding a job where I'd be happier or should I just expect all jobs to be mentally exhausting.",10Aug2020,1

570,"So y’all tell me what to make of this. I have a cousin that I am somewhat close to, we’ll call her brittany.  Brittney has always been the type of person to make shady comments towards me but I always try to brush them off...until recently. 

For one, whenever I started dating my boyfriend, she said to me “wow I can’t believe you have a boyfriend before I do.” I didn’t think much of this at the time because brittany was always someone that was dealing with a guy and I’m the complete opposite. Whenever I was single, she would ALWAYS tell me how I need to “live my best life” and go out and find a man. I took this advice with a grain of salt because NONE of the men my cousin was dating were bout shit. She always complained about them. So I just brushed that off as her projecting her own insecurities on to me because obviously she felt that she needed to be with someone to live a good life. 

It wasn’t until recently that I started to feel like my cousin is shady as fuck. For one, a few weeks ago I went over her house with my boyfriend, just to hang out. Whenever we were leaving, she made it her business to brag about how much she had about $7500 in the bank and she even went out of her way to show me. It was kinda weird because it was so random. So I was like whatever, she’s weird and kept on moving. 

Well, i decided to go over her house with my boyfriend again this weekend to just chill a hang out. Whenever I got there, she was asking me how to add Apple Pay onto her phone. This was weird to me because she literally worked for Apple for YEARS..and I said this to her.. that to which she claimed she never had to deal with Apple Pay. She then goes on to say “idk why it’s doing that.. I have ALOT of money in there so idk what it’s doing”. Mind you, for Apple Pay, you only have to put in either your card number or your bank account number. She knows this. So I was just wondering why is she asking me? She could’ve literally looked this up. I know she only bought it up to throw in my face that she had a lot of money in the account. 

I told my mom about the situation to get her opinion and she said that she wouldn’t hang out with brittany if she were me. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but she’s said quiet a few shady things in the past and it’s starting to make me feel like she’s really a shady b!tch. What do y’all think?

571,"Last night I had a few drinks with a long term friend for her birthday. We were joined by her family, and several of her friends and their partners. My boyfriend was also there too and we were having a great night until she decided to announce a massive insecurity of mine to the group of about 20 people sat around us.

She announced to the group that one of my breasts is bigger than the other, and proceeded to grab at me and get everyone’s attention. Many people called her out on her behaviour while the rest sat there very awkward.

Then 2 days ago I started feeling tired and having heavy breathing, to make it worse I have psoriasis -it only flares up when I have a stressful day at work, but since COVID struck my work migrated from office to work-from-home where I have my own room for work... But now even basic tasks like cooking, working out, or even just playing PC/Console games my psoriasis flares up.

I live with my fiance, and even she tells me that I look stressed -but I don't know why, and not knowing the reason makes me feel it more.

I can't get this diagnosed where I live right now, because most of the hospitals are converted to COVID centers -and my fiance and I usually go out only when necessary, I'm an indoor person myself so I don't really care much about outdoor activities. Everything I need for work, play, and lifestyle are in our home, so I really don't know why I'm feeling this way.

I'm posting this on reddit to find help, while I'm also consulting this issue as well to a family doctor, and my fiance and I are already discussing this... But right now, I feel so stressed and helpless (not suicidal).

Any ideas?",10Aug2020,1

So blowjobs aren't very nice for me and no, my penis doesn't smell like everyone seems to think on the Internet. I clean it as best as I can. I've been debating getting circumcised but after reading about it a few times on reddit it's really put me off. Losing up to 50% sensation and your mushroom tip starts looking cracked and dry, and then the ""g"" spot is mostly gone.

576,"I'm 22, my older brother is 26, and for about 6 years now, my brother has been an alcoholic, drug addicted, gambling addict, and nobody but me seems to care. 

I've decided to write this post now because of the events that happened 2 days ago. I have my own apartment, my brother still lives with one of our parents. He came over to my apartment the other day when I had friends over, he was blacked out drunk and threw up in my bathroom for hours while moaning in pain and laying on the floor. Over a course of hours I tried to kick him out of my apartment to get him to go home. I didn't want to have to see it anymore. He was laying in his own vomit at 26 years old. This is supposed to be my older sibling, my protector and role model. But instead I am stuck taking care of him, and its always been this way. 

My brother has deep seeded emotional issues. He is insanely insecure about everything including his appearance, income, dating life, social life, education, living situation, his past and his future. He was kicked out of multiple colleges for a variety of reasons from sexual misconduct to getting DUIs. His reputation has become quite odd and his quality of life has crumbled. 

All he does is lie, lie, lie. He lies about the girls he goes on dates with, about his income, about moving out soon, about his gambling, and most of all, he lies about his drinking. He used to take multiple Xanax pills a day but now he mostly drinks vodka or whisky until he's slurring his words, acting aggressively, vomiting, and of course, leaving me to pick up the pieces. 

I want him to go to therapy. But he probably would lie to his therapist about his life because he wants to make anyone and everyone think he's cooler than he is. He lies so much I think he believes his own lies. I am sick of my deadbeat brothers lies and alcoholism. I am sick of feeling embarrassed. I am sick of him wallowing in humiliation and then adding more onto it with his own actions. I am sick of my parents turning their cheek as if they've given up years ago. I am sick of all of it.

579,"So I’ve been in a dead end job that’s been making me suicidal for the past two years now, and I’ve spent so long looking at other options because I was so incredibly miserable. 

I was browsing on a job site and found Midwifery. Obviously I’ve known about this but I never really thought about it, so I looked into it and I have all the right qualifications to do the degree. 

I should state that I’m from the UK and I’m 20 years old and I live very close to a university so I could easily commute, therefore not having to pay accommodation fees. My parents wouldn’t have to pay for a single thing. I also told them I’d obviously get a part time job on the side to support myself whilst I studied. 

They both instantly shit all over me for it and said how I’d be a terrible midwife, and kept bringing up “the debt! The debt!” and saying how shit the NHS is to work for and how it’s a stupid decision and I should just stay in my job. 

I can’t stay in that job anymore, I’ll attempt again because it makes me THAT miserable, but I’m going to have to live with my parents if I do leave and choose to get a degree and they’ll be constantly judging me and bitching at me. I know I’m an adult and it’s my own decision but I am genuinely afraid of my mother and going against what she says (she can be extremely emotionally and verbally abusive, when I lived alone she forced me to give her a key so she could come in whenever she wants). I’m terrified to stand up against her. I don’t know what to do. This is something I really want.

580,"So, I'm a 24yo m with asd (so some social issues with actions/perception vs intent), depression/ anxiety. 

I met a close friend about 6 months ago, and they're one of the first people I've felt completely able to put my trust into, and let my guard down around. 

I've had a history of emotional abuse,  isolation, and generally being messed about with.  So the one thing I ask (lead with) when I start to really trust people is that they're straight/ honest with me. 

Another strong characteristic of me is that I always (try to &amp; usually do) keep my promises/always keep my word.

So yesterday this friend of mine tells me that sometimes they'll go back on their promises is they feel that keeping their word  would hurt the other person or mess them up in some way. Ie, telling them their ex was cheating on them (not related to our situation). Further they said that as long as the person they made the promise to never finds out that they changed their mind and hid something from them that it's fine.

They also made the point that even if they say they would keep me updated or tell me if certain things arose in their life that at any time they're more than welcome to change their mind.
Which makes sense. 

So effectively they said they'd be straight with me,  but there's no way I can see that I'm able to trust them (the person who made me feel able to trust again).

I feel completely lost, because I finally was starting to feel more relaxed and able to trust others again, because I was starting to give people the benefit of the doubt/trust them to be upfront with me. 
It's like all the progress I made was built on a foundation of sand, and now I'm falling apart.
Can anyone give me some advice?

581,"I'm 21, he's 20 and his brothers are 15 and 18. My boyfriend has struggled with OCD for most of his life (only diagnosed recently) and it has mostly been the intrusive thought type for the last year or so. He has obsessed over being gay/bi/a pedo/into teens/into incest/if I'm really the one over and over for a year. I really struggle to accept that these intrusive thoughts mean nothing and that he isn't secretly all/some of these. 

His OCD started becoming really thought based a few months into our relationship, when he told me about the one occasion that he dry humped his little brother during a tickle fight when he was 13 and he was 8. He deeply regretted it and apologsied to me and his family and went down a serious downward spiral of worrying if he was into incest/a pedo/a monster because of this event. I had mostly moved on but now he is panicking about the fact he used to tickle fight his brothers and on a few occasions, he would tickle them between their butt cheeks with his foot, when he was in his early teens. His mom caught him doing it and told him off and he never did it again. He seems pretty sure that he just did this in a playful way and the foot was nothing sexual but I feel so sickened that he cannot guarantee it wasn't meant in a sexual way. He insists it is OCD making this way way worse but Im so terrified now that he was a horrible little kid that felt attracted to his own siblings",10Aug2020,1
582,"Ive posted this in the College subreddit but thought id try here as well

So hey guys, Im new to this subreddit, just looking for somewhere to talk.

Im 20 years old, just finishing my degree, as I write this I'm around 14 days away from handing in my thesis and being done with my degree forever. (Did an accelerated bachelors so 2 years instead of 3, but skipped all the big vacations, had 4 weeks total per year).

I was so excited for college, I was going to live the good life, get drunk all day and night, go to wild parties, have some crazy stories that Ill never forget, get with girls, get into and out of relationships, and have the god damn best time of my entire life, before having to piss off and get a job and a life.

Well here is what the experience was really like (In the Netherlands BTW if it makes a difference, and no im not dutch)

I went to a private school, with barely any people, no such thing as a campus just a building with classrooms and thats it, made some friends but never chilled with anyone outside of classes. I lived in a student building, all my best friends live there, but they all came and went, leaving me more and more alone as the months went on. I developed such intense anxiety of going anywhere by myself that the only places I would go were the supermarket and liquor store when i need more alcohol (don't even get me started on my poor liver and mental state) and the coffee shop (dutch style, not for the coffee). It got so bad that when I was invited places I wouldn't go. Then I went too big on the oregano and wouldn't even socialise with people cuz i was getting really bad paranoia and didn't want to even leave my room. Basically i lived a shitty depressing look back experience and didn't do a single thing i wanted.

Moving on to the present, I've been back at my parents house for a few months, and im now going to be returning for a month ish to finish my rental contract and give my final goodbyes to the city that was home for 2 years. I wanna get smashed, get intimate with some people, and do all the thing I ever wanted from my college experience. But covid is still here, and knowing me the day I get back ill go back to my old self and ill just live my last month the same, being in big debt and regret for the life i dreamed of but never had. To top it off most people get 3 or 4 years and a big campus thats all in one place and big schools with thousands of people and not being trapped in the middle of the city with nowhere to go in that ilk, alot of the dutch people are very judgmental because im a fan of a drink, anyway ive gone on a side shoot here.

Basically I dont know what to do, I dont know what to think, I dont know what to want, and lets not even get started on the future after i move back to my current home country.

Any advice, ideas, thoughts, inputs, stories, or anything of the sort would be greatly appreciated, as im lost and not happy with where my life has gone so far.

Sorry for the really lengthy post, and thank you for taking the time to read,

Peace,

Will",10Aug2020,1
583,"So I’d like to move out and go to college in a year, I plan on studying biology and living in the city ( I live in a small town ) until I get my bachelors degree I’d like to move out because I want to be closer to the rest of my family and to have some freedom. I don’t take concurrent classes so I don’t have any college credit.

My mom and step dad think I should stay home and go to a 2 year college and then go get a bachelor’s degree in biology I’d like to work with marine animals so a marine biology degree would be better but there isn’t any classes that teach marine biology in my state. So I’d have to go out of state I guess I could go out of state in a year but it’s typically more expensive. I’ve applied for a lot of scholarships and I don’t think I got any.

585,"Hey!

My Dad has a type of Leukemia. It is called “Myelofibrosis” to be exact. 

Anyway. It means that once a week (every Monday) he needs to have a blood transfusion. If he goes without this he will feel extremely weak.

For a man. A healthy hemoglobin level is between 13.5 and 18 grams per decilitre. 

When he goes in for the transfusion on Monday. His level is often between 6 or 7 grams per decilitre. Which is way too low. So they give him 3 bags of blood. Which often boosts him up to around 10 grams per decilitre. So even after treatment. He is still way below what he should be. It’s enough to get him by but it’s just not cutting it.

This is where the question I had comes into play. 

If he were to get another blood transfusion privately. After having the transfusion by the National health service. This would boost his blood up even higher. So when he goes back to the hospital on a Monday. Instead of being 6 or 7. Maybe he could be a 9 or 10.

But I’ve heard that once you start treating yourself privately. The NHS won’t treat you anymore. Is this true? 

Are there any other options?",10Aug2020,1

592,"

Last my friend managed to swipe some booze, enough to get us both pretty fucked up. And being the highly intelligent assholes we are we decided ""You know where would be a great place to have this? School!"" Trust me it went as well as you would expect. Half way through the day we sneak off to the bathrooms with the booze and an energy drink each, we know we have only a few minutes before someone would wonder where we were so we chugged the god aweful mix. We walked back to class feeling fine knowing lunch would be in 10 minutes. As the bell rings it hits us, we had pulled stunts like this before but never with as much booze as we had that day.

 Being the intellectuals we are we decide to see how tough we are by punching walls and eachother (not hard enough to leave visable marks). I am typically an introverted person but when drunk I am completely different, so I'm talking to lots of people joking around with random teachers. Sitting in the staffroom having a good conversation with a teacher I was close with. 

The bell rings and a teacher lets call him Patrick walks into the staff room (I had him that period) he hands me a bag and tells me to make use of myself. Before I continue I need to explain how we interact with eachother, Patrick hates me and loves me. His usual greeting to me is usually ""Go away!"" Or ""What do you want?!"" then he usually smiles and we talk. Honestly I wouldn't say this anywhere but here anonymously he is the best teacher I have had. He actually gives a damn and doesn't let me do what I usually do which is sit talking to friends or doing nothing, I used to hate him for it but now I don't know. Anyways enough of that. 

Now to the bit where I fucked up. I'm not going to spin some story about how I did nothing wrong because I really screwed up. My drunk self went back to my old ways doing no work , being a dick and talking. By talking I mean the stage of drunk talk where you start talking about the meaning of life....Patrick tries to get me back on track but I'm to drunk to fully comprehend what he is saying so my answers were vague and thoughtless. And I even try talk about the meaning of life with him at which point he walks away.

 Once class ended I went to put something in the bin, at this point it's just me and Patrick. As I'm about to leave trying not to fall on my face Patrick says to me ""John, I'm disappointed with how you behaved this lesson. I expected more from you"". The words didn't quite register yet so I gave him the biggest shit eating grin and said ""Thank you!""  and promptly left. It wasn't until I got outside I realized what I had done. Patrick was the only person that saw me as more than a fuck up and the word disappointed played through my mind over and over. I wanted to scream, punch something but I managed to stay composed enough and I walked back inside adn tried to apologize to Patrick. 

It took everything I had to not tear up when he said nothing, I once again said sorry and he said ""sorry isn't enough"", then something else I have blocked out but he quickly tried to cover up by saying he didn't mean it like that, I just hung my head and mumbled sorry again and left. Tomorrow I dont know what to do. I have a class with him tomorrow so I can't avoid him, I wish he knew how much I appreciate him but I dont think he does.

596,"TL:DR at the bottom. 

So, just a bit of background info: I’m a teenager and I live at home with my family. I am not financially stable enough to move out yet.

My family says they love me and they are often supportive of me, but there have been times I’ve been convinced they’re narcissists because of the way they behave. For many reasons that would take too long to get into right now, I can’t be myself around them and I have to be somewhat emotionally closed off or else I get severely emotionally damaged.

My family thinks they know me better than anyone. They don’t really know me at all, I hate the person I am around them but I have to be that way to protect my mental health. How can I deal with knowing that they think I’m a terrible person? All I truly want is for all of us to be at peace with ourselves and each other and I am on that journey, but it’s so hard when I’ve been the scapegoat in my family for as long as I can remember. I know that they don’t know me one bit and I know that they think I’m terribly mean. It’s hard for me to accept this because I just want to spread love and kindness in the world, but with them I just CAN’T be myself or else it’ll lead to a lot of damage. 

TL;DR My family has toxic dynamics and I’ve always been the scapegoat. After a lifetime of being blamed for everything I have to emotionally guard myself which makes them think I’m a bad person (they don’t realize the damage they’ve done to me). I guess my question is: how can I cope with them not knowing me and thinking that I’m a bad person?",10Aug2020,1

She originally already wanted me to travel to her city on Friday (so I would have had 4 days of rest from the exhausting trip). Her city is about 6 hours by train from mine.
I was a bit reluctant at first because I was exhausted from our trip and then she also suggested I shouldn't come. Going a bit back and forth about me coming we had a fight on Sunday morning which resulted in her blocking me on phone and WhatsApp. After some more turmoil today which included asking me to come and then again saying final goodbye some minutes later, she just called me and asked me to come tonight in a rush (in about 1 hour in my timezone) and cancel my plans for tonight.
I suggested that I come tomorrow instead.

601,"So to start, we broke up about 2 months ago, after dating for just under 2 years, and i always thought of it as great, but looking back, i overlooked so much, every argument, no matter what it was about, i would appologise, she'd make promises, then push guilt to me for expecting her to keep them, she would often treat me very cold with no explanation, then when i brought it up she explained why like i should've known. I always put effort in to get into her interests (i even watched Cats in cinema because she wanted to lol) but she never put any effort into that with my interests and just wrote them off. She did singing, so every song she did i would listen to and tell her what i thought and how much she improved with every song. But when i brought up her reading my comic im writing and am just as passionate about,  she said she'd maybe read part of it, which really hurt at the time.

There was no compromise with her, on anything, it was her way or no way, and me being fairly easily pushed over, i just backed down. It all came to a head when she pressured me into cutting contact with two of my closest friends, which made me wake up and realise this wasn't healthy or ok, so i left.

Two months on im still thinking about her, and more recently, doubt on my part,  like the kind of what if scenarios 'what if we did this differently or what if i tried this' and even doubt that any of it was that bad and im over exaggerating and seeing things that aren't there. Im also justifying her actions a lot too, no matter what, i can't hate her, i don't believe she's a bad person, but i know i cant go back to her, it would be destructive to my mental health and a big middle finger to all my friends who helped me get out.

It was well, a bit different to what I’d already gotten used to with Filmora so I tried my best to do what I could but I couldn’t even manage to make it so the music I was planning on using in the background not drown out the audio of the actual video itself

At this point I was beginning to turn back to Filmora and I was looking at the pricing for a license to use Filmora 

The Pricing for Filmora is as follows

Filmora Permanent License - 59.99$
Filmora yearly subscription - 39.99$

Compared to other softwares like Adobe and CyberLink this was definitely cheaper and more affordable

Adobe Premiere - 99.99$
CyberLink PowerDirector - 74.99$

So I’m looking for wether or not it would be worth it to purchase the Permeant License

Or if there was maybe something else out there I could go to",10Aug2020,1
603,"Hi! My boyfriend and his sister had a fight earlier this evening. His sister said that I don't help around the house and I'm lazy.

I've been staying with them since the quarantine started. I really try my best to do chores (clean up after meals and wash dishes etc.) Except for cooking because I don't know how, my boyfriend is usually the one who cooks. I also give money for food and other bills.

I have work from 10am until 7pm. Tonight after work, I kind of sat around to rest and that's when they started fighting. Now I don't know what to do.

I honestly wanna leave but I'm sharing my PC with my boyfriend so he can work from home. Oh, and his sister also uses my laptop for work. Please help",10Aug2020,1
604,"Warning, this is about mental health.  


During last two months, I spent almost every evening ""regenerating"" after work, almost every weekend at home. Aside from work, where I do my best to put up professional and efficient front and holidays, which were amazing and where I was a different person, I'm spending most of my time in front of my laptop, playing video games, watching Youtube videos, watching pornography, drinking soda and eating junk food.  


I don't know what to do other than post this message. I see how unhealthy it is for me and for relationships with people, but still, whatever I do or whatever I think, I may wake up on saturday or come back from work tired and just go on autopilot.  


It sounds like madness, but it's as if I don't have agency over what I'm doing 80% of the time. I may get a brief inspiration to clean up my place or to cook something, but it is short lived. I may decide that I want to change, but it is short lived. Escaping into safe world where I know how everything works, that sweet sugar mood boost and release by masturbation are pulling me like a back hole.  


I haven't contacted almost anyone and appearently at this time no one initiates contact with me. My sister with whom I have a very supportive family bond, is travelling abroad. I feel shame even going to do groceries (something I had when I was younger and antisocial). I don't want people to see me in this state.

&amp;#x200B;

How to overcome this?  
I know of a group for adult children from dysfunctional families. They have an open meeting in two weeks.  
I know a therapist I had few online therapy sessions with. I could set an appointment with him... in two weeks.  


I don't want to be like that for another two weeks. I have things to do. I want to start studying at an university this year, and it would greatly help my case to start looking for a job that works with me studying and looking to get funds and formalities done. I want to resocialize myself and contact friends, and maybe look for a house to rent together with them. I may want that, but I end put in front of my laptop.",10Aug2020,1

I have no problem with the city itself but it’s been 10 years and I have no social life, I don’t see anyone, and nobody talks to my family. I’m not in a normal setup. I’m a teenager, I want to do teenager things like seeing people without having to schedule it 2 weeks in advance. I want to be able to ride my bicycle to a friends house almost everyday. I want to walk around the city with friends. I don’t want to feel like I make my friends make accommodations for me. I understand that I’m not like everyone else: I don’t do sleepovers, I don’t go to church (in my city it’s considered strange), better yet, I’m not even Christian, I can’t eat the same things everyone else eats because of my religion. Everyone always has to accommodate for me and I hate it. I want to be accepted. I want to have a normal friendship where I can just see them almost whenever. I don’t have that. Everyone else does. I get that my parents are foreigners and we came to the city strictly for work. But I still have the right to a semi functional social life which I now I realize it’s too much to ask for. I made a new friend this year, but he’s switching schools, and he lives in a place where he can just see people whenever. I live sort of far away and I can’t do that with him. In addition, everyone in my grade has made in extremely clear that I’m even lucky to breath the same air as him. It’s just not fair. Why does everyone but me have the right to friendship except for me in my godforsaken city. All I fucking want is ONE PERSON to talk to that would be there for me. Basically everyone needs that and I don’t have that. I don’t have a support system, all I have is my pride which doesn’t even exist. I need someone to talk to, to go to when I feel like shit. But, everyone is taken in my city and nobody needs me. Everyone around me makes me feel like an oxygen thief and I’m getting tired of it.",10Aug2020,1
608,"I work in veterinary medicine. I lived in Texas my whole life, a state where you don’t have to be licensed to be a veterinary technician. I recently moved to Washington where you have to be licensed to be considered a technician, otherwise you are a veterinary assistant. 

I worked as a technician in Texas for almost 10 years. This meant I was able to place IV catheters, draw blood, give injections, educate clients over a variety of subjects. My job in Washington has been reduced to folding laundry, deep cleaning, shaving/prepping surgical sites and restraining animals. 

To say I’m bored at work  is an understatement. I’m absolutely miserable. The only reason I don’t spend two years taking the proper vet tech classes to become licensed is because I’m actually finishing up classes to apply to vet school. 

Is there anything I can do to hate the idea of going to work any less? I’m realizing I loved my job so much in Texas it was the one thing I did look forward to doing everyday. Maybe I need a hobby outside of work I look forward to each day?

I have 76K in student loans, my fiancé has already paid off his.

I accrued the debt from having a bachelor of science in biology, an MBA in Information Technology. I’m also a self-taught computer programmer. 

So currently I am a software engineer this is my first job in IT and I am making 60K...again just starting out.
My fiancé also makes 60K.

I feel my earning potential is great and can probably make it to 90K in a couple of years of experience and perfecting my craft in programming.

So I beat myself up all the time about my debt, but I think I am going to be okay eventually.

We are currently saving to pay for our wedding in full and buying a home with a 20% down payment and we will be able to achieve that by next year. Once we buy the home I am going to start tackling my student loan debt, but I kind of wanted to do it by myself.

I don’t think it is fair for my fiancé to feel financially responsible for my life decisions. He has offered to help me multiple times because he has saved more than me. He is 3 years older and debt-free, but this is something I really want to tackle for myself.

I love my fiancé, and I am not marrying him for his money because I got my own, and I was not raised to take charity. I know I will keep getting better at my career. Am I being stubborn in saying no?

615,"My boyfriend left this summer for a job for three months. We are together for about 6 years so I know his parents and we have an ok relationship. This is the first time he is out of town for a period this long, and, because he is a only-child, his parents miss him a lot. I think that his mother, who is generally ok, sometimes overdoes it . 
She is always inviting over their house for coffee, she calls me and ask about my own parents etc. and  we communicate quit a lot. 
But from time to timeshe puts emotional pressure on me. She is being very dramatic about every situation and mishap. She even wanted to take me to the doctor, when we discussed about a health issue of mine (that I have under control for years). Or she always tells me how sad and emotionally charged she is for the fact that I can't find a job right know due to the pandemic. Things that I'm already anxious about and think all time!! The last thing I want is a person that is constantly remind me of my issues and even make them seem bigger than they already are. 
The other issue is that I am very uncomfortable around people I dont really know.  Knowing her and the family in general, after all these years, they are people that I would never be 100% myself around. They insist on the traditional roles of the ""family"" and she tries to ""train"" me into bring a good housewife. She hasn't forced me into anything but she always leaves hints about how her son, my boyfriend, likes being treated and shit like that. My boyfriend can shut these things down but right now with him missing I try to keep things as smooth as possible because any trouble around her and me will bring him into this.
So my problem how do I respectfully say no to some of the things she offers ( as she is a very emotional person, and she will take everything very heavily)and keep my distance when I feel like she crosses the line, and on the same time keep my boyfriend out of this?

He had a lot of money so he didn’t mind going out and having fun, it also helps how his dad is a legit millionaire. I’ve seen the guys mansion and cars. His dad owns radio and tv stations, hotels, and some other things. So this guy has a crap ton of money and power. Anyways back to Bill. So me and my friend used to hangout with him when we were 14-15 which was a couple years ago. He is huge into photography such as taking pictures of cars and beautiful things he sees on his travels, so we never thought much of all of his cameras and hard drives in his computer. Often times we’d spend the night at his house because late nights and he had plenty of video games and movies. We think this is when he possibly took pictures of us when we were sleeping. It’s rumored that he had hidden cameras in his house including that shower if so he could easily sell those photos and videos on the dark web. See the weirdest problem is that me and my friend weren’t the only ones that he spent time with.

620,"I’m a 25 F and my boyfriend 27 M is a great guy but whenever we’re drinking he randomly gets way too drunk and can be really mean. I somehow am ALWAYS much more sober than him even when I push myself. I have never once been more intoxicated than him which seems odd.
I always know he’s too drunk when he won’t stop blasting his music. He doesn’t seem capable of listening to me when he gets this way and sometimes it just happens out of nowhere. Once we were playing a video game and I was making jokes and he was laughing and then all the sudden he stood up and started getting really mad at me for making jokes about a game he liked.. even though 1 min ago he was joking and laughing too. I tried to calm the situation and say I’m sorry I like this game too I was just being silly to make you laugh. And then he just says fuck you...
I walked away at that bc I have been in a relationship with an alcoholic before and it scares me when the person I’m with switches like that all the sudden they’re not themselves..

Why does this keep happening? He is a kind man and supportive any time I’ve needed him to be EXCEPT when he drinks too much he can become this other person and I’ve told him it scares me bc I’ve been in abusive relationships and one with an alcoholic and it isn’t fair to me for him to act this way. I’ve told him that it’s incredibly disrespectful to me bc he hasn’t ever known what it’s like to be a woman and be scared the person your with will hurt you. It hurts me on a deep level when he drinks like this I don’t understand why he doesn’t seem to have that much control. 

Last night it happened again. I had three glasses of wine and was playing music and ready to go to sleep and he is blasting music so loud I can’t hear myself playing. I have to keep asking him to turn it down. I make the mistake of hanging out downstairs with him and then when I say let’s go to bed he agrees but then doesn’t follow just starts making gross food and so I walk away and go to bed. I started choking on some water really badly and he was aggressively telling me to come downstairs to puke and I kept trying to tell him I’m not really drunk anymore I just choked. He keeps telling me I am and that I need to get out of bed. I have to go downstairs multiple times to tell him to stop and I’m just choking. Then I leave again and I can hear him sassily talking about me to himself and cursing. Then he goes to the tv and can’t figure something out and I can hear him cursing like crazy saying shit I’ve never heard him say and I have to go down again and tell him stop. This happens several times and I’m really trying to be strong and concise about it just saying hey! I can hear you please stop I’m trying to sleep and there’s no reason to talk like this. He tells me to shut up. 

I have no room for this. I don’t want to waste my time with someone who will treat me this way. But he is also the most caring and supportive funny person I’ve been with and I can see us growing together. But if this continues to be an issue I just don’t think I should be with him..

Do you guys think he has a drinking problem? I have never acted this way even when I’ve blacked out.. for him it’s like this wall he hits and all the sudden he’s different. 
How can I address this again to make it stop? Is it okay for me to feel his behavior(especially given my circumstances on previous abuse) is unfair to me?

TL;DR 
My bf is a great guy but randomly when we drink he is an asshole. I have told him to control his drinking before and that it reminds me of my past abusive relationships. How do I get things to change?

I tried asking why she no longer wanted any intimacy and she wouldn’t budge on it, which sucked because we always used to communicate really well.

We were both going through a lot mental health wise when we started dating, and since then I’ve vastly improved while she unfortunately got worse over time. She doesn’t want to take care of herself, refuses to floss her teeth and gets defensive about it when I tell her it’s important basic hygiene (she had a traumatic dentist incident at a young age), and every day she feels less like a girlfriend and more like a responsibility.

Anyways he got custody because my mom wasn’t making enough money to be considered a good household for me to live in. 

Since then it’s changed and she now earns more than my dad but that’s besides the point. 

So my dad remarried to my stepmom about 4 years ago and she has a son who is my age, 16. 

So about 7 months ago we caught this kid masturbating to pictures from my Instagram. They weren’t even pictures attempting to be sexy either, just one I took while playing video games and one while working out. 

Instead of him getting in trouble, I did. My dad’s reasoning was that I was being a thot if my brother was able to jack off to me. 

His solution? No boy wants to masturbate to an ugly girl right? So he took away my phone and did the following:

He cut my hair into this nasty looking bob thing that I fucking hate

He took away all my skincare products and since I’m prone to acne that came back, and now my entire face is full of these disgusting whitehead zits. 

He force fed me 4000 calories a day (probably double-ish what I should be having) to make me fat. On purpose. 

So yesterday he gave me my phone back. Don’t get me wrong, I had used my computer for social media and stuff unbeknownst to him during those six months but I still was happy to have it back. 

That was until I opened up the front facing camera. I had purposely avoided mirrors for those six months because I knew I wouldn’t like what I saw. 

And I didn’t.

Now my girlfriend is really self conscious about how my mom feels about her, so I told my girlfriend the comment my mom made because I wanted her to make aware of the situation so my girlfriend could tell her best friend to be careful what she says on social media towards me because her best friend represents her. Anyway, she did that and her best friend freaked out and blocked me on all social media and said she never wants to see me ever again or have anything to do with me. My girlfriend is so hurt by this and she doesn’t know why she feels this way and her best friend won’t say why. I told her as she has other close friends that it may be best to stop talking to her or limit her contact if this affects you so much and you see us being long term because her best friend will get in the way of our relationship. Plus her best friend would be there for her and support me and her if she was really her best friend. I need advice on how to help this situation",10Aug2020,1

I’m referring to something that happened about a year ago. But it still bothers me because I liked her and enjoyed having her around. There was one woman who things went well with for a while but she ghosted me out of nowhere. We knew each other from a class and had lunch every now and then prior. We went on a date and it went alright but she seemed so anxious the whole time. Then she hung out at my place about a week later and all we did was just watch Netflix and some tv. I didn’t make any moves at all and maybe that was my mistake. But since she was a Virgin I didn’t want to push things too fast. She told me she wanted to lose it but not just to anyone. Since we’ve only met off campus like twice I figured I would wait a while until I made any moves like that. This last date was right before winter break though so I didn’t see her since then. We would talk and text a little bit since then but as soon as the next semester started she ghosts me out of nowhere. We exchanged like one or 2 messages on Snapchat right at the start of the semester then next thing I know she unfriended me. Probably blocked my # too since I never got a response from there either. So I just didn’t bother anymore since it was clear she cut me off. Idk why, she seemed to enjoy being around me but she was also so anxious at times maybe it was because she was faking being friendly. 

Either way I didn’t want to make a move because I’m always worried about them being an extreme feminist lying and accusing me of sexual assault later on",10Aug2020,1
639,"I'm a 36-year-old man. I've been married to my wife (43) for 4 years. We've been living together for 7 years. We have no children, though we had a miscarriage 3 years ago.

About ten years ago, I briefly dated this gorgeous fashion model who was 21 at the time. She's 31 now. Let's call her ""Jenny,"" which is definitely not her real name.

Jenny seemed completely infatuated with me from our first conversation. In hindsight, the intensity of just how into me she seemed probably should've been a warning sign for me. However, I was relatively inexperienced with women at the time and having this woman who was as close to physically perfect as anyone is act like I was the man of her dreams was a little too much for me to think straight.

We dated for about a month. We never slept together. We never used the terms ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend."" One day, she was putting herself down and I told her not to put herself down and she just sort of exploded, losing her temper, screaming at me, and ending the relationship over it.

Afterward, I felt like I dodged a bullet. I felt like the crazy, explosive person who dumped me must have been the real her that she'd been hiding from me up until that point.

Well, a little over a year after Jenny dumped me, in which time we'd had no contact at all, she contacted me out of the blue. She said she was really sorry for the way things ended between us, that she missed me, and that she wanted to get back together romantically.

This kind of scared me. Our relationship had been so much shorter than our time apart, and I wasn't sure what I could've done to leave the kind of impression on her that would cause her to miss me after all that time. So, I turned her down in the most firm but polite way I could. However, I did agree to become Facebook friends with her again.

About 2 months after I rejected her offer, she announced on Facebook that she'd gotten engaged to a man she'd met after the rejection. About 2 months after that, she and that guy had broken up and she announced she was moving across the country to be with a new guy. Let's call this guy ""POS"" and you'll understand why in a second.

While I have not contacted her or even commented on her Facebook posts, I have admittedly looked at her Facebook page a few times in the last few years.

POS is absurdly wealthy and, judging by the pictures she's posted to Facebook, he seems to treat Jenny like a sexual trophy. There are pictures of him groping her and/or reaching under her clothes in public. It's actually bad enough that female friends of hers have tried to do like online interventions. Jenny and POS have been engaged for at least the last 5 years but never gotten married and they have a child.

At one point, POS posted a link to a Youtube video to Jenny's Facebook page. In the video he interviewed her, and everything is light and airy until suddenly he asks her a question about the details of their sex life. She seemed very uncomfortable and he seemed to take pleasure in her discomfort. He has a youtube channel that's mostly videos of him doing things like skydiving or buying some expensive new thing, but there are other videos of him ""interviewing"" her. All of these interviews are abusive/offensive. 

Well, very recently, Jenny contacted me and said she wants to be friends and that she misses me. Again, the only time we really had anything to do with each other was the month we dated a decade ago. I'm not sure how to handle it.",10Aug2020,1
640,"I work in customer service, and quitting is not an option. I used to enjoy my job a lot more but lately it’s been difficult. People are just so miserable and lazy. They throw a tantrum at the slightest thing; I’ve never seen them this rude. (I had one tell me I was useless because SHE didn’t want to drive 10 minutes away to fix a problem that I have no control over, or power to fix).

641,"I'm a 14 year old boy and shes a 15 year old girl. We met online quite a while ago, we speak every day for most of the day. I live in Europe and she lives in the USA. 

Only recently, maybe in the last 2 weeks, she told me that she is super depressed and wants to kill herself, she even went so far as to tell me goodbye and that she was going to do it right then. I managed to luckily talk her out of it.

Here is a bit of description about her and her life and why she is depressed: her parents constantly shout and scream and punish her for the stupidest things, they go through her phone all the time, they even speak to her friends parents and tell them stuff about her that isnt even true so that their friendships end. Her parents have even forced her and her ex boyfriend to break up. 

Her parents somehow found out that she wanted to kill herself I dont know how but she told me they did. They havent done anything to help except for shouting at her for even contemplating it which obviously makes the whole thing worse. She tells me that everybody she has told about this before she met me just doesnt care. She lives in the South of the US. Of course nobody cares abot mental health there.

This is also one of the main things that makes her depressed, which is the main issue that I need to try and help with. Her parents force her to go to Volleyball practice which she hates. She has wanted to leave it for a long time because it makes her so depressed. Also to add to this, she has got a severely sprained and injured ankle from said Volleyball practice at school, at one point she couldnt even walk at all, and her parents still force her to go to the practice. She said it is one of the main things that makes her want to kill herself. It breaks my heart because I see her crying everyday because she has to go practice for 5 hours, and then I see on her social media that she has to pretend to be happy.

What can I do? Seriously. If I lived over there I could go and see her and comfort her, I could even try to speak to her parents. But I live so far away. When I asked her, ""why do your parents not let you quit?"" She stated that they never give her a reason. They just say ""You're not quitting, end of."" 

What can I do to help her? I care about her a lot and nobody she knows seems to care. How can I suggest a way of her to convince her parents to let her quit? Here are some of the things I've suggested:

For her to phone a hotline, she said no.

For her to tell her Coach for Volleyball and see if Coach can convince her parents, but she said maybe however her coach isnt going to care about her mental health either.

Please, please guys help me I need ideas",10Aug2020,1

643,"Hi, I (38m) live in my home town where my friends and family live. My girlfriend (28f), who also used to live here, moved a year ago to another city, which is 6 hours away for a job.
I recently got unemployed and she insists in me moving to her city and find a job there. To make things more complicated, I got a good job offer in my city, which I would have to decline.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to move for her and seek for a job longer. I'm in IT, so it should be feasible to find something. However, the wages (and col) are lower there. Also it's harder to find such a good offer as I got there.
Not moving would mean that she would break up.

646,"Simple story, my (23M) friend (20F) had her grandma pass away a few days ago. She still lives at home, and normally, myself or my family would offer to bring hers a meal, its a religious tradition in which we bring food to someone we know who has experienced a loss, so they can have more time to grieve and not have to worry about making food. With COVID thought, this isn't possible as her family is very cautious. I'm on very good terms with her family and she has never lost a grandparent before. Would it be inappropriate for me to text her dad who knows me well, explain the situation and ask If I could order them takeout? Would it be more appropriate for me to ask her and see what she thinks? Or should I just forgo the tradition and send a card? 

For those of you who may wonder we would hang out with a group of our friends weekly before COVID, but she does live an hour away, hence another reason bringing her family food seems unrealistic. Thanks for the advice, and sorry for the click batey title",10Aug2020,1

so basically, i want to travel with friends/family and do brunch and things like that and just have genuine fun but the people in my life currently i cant do these things with because they dont have the funds for it. of course there are things that i would cover like taking turns paying for dinner, airbnbs and whatnot but in order for anyone of them to go with me i would be paying most if not all of their expenses. i know i could go alone and do these things but i feel there would be animosity or resentment towards me for not including them? i'm 19 years old and i still live at home but i do pay bills, put food in the house, and everything else expected of me but i still feel like if i was to let my parents know ""hey im thinking about going on a trip"" they would expect to be included or expect more from me at home simply because i have money, and it doesnt bother me as much with family because i would do anything for them and i always do. but yeah, idk where im going with this but i dont want to go broke paying everyones expenses including my own and same thing if i took a friend. actually, i basically have no friends now because we cant do anything without me paying their way so we just never do anything. it's also hard for me to meet new people due to social anxiety and basic insecurities, PLUS i live in an area where there are more broke people than people who are well off around my age. i just dont want to be used because im the type of person to go above and beyond for the people i care about. but obviously with money in the picture peoples attitudes change fairly quick.",10Aug2020,1

649,"Background: 
I grew up in a small town, practically as a only child, but I am not an only child. My mom had me at age 41 and my dad was 46. They had my siblings when my mom was young. There’s a 15 year difference between my brother and I and a 17 year difference from my sister and I. We typically compare ourselves to the Griswalds from the Vacation movie series. My dad: creative, listener, but also hot tempered and Type A. My mom, opposite for the most part. Very bubbly and talkative, and loving. Maybe a little ditzy when it comes common sense tasks, but book smart and wise at the same time. My parents had always kind of picked for me what to do in my life. They signed me up for golf, show choir, music lessons, acting lessons,  violin, piano, and I had always been “destined” to go to IU (like the rest of my family). I had a great childhood I think. I ended up sticking with show choir and golf and singing. But it made it difficult for me to make decisions confidently on my own and still to this day, I ask for people to validate or tell me what I should do. My brother could be described as the character Gregory House from House. Deep thinker, great ideas, devils advocate, liberal (like me) and I have always been closer to him. Sometimes he can be an ass and doesn’t make decisions based on emotion which can cause us to argue. My sister is very republican, trump supporting, sometimes manipulative but loves to entertain, be extra, and loves to be dramatic and make things over the top. Which can be good and bad. Okay ... I think you’re caught up. Oh- and my dad just passed away unexpectedly a couple months ago. I am 25 and living with my now boyfriend who is 26. We’ve been together for a little over two years. I live 2 hours from my mom, my brother is now in the midst of moving to where I am at to be closer to my mom now that she is widowed. My sister lives about 6 hours away and I don’t think that’s changing. I’ve never wanted to move because I have anxiety about being away from my family and missing out on those memories. I never regret spending a lot of my weekends with my mom and dad. My dad has always been ill (8 back surgeries, 3 autoimmune diseases) so I wanted to always be there to spend time with him and my mom. I’m close to my brothers family and love spending time with my nephew and niece and watching them grow up. Okay still w/ me? Hopefully. 

Here’s my dilemma: my boyfriend wants to get out of the state we grew up in and move to a new city eventually. I use to say no, because of my dad. Even now w/ him gone, I get sad thinking about leaving my mom when she’s alone now. But I feel like something inside myself is telling me, though I’m scared, I need to distance myself from my family right now to grow myself and become who I am meant to be on my own. Has anyone done this that can give me pros and cons? Would it be worth it on the things I’d be missing out on? Again, here I am not being able to make my own choices and looking for help on what steps to take. But I would appreciate any advice or life lessons you’ve learned related to this. Thank you!",10Aug2020,1
650,"Any time I meet a new person I have extreme trouble visualizing their face. I could close my eyes a minute after seeing them and most likely couldn't put their face together in my head.

I can visualize the people I know well, but never people that I only met a few times. I recall having a crush in high school and for the first few months, I had to look at pictures of him and study his face if I wanted to think about him.

651,"Some background first, according to what my best friend told me so I might not have complete details:

My best friend (Who we will call Travis) and his childhood friend (Who we will call Randy) have been friends since they were kids. Travis is 25, and I think Randy is the same age. 

In 2015 they both went to camp, and one day Randy came into the cabin and tried to get Travis to talk to people. Travis has mild autism, anger issues, and slow to open up to people. Randy put his hand on Travis to try to get him to stand up, Travis stood up and threw Randy’s clothes to the floor. Randy threw Travis’s clothes on the floor for revenge. Travis in an aggressive tone asked Randy “Did you throw my clothes on the floor!?”, then Randy responded “Yeah, because you did it to me. Calm down bro”. Travis then punched Randy in the face, Randy shoved Travis to the wall and had Travis in a lock. A camp councillor broke up the fight, and ended up banning Travis from the group.

After the fight Travis tried to apologizing to Randy for the fight, but Randy refused and said that Travis has issues, and to back off.

Since then, Travis has been so depressed about what happened, and has so much regret. He said he didn’t mean to fight Randy, and really wants Randy to give him another chance. To this day, he can’t stop talking about the incident. Unfortunately he obsesses over past events a lot.

Travis said he tried calling Randy to apologize, but Randy responded with “You got the wrong number”. Travis also saw Randy in church and apologized to him, Randy responded “Don’t worry about it bro”. But it was still not enough for Travis to move on.

So I suggested he write a proper apology to Randy, since Randy had him on Instagram (He blocked Travis on Facebook). So he wrote the apology message to him on Instagram. Well, Randy blocked Travis afterwards...

Travis has been so depressed it and can’t stop talking about it. He’s also been saying some scary things before and after the block, like wanting to murder Randy, and kill himself. Those thoughts have gotten worse obviously after the block. Me, his mom, and everyone else keep telling him to move on, unfortunately however Travis is very stubborn and has a hard time listening to others.

What do I do? What kind of advice is there to give to him?",10Aug2020,1
652,"I am approx: 6'0 and I am overweight. Im almost positive I am over 200 lbs. I have been fat pretty much all my life and I've always wanted to lose it, but I just never bring myself to try. I find it really hard to talk to anybody about weight loss and help. I've just never been the type to ask for help when I need it. I've even been afraid to tell my parents for some reason. I even feel a little embarassed. I have no experience in weight loss at all though. Everybody in my family is overweight, even most of my friends are. All I know is burn more calories than you take in. Today is the first day I started to actually try but im not sure if continue to do this regular as I still have a hard time commiting to anything. Even with all the benifits of losing all the weight its just hard. I've had so much anxiety for most of my life, and im socially akward. I feel most of this is because of me just being overweight. Anyways, so far today I have eaten peanut butter on a slice of bread and some water. I found my mom's old cardio workout machine thing where you grab these handles and put your feet on these little platforms connected to the handles and you push the handles forward as you run. (Its hard to explain). After that I decided to run up and down the stairs until I felt like I was going to collapse on the way back down. I then went in my room and sit 50 full situps and 10 pushups.

He complained that “well why is okay for black people to use it but white people can’t” acting like it was some sort of injustice that he couldn’t use it. I sarcastically asked him if he was feeling oppressed that he couldn’t use a word that isn’t even his to reclaim and he defensively said no.

He claims he isn’t on meth but the kids have said they see him doing drugs and are aware of his drug use. The kids have been poorly raised, are frequently shuffled from house to house, are not hygienic, and malnourished. They curse and flip people off, are constantly in the principals office, etc. 

Last time I was home, they were living in a camper. 

My mom is upset with me for calling CPS because she said foster care is terrible and we have cousins who were sexually abused in foster care. She said I made the situation worse. I know I can’t undo what I did but with CPS involved already, I’d like to have faith in the system that they would be able to find a safer home. Anyone have experience with the system?",10Aug2020,1
672,"My mom got a Twitter account near the start of the pandemic and ever since its all she does all day. She won't talk to anyone if they talk to her (especially me) instead she will ignore you and continue reading whatever tweet she's on.
The worst thing is that shes addicted alt right conspiracy twitter and has become extremely radically right leaning because of this. She doesn't believe in the Corona virus and compares wearing a mask to the holocaust, she believes in the anti Semitic lizard people conspiracy, and she absolutely worships trump. 
Before the pandemic  she absolutely loathed talking about politics and but now it's the only thing she will talk about. If it's not about politics or how the pandemic is a democratic hoax, she will ignore you. 
Shes severely bipolar and twitter conspiracists have also convinced her to stop taking her medication because its government mind control... im so worried for her and I just want my mother back, its literally like talking to a shell of a person.",10Aug2020,1
673,"I completed my graduation this year and now planning for MBA-Aviation Management. 
Since my high school I have been mediocre or an average student with approximately 60% in high school. Then during the graduation also I was average, till the last year I had quite many backlogs, which I cleaned at the end but to clear ome subject I had to wait extra one year after completion of the degree and I cleared it too. In graduation also cgpa is 6.07, which means average. 
Now comes my question. I am afraid to face interviews just because of the thought insider me that what if the interviewer asked about my average performance throughout my school and degree and about the backlogs. I don’t know how to answer it so that I could be relevant enough with my answer and crack the interview.",10Aug2020,1
674,"Hi all,
So i always have a million thoughts running through my head at once.
I always forget things and when i do try and concentrate i over think leading me to mess something else up.

For example im doing an engineering apprenticeship (i’m currently at college)  and every single day i will mess up a workpiece im making, as i just wont be ‘with it’ and ill make something the wrong size or too small etc because im just not paying attention and thinking straight.

I’m also a massive over-thinker which constantly leads to me confusing simple things and over complicating everything.

Any ideas or suggestions?",10Aug2020,1
676,"Sorry about the formatting, I copied from the official sleep paralysis sub where my original thread was deleted for Spam... so..   
I've been having frequent episodes now, about 3 times in a span of 6 months.  I understand some people get them more, and I don't want to claim the  way it's been happening to me is special, rather I don't want to feel  like I'm the only one experiencing some episodes like this after reading  through other stories and them not matching my experience.

I  understand a common characteristic of SP is trying to cry out for help,  scream, whimper and it only comes out as a soft vocalization as well as  trying to move/push danger away. Well, I don't let out a soft  vocalization, and I don't always stay still. I react so loudly and  harshly it wakes up everybody, as if it was a night terror, but I'm aware of it when it happens, and I remember it on my own with little  effort (often accompanying by a little doubt whether I screamed or not,  usually confirmed by my partner which in turn makes me remember in more  detail).

As an example, and the  most notorious one for me was one night when we didn't close our closet  doors which is right at the feet of our bed. I usually like to close it  because it makes the room tidy with the big mahogany doors closing what  is sometimes a little disorganized. I was laying in bed facing up, and  when the SP engaged I was aware, but nothing was happening, I was able  to look around because I was confused from not being able to move, and  as I kept trying to make a sense of waking up I saw a big figure  standing at the end of the bed which slowly started to tower over the  bed, not ""lounging"" at me or anything, just growing bigger. It looked  like a Chernobyl liquidator if you are looking for a quick visual  reference, just overall dark with no distinct shape, if that makes  sense.

I went into panic mode not  because I feared for me, but because I was fearing for my partner  sleeping next to me because at that time I truly believed someone had  come into our home, so I started trying to get up from bed and throw  myself at this thing and screaming at it, but I couldn't. For some  reason, that's when the sleep paralysis stopped, and I literally sat up,  screaming my lungs out as if my body had snapped out of it and  immediately performed the action I was trying to make in the middle of  it.

It really hit me when my  partner woke up by my scream which I initially remembered as fuzzy, and  she kept asking if I was okay (after we talked about it later) but she  says I just moaned ""mhmm"" and laid back down to sleep just like that.

All  others have been similar following a pattern when I'm able to snap out  of them and react the way I felt I couldn't in the middle of SP. I just  don't know if it's night terror, SP, or a combination of both.

Anyone on the same boat?",10Aug2020,1
677,I had perfect vision two days ago but I woke up and my vision was blurry which didn’t seem weird because I just woke up.

Idk if this warrants a backstory but:

So today I'm cleaning out my mom's closet, ad I found this bag saying that was full of my old clothes. These were clothes we stored almost exactly a year ago with the intention of throwing out or donating, but we never got around to it.

Well, today while trying my old stuff on to see if I REALLY wanted to give them away I found an old jeans jacket I had that my dad accidentally spilled coffee on. At the time, my mom ad I quickly tried to wash it out, with no avail. Now it has these large yellow splotches on the back of it.

Is it salvageable or should I just throw it back into the Throw Out/Donation bin?

Would soaking it color safe bleach work? :(

679,"It’s been a good three years since I kissed someone- this is because I haven’t found someone I’ve actually been attracted to lol (until recently).
The other day, me and this boy (which i‘m actually attracted to) were at the same party , and he was clearly interested in geTtIng IntimATe. He eyed me over n we moved to a more private place.
All i felt though when it came to it, was dread , like only negative emotions- no excitement, or libido. Just anxiety. We sat for a solid 20 mins , him wanting to kiss me, and me turning my head away whenever he tried, and saying “I want to”, but “I can’t”. I just couldn’t do it? There was some sort of of physical block- I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t  do it- ofcourse i was  worried about my technique and all that, but I rationalised that anxiety - the block stayed though. He started kissing my neck &amp; shoulders &amp; I felt NOTHING- wasn’t turned on, and didn’t enjoy it. I try and make some kind of conversation but he was clearly just turned on ( and had a boner at this point) , &amp; i just felt extremely embarrassed aha (still am). The poor guy had to walk away without a single KISS. Right, 5 mins later with a bit of distance, I felt the urge and confidence to kiss him again, so I approached him , and went for it- lasted a second , pulled away, and said: “I can’t do this”. I just didn’t feel anything &amp; didn’t enjoy it. 
What’s weird, is that i want to kiss this guy &amp; all that , until it actually comes to it. Like if he’s in the same room, i‘m drawn to him. But once actually doing something is on the table, I just feel awfuL. Some insight: he doesn’t actually care about me, he just thinks i‘m “fit”, which doesn’t bother me because i was only planning to “have some fun”.

I can’t stop thinking about it, not because of the fact that I messed it up with the guy, but because i‘m confused at the fact that I couldn’t simply kiss him? That I physically couldn’t get myself to? I don’t get it, because I do get horny like a normal lass would , but I just can’t seem to at the right times.

I think, that I was so anxious that my libido was annihilated, so I couldn’t kiss simply out of hornyness - and I couldn’t kiss out of affection and love, because I don’t love the guy (he doesn’t care about me). 


Has anyone else been in the same situation? I really crave physical intimacy, and would love it , but can’t seem to hack it🤣 any advice? I’m worried I’ll humiliate myself again.",10Aug2020,1
680,"A few months ago I met someone and we eventually started to hang out a lot. We became very close friends almost right away and there aren't a lot of people that I trust as much as I trust her. Let's call her A. Maybe some basic information about her, me and my mother might be helpful.

A: I live in Germany, so my family and I all speak German. She lived in Canada for about 12 years and came to Germany to study. Her main language is English. So when she speaks German she tends to say things native speakers could interpret in a sexual way or in a way she didn't intend, which can be funny sometimes. She also has some problems at home, since her father, who she currently lives with doesn't always understand the culture she grew up with or human needs in general. So I try to include her in my everyday life as much as possible.

Me: I'm almost 19 and reached out to a therapist in March this year. I have some problems understanding/showing human emotions, which was often mistaken for autism. When my therapist pointed out that the actual reason for my problems might be (at least partly) my mother and my past in general, it honestly made a lot more sense to me than I'm willing to admit. I'm definitely starting to feel better now, but the fact that a lot of problems could have been avoided, if my mother had put some more effort into caring about me, still messes with me. My parents divorced 10 years ago and I currently live with my dad. My siblings (brother, 7 years old and sister, 4 years old) do not have the same father as me, so the only chance for me to see them is visiting my mother. My siblings are my favourite people in this whole world so I try to visit them as often as possible. Since that means I spend a lot of time in another city, I sometimes take A with me when I go there for the weekend. My siblings (and I thought the same counts for my mother) began to like A a lot too. So I thought everything works out, no problems, they all get along. 

My mother: She was diagnosed with a brain when I was 12, so close to 7 years ago. No worries, she's fine now. She has been cancer-free ever since. So she does have some mental issues and sometimes put that out on me. Which I never even realized until my therapist pointed it out to me. When she found out about A's current life situation she was willing to help her. She gave her some unused kitchen appliances (microwave and a toaster) and even called A a part of the family since she's basically my best friend. So I thought everything was fine between them and so did A.

Turns out I was wrong. Today I called my mother, because of a trip to the zoo we wanted to do next weekend that also includes my friend. And we eventually started to talk about A. She told me that some things about A do annoy her. I can basically narrow it down to two main problems.

1. My mother thinks A's eating manners are disgusting/ not suitable for children. She sometimes eats with her mouth open or makes noises while she's eating (such as biting the fork). Which isn't that big of a deal to me, since A is trying to change something about it. She just doesn't try hard enough in my mother's eyes. When we're eating my mother points it out once and is totally offended when A is making a sound again. She even eats in a different room. I understand that it bothers her, but I feel like she overreacts. She just does not seem to care about my or A's opinion.
2. A sometimes makes fun of my brother for not reading things properly. I will admit, a 7-year-old trying to read certain things, especially in a language such as German can be funny. But I wouldn't make fun of it in front of him. I told A that it can be very discouraging to make fun of him for that and A seems to understand. She just didn't have any contact with children in a very long time and is also dyslexic. So she doesn't quite know how to deal with children, specifically when it comes to reading. All in all, doesn't seem too bad to me.

The thing with my mother is that she is not willing to approach people directly in an eye-to-eye conversation. She just mentions it once (and in front of the rest of the family) and hopes the problem fixes itself. If it doesn't she gets offended and doesn't talk to you for a few hours. And if she does you can clearly tell she's still mad at you. Over the 19 years of my life, I learned how to deal with it, however, it may be hard for others to figure out how to communicate with her properly.

I'm willing to talk with both of them to solve that problem, but my friend also has some things she doesn't like about my mother. For example, the fact that she smokes in front of other people, even my siblings. Or the fact that she has three cats (Persian) and doesn't clean up the cat hair. Both of them seem valid to me and I also don't like it. Yet again, my mother is not open for criticism and will be offended if you point it out.

My mother always had some problems with not only A but also other friends of mine. She sometimes even tried to make me choose between a good relationship with her and that friend. Honestly, if it wasn't for my siblings I would not be in contact with her anymore. But they are too young to understand my decision. So right now I have no clue how to deal with the whole situation. I love my siblings and I don't want them to go through the same stuff my mother put me through. But I also like A a lot and don't want to end the friendship over some stupid issues my mother has.

Sure I could stop to bring A to my mother's place, but my mother would constantly ask me about her and occasionally even make fun of A. Which doesn't seem fair to me either. I also feel like if I decide to stand with my mother, she is going to do the same with either a future friend/ partner of mine or my siblings. And that's the last thing I want. So I really don't know what to do. I will talk to my therapist about it, but I wanted some advice in advance. 

This whole post might be a mess and I'm sorry if there are any problems understanding, but as I said English isn't my native language. And I'm thankful for everyone trying to help.",10Aug2020,1
682,"Alright guys. This is something I’ve been holding in for the past 8 months. Okay. Here we go. I moved to a new city around 3 hours away from my home in norcal. My cousin is an undergrad student at a college in this new area. First couple of weeks I’m getting my feet wet at work and then on a Wednesday my cousin trout it would be fun if I’d come along with her and her friends to a nightclub and then to eat after lol. I told her isn’t that kind of weird since I’d be the only guy in a group of 3-4 girls but she was like “no dude you’ll be fine and one of my friends thinks you’re cute anyways.” So I was like whatever and I just went with her. I met her outside the nightclub and hung out with her and her friends and we all danced. While we were dancing I started dancing with this other Asian chick. She was 🔥🔥🔥. We danced for a few minutes until my cousin actually started interfering and started rubbing shoulders with me. So much so that the Asian girl just left. I was heated!!! But then my cousin, who was wearing a strapless shirt started dancing in front of me. I was entranced and grabbed her hips and started caressing her. Then I kissed her neck and she was laughing. Okay fast forward, we’re all leaving from the club and she wants me to drop her home since all the friends left. Fast forward a little more and we end up at my place and she stays over and leaves the next morning. We haven’t spoken since and it’s awkward bc we go to family functions and just ignore each other. I think I have feelings for her but idk what to do since she doesn’t even look at me anymore. Wtfffff",10Aug2020,1
683,"Okay I know that seems like a no brainer, but hear me out. I made a throwaway account just for this, so you know it's important

I recently started working a new job at a chain restaurant, and luckily I knew almost everyone in the place except for three people, one of which being the man in the title, one of the supervising managers, who we can call James for this purpose.

James is wicked charming. Everyone in the cafe just loves him. One girl (another I didn't know beforehand) said she always hears people say that he yells but she's just not convinced because he's just too nice. 

He's also really funny, always roasting people. People always seem surprised when I roast him back for some reason

He always talks in his customer service voice, no matter what. At first I thought he just spoke to me like that because I'm young and a new hire, but it's been a few weeks and I'm pretty sure he just talks like that, which is in high contrast to his vibe (which is rancid) and is what made me suspicious of him.

I looked up his name, there was a local news article about him from a few years back about how he strangled a woman and is now a felon. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in the cafe who knows this and the only one who picks up a bad vibe from him. 

I see right through his facade and yet he still charms me into being excited about the most boring parts of my job. Why can't I break the spell? Some people have told me to just call him a wife beater and tell him to fuck off but I'm not sure I even could if I wanted to.

Yesterday we were alone in the cooler for a moment looking for something, and I realized that that was probably one of the only situations we'd be alone together without me specifically requesting it. I came really close to saying something to him, but chickened out because I'm 20 years younger, a foot shorter, and 50 pounds of muscle lighter than he is. 

TL;DR: I work with a man called James who's extremely charming and everyone likes, and has been nothing but great to me. But I'm very scared of him, and found out he strangled a lady a few years back

I think he knows I'm suspicious of him, should I talk to him about it or is that a bad idea? And what would I even say?? Please help oh wise r/advice",10Aug2020,1

686,"In the short time we’ve been together we’ve gotten pretty close and serious (exclusive, although we don’t refer to each other as bf and gf). We live in different towns but we’ve been spending time together every two weeks or less, things feel amazing when we’re together and there is definitely a beautiful mutual connection between us in all fields.

Now the thing is, when we’re not together she is very busy with work or her own friends and we don’t talk that much. I feel like she seems uninterested in developing our connection when we’re apart and that definitely hurts me a bit. I don’t try to push or pressure her and if she’s not responding I just let her be and won’t bother her at all. Usually our text exchanges last for five minutes and then she says she has to go to bed or to work or to meet a friend. We also have never talked on the phone (although I have suggested it) or video chatted. Ever!

I’ve brought this issue up some weeks ago and mentioned that maybe we weren’t a good match since it kind of made me feel sad and even a bit stressed because I don’t feel safe about investing in the relationship. She told me she has feelings for me but things take a bit longer to develop for her. She asked me to keep seeing her for a bit longer and see if it feels any better. She also sets dates and always seems excited about being around me in person.

I thought after our talk maybe she would be a bit more sensitive to this and make an effort but just this past weekend she went away with a friend and barely spoke to me at all in two days.

I do really like her, and trust her, and understand and respect her independence, but I wish I could feel that typical burn when you first meet someone new. You just want to talk with them all the time, and know all about them, and understand and dive deep into who they are and what they’ve done with life so far. It's not that I need that to be happy, it's that considering we don’t see each other very often I feel like at this point in the relationship there should be a slight mutual effort to create this connection that can’t develop naturally in person as it should in a traditional situation.

I do look forward to being with someone with whom I can share my day with and some of those superficial (or not so much) details about life that people that are close talk about. I’ve been trying to understand her way of acting but I’m also beginning to feel like I’m trying to normalize a situation that is actually not very normal or healthy if we’re trying to build something together.",10Aug2020,1
687,"I have an older neighbor, ""Mr. W."" Over the past five-ish years that we've been neighbors, we've been cordial but not close. Mr. W's townhouse is about 15 feet away from my backyard. 

I've been getting some red flags from Mr. W, but nothing is so extreme that it affects my day-to-day life. In an early conversation, Mr. W essentially admitted to spending his post-retirement days online telling other people they're wrong. (I learned this because Mr. W will talk your ear off for 45 minutes or more, ignoring cues that you need to leave or want to end the conversation.) Mr. W also makes passive aggressive comments about my dog, which I mostly just ignore. My neighbor tells me that any time someone nearby does a home improvement project, Mr. W asks for the contractor's contact information. Yet, after contacting the contractor will always decide that the service is too expensive. In short, Mr. W is a busybody, but mostly harmless. 

Last summer, my spouse and I experienced a weird phenomenon. We ate dinner in our fenced yard between 8 and 9 p.m. on a warm night. While we ate, we played jazz music on a Bluetooth speaker at a volume low enough that we could easily speak over it. As I carried my dishes into the house, I noticed a police cruiser parked in the alley behind my fence. (The fence was too tall for me to see the car until I was indoors.) When I finished carrying things inside and shut off the outdoor lights, the cruiser moved on. ""Did the police think something suspicious was going on in my yard?"" I thought. This memory came back to me because my spouse and I were hosting a friend in our garden for a late dinner last week. As the three of us chatted (no music, and we had not been drinking), I heard a weak voice from the alley. (Couldn't see the person through the fence.) It was between 10 and 10:30 p.m., and we were winding down our visit. Afterwards I asked my spouse ""Was the person in the alley talking to us? Was that Mr. W asking us to 'keep it down'?"" I thought nothing of being in our yard because that's the only safe place to socialize during Covid. As well, most of the homeowners in the area use window unit a/c, which is drowns out most outdoor noise. Also, there is always nighttime noise in the summer: One neighbor has been hosting parties with music and children outside screaming after 11 p.m. on weeknights; many people in the neighborhood set off fireworks between 10 and 11 p.m. all summer long; a mentally unwell man regularly walks down the sidewalk yelling at himself in the late night hours; and some neighbors kennel their dogs outside overnight. I do not want to add to the noise gratuitously, but I am also not going out of my way to be quieter than many people living nearby. 

What course of action would you recommend? I could just ignore my cranky neighbor altogether and hope that the police aren't called again. I could confront my neighbor. I could change my behavior by making sure to be indoors earlier, but that feels like conceding a loss just because someone else is overly cranky.",10Aug2020,1
688,"Good day my fellow Editors. I need work related advice. I will keep this as short as possible. Recently I applied for the Position of Podcast Producer and Podcast Editor through LTVPlus. After I sent my resume the recruiter was quite impressed by my credentials. I was further asked to send in a short video on why I was the perfect fit for both roles as Podcast Producer and Podcast Editor. I recorded the video and sent it to the recruiter who in turn also sent it to the client. They loved that I had the experience and knowledge of the roles. I was then asked what my asking salary was.

Now before I go further let me just say that the salary was put in the job description the recruiter had posted. Unfortunately any Post-Production specialist would easily know at first glance that the offered salary was too low for what the client was asking for. Even when I contacted the recruiter the first time I said that I had seen the pay and would like to negotiate because the salary and job description just doesn't add up. The pay offered is $1500 per month and the job description of ""BOTH"" Podcast Producer and Podcast Editor is to do entire concept planning of the show per episode, script development, managing the entire podcast per episode, transcribe audio, find guests and interview them, edit the podcast and do further full- post-production and much more.

Essentially as you can tell I would be doing the job of a team as one man. I haven't even covered half of what the client is asking for. The job description also said the job would entail 80 hours per month. Keep in mind the client was asking for 2 roles to be filled in the form of Podcast Producer and Podcast Editor I am sure I would exceed 80 hours in a month of the roles. So back to the salary negotiation. I decided to do research on the market related salary on only a Podcast Producer to be sure that it fits with what I had in mind and I was right. The average market related salary for a Podcast Producer is $5427-$6000. I gave the recruiter a range of between $4300-$4800 just to play it safe.

The recruiter told me it is a bit too high for what they planned on paying. So I re-negotiated and gave a range of $2200-$2500. The recruiter still wasn't happy. Keep in mind that even though I have to fill two jobs I gave a salary range for a position of one. I did this just to play it safe. The recruiter told me that the job would actually be part-time most of the time. I had trouble believing this based on the description that was advertised. The recruiter told me she would share my salary range with the hiring manager and get back to me. We last spoke last week Friday and now it is Monday evening. I am anxious. I need the job and I need to support my father, mother, brother and auntie since lockdown has really messed up our finances.

The salary offered also wouldn't be enough for my family to survive. I don't know if it is too early to do a follow up with the recruiter. I am thinking of sending an email to the recruiter and telling her I will take what ever they can offer even though I will be over working myself for a salary that doesn't even match the job description, my expertise and experience. Did I do something wrong? Should I just have taken the low offer?",10Aug2020,1

693,"I am getting married this month and want to step up my game as a gift to my spouse. We've been living together for years and he does at least 50%, if not more, around the home. I always thought I was raised in a fairly clean and orderly home, but his parents are on a totally different level of clean. And I like it to be honest. It is just that I don't ""see"" the dirt as he does. Mind you, our home is quite orderly and (in my opinion) pretty clean, floors and surfaces are uncluttered, laundry always done. But it is nowhere near clean as he likes it, I know that even if he is nice about it. 

How do I get better? See it as a wedding gift for him ;)",10Aug2020,1
694,"So, the other day my boyfriend broke up with me. It was truly unexpected, everything was fine between us. He was supposed to come to my house on Friday, the night before he was talking about how excited he was to see me. Everything was normal in the morning, then a little while before he was supposed to come over, he texted me asking if we can talk at the park. Just by him saying he wanted to talk.. I knew he was going to break up with me. 

I met up with him and he explained that right now wouldn’t be the best time to be in a relationship. He went on about how it upsets him that we can’t see each other often (we live 40 minutes away + covid) He also went on to say that he doesn’t want to make me feel like I’m waiting for him. 

I was very confused by this. I know this doesn’t make a difference because feelings change but, we both understood our distance and understood we’d have to play everything safe due to covid. Like, I feel this could have been a conversation that we work out, not a break up. 

After I left the park, I went home and obviously was in my feelings. After a couple hours, he texted me and told me he loved me, to which I asked if we could talk. We spoke on the phone and for about an hour or so we talked about the situation. After that, it’s as if nothing happened. Like, back to normal. We talked on the phone for  4 more hours and it was as if we never broke up. Then he told me he regretted doing that. 

So, here we are now. Monday. Everything still is like how we normally are together. There’s a tiny bit of awkwardness that lingers but, he told me he missed me. 

I’m not quite sure what to do in this situation, or how to handle it. It seems he wants to get back together, and make it right. Any advice?",10Aug2020,1
695,Okay so I've been having this problem lately with my girlfriend where I would just randomly get upset about the things she's done in her past like her smoking. She used to smoke for like a year but she stopped after she started dating me and after she saw that I didint like people who smoked. But after the 3 month mark for some i reason I can't get past the fact she used to smoke and she has videos of her smoking in her spam that I watch often which gets me upset. It just dosent seem like her or who she is to smoke. I do have anxiety and ocd so its just really hard for me to get these thoughts out of my head even though I know their irrational. My gf says I make her feel ashamed and I hate making my gf sad as she don't deserve me treating her bad. When I get in bad moods I usually just say that I hate you smoking or ill start bringing up her bestfiend who smokes. I just want to stop overthinking about this.,10Aug2020,1
696,"This is a throw away.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years ago my wife fell pregnant with our forth child something we were extremely excited about, at 25 weeks we found out we were have a boy, and telling my other 2 daughters and our son was exciting for them as well, at 32 weeks my wife had slipped on the stairs and landed on her stomach, sadly we lost our son.

We both went to therapy and after 18 months both us and our therapist decided we good enough to stop our sessions.

Well 2 weeks ago while I was at work my wife took a pregnancy test, it came up positive, she didn't tell me as she left before I got home from work for a family emergency, I found the pregnancy test in the bathroom and it brought everything back. I couldn't get in touch with her while she was away she was in a area with no service so I waited until she got back, to which she knew the moment that she saw me that I knew, she broke down, we sat and both cried for awhile before we talked about how to get through this.

She is against abortion which I would never ask her to do, and adoption is not an adoption.

my wife is now 12 weeks along and she has slowly started to fall in love with our unborn baby, Sadly for me it's been so much harder. For me I feel like i'm replacing my unborn son, It's not something That I like to think about.

I'm not trying to be the bad guy here but I cant seem to love my unborn child while constantly having the heartbreak of losing another.",10Aug2020,1
697,"There's this amazing woman (F26) whom I (M29) have gone out with a few times -- simply the best I've met. We got along well, have many similarities, share philosophies and perspectives. Everything had been going extremely well, until one day, she abruptly started responding less, to the point that it seemed she was trying to cut communication and fade. She eventually said she just wanted to be friends.

I asked her why but she wouldn't elaborate. However, I think we've met under unfortunate timing:

1. We live in different continents and the few times we've met are during annual work trip.
2. During that same time, she was let go from her job and has had a difficult time looking for another one.

700,"A few months ago I met someone and we eventually started to hang out a lot. We became very close friends almost right away and there aren't a lot of people that I trust as much as I trust her. Let's call her A. Maybe some basic information about her, me and my mother might be helpful.

A: I live in Germany, so my family and I all speak German. She lived in Canada for about 12 years and came to Germany to study. Her main language is English. So when she speaks German she tends to say things native speakers could interpret in a sexual way or in a way she didn't intend, which can be funny sometimes. She also has some problems at home, since her father, who she currently lives with doesn't always understand the culture she grew up with or human needs in general. So I try to include her in my everyday life as much as possible.

Me: I'm almost 19 and reached out to a therapist in March this year. I have some problems understanding/showing human emotions, which was often mistaken for autism. When my therapist pointed out that the actual reason for my problems might be (at least partly) my mother and my past in general, it honestly made a lot more sense to me than I'm willing to admit. I'm definitely starting to feel better now, but the fact that a lot of problems could have been avoided, if my mother had put some more effort into caring about me, still messes with me. My parents divorced 10 years ago and I currently live with my dad. My siblings (brother, 7 years old and sister, 4 years old) do not have the same father as me, so the only chance for me to see them is visiting my mother. My siblings are my favourite people in this whole world so I try to visit them as often as possible. Since that means I spend a lot of time in another city, I sometimes take A with me when I go there for the weekend. My siblings (and I thought the same counts for my mother) began to like A a lot too. So I thought everything works out, no problems, they all get along. 

My mother: She was diagnosed with a brain when I was 12, so close to 7 years ago. No worries, she's fine now. She has been cancer-free ever since. So she does have some mental issues and sometimes put that out on me. Which I never even realized until my therapist pointed it out to me. When she found out about A's current life situation she was willing to help her. She gave her some unused kitchen appliances (microwave and a toaster) and even called A a part of the family since she's basically my best friend. So I thought everything was fine between them and so did A.

Turns out I was wrong. Today I called my mother, because of a trip to the zoo we wanted to do next weekend that also includes my friend. And we eventually started to talk about A. She told me that some things about A do annoy her. I can basically narrow it down to two main problems.

1. My mother thinks A's eating manners are disgusting/ not suitable for children. She sometimes eats with her mouth open or makes noises while she's eating (such as biting the fork). Which isn't that big of a deal to me, since A is trying to change something about it. She just doesn't try hard enough in my mother's eyes. When we're eating my mother points it out once and is totally offended when A is making a sound again. She even eats in a different room. I understand that it bothers her, but I feel like she overreacts. She just does not seem to care about my or A's opinion.
2. A sometimes makes fun of my brother for not reading things properly. I will admit, a 7-year-old trying to read certain things, especially in a language such as German can be funny. But I wouldn't make fun of it in front of him. I told A that it can be very discouraging to make fun of him for that and A seems to understand. She just didn't have any contact with children in a very long time and is also dyslexic. So she doesn't quite know how to deal with children, specifically when it comes to reading. All in all, doesn't seem too bad to me.

The thing with my mother is that she is not willing to approach people directly in an eye-to-eye conversation. She just mentions it once (and in front of the rest of the family) and hopes the problem fixes itself. If it doesn't she gets offended and doesn't talk to you for a few hours. And if she does you can clearly tell she's still mad at you. Over the 19 years of my life, I learned how to deal with it, however, it may be hard for others to figure out how to communicate with her properly.

I'm willing to talk with both of them to solve that problem, but my friend also has some things she doesn't like about my mother. For example, the fact that she smokes in front of other people, even my siblings. Or the fact that she has three cats (Persian) and doesn't clean up the cat hair. Both of them seem valid to me and I also don't like it. Yet again, my mother is not open for criticism and will be offended if you point it out.

My mother always had some problems with not only A but also other friends of mine. She sometimes even tried to make me choose between a good relationship with her and that friend. Honestly, if it wasn't for my siblings I would not be in contact with her anymore. But they are too young to understand my decision. So right now I have no clue how to deal with the whole situation. I love my siblings and I don't want them to go through the same stuff my mother put me through. But I also like A a lot and don't want to end the friendship over some stupid issues my mother has.

Sure I could stop to bring A to my mother's place, but my mother would constantly ask me about her and occasionally even make fun of A. Which doesn't seem fair to me either. I also feel like if I decide to stand with my mother, she is going to do the same with either a future friend/ partner of mine or my siblings. And that's the last thing I want. So I really don't know what to do. I will talk to my therapist about it, but I wanted some advice in advance. 

This whole post might be a mess and I'm sorry if there are any problems understanding, but as I said English isn't my native language. And I'm thankful for everyone trying to help.",10Aug2020,1

702,"Hi there, 

So my neighbor recently has had guests over and they have a dog. I love dogs and have no issues with his guests because it’s none of my business and we just generally get along just fine together. 

But, they leave their dog (sweet pit mix girl) outside in the yard for hours regardless of the weather. No shade besides the one their garage creates, no water, and they don’t get her until 3/4+ hours. She’ll scratch and cry at the door. 

My petty side really wants to go next door and ask if I can give their dog water because she looks uncomfortable (and hopefully that will let them know that we are aware of how long she’s been out there lol) but I don’t know if I should just go and actually ask them to give her water or have a convo and run the risk of getting yelled at. 

I don’t want to be rude or intrusive but I’ve been a dog sitter and walker for 5 years and know that leaving dogs out without basic things like shade and water is pretty absurd. Today it’s 85F with 65% humidity, so feels like 96F.",10Aug2020,1

704,"i’m a 20 year old business student and i currently work as an optometrist’s technician for an eye doctor who’s office is located inside of a popular supermarket. i got this job about a year ago bc my aunt is also a technician for this doctor and recommended me for the job. my aunt knew that i had hated my other job in fast food at the time and thought i should get an office job. i got hired and have been a technician ever since. 

my boss, the doctor, recently spoke to the manager of the store where her office is located and found out that the store is only renewing her lease for one more year instead of five. the doctor has been at this location for about 20 years and she’s upset that they’re only offering her a year lease and she’d have to take some insurances that don’t pay her. so she’s made up her mind to open her own practice elsewhere. she plans to have the office fully set up in a year from now. 

i’m about to graduate from college next year and have been thinking about my future and came to the conclusion that i need to get another job. preferably one that is in or close to my degree field. i’ve been looking into some jobs and have found one for a marketing firm that is perfect for a college graduate. it’s full time and offers paid training. i have put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into getting my degree and definitely want a career in the field that i studied in. not that i’m not grateful for the job that i currently have, but i feel like i definitely don’t belong here and think it’s time for me to move on to something i feel is better suited for me and what i spent years studying. 

the problem here, is that opening up your own medical practice is a very lengthy process and my boss would basically be starting from scratch because most of what is here at her current office is property of the supermarket chain she leases the office from. and our contracts with insurances we are providers for were set up through the supermarket chain. my boss plans to have her new practice fully set up by next year around the time i graduate college. but after i graduate i would move on to (preferably) that marketing job i was looking into. 

i’d really hate to drop a bomb on not only my boss, but my coworkers as well because someone new would have to take my place and be trained. i don’t know how to tell them that i plan on leaving after i graduate to a different job. what should i do?

705,"Hello. I work as an executive assistant for an executive in a large European company. When I interviewed for the job awhile back he told me the job is somewhat simple but if I want more work etc he has what to give me to get me more involved etc. I was like cool. It’s been good and I’ve learned a lot in the role. 

Recently we had a routine discussion about my job and he told me he’s very happy with my work and I’ve learned, progressed, etc very well and he thinks I’m doing a great job. He said for my own benefit he wants me to get involved in the next big thing that I feel is right for me (mentioned a few options, but told me it’s up to me). He told me there’s not much more room to grow in my current role as I’ve grown and know the department well, so he wants me, for my own professional/career growth to find what I want in the department and squeeze myself into it and learn the ropes. 

Throughout the conversation he reiterated many times that I’m doing a great job and he’s pushing me to do this for me, not because of any issue at all with my performance (“when the time comes for you to transition out, it will be work for me to train in a new person but I’m willing to do this because I want you to grow and I care about the people who work for me”).
Here’s my question - what do you recommend I do, and also, do you think he’s being truthful and telling me this for my own good, or maybe he’s trying to get rid for me for some reason and is too nice/avoidant to tell me to my face the real reason?

706,"Hey! This is my (19F) first post + venture into Reddit so please excuse any rambling points because I have no idea what I'm doing... I just needed an outside POV and I don't really have anyone IRL to discuss this with.

My family (father, mother and younger sister) have been living abroad for as long as I can remember. A couple of years ago, my dad lost his job and sent the rest of the family back to our native country while he continued to look for a job. About 6 months later, he was rehired into the same company around the same time I got accepted into a college in my native country. We found a new apartment and moved back in with my father abroad while I waited for the academic year to start.

My mother's side of the family live about an hour away from the campus, and as there were issues with transportation and the family itself (my grandmother doesn't get along with my uncle and his wife and three kids), we decided it would be better if I lived in dorms. I had been living in the dorms for about two and a half months (from January to mid-March) before the COVID-19 lockdown began. Since we were having our studies online and the campus were set to physically open in September, I went back to live with my family after cohabitating with my maternal side of the family from March to July.

Today, my father received news that the company would be cutting salaries and may be shutting down in a few months. He is planning on sending my mother and sister to live with her side of the family while he looks for a new job - again. Now the thing is, my mother wants me to leave the dorms and live with her. As much as I love her, she is a woman who doesn't really respect privacy and personal boundaries and usually ends up off-loading all her frustrations onto me. The living situation also ends up being one where I can't really focus on my studies. Living in the dorms was amazing because I finally had my own space and I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted. I made these amazing friends who all lived along the same corridor I did, and I had access to a library that was open until 2 in the morning. My father has told me it is my decision and that he'd respect it, but I don't want to disappoint my mother or force my parents to pay the extra 1.5k dorms fee.

**TL;DR: my mother who doesn't really respect my boundaries wants me to leave the independent dorms life and shift in with her and 7 other people. What should I do?**",10Aug2020,1

709,"Most of what I do for work since COVID has been from a computer chair. I have been keeping to myself and not seeing people but I feel I am both mentally and physically suffering from not being active/leaving my apartment. A few months ago I got myself a longboard and it's been great but I don't live in the best place to just ""go for a cruise"" so about once a month I go to the beach to ride up and down the strip. Fortunately it is a big enough area I can keep my distance from people or have the ability to take an alternate path if there is a crowd.

Yesterday was trip #3. A few hours into riding around this lady flags me down and asks me to take my photo, she said it was for her son cause he just started skating but it was an odd situation just to begin with. Somehow she talked me into it but then wanted to pose with me so I said sure but keep 6 feet apart. She said something along the lines of ""oh get over it"" then came over and put her hands on my shoulders and her husband snapped it on his cellphone. I was so upset and shocked and I did nothing but stand there. I should have walked away right there. I should have stood up for myself and my boundaries. But I didn't. I can only imagine how pissed I looked in the photo. 15 minutes later I itched my face on my shoulder (because I don't touch my face when Im out) and that immediately snapped me out of my mental fog and ran to a beach shower to rinse off fully clothed. Now I feel like I have to quarantine myself for the next 14 days. And the thing is THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. 

Maybe not the same situation but stuff like trying to show a cashier a bulb I'm looking for and they just reach over and grab the phone or a stranger trying to shake my hand and putting their hand on my shoulder after saying no. And every time I feel like I have had my space, personal property or my wishes violated and in the case of yesterdays situation taken advantage of. Each time I feel too shocked to react. I am pretty good about avoiding scams/chatty salespeople/bad situations but this is a totally new thing for me and I seem to keep getting caught in it. Sure maybe I shouldn't go where there are other people but I do my best to maintain space with others and its usually a situation where I HAVE to interact with someone or THEY come into MY space.

So I guess my question is am I at fault here or how can I handle these situations better in the future? Was I being too nice, do I completely ignore all humans until the end of the pandemic? My roommates opinion on the beach story was that it was assault and to just call the police. But I feel like I would get laughed at if I called that assault. Plus I walked into that situation and didn't immediately remove myself the second I got uncomfortable. Sorry for the vent but I really need to have a better perspective of navigating this because I feel like I have a good balance between being socially responsible and taking care of myself ... but I still feel like I am doing it all wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

In the course of 3 years (from 27-30) I got 3 of them, the first one lasted 6 months, the two others 2 and 3 months. In fact, the longest I managed to keep a job was when I was 22-24, assembling central units on my own for customers (I was self-employed while doing my B.A).

The other thing that hurts me a lot is what people say out there about people who have almost no experience at my age: we're supposed to be lazy idiots, bums, parasites, useless yada yada yada you know the drill...

So not only do I have to accept my current situation despite how hard I fought to get a career, but I also have to put up with being perceived as a ""loser"" in the eyes of other people, which really really hurts. Every day I look at reddit threads where people mock individuals like me, and I'd like them not to be so hard, it's tough out there already...

I don't know what to do now, I'm lost: an anomaly whose value out there ain't exactly the best. My only redeeming quality is that my family loves me, my friends to, as I'm a wholesome guy, but that's not enough, it really isn't.

It's tough, really tough guys...",10Aug2020,1
720,"Some neighbors moved into the apartment behind mine about 2 months ago. I am incredibly weirded out by some activity I see and need to know if I am overreacting/imagining things, or if I have right to be concerned and should possibly call police? 

1. Three separate occasions I have seen a black van pull up, guy driving gets out and escorts a woman inside who is carrying a single pillow and blanket. Man immediately leaves, woman stays. 
2. I noted the black van's temp tags as expiring August 4, yesterday I saw the same vehicle with new temp tags with October 4th now. 
3. I routinely see 5 different vehicles (2 SUVs, 2 vans, 1 truck) at different times stopped outside their apartment (in the fire lane right out front)
They leave their front door open almost 100% of the time, with 4-6 younger men hanging out right outside as these different vehicles come and go. 
4. Because they leave their front door open so often you can see right inside. The only furniture (after months of living there) is a card table and a few fold up chairs. 
5. The few times I've seen women, they are ALWAYS dressed in tight black dresses and heels and accompanied by men.

There are a few other weird things I've seen, but these are the big ones. I walk my dog often and their apartment can be seen right out my sliding glass door which I leave open to let light in. Hence why I have easily noticed all these things. If you believe in women's intuition, then maybe it is significant to note two of my other female neighbors separately mentioned to me how uncomfortable they are by these neighbors. 

So am I crazy? Should I ignore it, should I call the police? Thoughts?",10Aug2020,1
721,"I currently work in a casino as housekeeping, now I will say this is probably the best job I've had so far, however there are just too many things stacking up against it.

When I was hired I was put on mornings (6-2) however after two weeks I was moved to swing (2-10). The only way I can have a life outside of work is if I wake up at 8 or 9 in the morning, or wait until my days off which I cherish. Also swing shift management is... not that great, one supervisor is cool and doesn't try to bullshit you, another is alright except he needs to slow the fuck down (both verbally and physically), and another is... nice but super annoying (she just talks and talks and talks and has that annoying customer service voice), and then we have the manager (not the one who hired me, he's cool) she micromanges everything and refuses everything (I asked her if I can change back to morning since I started school, even told her it didn't have to happen for six months and she straight up said no despite another manager saying he'll ask morning shift).

Last night was supposed to be my first day off, yet I get a call from my least favorite manager asking why I never showed up for my shift... apparently they changed my days off from sun-mon to mon-tue and never bothered to tell me, (she also waited until the end of said shift to call so it's not like I could have just came in late or whatever so now to avoid points I need to come in today.

It's just bullshit right now, I put in some PTO so I can go fetch my mom from Washington, and it's pointless since I have two of the three days off anyway and now I need to try and get the other day I originally had off, off.

I just started a business degree, might look into some political science or something because I've decided I'm going to run for president when I'm 33 (I'm 24).",10Aug2020,1

723,"My partner booked us tickets to go on vacation that he paid for 100% out of pocket. Now, I didn't know this before he booked it, but the flight includes a 19 hour layover at an airport in the USA. Naturally, not being Americans, I won't be able to leave the airport.

There are sleeping pods but you can only sleep in them for a maximum of 20 minutes (and I'm not sure they will be available during the pandemic either, I'll check soon).

So we will have to sleep on benches or even on the floor.

734,"Hi everyone, I guess I am looking for advice on how to overcome this problem. Essentially I feel as though I get too invested in friendships, for example, if one of my friends does something that I would personally never do to them because I value and cherish them, is that I become quite sad about it, it affects me and takes my focus away, i feel quite betrayed and saddened by their action. I wish I would develop this habit of not caring, where I could just brush it off and not let it affect me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem I find is that I like people. I like talking to them, discussing things and vibing with them. I hate being alone (not because I am not interesting enough to do things on my own) but its the loneliness i guess, I find chilling with people is 100x better than chilling alone, I dont know why. Due to this lockdown and quarantine I find it quite difficult to getting to terms with being on my own and doing my own thing. 

I would really appreciate if anyone could give me some life lesson, advice or general thoughts on the 2 points i mentioned.

Have a great day.",10Aug2020,1

My mother left me with my dad when I was three because she thought that it would help her end generational abuse pattern. We have always been in contact and I see her monthly, but not at all close.

How can we be supportive of one another? What are some of the dynamics at play here? It is hard to see from the inside out when we don't know what one another are looking for.

How should I approach this?

Side note, I tried asking her what she wants in life, and she said she’d like a simple one. I think that’s an excuse. A simple life does not mean being half assed and letting bad habits stay. You still have to work for it. I didn’t say I thought her “simple life” was an excuse though. 

To be clear, I only told her I thought she was unhappy. I hope at least that has got her thinking. The reason I’m asking whether I should apologize (or do something else) is she hasn’t been responding to my texts. She also told me she would text me but never did.",10Aug2020,1

Last semester, my parents pulled me out of college because it was too expensive. I proceeded not to get into the schools I applied to and am now having to take a semester off. Yesterday morning, my girlfriend of over two years stopped by and told me she wants to take a break for this semester so that we can both try being single and apart from one another for a while (so that we can try to get our shit together). It seems a lot easier for her to say. She's a senior in college. I should be a sophomore. She has her life ahead of her and I'm stuck here like a loser. Ive applied for several jobs but they haven't gotten back to me. I've lost a great deal of friends who have returned to college. Without anyone here to help me it feels like I'm getting worse and worse every day.

I think about suicide every day. It's been like this for weeks. My mother is abusive and my father won't stop her. I want an apartment but I feel stuck. And living away from my family could be incredibly dangerous for me.

I just need to know what to do. I have just sat around for days. I feel empty and underappreciated. I feel dumb and fucking worthless. My mom told me I was a failure and I see it.

Now he finally got a smartphone, but as always he doesn't answer calls, you send him the shortest audio notes possible, he listens only to the first and doesn't answer.

Another day I asked him why, he said he 'doesn't have time'. I read between the lines, as I know him so well: he is actually busy at the garage most of the time and often complains he wanted to raise enough funds to expand and finally offload himself from actually fixing the cars and buy himself some time. So he thinks he is saving a huge amount of time by just not picking ANY calls, not answering ANYTHING, so if you need him, the only way is to move your ass over to the garage...

I thought i was tough, got into martial arts, even became national champion once so i was pretty convinced that i was a tough masculine guy. At the time i wasn't interested in reading stuff on Internet and I'm 19 now and haven't had any romantic partners, even my father once thought i was gay cuz i wouldn't bring girls home lol. After quarantine i don't feel like going out of my room unless it's necessary but yeah i would like to have a big group of friends and go out but i think i don't have skills to do That, It feels like I'm all alone here like i never feel like i need help or asking for help, but my first inclination would be feeling like I'm stuck and can't use my mind when i find myself in challenging situations. I think i should get used to thinking on my feet. 

The only people i talk to face to face when I'm home are my mom and sister, am not good at small talks and they know that as well so when I started talking about something I've read on Internet like it's the coolest thing ever they'd just pretend listening to me and i wouldn't realise that at the moment but they know that them listening to me kinda makes me satisfied. Recently i was trying to explain how MBTI(its about brain functions and personality types) stuff works works but I couldn't pull it off and my mum said i don't understand laughing, and i laughed it off but i couldn't say anything more, my mood went down and I felt there's something wrong with me so i went to my room. I clearly know that she wasn't being rude or something and even if she did i don't care but I'm concerned about what happened to me there and i don't even know what to address it as. 

First time i felt this way was when I was in a fight in 8th grade, I got stunned while fighting, that's what made me get into martial arts i thought i was scared. Recently, i was in a party with friends and all of them were drinking and a friend was kinda starting a trouble (we're not that close but we know each other for like 4 years) so i grabbed his hand to get him to a room and he suddenly started saying _Yo, you have no rights to grab me, dude_and i was kinda stunned and got upset, didn't know what to do next (I'm not trying to brag, I'm 6'1 and 180 lbs, I'm confident that i can bear the hell out of him in a fight) my mood suddenly went down. I have so many incidents like this of me feeling that way suddenly in such situations i wouldn't know know how to respond, i think I'm highly sensitive. So i idk what it was or what to call it and i feared it the most and that made me lose so many stuff in life and almost made me lose all my teenage years.

745,"I'm really trying to kick bad habits and become a hard worker, but I'm finding it really difficult to make the transition so I'm asking for advice. Any advice would be appreciated, but I'm also hoping especially that there are some who previously managed to turn themselves into hard workers and have some advice to offer from their experience?

I'm not used to studying and hard work. In high school I did okay, I managed to get average or a bit above average grades by doing just about the bare minimum. I never really felt any ambition to try to do any better, it was just a matter of doing it because I had to and to avoid trouble. So I ended up with habits of procrastinating or just not focusing on studies.

People always used to tell me that I'm ""smart"". I don't feel smart, because I make dumb choices when it comes to academics, but I suppose in the sense of studies I am able to understand concepts quickly enough if I dedicate a bit of time to them. I once heard someone say ""The funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without having to do much hard work, but then in the moments when you do have to work hard... You don't know how to.""

Now, I'm in my third year of university and I've been doing okayish. I failed a few things in my first year because I wasn't used to sitting down and doing work. Then I adjusted myself to work enough to pass. So since then I've been doing okay but nothing great and I feel stuck in this rut of doing just enough to be okay.

But I'm no longer happy with that. I feel like I have the capacity to do really well if I get rid of distractions and apply myself, and I really want to do well. I've been working on improving my work ethic for the last few months and now I can get through my readings and lecture material without distracting myself, but when it comes down to actually doing work and completing assignments I still get sidetracked about half an hour in and my mind goes ""I can do it later, I'll still be able to pass either way"".

749,"My best friend is angry and depressed over a break up with his childhood friend, and I am concerned...

Some background first, according to what my best friend told me so I might not have complete details:

My best friend (Who we will call Travis) and his childhood friend (Who we will call Randy) have been friends since they were kids. Travis is 25, and I think Randy is the same age. 

In 2015 they both went to camp, and one day Randy came into the cabin and tried to get Travis to talk to people. Travis has mild autism, anger issues, and slow to open up to people. Randy put his hand on Travis to try to get him to stand up, Travis stood up and threw Randy’s clothes to the floor. Randy threw Travis’s clothes on the floor for revenge. Travis in an aggressive tone asked Randy “Did you throw my clothes on the floor!?”, then Randy responded “Yeah, because you did it to me. Calm down bro”. Travis then punched Randy in the face, Randy then shoved Travis to the wall, with Travis’s front side of his body on the wall, and had Travis in a lock. A camp councillor showed up and broke up the fight, and ended up banning Travis from the group.

After the fight Travis tried to apologize to Randy for the fight, but Randy refused and said that Travis has issues, and to back off.

Since then, Travis has been so depressed about what happened, and has so much regret. He said he didn’t mean to fight Randy, and really wants Randy to give him another chance. To this day, he can’t stop talking about the incident. Unfortunately, he tends to obsesses over past events a lot.

Travis said he tried calling Randy to apologize, but Randy responded with “You got the wrong number”. Travis also saw Randy in church and apologized to him, Randy responded “Don’t worry about it bro”. But it was still not enough for Travis to move on.

So I suggested he write a proper apology to Randy, since Randy had him on Instagram (He blocked Travis on Facebook). So he wrote the apology message to him on Instagram. Well, Randy blocked Travis afterwards...

Travis has been so depressed it and can’t stop talking about it. He’s also been saying some scary things before and after the block, like wanting to murder Randy, and kill himself. Those thoughts have gotten worse obviously after the block. 

Me, his mom, and everyone else keep telling him to move on, unfortunately however Travis is very stubborn and has a hard time listening to others. Travis refuses therapy, refuses to take his medication, is not wanting to take advice, and is continuing to rant about what happened.

752,"I've always had a solid group of friends to do things with in school/college/university. However I am nearing 30 now and people have been more and more distant. Understandable as people's lives become more about their partners/children. 

Either they can't do any dates or times or are extremely specific/picky about what things they are willing to do so more and more. Almost to the point where It becomes a chore to ask anyone and am having to beg or bribe. I am finding myself missing out on restaurants I want to go to, films I want to see, bars I want to check out, cities I want to go to, parks I want to eat a picnic in etc.

It's a new experience for me because I have always had *someone* to ask when in my teens and early twenties. I am working on making new friends and have been making a concerted effort since about 2017 by attending meetups, volunteering, joined a sport group etc. It's difficult because I do suffer from social anxiety but I keep trying all the same. Meetup is a weird one because sometimes it seems like people see them as a one off 'friends for the night' kind of thing but it never develops into anything more deep. Almost like a one night stand but for friendship. But I digress...

I know it isn't true but sometimes it feels like at my age people just aren't that interested in making new friends and are either wrapped up in significant others or have all the friends they need.

So while making more friends is a work in progress I thought it was best I try and do some things on my own because otherwise life will just pass me by. 

It's hard to switch off that voice that says people are judging you. I mean, I have rarely seen anyone in a restaurant on their own which doesn't help. I'm not sure why I feel so self-conscious about it. I specifically remember not being able to find someone to go and see Toy Story 4 with me and then chickening out on seeing it on my own because I didn't want to seem creepy going to a children's film on their own. 

I have a list of things as long as my arm that I would like to do. If only I had some courage to do them alone!",10Aug2020,1

756,"Hello!! (Trigger Warning to people who dealt with abuse/toxic families) I'm posting this on different subreddits and websites because I'm panicking and I need help. My brother has now become a threat to me and my mother. I am an underage overweight girl while my adult brother is 6 years older than me. I want to slim down but that's not what's most important to me right now. My brother is an ass; he smokes, drinks, and brings girls over to ""you know what"". I've been sick of it these past few months because corona has made me stay at home and have to endure all of this. Sometimes I can't sleep because of weed being shoved down my throat. So my brother and I got into a fight yesterday and he said ""you touch me and I'll hit you. it's self-defense"". He was getting all up in my mother's face, spitting everywhere, screaming at us. Mind you, this ""man"" is an adult. I don't feel safe in my home and I want to be able to defend myself. One day, I will give my brother the hardest punch known to man. He deserves it. My poor mother has an illness that depends on how stressed you are and you can imagine how horrible my mom feels. She's recently started losing her hair and her hair is getting thinner and thinner. We naturally have thick and kinky hair so she was very upset. My brother doesn't pay any bills, does any chores, and barely works. He spends his money on food (for himself and his ""girls""), whiskey, and weed. My mother has to do everything for him; help him pay his insurance, pay the phone bill, set up appointments, etc. My brother doesn't even go to school! I want to learn how to defend myself because a month ago, my brother grabbed me and pushed me down. I even have a scar that I can show to anyone who wants it. I'm just so upset and I almost passed out from an anxiety attack after. Please, if somebody can give me tips, videos, anything! I have no money and I wouldn't be able to afford real classes. I'm a beginner and I want to be able to defend my mother and I. I've tried asking one of my cousins who's a security guard to help but he says he's too busy. I'm in high school and I'm in advanced classes but I'll never be able to fully focus on my work and get good grades if I'm living in fear. Please. I'm currently shaking but I have to be strong for my mother. Someone, please give me all the information I need so I can kick my brother's ass and protect my mother and me.",10Aug2020,1

765,"Back in January I was driving on the motorway (UK) when a lorry driver hit my car after not checking their blindspot and moving into my lane. They didn't stop after the incident. Thankfully I wasn't hurt because they kinda just ""clipped"" my car and I was able to maintain control of it, but the damage to my car was unrepairable. If you're interested I posted some dashcam footage of the incident on r/roadcams a few weeks ago.

Anyway, because of my job, I had no choice but to get driving again once I had a new car, and that involved a lot of long distance/motorway driving. I guess this was a blessing because it meant I didn't have the choice to develop a fear of motorways after what happened. HOWEVER I am significantly more nervous when driving on the motorway.

I used to be a confident driver who wasn't really phased by motorway driving or driving near lorries in general. I used to think ""lorry drivers are trained, they know what they're doing"", until the day someone disproved that. 

Now, I overthink journeys (how long they'll take, which motorways I'll be using, what the traffic will be like) more than I used to. I HATE overtaking lorries because I get nervous that they're going to put their indicator on and smash into me like the other one did. In general I just hate being close to lorries. I've tried hanging back behind them but I don't want to be driving too slow that I'm a danger to other motorway users.

I'm tense and nervy for the whole journey so when I get out of the car my muscles ache. I also now get nervous about things that had nothing to do with my accident, like people merging from a sliproad or merging onto the motorway myself. I find myself more aware of ""bullies"" on the road who tailgate to make you either move out of their way or go faster. They used to not bother me but now they scare me.

I'm not letting the nervousness stop me from driving, but I would really like some advice on how to stop feeling so scared when on the motorway. I really don't want my nervousness to make me a bad driver! Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks!",10Aug2020,1

767,"Tl;dr Do I hang out with my spouses work friends again even though I had a terrible time last night? 

Last night Jack (34m), my son (6m), and I (27f) went to a bbq dinner at Jack’s kinda boss’s house. There was another couple there as well, Tom and Tracy. Tom works with Jack. I met Tom and Tracy on the forth of July and Tom got shit faced drunk. 

I do not drink, Jack does but he can handle his shit. Tom cannot. On the forth of July, Tom just couldn’t accept that I don’t drink so I already didn’t like him for that plus being super drunk the first day we met. 

Mitch (the kinda boss guy) was annoying. We were there for three hours and the first topic was how much money the guys make and complaining about other people in the company for at least 45 minutes. Tracy and I get along well enough and were small talking about our kids school situations. That was ok until Tracy asked me “so are you still not working or are you looking for a job?” That absolutely rubbed me the wrong way because her tone. 

My son was playing with Mitch’s wife’s dog and accidentally got hurt (totally my sons fault, doggo didn’t do anything wrong and it wasn’t serious at all) son got pouty and difficult after that. It’s been a rough few weeks for him because we found that his dad (who we do 50/50 custody with) is moving 9 hours away to be with his wife’s family instead of staying local to be with our son. So he’s been a little extra emotional. 

Son wasn’t being disruptive or making a scene at all, just quietly being difficult when I suggested things for him to go do. I have my son go inside and watch a movie. Apparently as soon as we went inside to get son set up, Tom tells Jack that he needs “get that boy in shape and get him off the teet.” Jack is great and defends me while explaining the circumstances. Definitely not ok with knowing Tom will say something behind my back. 

I come back out with all of the adults and the topics are Mitch going on and on about how he’s super buff (and he is) but trying to humble brag that he was also the smallest of his military guys. Then Tom and Mitch start talking about different types of steroids rather in-depth, ok cool, talk about whatever you want. 

Dinner time was ok for the most part. Son didn’t eat dinner because he doesn’t like to eat food he isn’t familiar with in places he’s not familiar with, yea it’s a pain in ass but I get it. He was quietly watching toy story 3 while we ate so not the end of the world. Talk at the table turned into Mitch going on a rant about his ex wife and how much of bitch she is. Tom knows her so he was contributing to the “she’s such a fat bitch,” talk. Then somehow they got to how covid is just the flu and it won’t affect them so who cares. 

There were some jokes and tidbits that I could participate in but not many. 

By the time dinner was over Tom was drunk again. It was like 7:45pm so I quietly let Jack know that we should leave around 8pm so I can do bedtime with my son. Fuckin Mitch brings over five beers and sets them down in front of Jack and says he drink those all tonight. Jack politely declines and says his current beer is his last. Mitch says “man, you’ve got to learn to party with kids around. They’ll eventually pass out and then you slip them in the car seat later.” I told Mitch no, that’s not going to happen. 

We leave at 8pm and in the car Jack is talking about how fun it was and how we should definitely do this kind of thing often with them. 

I absolutely do not want to do it again and the only reason I’d even consider going (and having my mom watch my son) is solely to be nice to Jack. I do not like being around drunk people at all. If we did do it again then I know the Tracy and I would be the only ones not drunk. Babysitting grown men in the late 30s is my thing. 

So do I just suck it up and go to these hang outs so that Jack isn’t the only without his spouse? Or just be honest with Jack and have him make excuses or something for why I’m not there?",10Aug2020,1

I have to wear custom insoles to be able to stand without pain and my orthotist told me to put them on top of each other but this stops them being on my ankle properly and creates a slapping on the floor problem as I lift my foot. There is also not enough room in my shoe for both the afo and the insole and I have blisters on my toes from my shoes being too tight, and yes I’ve tried wide toed shoes and taking there insole out and no that does nothing.



Private custom afos cost £1500, and I have contacted everywhere within 80 miles and cannot get a cheaper quote 


I currently have £40 a month left of my benefits for clothes and extra items or services. I usually spend it all on necessary things. My mum makes me pay for everything with my benefits.


That means it would take me about 30-40 months to afford these

Asked previously from other orthotist and they have also said things like this don’t exist.

773,"Ok! So my university dropped the obvious yet surprising bombshell that *all* classes will now be remote.  Now, a week ago, my uni had plans to have classes in person with hybrid schedules and safe social distancing; that all changed this morning when they suddenly decided ""everything will now be online, and you now have 3 days to decide if you still want to move in or not"".

I am 21 years old, F, and I am out of state over 100 miles away from home at school, If i move in, i will be allowed no off-campus visitors unless I walk a mile off campus grounds to sign them in to stay in a lobby area until i get my things to go home (I only go home on weekends and if someone gets me and my Support Dog)

Cafeteria food will be grab'n go, most rooms will still be doubles, and theres a good chance I get a room to myself and my dog. The only reason I am considering moving back in is because I refuse to stay home during the school year as I get very stressed in my home environment, I can't focus, and high stress levels impact my work.

I also helps to note that I am a year into a serious relationship; myself (F 21) and himself (M 23) agreed that its important for me to stay focused in my last year, I am a senior working on my BA final project and portfolio (art major). We have talked about moving in (please no hate or mean comments), but our restrictions are that he keeps his job in PA (meaning we would get an apartment close to his job or purchase an RV to stay in his parents vast huge ""yard"" of land. I go to school near New York, and have to stay on campus due to the distance. I dont drive, and I'm used to getting groceries delivered on campus. I'm usually introverted, so I would only leave my dorm to take my support dog out to do her business or to pick up groceries or art supplies. 

Options  overall:

1. Stay on campus, enjoy my peace of mind without having to deal with strain or stress from being at home with parents. Cons would be that I would be far away from my S/O. Last year we made a deal to see each other at least every other week, and so far its ok, as we make do with our daily calls etc. Cons are also dealing with a limited food option set, as dorms only allow microwave and fridge, and cafeteria ""grab and go"" (not good food)
2. My mother has offered to use the money she was putting towards dorming on campus towards an apartment near his work or somewhere between myself and him, so that way I could either live by myself with my dog for the school year, or if I so choose, live with my S/O. Cons - my s/o does not like the idea of her providing, as he is saving for another car atm he would feel as if he owes her (he does not, she adores him). Cons - I tend to need to be very alone to work on schoolwork or portfolio pieces and am still adjusting to working on my work and schoolwork while he does his own thing. I'm on the autism spectrum, so it takes longer for me to  adjust to slight or simple changes.
3. My boyfriend has considered buying himself an RV. though I am not too keen on this option, it would mean we could live comfortably together. He is looking to move out of his parents house as well, and this would be him having his own space regardless of if I go to school or not, and welcomes me to join him. Personally, i'm not sure I would like to live so close to his parents so long, they're wonderful people, but I feel like I wont get my privacy or peace of mind on their property.

775,"I don’t know where to go for this so I thought I’d ask here. It’s been two years since I’ve spoken to my mom. For about three years before I finally decided I had enough she kept accusing me of so many things that I’ve never even considered doing. She kept hurling accusations at me that i conspire with my dad against her, that I look through her stuff and other things that I’d rather just not repeat because they’re so disgusting. I’ve never even put myself in situations where things like that could be assumed. She kept this up for years. It’d flare up into these heated confrontations and if I defend myself, she takes it as being overly defensive like someone who has something to hide. And if I don’t she takes it as if I accept her accusations and pretty much admit guilt. It was just a really toxic thing to deal with. Driving home from work at times, I’d be plagued with anxiety thinking to myself “gee, I wonder what she’s gonna come at me with today?” It was the same deal with my dad, which is why he left like 6 months before I did. Just baseless vile accusations. She would even get physical with my father, trying to slap and scratch him. Screaming hateful things at him. Just pure crazed rage. For me it was a cycle, and finally, two years ago I decided, fuck this. I packed all of my stuff and left to stay with my dad and grandpa. And have been here ever since. For a time she would send me texts, which I would ignore. Most of them saying how she missed me and how we could start over as mother and son but I know it’ll just revert to the same old thing again. Then she began again, through text, saying things that really pissed me off. Things like “maybe the fact that you’re gone really vindicates what I thought all along” and stuff like that. I snapped back at her, telling her the only way we would reconcile is if she goes and gets mental help or something. This is isn’t the behavior of someone who’s mentally well. And that’s not a dig at people with psychological issues it’s just I don’t know what to think.

777,"My dad doesn’t believe in climate change, COVID, and many other things. I need help

As the title says, my dad is a complete idiot. He thinks that the coronavirus is a political issue( he thinks that  the virus is being overly dramatized so that no republicans will vote, thus, making the democrats win.) He also believes that climate change is fake news, and that it is just like the ice age, But hot. I have tried so many times to convince him otherwise, and he just says that my news is brainwashing me. What?

He also thinks that the BLM movement is just people overreacting because police brutality isn’t an issue/doesn’t exist

More than an issue of his stupidity, it’s an issue that he frequently breaks quarantine. That’s my main problem, he could potentially infect others because he thinks the virus is fake. I honestly need help convincing him. 

Unsurprisingly, he gets ALL of his information from Fox News",10Aug2020,1
779,"I (14F) female have been talking to this guy who texted me (19M) 

He texted me on a post I made about back pain (por los cenos) and i didn’t think much of it because it started off talking about Ghost Adventures and paranormal things. I thought it was a girl because I posted it on a girl subreddit but whatever, I didn’t think much of it.

It later progressed to talking about moving in once I was 18 and/or visiting him. We also talked about kinks which I have no clue how we got on the topic but it wasn’t specifically about if we were going to do it to each other, never had we talked about that just about what we might have.

We also talked about how if I ever visited then I’d stay over and we could cuddle.

I don’t know, I just don’t want to accidentally get myself into juman trafficking or something of the sort. I don’t want to be “groomed”, but at the same time it’s like should I even worry? This person is only 5 years older than me and my siblings are way older than that and I’ve never had a problem with them, not even their partners.

Mind you, this all happened in the span of 2 weeks or so which I’m honestly disappointed in myself because normally I don’t text strangers, they text me and I text for a day and leave it at that because I’m awkward over text. 

I don’t know, I felt comfortable? Like I didn’t feel uncomfy, I just don’t even know honestly.

782,"Two years ago while I was in school I worked a part time job. Once I graduated and got a job in my field of study I put my two weeks in and left the company. Recently due to Covid I’ve been working from home and have found that I have more free time since I’m not commuting an hour to work daily. So I figured why not make some extra money? 

I applied to the same company I used to work at but a different location. I told them I already have a full time job but I was looking for 20 hours or less a week. Now I’ve been back for two weeks and he’s schedule me over 20 hours and 8 hour shifts on days I already work my full time job. 

I told him I would like to have shorter shifts during the week (6 hours or less) and I’d be willing to work full 8 hours on Sundays. (Mind you this company usually schedules shorter shifts and when I worked there in the past they rarely gave me 8 hour shifts). He agreed and then I saw the schedule one week posted where I was given 25 hours instead of 20. I contacted him saying I would like no more than 20 and I apologize for the inconvenience. He said okay he would see if he could cut some hours the next day he went in. 

A week later and he didn’t change the schedule. I texted him again asking if he had the chance to cut any hours and he didn’t respond but responded in our work group chat. What should I do? I’m at the point where I’m so frustrated because I know I’m a hard worker but he is over-scheduling me and it’s exhausting. I have no problem working hard but it’s the lack of respect for my schedule. Any advice on what to say/do? Or if I should quit how should I go about it? I’ve only been back for 2 weeks but if he’s going to do this it’s not worth the stress. I don’t NEED this job.",10Aug2020,1
783,"At this point, I've been nomadic for at least two years... I think closer to three. The reasons why are irrelevant, but I am now at a point in my life where I no longer believe I will ever be able to maintain permanent housing for myself, or even find a place to attempt doing so.

I had two desktop computers before I lost my housing, and I still have them in a storage unit nice and safe and dust free. Both of them are very good computers, one is almost brand new. I also have a laptop, but the laptop is quite old... It does not have the ability to access 4G Wi-Fi for instance, only 2G, and it is somewhat dated. However, it's still a perfectly serviceable laptop, and an upgrade from what it used to be when I purchased it.

I would like to sell all three of these devices I suppose, and use the money to purchase a single high-end laptop that is capable of both running games as is, but also potentially upgradeable as far as RAM and graphics go.

As such, I'm looking for two different sets of advice:

1. What is the best way to sell the devices? Does the best method differ between the desktops, the peripherals, and the laptop? Or is there a one size fits all solution?

2. What type of laptops would work best for what I'm trying to achieve? Being very clear, I want a Windows OS... I don't want to deal with Apple (I dislike proprietary IP, and I already have a substantial amount of software for Windows.)

784,"I work in advertising. 

A lot of my job involves brainstorming with others about ideas for commercials.

I work with a guy who constantly comes up with ideas that are so over-the-top racist it literally makes my jaw drop to the ground. 

If he was an asshole or an outright racist I don't think it would be hard to confront him, but the truth is I don't think this guy even knows what he's doing.

He's very nice, a liberal, never ever says a bad word about people of color, and supports and donates to organizations like Black Lives Matter.

A lot of the time, I think he just thinks he's being funny and over-the-top, like South Park or Key &amp; Peele. 

He's intelligent about other things, but when it comes to issues of race, it's like he's an alien who has never heard of things like slavery or blackface or just basic History 101. 

The other day he proposed an idea for a commercial wherein two very famous Black celebrities would paint their faces white and pretend to Aborigines. 

When I gently point out that some of his ideas are racist or insensitive, he backs down and drops it, but I feel like he doesn't really ""get it"" if you know what I mean. I think he thinks I'm being your typical overly PC social justice warrior.

There are very few Black people at our advertising agency, and none of them work in the creative department, thank God. 

We are actively trying to recruit more diverse people and I worry that he's really going to upset someone one day and/or get himself in trouble.

Plus, you know, there's the fact that, intentional or not, he's being racist, and it needs to stop.

How can I confront him effectively? Do I need to be meaner? Nicer? Give him a book to read? It's like he needs a basic list of all the things we no longer do now that it's 2020. 

I should mention that I'm a woman in a very male-dominated environment. Bro culture is big here and women who speak up are often perceived as bitchy. This guy is well-liked and connected, so another reason I need to get this right.

Oh, and we're both white.

788,"So I’m a recent college grad, been working for this company for 2 months. At first I took this job because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to find a job during the recession. I thought I would like it, it’s a “service and sales” job (up-selling) and it’s decent pay with 42k annually plus commission.

I was living in an apartment with my friend and his GF but recently moved back in with my parents to save some money to eventually get my own place. I’ve got a pretty good amount saved up now and really don’t have any expenses. I’ve found tons of jobs on indeed that I could qualify for and have been applying like crazy, cause, well, I now *hate* the job i’m currently doing. 

The training has been ass, we have to remote into our work computers from our personal computers which has its own host of issues and they’re too cheap to provide us with our own equipment (which, is ridiculous as the company I work for made a couple dozen billion in profit last year), when I first got hired they said there wasn’t a quota, which was a lie, and I’m not a salesman nor a people person whatsoever. 

I’m studying to get into law school next fall, am looking for new jobs, and if I get fired I’d be eligible for unemployment which is paying just almost as much as my job is. And I wouldn’t be on it for long as I’m actively applying for other jobs and some I’m definitely qualified for.",10Aug2020,1
789,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for more than a year and a half now, and everyday i can’t stand his mother a bit more. 
I’m 18, btw. 

He’s the sweetest man, won’t raise his voice over anything, treats everyone with respect and never even screamed at me or anyone else by the time we were together. However, his mom treats him like thrash. He does not live with her, she left him at her parents house when he was 3, and he’s almost 26 now. She makes him take her grocery shopping because she dosent wanna “waste” her gas, tells him to fill up her car and pay with his money, makes him go to the other side of the town just to move heavy furniture for her, but she has a sister - who’s married with a strong guy and has a son the same age as my boyfriend - living literally next door and also has her other son (16) living in her house. She never ASKS, it’s always demanding him to do something and if he can’t or refuses to, she says he’s the worst son ever and that she hates him and he should’ve been aborted. She does it in public, in front of me and in front of the rest of his family. 

She sometimes makes some sexual comments about my body infront of their family. His uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents. It started when i was in his room (i’m usually in my underwear when there because his grandparents are really respectful about our privacy) and she just barged in. saw me “naked” and asked to take a look at my body. innocent me though she was just messing around and jokingly did a spin. After that, she started saying how i am “too skinny but still have some booty and titties”. She’s also EXTREMELY fixated in having grandchildren. I don’t want them, my boyfriend also dosent and we already made it very clear to her. She also knows i couldn’t have a safe pregnancy due to my body type (my mom had some very serious complications and a few doctors already said i would probably have too) as i told her that to see if she would stop talking about it. Even if i wanted children, im too young for it. 

The final straw was this pandemic. MIL decided to remodel her ENTIRE house, dumped her other son with his grandparents and constantly has strange men over her property due to the renovation. It wouldn’t be a big deal if she didn’t demand my boyfriend to take her to a home improvement store 2x a week. When i went with them and asked what was the matter, she said she wanted to take a walk and look around, didn’t wanna purchase anything. that left me angry as fuck, because that woman smokes and has had cancer before, so she’s in the risk group. her parents are 80+, and her father is diabetic and has leukemia, a BIG risk group. After a few days, she started getting covid symptoms and didn’t tell anyone, while continuing interacting with her son, unmasked (yes he wore a mask while with her). Then she asked him to take her to the ER, he left her there and gave her some money to grab an uber home. She got a few exams done and a covid test. It came out positive, which means she could’ve passed it to boyfriend, then to her parents and then to me, also knowing very well my mother has lupus. 

We quarantined for 30 days and no symptoms showed on both of our families, so we saw eatchother yesterday, but as soon as he talked about his mother i got mad. i just can’t stand her anymore. I don’t want to break up with him, but she has her lunch and sometimes dinner everyday at her parents house. My house isn’t the best option for us (parents are supportive but my room has a single bed). I’m tired of her talking shit about everything and treating my bf like trash.

I forgot to mention, I am 18 years old (I'm legally an adult in my country) and have had my driver's license since I was 16, but sadly don't have much driving experience because my mom gets extremely nervous when I drive with her even if there are no cars around or I'm driving slow and careful, the only driving experience I have is from driving school (which was almost 3 years ago) and driving both of my uncles cars (they even say I drive very good and only need a bit of practice).
I'm a car enthusiast and often share videos/ pictures of rally racing, drifting, and other things in my social media, so it could be that she thinks that I may grab a car and go full Colin McRae on a public road (which isn't true because I've never liked street racing or anything)

Now, a Mazda 323 from 1989 with only 68hp might not sound special to you, but for me is more that that, it is MY dream car, that was the car I grew up with, my granpa used to take me to kindergarten and school in that car, when I couldn't sleep he used to drive around untill I fell asleep, and made many more special memories in that old metal box, I don't wanna see my long life dream car being sold and probably scrapped as spares (a mechanic told us that for the car in that state we will only get about 2 to 3 million Colombian pesos which is like 500 to 800 dollars if I'm correct).

So, in a last effort to save my dream car I came here to ask, how can I approach my mom an convince her to let me keep that car? 

Thank you for reaching the end of my post.",10Aug2020,1
810,"This is a throwaway account because I am always anxious about family members finding things. 

I'm a 25 year old female whose Asian family are very religious and strict. 

These past few months have become really hard for me, my relationship with my whole family has broken down and I feel really isolated and depressed. I'm 25 now and my parents want to arrange me to get married, even though I've said I don't want to multiple times - I don't want to go through this mainly because I've started to question my faith and I can't reveal this to my family. My parents have spent my entire life shielding me from the outside world, I have only one friend because they thought friends would 'corrupt' me, I can't speak to that friend about anything because she's very strict as well. Life is getting harder and harder here. 

My plan was to continue living with my family and save up for a year then do teacher training for a year (I live in the UK) and move to Canada to become a teacher there. My plans has become a lot messier, I've done a lot of research and have found its really hard to become a primary school teacher in Canada and they won't accept my UK qualification.

I have a degree in education, I'm not sure what else I could do. The immigration process looks really difficult and I don't know what other jobs I could apply for with a 2.2 in education.

812,"Hi everyone, I’ve never used Reddit before but I need some advice and don’t really have many people to ask that would understand. My younger brother turned 18 this January and recently came out to me as gay. I am very happy for him and fully supportive. For context to this situation, he has Asperger’s syndrome, so he does have trouble with social skills and tends to be impulsive. He has been dating men for the first time. Yesterday, he told my husband that he met a man through Tinder and they are in a sexually active relationship which was surprising because he has never dated before and it moved so quickly. He told my husband he has gone out of town to spend the night with this man and such, but my brother still lives at home and hasn’t come out to my parents, so he is doing all of this secretly. He will be living at home for a while as he goes to a community college in our town. He then told my husband that his new boyfriend is 25. I was shocked. My brother has had no experience with dating, sexuality, just graduated high school in May, and is a bit developmentally delayed. Needless to say, I am very worried he is being taken advantage of. Especially because he doesn’t tell anyone where he is going and if he does it is a lie. It is very strange for a grown 25 year old man to be interested in a newly 18 year old boy with autism. My brother won’t listen to any criticism and doesn’t understand that he could be being victimized and not realizing it. The only thing I could do to protect him, as I live in a different state, is to tell my mom. Since he lives at home, she can keep him from seeing the 25 year old. My mom would not have a problem with my brother being gay, but of course if I told her, I would be outing him, although my mom already has her suspicions and so does my younger sister. My brother and I are close and I am so worried about him, but I can’t do anything from where I am. Please give advice on how I can protect him in his vulnerable state from these older men who could be preying on him.",10Aug2020,1

 she got  diagnosed  with bipolar  around a year ago but i feel like thats  more than bipolar 

, i always knew  she kinda wasn't  right but she was never this crazy untill lately ,  im her main ""target""  she thinks im a spy who  takes pictures  of her and send them to her ""enemies""   she also thinks her phone  is hacked by who i assume is her ex and she screams and curses at her phone all the time thinking  the hacker hears her , if i litreally  just looked her in the eyes by mistake she will stare at me for a 5 minutes waiting for me to look again to confirm that its a sign im spying on her , if im laughing  at my phone  she thinks im laughing  on her.

 everyday for the past  few weeks it gets worse i always tried to cut eye contact  with her and just ignore her but this isn't  enough she usually just say stuff like ""you think im not noticing  you?"" And apperantly  she's antisematist as well as she once told me ""you jewish pig"" (noone in our family  is jewish i have no idea why she said that) , i have anger issues  of my own and in trying to control  myself but it's  hard for me specially after what happened  today , i was sitting on the couch and she  came down from her room walked up to me and screamed at me ""fuck off"" along with alot of insults and telling me to stop spying on her , at this point i would  typically to back to my room to not escalate the situation but i thought  if i showed her that im not scared of her she would  eventually stop so i just insulted her back  and told her im not leaving , with more screams i just didn't  move and ignored her  , what i didnt except is her going to the kitchen and grapping a knife and trying to stap me (i dont think she was trying to stap me in a lethal way just pushed the side of the knife to my stomach) i  kicked her really  hard in the stomach she  fell then i ran to my room and my dad finally woke up to descalate  the situation  and drive  her away from my room but before she leaves she said ""its not over im gonna  show you"" .

816,"This all happened a few hours ago. I missed the train I usually take home from school, so I was sitting on a bench waiting at the station. While I was waiting, a guy came up to a machine next to me and began trying to order a ticket. Nothing seemed off, so I barely noticed him. Then I heard someone crying and looked over. His girlfriend was standing next to him crying and begging him not to be mad. He was mad. I don't know what she did, it doesn't really matter, but it sounded like she forgot to buy a ticket. I start looking over at them more and more as he gets increasingly angry with her. He eventually starts yelling horrible things at her despite being in a very public setting. I made eye contact with the girl a few times during this and the pure desperation in her eyes is the main reason why I'm asking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes they leave, and as they do he hits, kicks, and pushes her to make her walk faster. At this point I was looking around wondering why no one did anything, then I realized that I am part of the group I was cursing out in my head, so I got up and ran after them. The boyfriend, in his very masculine and mature rage, had walked a decent distance ahead of her. When I caught up to her I asked if she was okay. With tears streaming down her face she insisted that she was okay with a very unconvincing tone. I thought there was nothing else I could do, and I didn't wanna risk missing the train a second time, so after asking again and getting the same answer I went back. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I have done? This isn't just a question to make me feel better. I go to that train station every day, and I know what she looks like, so there's a decent chance that I will see her again at some point. If I do, what are my options? Should I give her my phone number? Should I confront the boyfriend? If I am lucky enough to meet her again, I probably don't have a lot of time before the boyfriend intervenes, so I'm thinking if I give her my phone number it might give me a chance to get more details and act from there. If he treats her like this in public, then surely what he does to her in private is worthy of being pushed onto the rails right as the train arrives. 

Also, why the fuck didn't anyone do anything? I am asking this, not because it will help better the situation, but because it genuinely frightened me. We were in a public area with at least 50 people who saw what happened. Most were grown men and a few were even soldiers who were still wearing their uniforms. In what world does it make sense that the 16-year-old kid who had his first day of school in like 5 months that day had to be the one to do it? if someone could give me some psychological explanation that would be very much appreciated. The other questions are a priority tho, this is just to make me regain faith in humanity.",10Aug2020,1
817,"I ended our correspondence two years ago because I suspected he was using me for money while incarcerated. Now there's a covid outbreak at the prison he is at and yeah, I'm worried.

I am not interested in him romantically at all.  As I write this I feel like I'm falling into the old trap, but if  bar of soap could keep him clean...(I could put enough on his books for that without a letter even) I don't want to feel responsible if he gets ill.

818,"So, basically this guy joined a discord server i’m in and at first I thought he would be fun to flirt with and stuff, kind of just as a joke. Long story short he ended up just teasingly calling me a hoe, but that kind of made me upset so I just stopped talking to him.

Later that same night someone brought up the fact that he might have sent revenge porn to someone else and I blocked him because I was disturbed. The next day, I was reassured that apparently he was also joking about that and the person he was ‘threatening’ knew he was joking as well. But I kept him blocked.

He said he was sorry for calling me a hoe before a blocked him and that he didn’t mean it, but I blocked him anyway.

A while after, I ended up unblocking him because we were on a Voice Chat together and were actually getting along well talking about stuff. We then decided to start reading the attack on titan manga together because it’s his favourite anime/manga.

We’ve been getting along well and i’ve been spending lots of time with him since then, but occasionally he says things that cause me unnecessary panic or anxiety, like calling me a slut or hoe as a joke (Which I really don’t like), making some sexual remarks regarding me doing things to him as a joke, making jokes about killing himself and stuff like that (he is actually depressed to some extent), and also makes fun of some specific kink I have which I told him about (Like the dumbass I am) which makes me uncomfortable to some degree. 

I like hanging out with him, but he does this stuff and it makes me feel stressed and sad and like, I’m aware that friends shouldn’t make you feel that way. So should I just interact with him less? Block him again? Tell him about the things that make me upset so that he stops doing them? 

I just have no clue what to do at this point, am I just being ridiculous or am I right to be irritated? Like I woke up today really excited to draw and listen to music and shit but now I just feel kinda bad because he jokingly called me a slut and made one remark about killing himself. It’s fucking stupid that my day should be shit just because one guy I don’t even know is being an ass.

819,"So I'm starting college this month and I'm going for business. I'm required to take a language for my degree, which is no problem because I've been studying Japanese every waking moment religiously since January (It helps that everything was closed) and I've gotten close to N4 in that time. But there was a problem: The college I'm attending doesn't offer Japanese as a language. I talked with my advisor and he said I could transfer credits from a college that DOES offer Japanese, which is good, because the closeby University of Memphis does.

So I'm going to take Japanese as my language. I looked at the UofM's website and it says there's study abroad summer programs. I've always wanted to have the ability to study abroad but I was homeschooled nearly my entire childhood, so I never even got close to anything like this before.

822,"Hi all. I’ll try to keep this brief. My boyfriend (28M) and I (25F) are trying to decide where to move. We currently live in City A. I want to move to City B. He grew up in A &amp; has only lived here except for around a year when he lived an hour south. I grew up in A and have since lived in three different cities including two different states. 

I have a bachelors degree &amp; he does not. He’s mentioned returning to school, but well... money. Therefore, I have more opportunities &amp; possibility to make more money. We’ve discussed this; he knows &amp; it’s part of why he’s considered school. I think we should decide where to live based on what jobs are available to me more so than him. 

Where I need advice is that he’s willing to move; however, not to City B. He wants us to find a specific job and then decide a different city to move to even if it’s out of state. This makes me nervous with the current state of the US &amp; the rona going around. 

So I guess my question is, is it better to find a job you want and then determine a place to live or find a city you want to live in and then find a job there? If we go with the first option, what’s the best way to handle that, as in when the jobs ask about moving do we just say we’re willing to relocate?

823,"Back story- My husband and I met online when we were kids. I was from California, he was from Massachusetts. We both ended up moving around a bunch of years from California to Massachusetts to Colorado to Idaho. It was a big mess. But we settled down in Idaho because the rest of my family settled here too.

We don't particularly like Idaho, it's very bland. Nothing to do, we don't hike or fish or camp. We are really just in Idaho for my family and also cheap housing (If we can ever afford to buy)

Now our problem, we're in debt. A whole bunch. To the point of if we don't stay we'll have to declare bankruptcy. We've been trying to dig ourselves out for the past few years while we've been in Idaho but to no avail (not trying to shuck responsibility, %100 our own fault obviously)

It got really bad recently with the covid19. We didn't go to work a bunch and now are even further behind on payments.

His parents in Massachusetts said we can live with them in a small room. His mom can hook him up with a job getting paid more than he currently does. And they won't charge us rent so we can get back on track. And they might even have a job for me too, that one is not as for sure as his job. On top of all that he misses his family too. It will be very uncomfortable for me while we live with his family, I don't know them well, they have many cats to which I am allergic. And the room is not a large one at all.

From the statistics online Massachusetts is more expensive to live in than Idaho. The cost of living, gas, medical, insurance it's all supposed to be higher than in Idaho. Although they also have a higher minimum wage. Although while we were there I enjoyed the beaches and forests and many places to visit.

My family obviously wants me to stay, and I want to stay as well. My family who has also messed up and had to get bankruptcy have recovered nicely. One even bought a house before the bankruptcy has fallen off of their record. If we do a bankruptcy and get everything in order we could possibly own a home in 3 years.

My husband and I spoke with a bankruptcy lawyer and the lawyer says we have a very simple case, should be no problem to file for bankruptcy and keep our belongings and where we live, along with our cars. While I'm not keen on the idea of bankruptcy I feel it's the only way we can stay in Idaho.

Obviously when we got together we knew at least one of us would be away from our family.


We also have a bit of a Deadbedroom that we're trying to fix and I feel that the pressure of sharing space with others would not help that situation at all. In Idaho we have our own mobile home that we pay space rent on. Just the two of us.


I need advice
We are have never disagreed so hard on what to do. I need advice, what would you do?

829,"I (36M) met a woman (30F) on a dating app towards the end of May. My gf and I broke up a few weeks before so I was on the app to see what’s out there but wasn’t looking for anything serious. I started talking to a woman and found out we volunteered for the same organization and she’s seen me at an event before. We hit it off and set up a date at a restaurant. She changed her mind and didn’t feel comfortable going to a restaurant (COVID) so I offered we have wine and charcuterie outside. I suggested we meet at my place then go from there. She agreed and we had what I thought was a really nice first date! No awkward pauses, intellectual conversation, lasted almost 5 hours. We had a lot in common and at one point, she said that it was so weird how she felt like I was inside her head. 

Problem is, she said she hasn’t dated in 8 years because she’s working on a PhD and has been so focused on school. She also lives with her parents since she’s trying to save money. We ended the date and there was no kiss or hug. I texted her 3 days later and brought up seeing her again and she said I would be an amazing friend but doesn’t feel a connection. 

Fast forward 2 weeks later, I get a text from her saying she really regrets sending the text and wanted to see if we could grab dinner or drinks and I said I would really enjoy that. She reached out a week later and had a good second date and messed around but didn’t sleep together. We went back and forth who reached out for a date and we hooked up on the third. She’s only slept over once although I get the sense she would every time but hasn’t told her parents about us. We usually text only to set up a date. I think she likes me since she’s brought me liquor from her home country once and a gift after I told her I left my old firm and am starting my own company. 

I’m unsure about her so I’m still dating other women and met one I’ve really enjoyed being around. On paper, the first woman checks off everything but she’s not my “type.” I go for fun motivated blondes with a large friend group but the first woman seems shy and doesn’t seem as fun. Also, I don’t want her to date only me and the only reason she likes me is because she doesn’t know what else is potentially out there for her. 

She seems to enjoy my company but she’s told me that she went out on a date with someone else when I asked the last time we hung out. I told her about the other woman and I feel like she was struggling to ask how it’s going and I cut her off and said I don’t want anything serious, after having just had a gf.

However, with Covid, I've been layed off and my industry (Higher Ed) and school I worked at has no signs of letting up for atleast another 8-12 months. I recently graduated undergrad and always wanted to pursue social work. I got a good job after grad though so i took that instead. Now I figured why not... let's do a quick 8 month post degree (intensive) social work college program so I can get a job and not worry about paying my mortgage anymore. 


Well as it turns out, I can't defer my admission and I'll be doing a social work college program at the same time as my part time M.Ed. i'm also at a very prestigous Uni and I do NOT wanna give my M.Ed up. 

M.Ed - 1 course (10hr/week of work roughly)  Jan-Apr. However it is asynchronous, meaning I work at my own time, no designated lecture or meet time either online or in-person. And a grade below 70% is a fail. 
SW-5 courses + an 35hr weekly internship. 
   - 5 classes: 30 hours a week. So 65 hrs a week just social work alone then add the M.Ed on.

My mother has told me many things about how there marriage is failing, how my father is more of a roommate that a husband, and that if COVID-19 wouldn’t have happened he would have lived with his parents the whole summer. It makes me look at him different and I hate it. I started therapy and it dropped the veil about how what is happening isn’t normal. I’ve taken it upon myself to brake up there fights since they listen to me. I feel like a parent parenting two kids. My father also doesn’t know how to parent despite having a child for fifteen years. He lets my younger brother and I walk all over him. Everyone says to just not focus on it, or it’s not your responsibility, your to young to worry. They also refused to go to couples therapy. My mother’s job is pretty much all day and can last 12 hours at a time. She  is working at home while my dad works a 9-5. We have pretty much stopped talking. I don’t tell her things that bother me, and I don’t ask to spend time with her because I know it will just be a “I’m working”. Just please give me tips or support ❤️❤️❤️

I am trying my hardest to be a more understanding person. To understand the motivations behind certain toxic beliefs or behaviors.

So I was sitting in the living room with my mom and my sister and I was petting my dog. My dad asked me to get my towel to put in the washing and I said ""in a minute"". I was petting my dog and saying goodbye when he stormed in and yelled at me for taking to long. Proper loud angry yell. 

He was standing in the doorway so I had to get closer to get past him to my room but I was too scared to get close so I slowly inched towards him until he moved. He followed me down the hallway but I was too scared to turn my back to him so I was watching him closely while moving slowly. 

My dad was cleaning the bathroom so all the stuff (Like bin, toilet roll holder etc) was out in the hall and I was moving slowly so I wouldn't trip. I he yelled at me as he kept moving towards me and doing what I can only describe as bearing his teeth (I hate it when he does this because whenever he did this in the past he hit me). I don't know how I was looking but he didn't like the how I was looking at him and went to hit me yelling ""never look at me like that again"". 

I was scared so I ran backwards to my room (almost tripping over the toilet roll holder) and grabbed my towel. He was in the kitchen when I put the towel in the pile and was mopping the bathroom floor when I was going to hide in my room (I went to say goodbye to my dog before going because I love him) so I was on edge. 

I broke down as soon as I got into my room and cried until I heard them (mom, sister, dad) laughing and talking peacefully as they got my dog ready for his walk. This made me irrationally angry and I cried more as I thought about how my sister is the favoured one and how I always feel left out and how I love my parents while I am also terrified of them and how my sister gets away with making fun of me but when I try and trade her back I get in trouble. 

I am so angry and upset and I just want advice about anything please. I don't want to be angry or hate my family. I also bottle up all that happens to me because I don't want to appear weak in front of my friends because I know I will cry if I speak to them about this.",10Aug2020,1

842,"Hello, sorry if this post comes out as a block of text or has horrible formatting. 

I(20M) am a college junior who is majoring in University Studies due to my grades not meeting the minimum grade requirement for my previous major which was Pre-Med. The change in major happened after my freshman year. The next year, I was put on probation for the spring semester since my GPA, yet again, fell below the minimum amount. This time, I was also put on probation for my financial aide. I have been getting financial aide that accounts for about 80% of my tuition. My grandparents account for the remaining 20% of my tuition. During the spring semester, I was unable to get my GPA to the minimum amount for my major and financial aide but due to COVID, I was able to maintain the major but not financial aide. No one in my family or my friends know about any of this apart from the major change. 

Now that the school stuff is out of the way let’s head to the personal stuff. I think I suffer from depression, anxiety, and a smidge of ADHD. I have told both my mother and grandparents this multiple times yet the only thing they hear is the ADHD part. For everything else, they tell me that I just have to basically “be happy.” Another thing is that I’m gay and no one aside from my mother and best friend know that I am gay. I fear that since my grandparents are devote Catholics that they won’t accept me. 

The last thing that I can really think of is my future career. My mom and basically everyone expects me to become a doctor since I’m the oldest child and that I have to be perfect. I do not want this at all. I have told this to them but they always make up an excuse or tell me that I’m just “too lazy.” What I want to do is major in psychology but anytime I say that I’m met with a “think realistically.” 

So yeah, if anyone has any advice for any of this, I’m all ears.",10Aug2020,1

My 15-year-old friend is being groomed by a pedophile in our area. I had suspicions about this man for a while. (He is 28. I did not know this until recently. We were sophomores but are now going into our junior year.) She started hanging out with a random man R she met at the mall in September of 2019. She and her boyfriend M at the time almost broke up because she cheated on him with this man. (She admitted to having sex with him.) At the time I was 15 and she had just turned 15. She told me R was 20. I thought it was weird but at my maturity level, I didn't feel like I had the power to do anything about it. Most of the girls in my friend group have a thing for older men. After the incident with her boyfriend M, she told me she had stopped having relations with R and they were just friends. She told me she would use him for rides. A few months down the line R was still in her life. He would bring her to nice restaurants sometimes and buy her things. I found it suspicious. Another month down the line she and I had a falling out because she and her boyfriend M got into a physical altercation while M was under the influence of some weird drugs I don't even know the name of. He physically assaulted her because she was still in contact with R. She sympathized with him because he was on drugs and I distanced myself from her for a few weeks. She soon realized that what M did was messed up; they broke up and we became friends again. My other friend L who is 18 threw a graduation party in June and Invited A because we were all mutual friends. A decided to bring R as a plus 1 to the party. The party was going well but one of L's friends had a moment of clarity and realized he was incredibly uncomfortable with R being there since at that point we didn't know R's real age anymore. At the party, R was making many claims that were all clearly lies. He claimed he wrote the song World is mine by Hatsune Miku and that he works as a music writer and he makes 4,000 an hour which we all could tell was complete bullshit because why would you still live with your parents if you made that much. He claimed he had a giant house in texas as well. He also claimed he worked at sony. Everyone at the party could smell bullshit except for A. At some point in the night, Ls friend was super uncomfortable and asked L to kick R out of the party since he was clearly older than we thought he was and he was with our 15-year-old friend. He did not want a pedophile at the party. L kicked R out and A went with him. At the party, R claimed to have a person he was romantically interested in. When I asked him what she did for a job and if she was pretty and what she was like he gave me little to no detail. I found that suspicious because when you like someone wouldn't you want to gush about them and talk about them. R also told me A was talking to someone too and I found that VERY suspicious because if A was into someone she would've told me. We had been friends since 2nd grade. (Forgot to mention I noticed on her Snapchat Rs name had hearts next to it. I don't think a friend's name would have a bunch of hearts next to it.) I had a feeling she was keeping something from me. A week after the party L and I confronted her about it. We both had a gut feeling she was lying to us about being just friends with R. We confronted her about R being a pedophile and we got into a huge argument. L who is 18 even stated that she wouldn't even date someone A’s age. I have our whole argument saved. In the argument, she admits to having sex with him which is an important detail. In the argument, she claimed to have age bated R and said she was 18 (which I later found out is not true we will get to that in a second though.) After the argument, she blocked and removed L and I on all social media but we saved everything. I became friends again with an old friend E who is 15 and was friends with A when we had a falling out over her ex-boyfriend M. She told me that A Claimed R was 28 years old and that they had dated after M and her broke up. I believe E. she has no reason to lie about something like that and everything adds up. This brings us to today. Recently I was on my old phone looking for pictures from my freshman year. I discovered that A’s Instagram account was still logged onto that phone from when I let her borrow it when hers got taken away. I couldn't help but look through her DMS with R. L and I were right they were clearly still having romantic and or sexual relations. There was a lot of heavy flirting all from September 2019 to recent. Nothing explicitly sexual though. (stuff along the lines of replying to all her selfies, calling her cute, calling each other husband and wife, talking about cuddling, him saying he doesn't want anyone touching her, etc. I have it all saved in a folder.) The biggest piece of evidence though is right in the beginning of them talking A tells R she is in 10th grade and that she is 15 R states he is in his 20’s but not a specific number. In my argument with A I have her admitting to having sexual relations with him but denying their relationship. R is grooming A. In their private DMS he is encouraging her to cut off L and I who are her close friends because we do not approve of him. He calls us toxic ( that's kinda funny a pedophile calling the friends of their groomee toxic.) All in all, I have decided I want to get him arrested. I have their entire Instagram DMS from September 2019 saved and the argument where she admits to having sex with him and many witnesses who have heard her say she had sex with R. I'm afraid I won't ever be friends with A again but I know reporting R is the right thing to do. I just hope I have enough evidence.

24(f). I went to a top university with a good degree as first in family to going to university, lived in Paris for a year, lived in Asia but now I’m back at my parents following a tragic turn of events. My younger brother suddenly passed away, and I left my job to be with family and recover. Then COVID happened.

My problem is I’m so, so, envious of some of my friends who are in settled relationships who never left our hometown. They now have cars, own houses, take multiple holidays a year. Meanwhile I’ve never really been in a relationship, and have literally not one single penny to my name. I have no one split costs with or plan a future with. I’m dealing with grief, unemployment, usually 20s soul searching etc.

I feel so confused about life - on the one hand, my life experience is broad and exciting re. travel which is a huge privilege . On the other, they are doing way way better than me materially and are independent adults whereas I feel like a teenager still. I’m also ‘envious’ that they’ve never experienced real trauma in the way that me and my family have.

I just feel terrible. I don’t want this envy. I don’t want to compare myself (I don’t resent their happiness but boy I wish I had some, anything good going on in my life right now) but I do compare constantly and it makes me doubt choices that previously made me happy. I never ever used to care what other people did but since my life took a downward turn it’s all I do.

853,"Hey y'all,

First time posting here and all that. Long story short, on March 4th I purchased two tickets to an Action Bronson concert for May 21st and because of Coronavirus, the show was canceled but the tour as a whole is postponed as far as I've seen. I then reached out to the platform I purchased the tickets from, TicketWeb, on April 1st requesting assistance towards a refund, as the tickets cost over $100 with all fees and since my hours have been reduced, every penny is appreciated these days.

I contacted them to then be told that they have no information as to whether the concerts are refundable via the promoter, and that they cannot help me towards this end. Afterward, on a date I cannot remember, the person I went to go see himself, Action Bronson, stated in an Instagram Live video that he has no idea about what's happening with the tour, and encouraged people to go for a refund if they want since he does not know when things will be steady enough to be able to perform.

After the purchase was when I read up on how problematic TicketWeb can be, and I understand that this can be an issue towards a refund, and that I should have done my research ahead of time, but I just wanted to get a nice birthday gift for my brother and bought them before they sold out. All that to say- is there anything I can do to get my money back? As previously stated, the funds would only be helpful these days and I would very much like to get it all back if I can. I bank with Chime, if it matters.

Any and all help is appreciated towards this end. Thanks for reading, hope you're all having a good day/evening so far and staying safe and healthy!!",10Aug2020,1

For a brief overview of my life I am 16f, work a job, but aren’t in school due to my mental health. I live with my mom and my siblings (12f,6m.)

My mother treats me like a stain on her life. Everything I do is somehow “gaslighting.” I can never enjoy my life because all she does is scream at me over literally anything (for example today I made coffee and it tasted *awful*, like to the point it caught me completely off guard. When I turned to spit it out in the sink a little splashed out of my cup and onto the floor, and she went absolutely ballistic and called me a n ungrateful and over dramatic slob.) She verbally abuses me on a day to day basis, calling me everything from asshole and bitch to cunt, retard, and dysfunctional (the last two being entirely due to my mental health, I have anxiety and depression.) She threatens to get me “locked away” when I don’t do what she wants, and has hit on a few past occasions. 

I have been kicked out *multiple* times. 

She speaks to me as if I’m less than, and numerous people including our own family members have noticed. It’s humiliating. 

She disregards my issues and struggles, and whenever I try to talk to her I’m met with yelling and belittling. Everything is about her, and I’m just “causing her stress.” I’m not afraid to say I genuinely hate her.

Not to mention dealing with all the other issues with customer service AKA cunt customers.

Ive  recently got acrylic nails, which are like 1cm long so like yeah theyre  fairly long whatever. What I dont need is every fucking man I bring a  drink to making some cunt ass comment about them. ""how'd you get  anything done with talons like that?""

I  dont fucking know Gary how do you go through life thinking your stupid  little comments made to waitresses are in any way funny or  charming??????

I spent a whole day  at work last night starting at 5pm ,ending at 1am, fucking boiling hot,  sleep deprived due to the heat and any sleep I did get was filled with  nightmares due to my new medication. People commenting on my nails,  people making my life 10X more difficult than it had to be, people  making smartass comments in general, and then I get a text.

From  my flatmate. He went out with all of my/our friends that night for  drinks. and disclaimer I dont care that they went out w/o me because I  was working and they cant plan their lives around me. I care that he  showed ZERO consideration to the fact that I'd spent four days doing  nothing but working, he just decided to text me saying: ""please come  home ASAP because I dont want to socialise anymore""

**FUCK YOU SO HARD.**

Poor  little you. Had too hard a time DRINKING and HANGING OUT with friends.  This all probbaly sounds harsh. I get that. but hes such a selfish  person in general if you knew him you'd understand my frustration.

If  you've been to tenerife hes been to elevenerife, this is in regards to  bad situations. If I hurt myself, hes had an injury 1000X worse. If I'm  depressed, he's been WAY more depressed than me.

I complain about work stress? ""well...I cant even get a job so be grateful you have work""

He  bitches and whines about being 'left out' if we hang out without him.  But why do we hang out w/o him? Because when he comes out with us he  spends the ENTIRE time tweeting about how miserable he is and how he  wants to go home, and telling everyone we're with the same thing.  Announcing to the entire fucking venue how hes being 'forced' to stay  out.

Never pays for anything b/c  he pretends to be poor. I say 'pretends' because I've seen him spend  money on pointless shit before, I've fucking gone to amsterdam and  france with him where he paid for his own tickets, food, etc. Like the  amount he complains about his apparent lack of money is just a total  exaggeration? If he needs money he gets it. period. He isnt poor he just  likes to tell people to get free drinks and also to garner sympathy  points.

863,"I'm currently living in a small city/town in the Midwest and I'm struggling with keeping my sanity. I'm a 26-year-old, gay, multiracial man who has an inclination towards urbanity and diversity; which is why I've decided I *need* to move. I have a couple of cities in mind but it doesn't really matter where as long as I can get somewhere that meets something close to my ideal.

I've been saving money, slowly but surely, however I'm running into one problem...I *cannot* stand the wait. I have a sense of a wasted past and I feel like I misspent my youth not getting out of here sooner. I'm aware these are probably common feelings for people my age but I really feel like if I can't move soon, I'll never get out. The rub is I know the waiting will pay off in the end, especially when I have a comfy amount of money saved, have built-up my resume and coding skills (I'm a software engineer) and even read more and develop to be the person I want to be in a new scene, or at least an inch closer. I'm trying hard not to romanticize my change here, but I want to try and give a sense of the possibly ridiculous urgency that I""m battling against.

Anyway, what I need advice for is how to wait...Any wise words or stories that can be shared, ones that I can hold for these next 4 - 6 months to keep me from jumping off the nearest 3-story building?

866,So it's actually ironic that as a teenager I had a great sleep schedule. I was in bed between 10-11 and up by 6 or 6:30 and never had any issues. It wasn't until after my teens that my sleep schedule became really toxic for a variety of reasons. For the last 10 years I've had the same sleep schedule: Stay up between 1-3 AM no matter what time I have work the next day. Nothing I do can get me to fall asleep sooner. I try laying in bed? I'll just toss and turn for hours before eventually getting back out of bed. Avoiding TV or video games doesn't help. Even when I'm exhausted my body feels like it needs to fight to stay awake longer. I'm tired of struggling to wake up on time and feeling like I have no energy. I'm setting it as my goal to return to a normal sleep schedule and I'm determined to do whatever it takes. If anyone can offer advice on this I'd greatly appreciate it!,10Aug2020,1
867,"I know both of these people online and haven’t met them in real life. I know part of this issue is just jealousy because the creep used to like my friend too and probably still does, but it’s hard to sympathize with the guy who made incredibly creepy remarks and is slightly racist.

I met both of them through video games and the creep seemed really nice at first. I met him a few weeks after meeting my other friend and after only 2 weeks of them knowing each other the creep decided he was in love with my friend. I told him that he should take it slow but he confessed anyway to which my friend responded maybe but take it slow. Instead of taking it slow however this guy started to make incredibly creepy and weird remarks like how bad he wanted to kiss him and how he wanted to sit in his lap and how his bed was top big and he was lonely.

It’d be fine if my friend was ok with it but he wasn’t. He was incredibly creeped out by this guy and understandably so. The creep also came to me crying and basically threatened suicide just because my friend left to take a nap for a few hours. He also said some suspicious things like how he wouldn’t date transgender people because he wanted a real man and that he almost said the N word because he got angry at a game of MINECRAFT. He also got fake drunk like “ahaha I’m so drunkkkk rnnn” drunk and told my friend (who’s 17, creep is 18) that he wanted to have sex with him. My friend of course was super freaked out and came to me panicking.

Eventually we blocked him and moved on but a few weeks later the creep messaged me on something I didn’t block him on and asked why my friend and I blocked him. I told him why and probably could’ve been a bit nicer but it’s hard to be nice to someone who’s a total creep and made me and my friend uncomfortable. I blocked him too after I sent that but it obviously upset him to be called out like that.

Yesterday creep ended up making a group on a video game and my friend joined it. I told him not to and advised him against hanging out with him after what he did. My friend knows I hate him and that he hurt me too but still decided to do that. It would be fine if he just went to go say hi and leave but later that night he told me he was going to play with a friend. I’m perfectly fine with him playing with other people ofc but he didn’t even tell me it was him until later. He was trying to hide the fact he was hanging out with the creep again because he knew I didn’t like him.

I honestly have no idea why my friend would hang out with this person when he knew it would hurt me anyway. It honestly hurts and I feel kind of abandoned in a way because he ignored all of my advice. I know i can’t tell him what to do but it hurts to see the person you care most about going to get hurt again. And again I know it’s jealously partly because we both like him or at least the creep used to like him. I can’t seem to get through to my friend that this is a bad idea because he doesn’t listen.",10Aug2020,1

874,"This ones a bit of a weird one, so bare with me. 
So the first incident happened when my partner and I noticed the lid to the biscuit tin was off and there was no biscuits in it - nothing major, just assumed one of us had eaten the biscuits and not remembered, and accidentally knocked the lid off the tin. When I came home a bit later on, I noticed all the biscuits in a pile, right next to the sink. (I have a picture). Thought my partner might have been having a wind up - but he swears he didn’t touch them and I don’t remember doing it either. We spoke briefly about one of us sleepwalking and came to the conclusion if one of us was sleepwalking it will probably be me (I’m on medication and he is too much of a light sleeper). 
Next incident happened tonight when my partner asks if I’ve eaten a packet of his sweets (I swear I haven’t lmao), but he swears down he hasn’t touched them either. Now we have ferrets so our first thought was what if they got in the cupboard whilst they were out and just started storing them somewhere? But we have looked EVERYWHERE and cannot find a stash with sweets in (did find an old piece of chicken though yum). But 1. They have never managed to get in the cupboard 2. They wouldn’t eat sweets they would store them 3. If it was them, they must have had upwards of 30+ sweets! 
So that kind of ruled them out to us. 
So the next thing was again... one of us sleepwalking and doing this in our sleep? (I can be known to have a midnight snack but come on) so... how common is this? Could it be sleepwalking or could it be a very hungry ghost?

876,"I’m legally blind, but I enjoy manga and novels for Japanese reading practice. It’s rather tiring,  physically because of poor eyesight; and mentally when trying to remember new vocabulary, since it’s not in my native language. (Oh, and on top of all that, the standard for physical Japanese literature is tiny print for small form factors, regardless of how complex it can be compared to the Latin alphabet.)

I use a high powered magnifier for physical books, as well as digital copies that I can enlarge at will on the spot. As for remembering new vocabulary, I can take note of them and input them into the flashcard program, Anki. It’s very effective but very tedious to make my own flashcards.

Aside from that, it feels like I’m trying to take on more than I can handle. What can I say? I don’t want to be bored by the longer series, so I switch out what I’m reading occasionally.

She met a guy on a game she likes (I don't play the game) and they become friends. Now Tina can speak a bit of english but she asks for my help often, as I am almost fluent .The guy she met(Luca) only speaks english. Tina asked me for a favour: for me to translate some of the things she wants to tell Luca into english. I accepted because 1. I love translating 2. It will help me improve my vocabulary. 
At the beginning I was only a translator, not adding anything to the conversation. After some time she asked me for advice on how to reply to him, which wasn't a bad thing since It's normal to ask friends on advice when talking to someone. But I noticed that I started adding more and more from myself as time goes by, almost like I was having a conversation with Luca.
 !!! Tina told Luca that I HELP her with writing in english, and they spoke on vc before so he should know her english level !!! 
The whole thing went down tonight when Luca started being more open about his life. I felt bad for seeing the whole conversation without him knowing. The things he said really touched me so I was trying to write good, encouraging messages. 
Tina is a good person, trust me. But she isn't the best at giving advice. So I wanted to be the good guy and be supportive to Luca, but now I realised it wasn't my place to give him advice. Now, Tina wrote a lot of things too, don't get me wrong, but around 1/3 of the things she said that night, came out of my mind, me telling her what to write, and Luca thinks that the encouraging words came out of Tina's heart.
 I have tried before to tell her that I am here ONLY to translate, but she insists that I tell her what to write because ""I am so good at communicatingin english"". I wish she was more independent, more confident in her own thoughts. She was always like this, relying on others to control her life, too scared to make decisions on her own.
What do I do now? I can't stop doing this, I already went too deep into it. I can't tell Luca the truth, it will make him even more sad than he already is. He would feel betrayed, by one of his best friends. Tina would also hate me if I end their friendship, and I don't want to lose her.

Since the pandemic situation started, he has been a little rude to me and apologized for it, claiming he was feeling too anxious, which I understood perfectly.

He would usually feel he was having symptoms and be certain he had covid-19, so I always tried to reassure him and be patient.

Anyway, about two weeks ago I told him about my sister who lives in another country, who got covid but was recovering fine, and he just replied with something about some work meeting. Finally, about one week ago I told him my parents (and possibly myself) seemed to be positive. He ignored me as well, and talked to me about a car he’s planning to buy. 

Later on he complained that I didn’t tell him about something, and I told him I forgot and also that he usually doesn’t even acknowledge the information I share with him. And lastly, when I confirmed that my mother was sick, he started talking about another friend.

So, now when I reply I barely say anything, and I’m considering just telling him I don’t wanna text anymore.

890,"I hate my dream job.

I went to school for public relations, held 6-7~ internships and jobs during that time to build up my resume, and pretty soon after graduating landed an incredible role at the top PR firm in the world. I’m at the top of my industry working on clients I never dreamed I’d touch.

Unfortunately, I hate it. Not just the job, but the whole career path.

I feel uninspired and unmotivated, which is just not who I am. I don’t care about the work itself. I’m completely apathetic, which I’ve never before experienced. On top of this, my coworkers are rude and condescending. But that just makes the job more difficult. The problem I have with PR is it requires maximum effort for minimal pay/freedom.

I could justify long hours and little PTO if I was making boat loads of money - which, at $40K a year, I’m not.

I could justify lower pay if the job allowed me enough flexibility to travel and I enjoyed the work - but it doesn’t, and I don’t.

This issue isn’t specific to my job, but pretty symptomatic of all of PR agency life. Additionally, I resent such a low earning potential ($120K is the max you’ll make in this field at the height of your career. You’ll spend most of your years at 60-80K) when I come from highly educated parents and a combined household income of ~$500K. I feel like I’ve squandered my opportunity to make more than my parents, even with all the privilege and opportunity I was afforded.

I am unhappy - feeling trapped, unmotivated, uninspired, and honestly pretty depressed. 

If I were to quit I’d most likely write (PR writing) freelance, and hustle a few side gigs until I figure out something more permanent. I’m very interested in real estate (flipping houses, wholesaling, etc.) , and have been looking into various avenues in that industry. I’ve also looked into dropshipping (thanks, TikTok). I don’t have a set alternative path, which is stressful, but I’d be willing to try things out until I get there. 

I’m very open to career suggestions!

The problem is... we’re in the middle of a global pandemic. I’m lucky to have a job at all. It feels selfish to want more, and reckless/irresponsible to give up a reliable source of income over an existential crisis.

892,"So, I'll start by saying that I'm slightly introverted and don't really know how to put myself put there. 

So, a little background information. I didn't really have a lot of friends growing up. When I entered high school, my parents wanted me to start preparing for entrance tests so I could attend the top university in my country. It's a very rigorous exam and requires complete dedication and no distractions if you want to get in. My parents made me cut off contact with the few friends I had and give up all the extracurricular activities I was taking a part in. The routine became to cramp school and back for almost three years. My parents also got a little abusive during that time, mostly verbal (calling me names) and sometimes physical (locking me in a room, hitting and stuff). The only thing which kept me going was that things would get better if I got in the university. 2 more years, and I'll be free. 

 Somehow, I made the cut. In university, I was slightly introverted in the beginning and couldn't socialize much. I made a few friends and it was fine. But slowly, I realized that everyone there was extremely competitive. It is a super competitive, toxic environment. People only talked to each other for ""networking"", to see if you could benefit them in any way. They didn't really care about each other. I wasn't doing too well academically due to a few reasons (wasn't really interested in the course, best friend in college committed suicide and a lot of other stuff) and I could feel people lose interest in me as it became clear that my grades were average or I couldn't really benefit them in any way. I hate that my worth is being judged by my grades, but that's how everyone in my uni sees each other. I saw as people became less and less interested and now I hardly have anyone left I can call a friend. 

I didn't participate in any extracurriculars and feel like its too late now. I just feel like a complete failure and don't know what to do. I've just kind of accepted that I'll always be a friendless, uncool loser and I hate it. My life was supposed to get better but it only got worse.

I've been super confused lately. A little bit about my background, I am a international student in Canada, studying a Chemistry diploma. The thing is, I'm not quite sure if I should continue to study or not. The reason why I chose this program was because I was quite good at chemistry (and I'm still now) and I was interested in drugs and cosmetics; but it's not the main reason, the main reason was because I was fucked up with *anxiety* and I *hate human communication* so I chose this one because I will deal with chemicals, instead of humans (it sounds suck). But now, I can say I'm quite clean of anxiety and I don't hate human communication anymore, so I find this program a little bit boring (I've just finish my first year and will start second year on Sept). This pandemic makes me study online and it sucks because the thing about this program is working in the lab. It makes me think if anything wrong happened to me in the future and I couldn't go to work, what should I do then? This was the time I think about taking a gap year to know what I want or change my program.

However, things are not that simple. *It costs me 15k-16k a year for my education* and my parents have been working hard af to pay my tuition and Asian parents don't like drop out. I don't want to waste my parents' money, but I don't want to waste my time either. I still don't figure out what I like or what I should do to earn a living. I do like something since I was a kid till now, but I don't have the courage to do and I don't think my parents will approve, cause it's not quite stable and my family is not rich, they work really hard because I was so so decisive about studying in Canada. I do like chemistry, but I don't know if I can pay my bills with it, or if I can finish college. What should I do then? It's been messing with my minds lately and I feel guilty if I don't do the right thing. I am now regretting studying abroad too soon and didn't give myself a chance to self-test my interest.

She has been like this for as long as I can remember and even though she has her spells of good days, her bad days overpower and we are left with crippling sadness and miserableness. All in all a terrible environment to study and develop. My sister took her way out in college and shifted to another state. My sister has never really supported me in anything although she believes us to be really close. 
It has been my dream to move out of state for college since I could imagine and I have an amazing college lined up in a city almost 9000 miles away. After one of mom's emotional outbursts, she called me names and I came and cried to my sister on how I wanted to leave the city too and asked for her support when I would tell mom. At that moment, she agreed to having my back and promised she won't force me to apply in colleges in my city. Cut to today, the forms of colleges in my city are made online and she started forcing me in front of mom to apply to the colleges. She specifically made mom believe that studying from home will be better. I got really mad at her and I haven't spoken a word to her since then. Moving out while staying in the same city as my parents is not an option.

902,"Throwaway bc partner knows my main account.

Basically my family is incredibly dysfunctional, and I'm having a really hard time coping with it.
I won't go into too much detail but my dad and my mum's parents (my grandparents) fell out over 10 years ago over something incredibly small, and now they don't speak to each other.
My mum had 3 kids before she met my dad, and 2 of them - Lisa and Mark, are fine. Mark's ex-finace was a bitch but they have now separated due to their own reasons and Lisa, myself &amp; my sister Angel are now speaking.
There is an older ""brother"" called Tom, and Tom's finance has sigle handedly ruined the family. She and my dad fell out years ago after their first child was born, it was because apparently he didn't ""give the child enough attention"", but instead of talking this through, she had an argument with him. Tom is now banned from visiting my mum's house, last time he came round his finance made him sleep on the sofa. His kids aren't allowed either. 
For Xmas one year I paid for all my nieces, nephews and mum&amp;dads to go to the pantomime together. Tom's finance refused and sent me incredibly rude messages telling me how ""I'm inconsiderate"". Of course, I sent a lot of messages back basically telling her how she has ruined my family, and she needs to stop being such a bitch and grow up. We haven't spoken since. 
Mark &amp; Lisa also don't have any contact with Tom or his finance and we have pretty much dismissed them from our lives.
I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, along with slight Autism. I'm going to be on medication and in therapy for a long time, and recently I've just become so angry and upset about my family.

904,"I want her to get out of her situation but I’m still really mad at her and we haven’t spoken in months, all communication has been through a friend who also wants her to get out of that situation... But if she does stay what boundaries should I set? 

BACKSTORY: My sister and I were incredibly close growing up. We went everywhere together and had all of the same friends. People asked us regularly if we were twins, though we look nothing alike, because they hardly saw one of us without the other. 

I moved from our small town to a big city by myself 3 years ago to pursue my dreams, the beginning of last year she decided to move in with me and my roommate (we have a 3 bedroom) and we lived in peace for the most part. 

Starting this year, our once great relationship has turned to total shit. She invited a friend (toxic, manipulative, rude... spawn of Satan) to live with us in her room without asking my roommate or I first and we would not be charging her anything, began drinking a lot and inviting friends over to drink on week nights (my roommate and I do not have parties and if we were to have people over, we would let the others in the apartment know prior) and they made giant messes in our apartment. She defended her friend who was living with us even when she was blatantly rude to my and my roommates face and she called us homophobic (my sister came out last year) and racist (which she has no basis for, though we would have both been open to hearing if we had unconsciously said or something offensive... she could give no concrete examples) just to make us feel like we were the bad guys and we should let her stay there. My roommate even suggested that since she wasn’t planning on paying any rent or utilities, she could thank us by keeping the apartment extra clean which she agreed to but never followed through with. They also adopted a kitten without our knowledge (we did have one cat already) and we loved the kitten but our elderly cat did not get along with her at all so the kitten took up residence in the shared bathroom. 

They decided to move out together to a city about an hour from where we were living at the time. I have not spoken to her in 6 months. I learned yesterday that her living situation has become extremely toxic, as both my roommate and I predicted because of our brief experience with the girl. She called the suicide hotline twice yesterday and was talking to two of my best friends on video chat when she completely disappeared without warning for 30 minutes. My friends called the police to check on her as well as asking me to ask her friends who might know the toxic girls phone number. I called her too, (a really big step for me, I am still very angry with how this whole situation happened.) she did not pick up. It turned out she had taken a pill and been drinking and she had just passed out but this in addition to other factors I am not aware of served as a wake up call that she needs to get out of that apartment. 

Though I have still been paying my rent, I have been staying with family since the beginning of this Covid era. There is only one person who is living in our 3-bedroom (the girl who took over her room) and my best friend suggested maybe she could stay there if the roommate is okay with it. Though I am still very upset, I did ask my roommate what she thought and she said if its only until the end of the month, she would be okay with it. I have the master so she would be able to hole up in there pretty well and not need to interact much with my roommate. 

Needless to say, its a complicated situation. My roommate has agreed to let her stay but I know there need to be boundaries.

So what do you guys think? If she stays (only till the end of this month) what boundaries should I set in place? 

I love my sister even though I’m mad, I just don’t want to put my roommate in a bad situation. (She is usually a very kind, considerate person. However, she tends to turn into the people she hangs around and can be naive)

905,"So I'm 30 years old and the job I've been working for the better part of the last decade will soon come to an end. The job is in the oil and gas industry, and honestly I've hated it from day 1, so I'm not so unhappy to have an opportunity to take my life in a new direction. 

The question is which direction. I have a bachelor's degree, but it's essentially in general studies. I have two degrees that are over halfway finished (or were when I left) in computer science and music (piano; theory and composition). I am a PADI divemaster, the first level of professional diving. I have a PPL (private pilots license). So you can see that my interests go off in several directions. 

I would also like to be in a new location. My fiancé and I live in Texas. We've done a fair amount of traveling and living abroad, and have decided that ultimately we don't want to settle down in the US. We have friends in a few other places we'd like to try out,  the most desirable of which is Switzerland since we both adore the country and we could stay with our friends who could help us get on our feet, but of course Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries in Europe, and getting a job with a general studies degree is probably unlikely. Getting even a low level job and work visa with my education and experience is probably unlikely (maybe someone can expound?) 

So I'm posting here to get some ideas. We have enough savings to float for a while, but obviously we'd prefer not to blow through it. What would you do in my situation? What field or interest would you pursue and why? Where might you look to set up shop? Why ideas/advice appreciated.",10Aug2020,1

Ok so this might be a bit long and sry if it’s hard to read I suck a t writing, but I’ll try my best. 

Ok so last year I started highschool it went pretty good I put my self out of my comfort zone and talked to anyone and pretty much anyone which was big for me since I’m normally rly shy and anxious.

I now have 5 close freinds, and talk to quite a lot more but ofc not as much or only at school.

Since I’m going back to school soon I need to sort a problem I was having on the first year if highschool 

Ok so at first I did talk to ppl but didn’t have much friends just the two and weren’t that close. 

Fast forward until the “friend group” is all well freinds we all got along and we all went to the same classes mostly. 

But there is this one girl let’s call her Carla, 
I don’t like her and either does anyone of my friends, I know it’s mean but we can’t be forced to like her.
I (and my friends) just find her annoying and I’ll explain 

She always follows let’s say Lucy, 
Like idk why I feel bad for Lucy, she’s qui the and nice so never rly says anything and just jokes about it but I can tell Lucy doesn’t like her, we eventually realised that she probs likes her which ngl I found funny just because well Lucy is awkward and doesn’t know her sexuality yet so she ofc said no , and cause she doesn’t like her that way 
And say when we are going to class or lunch or whatever she just follows us everywhere and it’s so annoying, and when u try to talk to someone else she walks between u and go’s “WhAT?!” and it’s so annoying lol

I don’t want to hurt carlas feeling though, yes she doe annoy me and I mean a lot but I don’t wanna make her upset.

She doesn’t have any other friends than “us”
But recently well before lockdown with this other girl (she also doesn’t have that much friends I don’t like her either but ofc not rude or anything)

I just need a way of saying like leave us alone we aren’t your freinds, but how am I supposed to say it politely?

I try to be nice but sometimes she annoys me that much I say thing I shouldn’t have (not anything extreme, just say when she buys into Our convo I jokingly say “we aren’t talking to you” which tbh we are in highschool ik Scotland so you would hear way worse

But yeah idk what to do, don’t wanna gurt her feelings but do not want to be freinds at all and no one in our friend group does

I got paid much less than before as I am on furloughed leave. we are slowly but steadily recovering from that as we made some rent arrears, but basically we have been stuck at home since March. 

I am originally from elsewhere and I got really homesick. I also struggle from anxiety and my boyfriend has been my biggest rock in this journey (2 years of anxiety). he has helped me out a lot and also took over the household for months.

now I am slowly coming back to being myself but my boyfriend has really taken a toll. he is very bored at home. we go to the park every day for some while to change scenery and even that has become very much routine. we haven’t really met friends in a while and we also don’t have many friends here as my boyfriend has travelled around in his life and has friends in different countries and me as well. I can notice sometimes how hard it is to get him to smile.

he says it’s not me but obviously, my anxiety problems weren’t always fun memories. he says he misses experiencing things but there’s not much to do right now. he told me today that he kept working out, eating healthy and everything to maintain a positive mindset but now he is very tired of that. 

I want to help him but I’m not sure how. he is not a fan of therapy, he believes it works for others but it wouldn’t work on him. he feels like he had to take control of both our lives for a wile and he wants me to take the lead as well at times and I totally understand. 

I am feeling much better than I did months ago but I don’t really know how to give him a great day when it is lockdown. I feel like this is the worst time to overcome anxiety to a point to want to experience as there are no opportunities right now.

I’m new to this sub and I’m just looking for another POV. 

For starters, I’m 18 and recently moved out for school (4y BAH in law)

I suffer from severe depression and ptsd and haven’t had the easiest 10 years. 

I’m looking at getting a companion, specifically a dog but I’m worried about the cost of owning one. 

I feel really lonely most of the time and that adds to the depression. I guess I just don’t want to feel alone when I’m home/ out on the town. 

 I have most of my first year fees paid off and am in the process of getting a part time job to pay rent etc. 

School is all online first year (covid) so I’d be home most days except for work or study groups. 

Is getting a dog (adoption) a viable option based off my situation? If so, what breeds should I look out for and shouldn’t. I’m relatively active, have a medium ish apartment in the city core.

Before this, I was in college having the time of my life, I made a great amount of friends and I finally got to date the girl I had been trying for for the entire year. Well, come COVID, we get sent back home and I lost happiness within myself. Everyday was a cycle of doing the same thing, and I made a whoopsie, I relied on my relationship to keep me happy through this. For 3 months, I didn't realize the pressure I was putting on my girlfriend to keep me happy and I feel horrible for it. So now, my life was making me unhappy and now the relationship was at risk. I finally realized, like literally just last week, how me allowing myself to be unhappy with everything else and not bothering to fix anything, all the while relying on my girlfriend to keep me happy affected her. I feel horrible and the relationship is at risk. I want her to be happy as well as she is also going through some of her own things. We agreed that it we should take time to focus on ourselves, meaning we are still dating, but we focus on making ourselves happier. With this, it means we talk a lot less than we used to, and it's doing great for her. Me on the other hand, I'm a bit too anxious about walking away from the relationship for a little to focus on myself. I really am trying though because I want her to be happy and I want us to foster a healthy relationship. With this all being said, when I do have alone time, I 'm not sure how to find happiness within myself. I'm quite honestly relying on going back to school in two weeks to make me happy, but in reality, there is no guarantee for how long I'll be there. So I guess what I'm asking is, what can I do to keep myself busy and happy, all while still being in a healthy relationship? Any help is great, I've been stumped for a month and it's really eating me up.

926,"I think there’s something wrong with me [22f] because I waited to have sex with someone I love, while my bf [24m] has slept around. I wish I lost my v-card in my teens like everyone else and I feel regret. I missed out on a lot of “fun” in college, especially after reading all the posts on this subreddit. 

I honestly still feel sexually inexperienced because I’ve only had sex once in my life, with my love. We met on Reddit, and even though we are from the same area, we are currently long distance since my boyfriend is doing his PhD at a different state.

We spent December 2019 and January 2020 together due to winter break. We spent a lot of quality time together and it was amazing, I miss those moments with him. We also tried to have sex (I was still a virgin) many times, but his dick literally couldn’t come inside my vagina when we first attempted it. So we decided to take it slow. I ended up losing my virginity to him literally our last day together in January.

We were planning to see each other in May, but that didn’t happen because of the worldwide health crisis. We also can’t see each other in August, but we are having our hopes up to see each other in December.

Today, I just feel so sad that I’m not having sex. I’ve only had it once, but I remember it being really painful (I bled a lot), yet intimate. I really wish I could make love to my boyfriend, but I can’t. We might see each other in December during winter break, depending on the worldwide situation. But we both know we won’t be having sex because I will be staying at my parents house (who are very religious and stay at home), and his parents just retired so they will be staying at home. He told me that he used to be able to bring girls home from a certain time limit because that’s when he knows his parents will be away, but literally the year me &amp; him got together, he won’t be able to since they retired.
Hearing how he was able to bring girls home &amp; his favorite sexual position (missionary while holding the girl as tight as he can because it feels like making love instead of f*cking) literally killed me in the inside. He told me that he can wait for me after we both graduate from our degrees because he thinks I am worth it.

I also feel bad that my boyfriend has had much more sex than me, I wish I could catch up. I literally think I probably look ugly.

I told my boyfriend that I honestly feel really depressed and sad that I’m sexually frustrated. I honestly still feel like a virgin. I think I place a lot of importance on sex especially since everyone around me is having it and I haven’t. I really want to catch up to the amount of sex my boyfriend has, BUT I DONT WANT AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP. And I don’t want to cheat because I love him.

He says we won’t be able to get a hotel room because of the worldwide health crisis and our strict parents, and he feels iffy about air bnbs because he is afraid that they might have a camera and our sex video might be put up on porn hub. Honestly, I am willing to be the one to spend a hotel room or air bnb. I just want to make love to him.

My older sister and i had a long talk with her about how we felt.  She really seemed to not care.  After another year i couldnt take it anymore.  My older parents began having issues we had never seen before.  My mom started having panic attacks.  
I got mean.  Sent her a message that was very direct and kinda mean. Let her know not to talk to my parents until she showed she had changed.  And my other siblings and i cut her off from us and our children.  She sent me a direct message back but i didnt read it.  3 weeks later after being away from us all she sent me another message.  I again did not read. A week later she died of an overdose.  
We were dumbfounded. Didnt have anyone with drug issues in family before and we didnt see the signs.  Now. What do i do with these messages?",10Aug2020,1
930,"[ Please pardon any grammar mistakes, English isn’t my first language. ]

I live in a Latin American country, where it isn’t common for a kid to move out of their parents’ house until they either graduate from college or get married. I (M18, college junior) am technically moving in with my friend (F19, college junior) and her family. I say “technically” because what’s happening is that they bought a two-story house, but the second floor is actually a studio that they’re gonna rent to me. They offered it to me because my friend knows that I’ve wanted to move out just to experience what it’s like being fully independent. However, I don’t know how to tell this to my mom (F44). We didn’t have a good relationship until my senior year of high school and I’m scared of hurting her feelings or making her think that I don’t want to love with her anymore because I hate her or something. 

On top of that, my stepdad also bought a house for himself and my stepbrother (mostly for my stepbrother, according to him he’ll still live at our house), so I feel bad that two people will be moving out and it’ll just be her and my brother (M14).

Basically I don’t know how to tell her that I’m gonna be moving in with my friend in around 2 months without making her feel bad. The only thing that makes me think it’s not gonna bother her that much is that she constantly brings up how she got married and moved out of my grandma’s house when she was 19, and that she thinks that I could fend off for myself (she’s never directly recommended I should move out though). So, uh, yeah, what should I do/say?",10Aug2020,1
931,"Almost Two years ago I broke both my feet. (Started walking again early 2019) And I am now looking for shoes that would work for me.

Here is some context:

Right foot, I broke my Talus Bone, which required surgery as a bone fragment wandered to my heel. As well as partly torn ligaments around my ankle, as my foot was dislocated (set back by an Emergency Surgeon that was also there)Left foot were small fractures in all my middle foot bones, I had to have wires for a month or so. 

I am back to walking now, but I was overweight before and that hasn't changed, as the sport that I was involved with requires sharp turn on my feet with my ankles and fast short sprint. I am still uncomfortable with the turns, and only starting to run more, so I quit after my accident.  
Before the accident, I had lost weight doing that sport regularly which after quitting I did put on.

I used hiking boots for the last year and a half. Those tore recently.

I also have inlays for shoes (splayfoot) since 2017. 

My dog and I go on two walks a day, both around 1 1/2 hours through the forest in a very hilly area.

I am looking to get maybe one pair of shoes for dog walks (I think hiking boots); one or two pairs for normal going about daily life and a pair of trainers. Maybe even a pair of summer shoes.

So what should I look for? Any shoe company that I could look into? What are some signs that shoes are of high quality and durable? Is online buying a good idea?

Any help is appreciated, I am pretty clueless when it comes to these shoes.

Also, my doctor told my I would always have problems with my feet, so I want to minimize these early on.",10Aug2020,1
933,"I'm not going into much detail with why I'm unemployed right now. But focus on what's going on. 

My boyfriend and I are currently unemployed and have been for a year now. He got a job for a few months but quit after 3 months of working. We decided if we can't get a job right now to start doordashing. It's good, we're finally getting income and can start saving up. 

Our problem is we've been out of a job for a year (atleast for me) we're completely and utterly bored out of our minds. Especially with a pandemic happening and not being able to go anywhere. That got us in the problem of being lazy if we weren't already lazy enough lmao. 

We've started to wake up early now, about 9am or 10am. We start our day by drinking water and eating breakfast. And then our day stops. We probably try to decide what to do for an hour. It always end up watching tv or cleaning his parents house since we live here. We've tried to start reading and I've almost finished a book. But there's nothing else to do.

Most of the time it's way too hot to go on a walk or go outside, or we're tired, he has a back problem too and if he does any physical activity he's in terrible pain all day and into the next day. I guess we're just feeling kind of hopeless right now.

Our home town is filled with people we don't like and everywhere we go we run into someone from our old highschool. We're ready to move out of town. We have a plan for the future. We decided to save up with DoorDash until we get jobs. Move out of his parents house into an apartment because his parents are on a downwards bad spiral of alcoholism. And then save up while we're in an apartment, buy a van to renovate. Drive up to Oregon for a month and find jobs there. Get a place and start our lives in Oregon. 

We're just not sure what to do with our days in the mean time, we've hit a rut. And with his parents being alcoholics it's hard to progress in life because we're like their own maid since they're too drunk to take care of themselves or their house. They have left it up to us to clean up their messes, their house problems like all of the piles (i'm talking 15+ big bags of old beer cans) moldy floors, dinners, their nasty dishes. I don't mind helping clean at all, but they don't clean up after themselves anymore. 

Anyways it's really hard to progress in my life with them always expecting us to be there to help them out when they're too drunk to do anything. It's weighing my bf and I down. And we also just don't know what we can do in our days to beat boredom or reach our goal. How can we start doing this??",10Aug2020,1

This affects my friendships too. People don't really have an interest in me like they do for most people. I always have to be the one reaching out to them. I'm not saying they don't like me but I'm saying that I always have to be the one to text first.

I keep trying to fix myself with this but I just can't seem to reach it which just makes me not so happy. There are so many people my friends are friends with who consider them their ""best friend"" just because they can get them to get a good laugh which I try hard to do but I just can't reach that point which is why I struggle with everyday relationships.

936," I've always been really skinny so I started lifting weights at home several months ago. I work out an hour-ish, four nights a week. After my family, lifting takes up virtually all of my time right now. I want to be able to protect my family but it's making me neglect everything else.  

Free time that ISN'T spent planning meals, counting calories, reading fitness stuff (which is very little) I'm too burned out to actually do anything. I haven't played video games or watched anime in a long time (not a huge loss), haven't played musical instruments in months, read like three pages of a book a week, no bible, hardly any praying, don't spend time with wife, always very behind on chores/projects, can't put in any extra hours for work, can't learn any new skills whether they're personal interests or work-related. We're planning on moving to the country in a couple years, I'd like to do gardening and raise some animals but there's no way that's possible right now. We also plan on having more kids, and I doubt my wife is going to be able to take care of infants PLUS other kids on her own when that happens. Once I start going to a gym I'm going to have even less time (and money) than I do just working out at home. Encouragement to quit or keep going are both welcome, both seem equally bad to me.

946,"( English isn't my first Language, so there may be a few translation errors)

The neighbours I am talking about are a Family consisting of a guy named Fred, a Woman named Erica, Erica's son Tom and Fred and Erica's daughter Lisa (Not their real Names). I think that Erica and Fred may abuse Tom.

I do not have any proof of this, and this is based of how I see people react to each other, so I don't want to make any false accusations. 

The story is, that Erica had a husband with whom she had Tom. Tom is about my age (16), we went to the same primary school and I would see him on my way to school, but we don't like each other. Erica and Husband were together until Tom was like 10. We lived in the same street back then, but we weren't neighbours. So through some way she met my neighbour Fred. Fred is at least 10 years older than her, but they fell in love anyways and they moved together and were happy, you know how this goes. A few years ago, they had a daughter: Lisa. Lisa likes to do what all kids do and she spends a lot of time with another neighbour kid in the garden. 

I think they may abuse Tom for the Following reasons:
•they are way harsher with him than with Lisa, but not on the normal she is just a small kid, it's like they are waiting for him to do something wrong. 
•Tom, despite not looking like he really enjoys it, spends a lot of Time out if the house. I was sick for a week (last year b4 the lockdown) and I noticed him only being home to ear and sleep. 
•they once had an argument in the garden (Idk what it was about but it didn't seem like a big deal to me) and Fred decided to ground Tom for a week and take away his phone for another. Tom also said that was a bit of an overreaction and Fred just went full on this ""are you taking back to me young man?"" And Tom seemed kind of a raid of Fred. 

Idk what to do guys maybe I am interpreting too much into this, but I couldn't help but think they were abusing him, especially since they had and argument like the last one yesterday (Fred and Eric's were mad because Tom looked at his phone while they were watching the news).

I don't want to approach them directly about this, I think it's obvious why so some advise would be great.

TLDR:I think my neighbours may abuse their son, but I don't have any proof, only a feeling that something if off with how they treat theirs Son.",10Aug2020,1

But then in my most recent semester I was  accused of collaborating/sharing answers with people during a final exam  for my public health class. The extent of what I did was very limited, I  gave someone a ""yes"" answer to something they had asked but was also  talking during the final about other things (not realted to test). I was  reported and am probably facing suspension from 1-2 semesters from  school. 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can appeal the decision  if they suspend me based on it being too harsh, but I'm scared. My  parents don't know about this at all and being the typical chinese  parents they are extremely strict about even the smallest things.

We had a really busy rush coming, my supervisor was unaware the girl doesnt know how to do anything. I tried to tell her she probably shouldnt send me on break just yet to help her through the rush, but she insisted. Long story short, my supervisor blew up because she had to handle the rush basically alone. She was screaming at the top of her lungs in the backroom shes going to kill her, and calling her a bitch. The poor girl could hear everything. 

After the girl went home, me and SV were talking about her. SV was saying she hates her, never wants to work with her again, will tell our manager to never put her on the same shift, blah blah blah. I told her what I know about her inexperience, and how its not her fault. Said she needs to back off, and try helping the girl before giving up and tossing her aside. Because in reality, we are stuck with the girl until she quits. She wont be fired for being bad. She relucantly agreed with me. Then she apologized to her for her behavior, and said that I stood up for her later. After that, she (17F) thinks we're much better friends than we actually are. Overtime Ive kinda realized she might not really have many friends at all, because she had to dropout for health reasons a year or two ago.

I just wanna give some context before venting. I’m really confuse if I’m doing something wrong, I always self doubt myself and I would love to hear your perspective and advice on my situation. 
I already have a boyfriend. My boyfriend is my friend’s best friend. The three of us have always been gaming buddies since last year, when my boyfriend introduced us to each other. (Just over discord voice calls, never met IRL) 
It seems like the issue started once my friend’s gf finds out that her bf was playing games with a girl. I understand that it can be something to be worried about but in the beginning of this year, she reached out to me for help because they broke up and wanted her bf back. From then we got along and close, I helped her out and she helped me out.  (They got back together btw)
My friend and I thought that once she got to know me she would be more relief but it seems like it wasn’t the case. It seems like it gotten worse. I have tried my best to show that I’m just her bf’s FRIEND, nothing more. When she asked whenever I play games, messaged or any form on contact with him, let her know.(basically report it to her) I did as I was asked.  
In my perspective I thought my friendship with her was going well, but in June she ghosted me for almost a month. Suddenly she came back to told me she has been hurting since April because I was letting her know when I was with her bf and my bf. At this part I felt like it was unfair because I am no mind reader, I didn’t know she was hurting and for a long time. I felt like she should have told me to stop but from what I remember, she never did. She sent a really long message with a bunch of more claims like I didn’t care about her issues and the friendship wasn’t reciprocal. She also ended with “I also thought you were my friend” which made me felt like I been a bad friend instead. I responded nicely (because she is VERY sensitive), apologizing, letting her know that my intentions wasn’t to hurt her at all. She left me on seen after that. 
I did have an anxiety attack that night when she sent me those messages and it did bother me for a while, I questioned myself and traced back to what I did wrong. I talked to her bf about it and he told me to not doubt myself and he doesn’t believe I was a bad friend. With those words, I started to move on and distance myself from his gf. 
I was feeling better and enjoying my days more until my friend told me he wasn’t feeling so great. I found out his gf always brought me up to him, she doesn’t like me (kinda obvious now), and she gets triggered easily when words like “Python” is mentioned by him. (Insight: it’s because I mention my bf and her bf was helping me with my Python class). Also triggered when she knows the three of us are gaming together. 
Recently it gotten even worse when I updated my Instagram with a selfie. My friend told me his gf is mad at him for liking my insta post. Before noticing he already liked it, she even asked him something along “she posted, what are you gonna do?”. That led to her wanting to break up and I was confuse along the way because the next morning she wanted him back. 
I’m tired of constantly being talked about and seeing how she keeps bringing me up is ruining her own relationship. They always argue over me and she claims that her bf is defending me and all. I feel like it gotten to the point that it’s unhealthy and kinda obsessive so I sent her my statement and my perspective, what I should have done when she first messaged me again. 
I believe I wasn’t harsh, I was straightforward with what I said but it seems like she couldn’t handled it. Instead of the issues, she REALLY focused on my four cap locks and me using the word “refused”. (For example I said: my intentions were NEVER to hurt you.) For her that came off as me being angry and hurts her a lot. 
This is the final recent situation that happened and I have discussed this to my friend. He reminds me to not overthink because he also felt that I didn’t do anything wrong. Let me know what you think or your perspective on this. Any advice would be great too! :’) (we’re all in our college years btw! If it helps to know our age)

EDIT: I have her on her private Instagram acc and I am really worried. Though she is talking badly about me, she brings up depression and suicidal thoughts on her posts!!

I am (23F). best friend (23F). Ex boyfriend (24M).

 my best friend dated her ex for 6 months, and he emotionally hurt her. It took a lot out of her. She is doing better and she is married to a wonderful man for a few years now! 

Ex BF has tried contacting me recently, because we were the best of friends, really close and supportive, we loved each other more than anyone knew. We understood each other,  we felt like soulmates. We miss each other. 

After they broke up (5 years ago), I stayed friends with ex bf for a few months until best friend said I either kept my friendship with her or her ex. Expect, ex bf fell in love with me... and we tried dating with her approval. 

We dated for almost a year , until I almost lost my best friend, so we broke up and I saved my friendship with best friend ...
I cut all connections with him.. for the sake of best friend. 
It has been 2 years, ex bf actively searches and contacts me, he wants me in his life. So do I. 
I can't even utter his name anymore to best friend. Even though she is married. She has such hatred towards this man.
Best friend would disown me if I talked to this guy... 

The smart thing is keep best friend, not cause hurt and drama... and let this person go... but my heart is stupid and wants this guy back so bad.

I feel like we missed out on an opportunity of loving our soulmates and we both agree we would give it a chance again and instantly be together, expect I would lose my best friend. 

Am I crazy? Best friend can be happy, married and selfish... but I'm still miserable and searching for love, when it's in front of me.

My Boyfriend 26M has never lived on his own neither and lives with family as well and is looking to buy a place eventually and has asked if I would move in with him, and would like to have help with bills.

962,"I seriously got banned???

So I usually post on two very popular subs which I won’t name (one is for intercourse and the other is about relationships) most of my karma points are from those two places.

I check them out daily and have lots of fun commenting. Whenever I get a “thank you this really helped” I always feel great. I almost never comment outside of advice on both subs.

Anyway about 30 minutes ago I just got banned from the intercourse one from out of nowhere. I was shocked because what the heck did I do? I’m a stickler for rules so I immediately went over the rules and was tearing through them, wondering what I did wrong. Then... ouch I saw it. No engaging with trolls. About 2 hours before a troll posted a lengthy post in which I said “oh my god, get a life” then reported the post. 

I didn’t think much of it until I got permanently banned. So here I was, fumbling with my hands, wondering how I was going to explain myself. I was so shocked that I just got banned forever for 1 sentence, did all the other people who commented like that get banned to? (There were several!) 

I sent a quick response “why did I get banned?” And the response was not what I was expecting. It wasn’t because I engaged with a troll, I guess it was because I had “multiple sex negative and non constructive comments.” I was even more floored. When? How? Why??? I see many many posts and many comments which  go against their rules but never get taken down. So why me? I asked if I can take down my ban, explaining how I love the sub and didn’t even get a warning, so an outright ban was shocking.

They responded me by showing me the rules (no shaming and no non constructive stuff) and angrily telling me how they were a volunteer and couldn’t babysit people who couldn’t read rules, and how I need to “do better than that” if I wanted my ban lifted.

Honestly guys, I’m floored! I’ve never interacted with a moderator before so I guess I thought they would be.... more professional? I thought they would work with me and help me when I requested my ban be lifted. 

So I sent another message, explaining how I might have disagreed with other people, but I believe everything I said has been constructive. I’ve never kink or slut shamed. I then asked for a second opinion....

They showed me the thing that I said which was wrong apparently. it was a person saying how they love to get sexually stimulated when they breastfed, and how some women can orgasm from it. (The post was about whether it was okay to have sex while breastfeeding, or having sex while your child was in the room). 

I responded by saying how it was gross and I didn’t like the thought of how I might’ve helped my mother achieved orgasm. I then proceeded to explain how breastfeeding is natural and isn’t inherently sexual. If it is, this can harm the pro public breastfeeding movement which isn’t good. So I guess this wasn’t very sex positive, but it was with a MINOR. A baby. Getting off to a baby. I explained that having sexual relations with a minor (or describing it) went against the subs rules. 

The moderator responded by cussing and calling me crazy in which I was banned and muted for 28 days. 

Any advice on how to uplift my ban? I feel like this is so crazy and surreal, getting banned for an opinion.... especially since there was comments similar to mine. Did they get banned as well?",10Aug2020,1

So, I have a idea for a fantasy/sci-fi story that I'm revisiting. It's an ""old"" story idea of mine.
But when the inspiration came, and I begin to imagine the characters, there is a problem.
My main character was previously female, but now i can't imagine them as female or male. I just can't, i imagine them something in between, kinda androgynous.
So I created that in the story there are people that are genderless, because they don't have any sexual organs(and I will figure out their reproduction)
But I'm afraid that will ofend NB people.
Because the sociaty don't see the genderless with good eyes because they're different (everyone in this story has powers, but problably the genderless will have different and probably more powerful powers).
Because representation is complicated.
And because I'm a cishet brazilian girl that is not in any minority(except religious, maybe)

969,"
Me (F18) and my boyfriend (M18) have been togheter for almost 3 years now and his family has started taking its tole on me. He lives in a family of 5. He, his parents and two sister (F14), (F7).

The way they live have made start to question his parents abilities to take care of them. To begin with their house is a total mess. Piles of clothes everywhere, last nights dinner just left on the table and rooms jam packed with trash which u can’t even walk into. 

In the beginning of our relationship I thought that this was just something that happened from time to time since they are a bigger family which means they have a lot more stuff to take care of. But after spending almost 3 years together with him almost nothing has changed or been cleaned in the house

Both him and his siblings are also underweight and he and his sister (f14) both weigh under 110 lbs/50 kg even though they are both extremely tall. My boyfriend always told me that it ran in the family to be skinny but later I have started to realise that they simply aren’t give real food most of the time. Most of them barely eat any breakfast, then in school the food isn’t that appealing and when they come home if the parents feel lazy (which they often do) they just get plain sandwiches. Every. Single. Night.

They have been handling this virus situation very poorly as well. They have been going to family gatherings and this summer they traveled around the country eating buffes and generally doing stuff which involves a lot of people.

Whenever I try to bring stuff like this up my boyfriend just gets sad and tells me to stop bashing his family’s way of living. I’ve considered contacting child protective services and other means since I just can’t take it any more.

I feel horrible for his sisters and want to help the family but my boyfriend always gets mad when I bring it up and I love him so much that I don’t know what to do since I have nobody to talk to. 

In general all this stuff have just been making me really sad since my boyfriend literally has been living like this his whole life. We are planning to move in together next year when we are going to university but I just feel like I can’t handle his family  at all but at the same time I love him so much since he means the world to me.",10Aug2020,1

I rationally know that the world is not against me, it’s just a collection of random, but I can’t stop feeling like I’m no supposed to do something good with my life, every time I try to take a step in the right direction, I really put in the effort, some random circumstance just destroys everything.

The past year or so, I’ve noticed my imagination has gone completely. I have a very hard time thinking/imagining things, especially people.

I can imagine faces of people but not features or anything properly, like I can imagine their outline kind of or I can imagine them but not imagine them at the same time. And it’s like I can imagine but I chose not to? 
I have trouble imagining or remembering faces or stuff in general, I imagine better with my eyes open kinda.

It’s weird because when I was a kid my imagination was too powerful, I would imagine anything like imaginary friends I used to talk to toys and stuff and had loads of imaginary friends and saw stuff and I remember one memory of a lever in my head I’d always close my eyes and everywhere was greyish and the lever in the centre and I’d imagine turning it off and on in certain things like having a good day and stuff but I think I turned my imagination off from that lever when I was a kid and I don’t know how to get it back.

I’m 18 now I used to be very creative in arts and all things but since then my creativity and imagination had gone and it’s kinda bothering me, especially not remembering faces properly, however my inner voice has compensated for it in my head I overthink everything it’s kind of like I can see my thoughts??",10Aug2020,1

973,"Originally posted this on r/relationship_advice but after seeing they’re reactions and just hearing things about that sub, I realized that I really shouldn’t be trusting that place so thats why I’m here now. Hopefully you guys are more trustworthy.

By 15 ish I mean I’m turning 15 soon so I don’t know if I should put 14 or 15

Recently I’ve been becoming irritated from everything. I know puberty and all but still it’s scares me at times. A couple months ago I got burnt out from my friendship with someone who I’ve been extremely close to for 5 years. I asked to just take a break from life for a while and entrusted them with somethings that I do while I’m gone. Though, he never gave me a break. Even though I said “from life in general,” he still asked to do things everyday while I was on my “break”. I struggle with saying no to people and to him especially. So I caved every time and said sure. It got more and more exhausting each day to wake up and see him texting me to do something with him. At that point I gave up on my break.

Two weeks ish pass and I ask again to go on a break hoping this time he lets me. He doesn’t. 

This is where I do a dumb thing. I ghost him. I couldn’t take it. And I ignore him for a while, and just kind of drift as my head just aches and floats in static. A day becomes a week. A week becomes two. And soon, its been a month. We talked a bit in between but only for an argument about how I was playing a game of league with another friend while he saw we where online. He got mad at how I’m talking with him but first starts the conversation in a horrible way

“Bitch”

At this point I’ve been annoyed for a while and say

Me “What”

Him “You know what you did”

Me “And?”

Him “Its wrong”

Me “So what?

It goes back and forth while I’m trying to call my other friend over discord. In the end we couldn’t play as he needed to go. The call lasted 5 minutes. In the end he got mad over 5 minutes. I know its more than those 5 minutes but. In my mind I can’t see it anymore than that. 

At the end there was a big misunderstanding and an even bigger argument. During it I just asked to make a deal. 

“Can we not be friends? We can still talk and play games at times but. Can it not be like how it used to?”

“Do you not know how insulting that is?”

“I know that but, it’s that only way I know how. I want to make a deal. Is it okay?”

“We’ve been friends for 5 years, we’re getting through this. We get through the bad shit.”

At the time I didn’t know it but. That isn’t your choice to make. I just wanted to end on friendly ish terms. 

So right now. We’re still friends. He pretends like it didn’t happen/put it behind him while I’m just mentally destroyed. I’m sure he is too but. At least show something. Some sign of just fatigue or exhaustion. My friends I’ve been talking to tell me to kill this friendship. And after the argument where I told him something I shouldn’t’ve he got chewed out completely by my other friends and was destroyed for a week. 

I have some sort of plan but the timing is horrible right about now because any time I do it it’ll leave a bad taste in my mouth. 

I owe him money. I owe him favours. I owe him so many things that I don’t know how to deal with. He’s helped me so much but now he just makes me feel like shit just thinking of him. 

I do it now. I’m not prepared and I’ll most likely botch it and mess it up and succeed in the worst way possible. Or fail and we continue as “friends”

Do it later. Oops its a week from my birthday. Happy birthday to you you fucking asshole.

Do it even later. Uh how? School. I live in Canada specifically Ontario where my school is doing a half and half system due to the pandemic. Hes not in my half. How do I set things up?

Do it even further? For what? I just end up suffering. 

I’m scared and panicking. Time is running out and I have the bare essentials of a plan. I don’t know how to end our friendship and at times just have second guesses and think I’m over reacting and I’m being a piece of shit to the person who made me happy and valued in life.

I’m shy and quiet. I’m a people pleaser. Thus I find it hard to say no to anything. And if I do and they say no to my no, well I’m just stuck there not knowing what to do. 

This isn’t a one time thing either. There’s past things he’s done that are similar. 
Some examples are taking a joke so seriously he’s tried to end the friendship himself. Saying me and the rest of our friendgroup we aren’t important and aren’t a part of his life. And repeat of this situation.

He’s broken my trust slowly and forcefully and I just can’t trust him with my thoughts anymore. I’ve talked to him about this but that was what led to the argument before.

This isn’t only about him though. I’ve messed up too obviously. With that one joke. Being insensitive. And just overall very needy. All I do is take and he just keeps giving. And I hate that. He doesn’t deserve that, even if I’m starting to hate him. I do dumb shit to him that he doesn’t deserve that he just takes. 

I’m bi alright? I came out to my friend group a while back and somehow it spread a bit around the school. No one really bothered me too much. But who did get bothered was him. He was called faggot and was constantly picked on because of me. The worst part was I didn’t notice. I didn’t notice that he was being picked on for just associating with me. A year ago in another fight he brought it up and explained how it was my fault for him feeling horrible that whole year. Although I think that’s ridiculous, not all of that’s my fault. I still do feel guilty for not helping him or even noticing. 

I’m kind of chubby. My bmi is just below slightly over weight. Even then, he still pokes fun at that. Saying how I’m fat and should stop eating so much. Even at my best friends birthday party he said that if I wanted to lose weight I shouldn’t take one of the biggest slices of cake. I never even asked for advice he just gives it and I hate it. He says that later in life I’m going to be obese if I keep how I am right now. He knows how self conscious I am of my body. I try to work out and even shed a few pounds and gain a bit of muscle but he still calls me fat. He also likes to bring up how we used to be the same height a ling time ago a bunch. He’s said it like 50 times each with the same amount of surprise. He like 6’1 or something while I’m 5’6 ish. It sucks. He brings it up so often just to annoy me. 

He’s also kind of racist towards me. I’m the only spanish one in the friend group. Everyone except one friend is polish so this is an extremely white friend group so me and my other friend stand out like a sore thumb. I’m Salvadoran and my other friend is Filipino. He gotten called short so many times by this friend and it gets to a point where it stops being a joke. He used to call him ling ling for a whole month. Which is just... no... He constantly calls me Mexican and just blares mariachi music when we’re calling. There’s tai jaun do. Calling me Pablo when my name is Paul. And when I say that I’m going to get something to eat he says oh are you making a taco. He even knows that I hate tacos. We had a whole conversation about how much we both hate tacos. I hate it. I’m Salvadoran. I may suck at speaking spanish but it’s still my background. We had an argument about this on a call and he stopped for a week but immediately started again. Like, did nothing of what I said mean something to you?

He also just calls me gay as if it’s an insult. Sometimes even calling me a faggot. I’m not even gay I’m bi I like both. There’s a difference. It even went as far to him thinking I was doing it for attention. I even had to prove it to him that I liked guys. 

He makes me hate myself. He’s the only one that makes me cry at night. He’s the only one that does this to me. He’s the only one that makes me stay awake at night. I hate it.

He complains that people are so sensitive now but it’s not that we’re sensitive it’s that he’s insensitive. Although yes I am very sensitive so there’s that. Yet when someone makes a small jab at him like calling him a dumb blonde even though we all know he’s one of the smartest in the group, he blows up and makes a scene. 

I want to get out of this but... I’m weak. I can barely stand up for myself. And he used to be so kind to me so I don’t want to hurt him. He also won’t just let me go peacefully. So I’m lost on what to do. Everything is against me. Time him myself. I only have two friends that know of how I feel about wanting to leave him. They agree I should but don’t want to force me into it. I have support but I’m scared. I still owe him money and favours too. So that makes it harder to leave. I’m just scared and want help so I can leave him.",10Aug2020,1
974,"I’ve posted about my best friend a few times before. In short she likes to scream because it makes her laugh. Yes she really is in her 30s. It would seem chaos makes her laugh- she screams and when my dogs run around freaked out and howling she finds it even funnier. It’s not even a regular scream she somehow does these blood curdling shrieks that make my hair stand on end. 

She’s always been like this. When I ask her not to scream she laughs. Then when she stops she’ll say she wants to show me a video she likes and it’s a video of people screaming. 

She now has a fiancé. He just ignores it or chuckles. My husband becomes furious and said she’s not aloud to come over anymore especially because it upsets the animals. 

I agreed to be her bridesmaid because we have been friends well over twenty years and she wants to see us again. I want to give her another chance but I can’t guarantee she won’t start screaming again and this time I think my husband may kick them out. She promised she wouldn’t but this isn’t the first time she’s broken that promise.

Being in public doesn’t necessarily help. Once at a restaurant she put ketchup on her face to look like a “beard” on her chin and started screaming. The restaurant staff was deeply disturbed and she kept trying to reassure all of us that she was “kidding” but they nearly called someone to come get her. 

She does this screaming number and then acts completely normal so people back off. It’s very strange.

976,"Hey r/Advice,

So, I have been dealing with awful anxiety lately and it even from time to time turns into me resenting my friends over stuff which are not their fault.

This is just an explanation though for why I am asking for advice. Normally, this type of thing would not be an obstacle for me.

So, last month I have not had the best time with my relationship. My gf cheated on me for the past few years and only told me now that I was being cheated on for so long. This definitely brought up some issues about my self worth and how I did so much and cared so much for my gf; yet; she ended up doing what she did.

This has made me extra clingy on my best friend and has made him a bit distant at times. Ex: usually we send each other funny shit almost everyday or just want to speak with one another but i am lucky if he initiates a text or sends anything the past month- although I have to admit he has not really been in contact with anyone in our friend group so it is not just towards me I know that too. I completely understand that he wants to focus on his childhood friends right now since in September he and I go back to our apartment again (yes, we are also roommates). I also don’t have many very close friends because I moved around a ton throughout my life and never had any established friendships up until I met my buddy now who is basically a brother to me. However, he grew up and was born in the same small town so he has childhood friends he has been focusing on for the summer. 

Anyway, right now I am in vacation with my family and he and I talked about doing something after I am back. However, I will be honest I gave the idea of doing something so maybe I am overthinking and letting my pride take over, but deep down I get the feeling that he does not really wanna do anything with me based off of his distanced attitude online lately and he only said oh ye lets do something just to say it. I do actually believe this is mostly anxiety and pride speaking but despite him telling me two times last time we spoke “let me know when you are back from vacation with family” I feel like not telling him now because I am doubting he wants to do anything at all and have the feeling that if he really wants to do something he can just hit me up and ask instead of me telling- even if he asked me to let him know.

I would really appreciate advice on the dms. Since, I need someone to talk to as well and will delete this later.

So, should I just give up the bullshit and overthinking and let him know like he asked or be prideful, ignore him and hope I get chased. My overthinking is killing me because this thing that happened w my ex is really making me doubt trust in all my relationships and makes me feel like i need to be colder and more distant to anyone no matter how close I am to them so they understand my value and don’t dispose of me like she did..",10Aug2020,1

981,"I have two friends. Let’s call them... M and A. They aren’t on very good terms with each other. 

Let’s start off by saying that they both have a lot of talents and... I admire them. I really do. A is shy but can be outgoing. M is relatable and funny. They both can be serious when they need to. And... I’m pretty close with both of them. I’ve known A for almost a year now, and M for almost three years. 

Rewind to last summer. M and I used to be very very close, until she started reaching out to other virtual friends long ago.

Though, one day, I was with M virtually. M, barely knowing A, introduced me to them. We talked for a bit. And as I thought we would leave it at that, A started following me everywhere. Keep in note that this is all online and I don’t mean follow as in a profile follow, but A started joining me in servers and such. I will admit I got a little annoyed having no context. I mean, I barely knew A back then, and they were with me all the time. It came to the point where A declared we were best friends. 

I was definitely weirded out. I mean like... what? But I didn’t think too much of it. Soon I got used to A’s company and eventually started talking to them first. Our friendship developed and we really did become literal best friends. I was with A for almost all the time. 

Back to M. I never got a chance to talk to them, as they were always with their other friends and I was always with A. I thought M was better of without me, because I was probably a nuisance. 

Anyways, when M did decide to hang out with me, A was always around. Let me say that A is very sensitive and.. takes things too seriously. Which is why I can’t really be myself around them. Soon, those small moments where me and M hung out just flickered out and.. we didn’t talk at all. I would have a burning feeling whenever I saw M online, but with their other friends. I felt this almost everyday, even when being around A. 

Here is where things get a little messy.

M wasn’t exactly fond of A. M thought A was annoying, like how I did, and how A was an attention seeker, like how I did. M didn’t stick with A long enough to know their true side, the side I talked with everyday. 

A quit the game that we all played on virtually. I decided to quit too because... I had no point in staying. Nobody else to talk to really because M was doing their own thing. A and introduced me to Reddit. I have my own account but this is obviously a throwaway. And soon... I lost touch with M. Completely. I felt this horrible guilt once I quit the game because I left so suddenly (due to pressure) and flooded my emotions upon them (M). Like how I thought I saw them as a sibling and how our friendship was in general. Yeah, those were my “last words” to M, sent by a dumb game feature.

Back to A. We grew even closer, but... in the same way, distant. You know how I said A is sensitive? I could say one thing and boom... goes our friendship. We had constant fights and I always fell into this empty hole of loneliness. A always talked about their problems, which were of course serious. But I felt like I couldn’t share my problems with them because they would be compared to and everything. I strangely felt so much smaller than A, as if they were superior, and this lasted for such a long time. I did share my problems with A once, but I couldn’t bring myself to finish a single sentence. 

I once again felt pressured by A. Being told I was their reason to live.

Time skip to where A had the great idea for us to go back on the old game just for nostalgic purposes. I was refusing. But at the same time, going back there to where M was made me feel... happy. M wasn’t online of course because of their time zone, but I saw their replies to my countless goodbye messages. My heart sank... and I wanted to cry. What would M think after seeing “online two hours ago” on my profile? After reading those dramatic goodbye messages. More importantly, what did M think of me as a person? I hated it. The amount of guilt was unimaginable. After both me and A left the game, I was crying into my pillow. It felt so dumb crying about such a minor thing, but at the same time, I was letting out my bottled feelings from the past, of when I wished I could be back with M and just laugh with them. At least for one second. Just a millisecond of M’s time. The next few months I felt like complete garbage. At that point I was just reminiscing the past. 

As time passed, me and A had another fight.

During this time, I checked another app we had tucked away. M used it with their friends, and I was just like a third wheel like always, and so I stopped using it. But I cannot tell you what I felt when I saw M’s missed notifications. Was it guilt? M doesn’t like A, that’s all cool and dandy, I can’t control that, but... talking to M on the app after months of separation just.. felt so right. It felt so good talking to them again. And to think I missed so many notifications. 

— 

Me and A made up. A soon found out about my silly conversations with M. 

A... had different feelings towards M. A genuinely wanted to be M’s friend and couldn’t find out why they (A) were being avoided in the past. 

So I straight up told A that M thought they were annoying. I regret it so much, because as I said, A is really sensitive. A held onto this statement for such a long, long time and even brought it up once in an argument. It pained me more that annoying wasn’t the only thing M thought A was.

More time passed. Me and A had our biggest, most recent fight. A suggested that we should both just take a break until we feel better.

I went 2-3 weeks, being antisocial and.. basically in a horrible state. Again.

That’s when M, not aware of the situation obviously, started texting me. We were making the same old jokes and having... a good time. While A was probably having a hard time. 

And then M hit me with a question. M asked me if I could go back on our old game. Without thinking, I told M just once.

I felt the happiest in... almost half a year. It felt so wrong. But so, so.. right. My mouth burned from smiling. 

Until M brought A up.

I won’t go too much into it of course, but... M said that A just.. scared them. That A had a weird presence. That A was, again, an attention seeker and... how M got an old friend request from A (before quitting the game) because M unfriended A. I gave small responses back, soon even agreeing with M at some point. It was horrible mocking. Horrible talking behind A’s back. Nothing felt right then.

Of course, after the game, I completely broke down.

Present time. I know that I am obviously in the wrong and that I messed up. I can’t even blame M for mocking A. A really does seem like someone you wouldn’t really be friends with. But A has feelings too. It feels horrible just “moving on” from M when I obviously haven’t. 

I really want to tell A what M said, because I don’t want to keep any secrets, but at the same time, I don’t know how A will handle it. I can’t even talk to them now because of the fight and break.

Can I really keep this act up, pretending that me and A haven’t been through what we have? What will M think of me?

What should I do?",10Aug2020,1
982,"So I'm in a bit of an dilemma and need some advice on what to do...

I was going to attend college A this upcoming September but because of Covid19 my program was cancelled until fall 2021. To give a bit of context I'm taking Aviation Flight management and they can't switch the program to the online classes. I was really pissed because most other college that had Aviation programs were still continuing this year. I had already attended college A and took a preparatory course that would prepare me for the program, I was able to make great friends who were also going to attend the flight program this year. Now everything has changed and from the sounds of it most people in my friend group will be waiting till next year. However I also have an offer to go to college B for the same program and it's actually starting this September. The only downside to going to college B is that it's four times more expensive then the first one for the same program. Aviation programs are usually really expensive and I felt lucky to be accepted to college A because tuition is only 8k a year. I'm already 21 years old and don't want to waste another year of my life however I also don't want to be in massive debt because I'm already in debt from a previous education.

I also forgot to mention the program at college A is 2,5 years long and the program at college B is 2 years.",10Aug2020,1

984,"I'm a 19 year old gay male, Brazilian college student.

People often say that I'm doing OK in life but I feel like that all my accomplishments aren't mine but rather the acts of somebody else or just destiny. In context, whenever I see an intimidating task, I feel like ""I can't do it"" and I somehow get it done with good reception.

I've had an awful first relationship (ended with the partner threatening myself with law as to preserve his image) last year that scarred my self worth to a degree that I ended up hating myself entirely. I sought help but I can't get therapy because of the virus. I can't afford a private therapist as well.

Basically, I feel like I don't deserve anything positive in life because I don't feel like I really did anything to get it. My English level is high but not thanks to a course. I somehow learned the entire language by myself involuntarily rather than going to a private course like my peers. When I told them this, they said that people like me don't really understand the effort many people have to do to speak English and that is sad.

My family doesn't really care about my scores and they don't really mind if I'm getting a zero or ten as long it doesn't affect them financially (I have free tuition). I'm trying to keep good scores in college and it's going okay so far. But again, I feel like those accomplishments are the work of another and not me.

I got a trainee position as a volunteer English teacher. I was very scared but I had a good semester and my students liked the classes to the point I got another class to teach and I'll be paid around $92/mo (R$500) instead of zero. I happily told this to a peer who said he'll be getting paid $127 (R$700) and he said that maybe I didn't deserve a better pay even with the same amount of classes.

Every night I see myself as a big failure. I blame myself for being single, I see myself as an physically ugly, horrible person. Every day I wish I died somehow because I don't feel like I deserve to be alive. Whenever I accomplish something, I feel like it was just a twist of fate again and I just happened to be there.

Is there any way to work around this considering that therapy is a huge no because of the pandemic? I keep losing sleep due to self hatred.

Thanks in advance for reading.",10Aug2020,1
985,"Long story short, some guy cheated on his girlfriend years ago with my current gf (we weren’t dating at the time) and last year his girlfriend found out and ofc got mad at my gf and not her boyfriend...

Anyways, since then they have been making fake tinders, other dating apps, and linkdins trying to get “revenge”. They say things like she likes being a slut and that she’s a professional on onlyfans etc etc. we’re worried about the online reputation that can get ruined from this, if a prospective job was searching for her or something. 

We have no idea what to do about this and need some advice. I believe it is illegal to slander someone’s name like that online, but we really don’t have much hard evidence to give a lawyer. For some reason they added their pictures on a fake tinder account along with my gfs pictures and we have screenshots of those but it doesn’t prove a whole lot.

989,"So I have this really close friend, we'll call her O, and she means the world to me who had an issue in the past. I'm pretty present on twitter although I don't have an enormous amount of followers I have a lot of mutuals and I interact a lot on this app.  Fast forward a few months I rt a tweet about listening to your friends' advices and my friend commented that I was the one to talk because I had dyed hair. I knew she was joking so I replied by referring to that issue she had a few months back, but I'll admit it, in a mean way. She really wasn't over that yet and I hurt her, and although I didn't mean to (thought she was over it) I got her upset. She got cold and distant with me for a while before telling me that she had trouble getting over what I had done, which is legit, but eventually she came forward and said that she was fine with me and from then on we went back to normal.

Fast  forward to this summer, I graduated High . I tweeted about circumcision to know whether people regretted getting one. And a friend commented that ""90% of girls like it better anyway"". One of my friends, we'll call J, said that she didn't. I was surprised and tweeted ""So J prefers to unwrap her meat"" expecting she would see the tweet and we'd joke together. I guess it's something I do a lot with my twitter friends since everyone knows what we're talking about. But J didn't like the tweet as she thought it was offensive. She answered something really dry and mean but I thought she was joking and answered accordingly. It was really trivial to me so I just forgot it. Then later a close friend of J (let's say Q) came to me with a the tweet asking me what it was and she told me that the tweet was really offensive and mean. I didn't realize so I deleted the tweet and immediately came to J to apologize but she had blocked me. Then another friend ( W)  texted me, asking me to stop talking about my friend on twitter. They were really mad at me, without context the tweet is mean, and they  came for me hard. They brought back what happend with O and stuff. They basically were ma and for a long time but couldn't say anything because O asked them not to.  I understand that I hurt J, I guess I don't know what is correct and what isn't. I wish I could at least apologize to J and also I wish she could tell me directly. 

This happend a few days ago. And just now, this girl, who is a bully so we'll call her B. She has issues, she's mean af and bullied me for the 2 years we were in the same class. It was pretty lowkey and she is really popular so I wouldn't say anything, and besides I hate confrontation, I can't deal with it so I just avoid it. So this girl is really mean and everyone knows and she also happens to be gifted with a really small butt.  And just now she came to me with a tweet from January which says ""I know a girl who's so mean that she don't have no ass"". W had searched for this tweet and showed it to B telling her I was talking about her. For the record I don't even recall tweeting this but it musn't have been about B since she follows me on twitter.  So I told her that it wasn't about her. And she came for me and confronted me about O and J. She was pretty agressive and given the fact that she is the meanest bitch I know I understand how she might've felt targeted by the tweet. However, everything she said applies to her but 10x worse like this girl is Evil. And W said it herself like she knows she is a bully ! Which is why I don't understand why she did that ? She wanted me to deal with her for what? As a punishment? As a warning??? I don't get it. Besides I have clinical depression and B told me that me joking about it, or me joking about me being fat was annoying to everyone. Like oops sorry if my coping mechanism was that annoying you could've just told me or muted me? Did I mention, she's fucking racist and I have proof of that? 

I know that I wronged people in this story, I deserve them coming for me but I feel like W sending me a Bully to attack me is pointless, and they're all talking in her back too ! I just don't get it but I'm glad school is over.  Please tell me what I should do and whether they were right to do that. I don't care you can tell me if you have questions tell me. I deleted all my socials for now because I feel like that's the right thing to do.",10Aug2020,1
990,"I’m 16(F)

My family went on a trip. They decided to drive up a mountain (it had no guardrails and was 6,000 feet high), and I was too scared. I told them I didn’t want to go but they still made me. During the middle I saw we were really high and close to the edge and I freaked out and started crying so we came back down. I was also too afraid to go on the ski lift. It’s strange though, I wouldn’t really say I’m afraid of heights but something freaked me out.

Then we went biking, and I was apparently going really slow. I was too afraid to go really fast, and I was fine at the pace I was. My family (mainly my siblings) got annoyed at me though and were mad that I was going so slow.

I’m scared of a lot of things.

I’m afraid of bugs too which always annoys my family. I’m really shy and anxious talking to people which annoys me and my family. I’m scared of the dark. 

I get scared from reading other stories of people. For example, I used to not be able to sleep well because I was afraid of dying in my sleep (I’ve luckily gotten over that) And I used to get really anxious anytime I felt bad or sick because I’ve read stories of people dying from random brain aneurisms or blood poisoning, etc. I read one bad story of something going wrong, and suddenly I’m afraid of the same thing happening to me.

I don’t know why I feel like I’m always so anxious and afraid. I just want to be able to have fun like everyone else without being scared.

I feel like I should have outgrown this already. It’s strange but I don’t remember being so anxious when I was younger; and I’ve never been in an accident or anything like that that would make me afraid.",10Aug2020,1

993,"We met on one of those subreddits for making friends the other week and just really got on well. It was a little rocky but for some reason we both just really liked the other enough to keep on speaking.

We’re both from the same country and very similar ages. They are currently very nervous because soon they are getting Exam Results that will determine if they get into the University of their dreams.

It has become apparent that my internet friend has pedestaled this University above all others. They have openly admitted to getting really emotional after the first paper of two. 

With the day of results approaching they are becoming more and more nerve wracked. I, to my shame, didn’t notice until tonight. Where they kind of just vented it all out.

I can’t say anything that will help. What can you say to someone worried about exams? “I’m sure you did fine”? Even when the person themselves has said they didn’t feel they did well?

997,"A little background: Me and my friend, who we'll call Mike, are starting high school this fall, and he recently confessed to one of our previous classmates, who we will call Erika). She's a really caring and nice person, with roughly the same interest as my friend (anime, a few nintendo games, highest grades in school etc.) Erika responded by saying that no one has really loved her before, but she would like to meet.
The problem is that neither of them has went on a date before. They have chatted via text and snapchat, but havent even talked to eachother over the phone during the 3 weeks they have been in contact. They tried meeting up in the city centre about a week and a half ago, and Erika brought her friend with her to comfort her, but she still couldnt meet Mike because she was so nervous. Mike doesnt have mobile data so he couldnt see the messages they sent on snapchat to him saying that they werent coming because Erika had a ""panic attack"", so he spent over an hour waiting for them at the station.
Already up to a bad start, right? Well, Mike and Erika STILL haven't talked. Mike told me he puked TWICE because of nervousness, the first when he confessed and the second when he was about to meet her in the city. They have been chatting a bit during last week, that's about it, but this is where he asked me for help. Earlier this evening he told me on discord that he wanted my help with a date, and told me that he had confessed to Erika about 3 weeks ago. At the time I was really happy for him because I had already suspected that he liked her, but I didn't really think much if it back then. 
I suggested we meet up and talk about it since we live close to each other. About 15 minutes later I could ask him in person about the details, which is all the background I have given up until now. I tell him that he has to ask Erika if she wants to talk over a phonecall to clear things up, and that if they talk to each other and make plans and hear each others voices, it will be a lot easier for them when they eventually meet. I also suggest going to a shopping mall nearby, since there's a lot of things to do there and you never really run out of things to talk about or places to go to. 
He then says that Erika wants to bring her friend, so he wants to bring me there too. At first I thought it was a kind of weird idea, but the more I thought about it and put myself in Mike and Erika's shoes, the more it made sense. They are both so nervous that they panic/puke, and this is their first experience with something like this.
The reason im posting this in r/relationshipadvice is that a lot of problems have appeared. My friend, with my encouragement, called Erika to tell her that he had a plan for a new meetup. A lot of signals went through, but she didn't answer. She texted Mike saying ""I don't feel like talking, I hope you know why. Sorry."" Which made Mike feel even more lost and nervous. He still powered through and texter her about our plans, which made him feel a bit more releaved. 
Around this time we went our separate ways, and about 30 minutes later we started talking on Discord (online voice and text chatting app) and he told me that Erika's friend had written (from Erika's phone for some reason) that they didnt want to go to the mall, they wanted to meet up where me and Mike lives. 
I actually don't know why they preferred to stay here, and Mike didn't want to ask them, so I suggested to Mike that we should at least visit the local pizzeria. There's not much to do where we live, since it's in the outskirts of town. Im worried that there won't be a lot of things to do except talk, which is probably going to be really awkward. 
The questions that I want to ask you guys are:
- How can I and Erikas friend prevent Mike and Erika from clinging to their respective friend? I predict that this is gonna happen a lot. Just FYI I have never talked to the friend Erika is bringing so I'm not sure what kind of person she is.
- How can I make their date go smoothly? Do I just get out of the way? Should I know when to help? Mike says he wants support but I'm just as clueless as him about what to do.
- What are some signs I can look for to tell how Erika actually feels? She might just agree to a date because she would feel bad if she said no. 
- What is a good way to break the ice? I am planning on asking if I can add Erika's friend on snapchat, and sending a picture of Mike and Erika together to ""see if it works"".

Keith is a little bit older than us with law trouble &amp; drug trouble, 4 kids, selfish, cant hold a job and etc.. Unfortunately she saw stars and went for a rock instead of a gem. When I met Keith he did not have custody of any of his children. The first two kids he had state took away, and he left the last two with their meth addicted mother (Bertha) who was abusing them. Jaz and Keith moved in together and Jaz pushed Keith to get the kids out of there, and he never really tried. One day Keith gets a call from Bertha who is in jail for meth and said their kids were found in the trap house with her and he needs to come get them from the station or state will take them. Jaz drops everything gets off work and drives a state away to get his kids. After getting the kids they had trouble finding a baby sitter. I offered to babysit since I just had my son and had the time. Well after a while I noticed odd behavior in the kids. Such as the oldest (4) telling me stories about how parents friend would kiss her on the lips, and was the ""secret keeper"". The eldest would bend over doing kid stuff and their sibling (2) would try to rub private parts. My husband came home early one day and the eldest kept trying to touch the front of his pants. He would move the child away explained that it was not okay, and to not do it again. He told me about it and said he was very uncomfortable. He stayed in our back room until they went home. They would come to me with multiple infected bug bites, the youngest had a medical problem (keeping all identity out can't say what). Everytime a problem would come up Jaz and Keith were notified through text and face to face. Nothing would change. As things got worse the eldest told me that they were left home alone. While Keith took Jaz to work. A four year old and a two year old were left home for 40 mins or longer..

I called DHS and reported them.

1002,"Hi everyone,

So I just started using reddit. I need some advice since it seems like I can get responses on reddit. I will decide for myself but hearing everyone's advice would help me and get me thinking more.

I'm a 24 years old woman living in Toronto. It's expensive here Lol. But I managed to survive decently throughout the years. I didn't graduate school or go to university. I had a rough childhood and towards my teen years I wasn't as ambitious and just didn't realize how difficult life can be. I've made good and bad choices. My bad choices obviously leaves me with feelings of regrets and I learned from that. However going forward into life being 24 feels like I'm getting older and need to get real serious.

I do want to go to school however I need to survive and live as well. So mixing school and work won't really go well. It's just too hard. I am not financially stable. Just enough for me to live and get things I need.

I am a receptionist / office administrator and throughout the last 5 years I've been in that field with different employers. It's tough. Sometimes I feel like it's a dead end and I feel like I can do more. But I don't have the qualifications. Employers look for a degree, and experience which I lack of.

How can I move on getting a decent job where I can save more and gain more experience with a possible opportunity to climb within the company? Any advices on self discipline and financial savings?

I got big dreams but I had a rough start in life. A really rough start. Depression has been something I've been dealing with over the years. Some times it's ok but sometimes it's really hard.

Like, it’s bad, and the quarantine’s made it worse. If I were a DnD character, it’d be a Wisdom score of either 8 or 6. I frequently and consistently misplace and/or forget things, I space out a ton to daydream about other things, I constantly need to be told by my parents on what to do for chores and basic hobbies — in their own words, “it’s like I need to be baby-sat”. My sister has a lot more common sense than me, and I struggle profusely on how to even begin to improve — because I don’t even know where to start. The world around me is vivid, but there’s so many things that it just becomes supremely difficult for me to act on it or know what “needs” attention, to the point my parents worry in the event of a fire, I wouldn’t even notice it. And that’s scary to me.

Thing is, I don’t even know where to start, even though I have all the knowledge in my head from classes; it just doesn’t _transfer_ for whatever reason, and I just wound up being caught thinking about other things to sort of tune out because I don’t even know where to begin + it doesn’t interest me so much. Hence, it’s why I ended up relying on others to help me figure out what to do, which I know isn’t healthy but it’s the only solution that worked for me, and I hate it. I hate that I can’t find a way to “know” what needs to be done, and online searches for “I have bad common sense” or “I have no common wisdom” get me to things that are likely completely unrelated.

Ive had the luxury to live with my parents, but soon I will have no choice but to move out. I cannot afford a house anytime soon. I will have to get an apartment. But I am afraid I will disturb neighbors and have my lease terminated due to my screaming at night. Is there anything I can do? Or will I be homeless?

1012,"Title says it all. I went in having the impression that college was fun, a blast, the most memorable time of your life.

Even though I’m an incoming sophomore and only have experienced one year, my lack of social skills and my social anxiety prevented me from making new friends. I have thought about this a lot of why I don’t like college and I think it comes to the fact that I’m just very lonely and not very capable of making new friends or at least talking to new people. 

I like the idea of college and how classes are formatted obviously, but never did I think my lack of friends and a social life would affect my school life. 

So in the title I mentioned being stuck in a loop. I’m stuck in a loop that wants to try to get better at socializing, but even when I try, my anxiety really gets to me and then I go back to shutting myself down. For this semester, I’m living at home and doing everything online, and a part of me is relieved because I’m alone in my room and having the part of college I like with me. But then I remember how people were so eager to get on campus again despite the housing with the pandemic and I get that motivation to want to try to make new friends, and then I enter that loop with my anxiety, and then getting relieved that I’m staying home and wondering if I should just commute for the rest of college, and then I’m back to thinking no, I need to try, etc... 

So I guess the advice I’m asking for is a simple, how do I get out of this loop or some advice on how to just get better at socializing. If my anxiety is always putting me in this loop, is there any other way to make college somewhat enjoyable for myself?",10Aug2020,1

1017,"I've talked about the situation on this subreddit before, but a quick recap: I'm 20NB, my partner is 26NB. I'm in a long distance relationship with them. I'm in the closet and I currently live with my religious parents, but I'm scheduled to move on campus in about a week and a half for senior year.

My mom in particular was very abusive towards me growing up, which mainly manifested in being extremely controlling and manipulative, destroying my self esteem, socially isolating me (i wasn't allowed to go to school), not allowing me to go to doctors unless it benefited her personally, and giving me an intense fear of death/damnation for disobedience/disrespect. This followed me well into high school and adulthood, to the point that I wasn't even able to choose my major in school if it went against her will.

Back in March, I made the plan with my partner to come out to my parents, move on campus until the semester was over, and then spend the summer with them before coming back. The hope was that access to the on-campus therapists and counselors would help give me the strength and support to get out of my situation, and that that way, if something happened between us or my family came around, I could go back and live in the dorms.

Then COVID hit, and the world kind of came crashing down, along with any plans I had to leave. My partner had offered to at least come and visit me, or try to come get me before all this started, but they are also at risk, as are several of their family, and they can't fly into a state that never put a lockdown order in place and will not make masks mandatory in most places.

This made things considerably more difficult. It meant that I couldn't take my car (as hotels weren't open for a while), which meant I needed a lot of documentation for different things in order to leave the state with my ESA. A lot of these things took a long time and a lot of research, so I only ended up being able to leave about mid-late July. It is now August. I have everything set to leave, all I need is to book a plane ticket and leave. In fact, I have until the 14th to do so, because that's when my cat's health certificate expires and I need to get a new one. Which would probably take another 2 weeks, and more money.

In addition, my family has put a lot of time/money into helping me move into the dorms. This has resulted in them being considerably kinder to me (something that they did to my older brother as well) in the weeks leading up to me leaving. Up until this point, I could barely leave my room due to the treatment I received whenever I left. This not even to mention that I am gay and nonbinary, and they have openly expressed their hatred of the LGBTQ+ community. But now that I'm not going to be living with them anymore, they seem almost like normal (albeit homophobic) parents.

My partner is rightfully upset that I haven't left yet, as I told them back in March that I'd get up the courage to leave over the summer. Now, school is starting up again, I'm still here, and they haven't seen me. They made preparations for me to come and live with them, but the guilt and fear that comes whenever i look at plane tickets has me frozen. I feel so scared and uncertain. I know, realistically, that there's nothing for me here. 

At the same time, up until this point, my life has been lived in secret. I've had to, even as an adult, get permission for everything from ""Can I wear this dress"" to ""Can I have this friend"" to ""Can I get this job"" and so on. I've always had that innate fear of going to hell if I disobey my parents, and this feels like the ultimate rebellion.

1021,"Hello, 

so its my first time posting here and  figured I should keep this to the main points, even though its a bit long, but can answer more in detail....

So its like this.....I went to a community college soon after High School because I figured it was a good choice of saving money, and then transferring to that 4 year college life, and get that B.S. soon after right? Well......

At community college ""A"",  I put my major as Computer Science to then transfer to a 4 year, which was in Fall of 2015, and then I changed my major in Fall of 2017 to mechanical engineering to then switching to kinesiology-allied health in Spring of 2018, because ultimately I figured id just slog through and play catch up with all the math courses I have to take, and just switched.

And with Allied Health..I figured at the time I can do well with being a Physical Therapist with my interest in the human body and all that, and that's when I enrolled at Community College ""B"" in fall of 2018 because their physics courses were 'better' to understand, and because its a class requirement for that major. And that hearing about their vocational programs seemed pretty interesting to me as well. 

Then at some point, I figured that maybe, yeah...this isnt for me after all, and thats when I thought of doing a trade, but then decided on an ""Information Systems and Technology"" major in the spring of last year, particularly with an interest of cyber security to it.

As it stands, I have a general AA degree that I could get but figure its useless. And that I am 5 classes away from an AS in Information Systems at community college ""B"", but its mainly geared toward preparation for upper division courses at the local 4 year college, which I have done almost all of the lower-division courses required in transferring to that local 4 year college.  Also Ill have 103.25 credits by the end of fall 2020, and have been really trying to learn to code with Python and study IT, among other things, for the last few months.

For my other experiences within last year, I have done some volunteer work at this community shelter for 5 months , and that I have a food handler certificate that i got but haven't really used at all. And that I just only started having work experience through a temp agency at a warehouse last year, which only lasted a month because I was told that my work period had ended and that I contact them again for work. From that point, its just mainly been temporary warehouse work with an instance of seasonal, holiday work at a Kohls Warehouse.

It doesn't also help that I've kind of 'disassociated' and feel numb to where my life is now. 

Any thoughts on this?",10Aug2020,1
1022,"Howdy, I'm here with a sequel to my last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hc1gc9/am\_i\_allowed\_to\_feel\_a\_gift\_i\_made\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hc1gc9/am_i_allowed_to_feel_a_gift_i_made_was/)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll summarize the post so you don't need to read through, but I figured I'd include it. 

I made an RPG for a group of my friends as a (very, very late) Christmas Present. I started in October, hoping to release it by Christmas, and the project kept growing, as I really wanted to make it something they could actually enjoy. It didn't come out until June 2nd, but it seemed pretty hyped up as it was a game made for them, starring them, filled with inside jokes we all love. 

The whole process was incredibly stressful and taxing on me. I spent around 1,500 hours on the software, so that's not including planning, writing, bug-testing (I recruited some other friends, including my girlfriend, to test it) time. Development took up nearly all of my free time outside of my full-time, 8-5 job. When my state went into the Stay-At-Home order for COVID, I was spending 9-13 hours a day on it. I didn't mind all the work; it was for my friends, people I love.

The end product, based on the tests, could be completely beaten anywhere from 5 to 15 hours. Not a very long game. Before release, everyone insisted their schedules were clear and were eager to play it. 

Long story short, of the five of them, only one has actually played through it. Another one plays intermittently, two of them seem to have abandoned it half-way through, and the last never even downloaded it. It has been over two months since I gave it to them. 

To say it hurt is honestly putting it lightly. It, combined with the stress of recent global events, has helped push my mental state to a terrifying limit, the kind that I am now seeking therapy for. 

It'd be a different thing if I made this game for randoms to put on the Steam Marketplace for like $5.00 and it got no reception, but this was something that I'd spent all that time for these five people *specifically*. They know how busy it kept me, because we all live together (with the exception of one friend). 

I'd been holding in the frustration, the disappointment, yadda yadda, for two months, and my gut keeps telling me I need to let them know how much pain I'm going through because it's gone ignored. I just don't know how to do it. I'm afraid of them telling me it's my fault for getting upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

I made a video game for my closest friends and they barely touched it. It felt like the effort and 1,500 hours of work were neglected, but more importantly I was shelved as a friend. 

Any advice-- whether it's for how to begin that conversation, or that I am in the wrong here-- is greatly appreciated. I'm also happy to provide more information (i've been holding it in for so long, I am honestly a little eager to get it off my chest...) Thank you.",10Aug2020,1

1025,"Hey everyone. Hope you all are safe and healthy. 

I apologize in advance, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in. Also, in advance, apologies for the really long post. 

One of my best friends passed away from pneumonia, on the 9th of August, 2020 (Tested negative for covid). His funeral was yesterday (10th). 

I've been trying to accept this news. I am able to make the day go by without thinking too much. But, night time is where my memories of him come flooding into my mind, and I can't sleep. 

Both of us just graduated from university last year as Engineers. He was.....a genius, or, probably more correctly, he was a gifted talent. He knew something about everything, from programming in C++, to working with Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi, to doing Image Processing stuff in MATLAB, to being an expert in Bikes and Food, the list goes on. He was the #1 ranked student of our branch/field. The saying ""Jack of all trades..."" could really apply to him, except that it could be modified to ""Jack of all trades, master of ALMOST all"". On more than one occasion, he even did a mini-project from scratch for me, all by himself, when I wasn't able to generate the correct output for mine, even though his own project was pending. 

Now when I look back at my time as an engineering student, I feel really guilty. I feel bad that I didn't hang around with him more. I feel bad that I didn't stay in touch with him that often after we graduated. 

Most of all, I feel bad that it was he who had to leave this world, and not me. Compared to him, I couldn't be more below average as an engg student. I lack problem solving skills, i'm pretty shit at programming, and, I could never do projects alone without asking for help. I'm a loser who hasn't even managed to secure a job for over  a year since I graduated, while he got the job offer in the 2nd job interview he went for. 

He was surely the one who could have helped change the world with his immense potential and his hunger to learn &amp; solve problems. He had so much to offer. He even had his job in the R&amp;D dept of the company he was working for. He could have, and, imo, would have come up with ideas that could have helped make 2020 a less painful year. 


And yet, he had to be the one taken away, a mere month shy of his 23rd birthday. If only there was a way in which he could he brought back to life (even if in exchange for my own), it wouldn't sting so much. In the 1 year since we graduated, I've done nothing productive. Not landed a job, not kept in touch with most of my friends, wasting time, and I'm still stuck in the tutorial hell of Python programming. While he was doing almost everything right to achieve his dreams. And yet, death chose him and not me.

Amidst this whole flood of thoughts, I'm determined to do something to honour him. I want to do something for him. Something like a ""in loving memory of...."". But, idk what. 

And this is where I come to seek advice from you guys. What do you think I could do to dedicate something in his name? I, unfortunately, couldn't even attend his funeral since we were living in different cities and lockdown restrictions meant that flights weren't available, making me feel guilty for not being able to pay my last respects to him. 

This news about him makes me wanna live, and it makes me want to fight this stupid year and the misery it has brought us. But, idk what to do. Idk where to start.   And, idk if someone like me, who doesnt even know what I want to do with my life, can really do something that will impact the world. 

I've always been ""all talk, no show"", and, the above paragraphs make me feel this is happening again. But, this time, i really dont want these words to be....empty words. I want them to mean something.

So, please, help me out. Guide me. I'm confused. I'm lost. I want to help myself, and also help you guys (I know this, again, sounds like ""big words, but nothing to show for it"" kind of thing, but, I really mean it). Tell me what I can do, and what I should do, so that I can make his passing, and my efforts, be more meaningful than they currently are.


A massive thank you, to anyone who can give advice. Even those that cannot, it's okay. Just you reading this post is enough support for me. 

Have a nice day, everyone. Again, sorry for the long answer, and also, apologies if this post sounds too negative. 

Stay safe, and stay in touch with your good friends  family members, and people that you adore.",10Aug2020,1
1026,"So I wanna be short about this bc I can ramble on forever. I recently broke up with a girl who Id been with for 3 1/2 years. She recently messaged me (this being about 6 months after the break up) talking about plenty of reasons why we broke up. One being something that struck a nerve with me that I need advice on. I have a friend, who I’m no longer very close with but at one point was one of my closest friends. He is known all around by everyone to be an amazing person a very likable super nice guy who goes out of his way for everyone. I know this guy very very well and there really isn’t anything that would suggest he’d do something bad. But about a year ago a bunch of my friends went out partying and one of the girls needed a place to stay. From here out this is all rumors and none of it other then the fact this girl stayed at said friends house is confirmed. But apparently he wasn’t very drunk while she was and when she stayed he offered her the bed while he slept on the floor but sometime during the night they had sex. So if all of those “rumors” are true that would highly suggest he could have raped this girl in some capacity. But the thing is really no one knows the truth. When hearing this news I wasn’t very close to him anymore but I did separate myself from him. I told my girlfriend at the time and she was disgusted and didn’t want us to be his friend anymore. As time went on I kept running into him wether it be by complete accident or him hanging out with my other friends. The news of this “rape” died down and really kinda disappeared. The girl who it happened to still was friend with everyone besides him. She’s this outgoing girl who gets into a lot of relationships. Anyways I kept running into him and I didn’t really treat him any differently then I used to. I didn’t cut him off I kinda stayed his friend. My gf at the time hated that and it was a constant argument through out the remainder of the relationship and she brought it up again. I’m at a loss bc am I a horrible person for being this guys friend. None of this rape stuff was reported to police it was kinda just a rumor that went around that died. But if he did rape her shouldn’t I have cut him off? He’s still friends with all of my friends and dare I say myself. I just feel so conflicted in it and it makes me feel like a bad persons being his friend if he did it. But at the same time I would be a bad friend not being there for him if he didn’t. I just need a outside view for this. (We are all around about 21 and 20) I guess what I’m really asking his how should I treat this friend since my ex made me feel like a horrible person still being his friend.",10Aug2020,1

1028,"I'm going to try and condense my post as much as I can. Im a 23 F. I have never had a good life I grew up poor but above that my dad was extremely abusive towards my mom and me. It made my mom crack and by the time I was 10 she checked out. By 11 my parents divorced (I found out my mom was cheating and told my dad so they would divorce.) I couldn't live in the house with him anymore. I wanted him dead. 

By 11 both parents checked out. I was home alone all of the time and could do pretty much whatever I wanted. What I think I really wanted was some attention so I would draw it upon myself. Usually negative so someone would notice me or notice I needed help. Sometimes when my dad was beating my mother she would ask me to call the police but he told me if I did that he would kill her so I never did. He also told me to never cry so I didn't know how to ask for help. I even faked a pregnancy at 14 just so a teacher and my mom would notice me. Nothing ever came of it except a trip to planned parenthood and suspensions for acting out. 

My father never really resembled a father I see him more as an older dysfunctional brother. He is an alcoholic drug addict. He started smoking weed with me at 13 giving me weed and alcohol whenever I wanted. Then by 15 he was giving me pills.  Xanax and pain medication. The pain medication made me feel complete. Like it was the only thing I needed in life to be okay.

I planned on killing myself at 15 for a combination of things like the death of my very first boyfriend (he was in an accident) and feeling completely alone. My parents weren't really concerned with me. My mother kicked me out because her bf at the time wanted me out. We didnt get along. I moved in with my grandparents. My grandpa started molesting me. He would come into my bedroom every morning before school and touch me inappropriately. I would just pretend to be asleep. I didn't know how else to react except play dead.

Then I met my 2nd boyfriend on the school bus and I really do feel like he saved my life. I would have done it had I not met him. He has a great family that I latched onto but then he became extremely depressed and I didn't know how to handle it at the time being young myself. We would take pain meds together and smoke weed and just stay together out of the sake of codependency. I left him for good at 20 and the pain that it caused me I just dove head first into drug use. 

By then I had a dealer and could get what I needed regularly. Was an addict for about 2 and a half years. My dad knew and would make comments and my mother (I finally cracked from living with my grandpa and moved back in with my mom) would walk in on me doing pills and she would ask what I was doing and I would just tell her to get the fuck out of my room. I ended up going to a concert with my dad and we did some molly and nitrous together. I broke down crying from the molly and told him that I was addicted to pain medication, that I need it to function and that I needed help. He asked if I wanted to go to rehab, I said yes. I guess he wasn't expecting that so he told me rehab doesn't work and I'll help you withdrawal. So I would go over to see him everyday and he would basically just put out a line of subutex. (It helps with people going through withdrawal) and every day it would be less and less until I had to just lay in bed for a few months and just wish I was dead.

Of course I was in my bed a lot of the time so I eventually had to just tell my mom. Instead of help she was kind of stand offish and told people I had mono. I eventually got over it and felt really fucking good. That's when I met my current boyfriend. I've been sober for 2 years now. But I just don't feel right anymore. I have a shit fucking job with terrible work conditions and I work with a lot of sketchy people while my bf is almost finished with schooling. He is incredibly smart and is going to be in a higher educated career. I dont want to flat out say it but I hope that makes some sense. 

Now at this point I feel like a failure. I'm anxious all of the fucking time. I don't want to really leave my home let alone my bed unless needed. I feel just so down and disgusted with myself. I can put on a fake mask when needed I can still socialize but I just feel no emotion for anyone except my boyfriend. I can't afford therapy but I feel like I really need help. I wasn't always like this I used to love to be with friends go out all of the time. I tried to have as much fun at work. Now I don't even feel like myself. I don't even recognize who I am anymore. My personality has been almost sucked from me. I only told the backstory just for some reasoning as to why I might feel this way. I Just need some help and direction on how to do that. I have no one to talk to about this. If anyone could help me with some advice it would be so appreciated. I want my life back.",10Aug2020,1

I’ll be starting my Pre-Reqs for a Nursing degree and all anyone can talk about is how hard the degree is and how you never get any free time. I know I should just be grateful I get to go to college but I can’t stop stressing about it taking up all my time. 
To try and mitigate this stress, I’ve already started studying for my classes. I’m averaging about 10 hours a day. My parents say they’re worried about me and that I need to give myself a break. The thing is, every-time I take a break now, I feel like I’m stealing a break from myself in the future. 
It’s like I can’t stop studying, even when my parents make me out my books away, I just pull up the pictures of the textbook I have on my phone. I just can’t relax, even now as I’m typing this I feel like an idiot for not studying and wasting my time online. 
Logically, I know that most people do relax during college, but I can’t stop myself from thinking that I need to study as much as possible now or else I’ll never have any down time later. 
The thing is, I don’t think my parents understand how much I need to study. I graduated with over a 4.6 GPA so everyone assumes school comes easy to me. But college is such a different environment than High School!

A while after I relapse into a bad depressive episode, and I finally confess to her that I wasn't doing well (that was why I wasn't talking as much), and she said she would be there for me. After I told her, I didn't hear from her much, she might have messaged twice that month, but only things like memes. I get through it, and she messaged two months ago and tells me that she and my other good friend (we would hang out together always) were dating as of December, and she felt weird telling me and didn't want me to know. I already had an idea that they were; they were hanging out more alone, not talking to me, and the last time we spoke she was very adamant that this other friend was no longer dating whoever. I wasn't upset, or sad, but I knew that this couldn't continue. I didn't have anyone else, I wasn't interested in making a new friendship at my school and I still don't. Anytime she does talk to me it's either ranting about her family, asking for a ride (I always said I was busy), or sending memes. Anyways, she messaged me today after not responding for 10 days and said ""Hey if you're mad at me or something you please just let me know if we're not friends anymore. because we don't really talk anymore and even when you're busy you always found a way to text,"" I'm not mad, or even upset with her or the other friend. I knew from the beginning it would end like this. But, what do I say to her? I don't want to continue what's happening now, but I don't want to be cold and hurt her either.",10Aug2020,1

1037,"hi for some context i’m a 14 year old girl who also happened to be gay, i have a friend who is 14 and is bisexual, we’ve been friends for a year now, and we have lots in common, had at one point wanted to live together, and we often make jokes about us dating and kissing and such.

i went over to her house for a sleepover in which it was her birthday and she was turning 14, we watched a movie and cuddled and joked and snacked and just had a fun time, but then she started being all jokey and was like “ haha we should kiss” and stuff like that over and over and in my head i thought, okay maybe that wouldn’t be so bad and so i made a plan for when the clock hit 12 and she turned 14 i would kiss her, not a make out sesh but just a little peck, so soon 12 came and we kissed, it was good, she kissed back and it was fine, we kissed( peck kiss ) 2 more times per her request(she asked to kiss me again) and we went to sleep

when we woke up the next morning she acted really weird and strange, she barely talked to me and wouldn’t get to close to me, when i got home i texted her and she didn’t respond, about 4 hours later (10 pm) i called her and we talked ( it was a bit awkward) and after about an hour she said “ this conversation is getting boring bye” which she had never done and she usually hates rude, upfront stuff like that so it was weird

finally she text me today at 1 pm and i called her and she was on the phone for 2 mins and said she had to go to the convenience store and she never called back or texted back, i text her back at 4 and i haven’t heard from her since and it’s 7, this might sound clingy but we are just really close and are on the phone majority or the day bc it’s quarantine so this is definitely not the norm",10Aug2020,1
1038,"As the title says, my boyfriend has a very very close friend who in recent years has made a lot of sexual “jokes” about my boyfriend and is constantly trying to touch in inappropriately. We strongly believe that he’s gay/bi and in the closet but anytime someone even suggests this he gets extremely offended and insists he’s “not a homo”. 

The behaviour can be anything from just calling my boyfriend hot to straight up saying he wants to suck his dick or trying to lick my boyfriends nipples. One night while really drunk he admitted to me that he was “jealous” of my relationship with my boyfriend but now pretends that he has no memory of saying this. Other friends of my boyfriend have told us that he’s like this with a other men who share my boyfriends physical attributes. 

We want him to know that we’re his friends and we care about him, and that we support him and whoever he wants to be. If he is attracted to men that won’t change the way that we treat him or look at him and he doesn’t have to use humour to disguise his feelings. That said, what he’s doing makes my boyfriend extremely uncomfortable as anyone would be when someone is making unwanted sexual advances toward them. My boyfriend always tries to laugh it off but I can tell that it’s exhausting for him and it makes everyone else around feel extremely awkward as the whole dynamic is just so off. We also don’t want him to feel like we’re forcing him to come out if the topic of his sexuality is brought up. 

I’m not really sure how to handle this and would appreciate any and all advice on how to handle this situation. He’s a great friend and we’d like to keep him in our lives but my boyfriend doesn’t deserve to feel uncomfortable all the time.",10Aug2020,1
1039,"Hi all.

This is a tough one to post I just thought I'd never have a conversation like this in my entire life- but I'll dive right into it.

Basically my ex and I dated for a year and broke up 3 months ago? But have been talking the entire time since/ still hooking up from time to time. Anyways- She was abused as a child by her adopted sibling- her and her two sisters (they're 2 years younger). From when my ex was from about 7-13 years old he would abuse her, rape her, assault her, force her to suck his dick, throw her into walls, and the parents did nothing- she claims that the 'mom' knew but didn't do anything and the dad just didn't know, happened to her sisters as well. Seems like he kinda singled them out. She told me all about this in our time together and would often cry about it and say how her dad does nothing about it and nothing's ever going to change even though the abuse stopped around 5-6 years ago. She lives with her dad and the two sisters as well, the guy lives around 2 towns over but it still 'around' as the dad supports him and has bailed him out of FOUR different DUI's.

Regardless, I knew a lot about this guy and he knows nothing about me, I have such a severe hatred for him after all that I've heard, its just the most horrible thing I've ever heard, I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. However, today- I saw him. Right in front of me at the gas station waiting for the checkout line. He looked familiar and I say ""Hey you remind me of somebody what's your name?

""Douche"" (names changed for legal reasons?) he says,

and I go ""oh, Douche F\*ck?""

He goes ""Yea how do I know you brother?""

I said, ""oh I dated your sister,""

I watched the expression on his face drop behind his mask, he turned around and went silent. My blood is absolutely boiling at this point, I am fuming on the inside and want to see the worst things imaginable happen to this POS. He checks out and I give the teller my cash and walk out, but I ask him, ""hey man question for ya.""

""How do you live with yourself""

he said, ""oh you've probably heard a few rumors about me"" and chuckled a bit.

I was so goddamn pissed off at this point but I stayed calm and collected the entire time.

I replied ""You shouldn't be let off the hook for brutally raping 3 girls for a decade and getting four DUI's, people know about this""

He just walked away and got into his GF's car. I just kinda starred him down as they sped off. I Immediately call my ex and say- hey so I met him today, this is exactly what I said. I know I probably shouldn't have done it but this is what happened.

I'm at work and a few hours later I get a call from my ex and her dad together basically threatening legal action against me if I ever contact any of them again- I straight up told the dad that his adopted son shouldn't get away with that and that he needs to man up and take care of his daughters who are all his dependents still.

I said ""You let this guy rape your three daughters in your home for over a decade."" (definitely overstepping all boundaries, even the dad had told me he loved me in the past)

to which he basically started yelling that's enough and that he couldn't handle it and to not contact them again. I hadn't been talking to her at all except for when she called me two nights ago and we ended up talking for around 3 hours. the last time we talked was basically 3 weeks ago when we was freaking out this for other reasons and I left a bottle of champagne for her birthday the next day.

So I don't know what to do, Im in my mid 20's and talked to my friend's mom who's a lawyer and basically said that I'm totally in the clear and it wasn't harassment or anything along those lines. I'm just still so pissed off about the whole thing, my ex would freak out because her dad wasn't doing anything for her. I'm the first person to ever confront this person about this outside her family to even at that point was discreet. My lawyer friend basically if anything did happen the dad would implicate himself for a ton of different neglect crimes and more, as well as other things and that's why he threatened me with that? They just don't want to expose it? So idk what to do, She's blocked from everything, we were never on the best of terms especially recently (last month or so), after we split it was basically her being mad at me all the time (I'm not perfect either) and things about this guy- super toxic environment which all my friends told me to get TF out of.

Is posting this against my best interest? Could I get in trouble for anything along these lines? I'm just not sure what to do here besides never talk to any of them again.

Am I the asshole here? The biggest thing that I can think is that it's just not my business, but I involved myself inadvertently so here I am. That relationship is 100% down the drain but I'm just still so mad about all of this and just pissed off even more that nothings gonna change in their lives. My ex is usually very sweet but has just gotten so bitter with all of this understandably of course but I wish it didn't happen to her, let alone anyone at all. She's very upset that he's still around walking and wants to see this guy in prison for the rest of his life, as do I.

I'm just confused you all, thanks for reading and thanks for the help.",10Aug2020,1
1040,"I am recently separated and live with my mom and my children due to not only legal fees from lawyers but covid as well and limited income. My mom is passive/aggressive and plays favourites with my children. She will ignore one of my kids, give them silent treatment and pass dirty looks. Then, a day later, she will act nice and then lash out because my child won’t be nice to her. My child is confused and is starting to not like grandma. I am broken. I am so passive due to abusive relationship I can’t even speak up due to paralyzing fear.

Four months ago me and my friend of 9 years had a fight and i got really mad and told her that our friendship was over. I told her to never contact me or my family.

1043,"So, last year I had an amazing frined that was awesome we would talk every day and send memes all the time and yanno do what teenagers do. I havent had many friends and what we had was different and I really liked it. 

We started drifting off during the summer and before quarantine we started talking again and then it happened again, we just drifted off. It was mainly coz niether of us talked much coz I didnt know what to say or do sometimes and I get carried away with school work. Maybe she dosent like me anymore.

I messaged her again to say hi and how she was. She ghosted me (well only slightly she was in insta which was where I sent it several times after I sent it but never read it so she most likely knows it is there). What have I done? I don't understand girls maybe its super obvious. I just need to get it off my chest. Anyone who has a clue or anything please tell me. 

The first time we drifted off was after I got a girlfriend. I don't think this was y but could be coz she did want us together but maybe that was just to be nice idk tbh. I maybe thinking too much.

1045,"I know this isn't nearly as serious or important as a lot of the posts in this sub reddit, but this has been really getting to me lately.

I'm very quiet around people that I don't know, I have a lot of anxiety, self confidence and esteem issues (which I have medication for).  Really not trying to big myself up in anyway, but people say I'm good looking, and I make a lot of friends whenever I'm in intoxicated on whatever. It's been really getting to me lately, because when I am intoxicated, and just chatting away to people, I get invited to a lot of nights out, make loads of friends, chat up girls successfully, get loads of numbers, get asked to meet them etc. which I never go through with when I'm sober; but when I'm not intoxicated, I just feel an overwhelming amount of self doubt, anxiety overall lack of self esteem. I've had people tell me I'm really quiet or reserved usually, but when I'm drunk or intoxicated, I'm so chatty and a load of fun. It makes my mind automatically look towards taking something or drinking a little just to ease myself up a bit and take the edge off (which I've avoided since I know it's a slippery slope). 

What I'm really asking is, how can I make myself more confident, how can I raise my self esteem and just ease up? It really sucks being told you're a lot of fun when you're drunk, and having a lot more social acceptance when you are .",10Aug2020,1

1048,"I kind of always felt like I had an idea of what I was doing: following the proscribed motions, going to school getting a job, getting engaged. Things were good, not perfect, but good.  


Then two things happened. **I developed and got diagnosed with narcolepsy, and my fiance walked out on me** without explanation one day while I was at work. There are other second order effects, like the 80 lb weight gain (30 lbs lost of it since though!), the sudden inability to ethically drive a car, and the inability to continue my schooling because I fall asleep, but they all follow from the narcolepsy.   


The predominant effect was to shatter my confidence and my self esteem. I no longer felt like a person with a plan and a life and goals. I became like a man who is treading water, desperate to keep his nose above the waterline. Sure, he probably has dreams and desires and wants during better times, but right now, literally **all he wants is the suffering to stop**.   


And so I've been stagnating for two years, treading water, begging doctors to help me, asking literally every human I come across for advice. *I admit* I've been making excuses and playing the victim. *Woe is me! I didn't* ***ask*** *to be narcoleptic! No one* ***understands****!* I didn't realize until just recently that **just because it's not my fault,** ***doesn't mean*** **its not my responsibility**.   


So I realize now that it's my job to put one foot in front of the other, that only I can make this better, even if it's not my fault. And I'm ready to work to make my life better but...  


I don't know what I want. I've spent my entire life subsuming my will to others, just trying to survive. I'm willing to do the work, I \*\*want\*\* to do the work but...how do I know in which direction to plant my first step if I don't even know where I want to go?  


**Like the drowning man, I'm still unable to think of anything I want other than to stop suffering in this moment.**  


I've been working on it, trying to write out what I don't like about my life, what I could change. But it's not enough to figure out my next move. It goes something like:  
""I want to move out of my parents house again""  
okay, so how do I do that?  
get money.  
okay so how do I do that?  
get a job.  
okay so how do I do that?  
stop being narcoleptic

1049,"We had a big argument over something so stupid that I wish I never did about 2 weeks ago, I arranged an apology and explanation for everything i did.

I checked in with my friends to see if this was solid because they know what happened too and they said it was perfect.

Listen I really care about her she’s very important to me and I don’t wanna lose her over some stupid drama, she misunderstood some things and felt like everyone hates her because of me but that isn’t true, it’s not my fault I never went to other people and talked trash about her I always tell her I defended her and say nice things about her but she always second guesses it.


We talked a little bit after we broke our friendship up cause she knows I was depressed severely or something I don’t know why she would still answer me but I’m glad she does. 

About 4 days ago I finished my apology and I tried asking to ft her and she always told me no cause she was busy or she just couldn’t. I asked her this question at around 9 o’clock and one time I think I asked her in like the morning or something and she said she couldn’t. she wasn’t lying to me and I think she’s starting to go to bed early now, she’s not active on Instagram past 9 pm and I can see cause she’s in my insta dms. I don’t know why this makes me so hesitant and nervous, I constantly overthink the worse that can happen and she just will decline which makes me not even want to call her.

I’m thinking about asking her to ft at like 7 or 8, I don’t know how I should grab her attention I wanna say something that’ll give me a chance to speak to her, I really wanna redeem myself. I wish I could just do it, and not hesitate, I don’t know how though.

1052,"Hello, /advice. I'm a long time lurker, first time poster.

For some background, I'm female, 25yo, lesbian and I've been in a great relationship with an amazing woman for, what, 10 years now? We met in high school. 

I'm very okay with who I am. I love myself, I love my girl and I love my friends and family (and I'm loved back!)

Last year I moved across the country for my medical residency (I'm a physician) and for the first time in my life, I guess, I'm face to face with some not-so-nice homophobic behavior. In my hometown I surrounded myself with such an awesome environment that it never really got to me.

In surgery life hierarchy is a big thing. And some of my superiors happen to be very religious bigots. And I'm here, alone, away from my whole support system.
I'm deep in fear, I came back to the closet, I started lying and deflecting questions when asked about my personal life. I'm afraid go be treated different because I'm gay, and it hurts that I can't participate in things that are So normal for everyone else, like going to a party and bringing your companion.

This is making me a loner. When I start meeting something that might be a nice friend, I immediately push the person away at the slightest hint of interest in my personal life.
Today this colleague, who is very nice to me, said we should grab something to eat after work sometime. And I was happy, since I don't have any friends, but I KNOW they are going to ask something like ""are you dating anyone? How's your love life?"" And I'll have to chose between lying or exposing myself

I feel that surgery is already too fucking hard, and being gay makes me start behind... So I'll be ""that girl who's gay, BUT she's a nice doctor"" or ""she's good operating, despite being a dyke""

I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for... Maybe how to care less? 

I'd like to marry my girlfriend, you see. We are kinda engaged. But I'm so bothered by all this that I'm afraid that I'll somehow be harmed if I lose the ""benefit"" of lying about my love life

1054,"My ex girlfriend (18f) and I (18m) dated for nine months, minus a day. Throughout these nine months, she did a lot to hurt me, including:

Giving me panic attacks by accidentally triggering my PTSD
Not accepting when I needed more space 
Telling me our sex was so bad she'd be ok never doing it again 
Telling me she'd fallen out of love and a week later saying she didn't mean it and she was just anxious and confused
Blaming me for sleeptalking when I couldn't control it
Telling me to not spend time with a good female friend of mine because she got jealous

And a whole host of other things. In spite of all of this I still loved her a ton. I'd made a lot of mistakes and I gave her the benefit of the doubt and forgave her for everything. But a week or so ago she did something that I just couldn't emotionally recover from so I told her we should break up so I can focus on my mental health and get back to normal before we pick things up, if we decide we want to.

This friend had previously sexually assaulted her after getting drunk and my ex said that she wasn't comfortable around her, but this morning she posted that she spent the night there because she was ""mad at someone, and rightfully so!""

Among other pictures from that night, she posted a video of her holding a handmade gift I had for her, doing something that triggers my PTSD which she said she'd never do.

1060,"So, just to set this up for easy explaining, there are three of us in a throuple together: Lexi, myself, and the partner in topic, Karen.

K is 25, and idk what to say other than that i think she's losing her mind. L and I went on a vacation for a week and during that time we were gone everything kinda changed. Every day since we've been back its like non stop things that are wrong and have changed about her. We get back and she claims that she hit her head really hard while we were gone and ever since then she can remember everything that has happened since she was about 4 years old. She decided she was going to start a youtube career and has gone out and purchased multi thousands of dollars worth of equipment for it on credit cards. Then she came to us crying one day cause she realized she has adhd, too. (L also has adhd that she struggles with on occasion and is on adderall for.) In the next couple days it was that she's OCD. Now, shes saying shes starting to go deaf, but then always complains that everything is too loud, and that she is colorblind/blind, but everything is too bright for her. She has this green pair of sunglasses she almost always wears because the tint ""helps her see better"" but at the same time she's broken down and cried because ""everything being green is overwhelming""

She backs all of this behind ""not letting anxiety rule her life anymore"" but says she's always anxious. She says stuff like shes ""only going to do stuff she wants now and not do stuff because her anxiety""... but she went to the store and didn't put groceries away for three days due to ""not wanting to due it because her anxiety is telling her to"" so needless to say everything that was perishable had spoiled by the time we had gotten to it. It is really hard because some of the stuff she says she has the right concept but she's doing it all wrong in application and I just dont know how to make her see it. 

To L and I, this just seems like a giant beg for attention, but every time we try to give advice or try to help her in a way that doesn't follow her narrative we just get shutdown by her telling us ""that's just your anxiety speaking"" or ""you're being destructive and triggering my anxiety."" She's been caught up in lies with us in the past and anytime anyone suggests she's a liar she gets really upset.

K is in therapy, but she avoids the real problems and lies to the therapist. K's always misinterpreting whatever he says so that it fits into her own narrative and then holds it over L and I who also have our own depression and mental issues and acts very holier than thou as if she doesn't have the same issues.

TL;DR
Can you give us any r/advice? We really want to help her get on the right path, but we are completely lost on what to do. She's always been kinda controlling, attention needy, and kinda hyperbolic, but ever since she hit her head things have gotten 10x worse and it's become toxic. Her parents have suggested we take her to a mental hospital but we want that as a last resort. Therapy and talking to her hasn't really worked out too well and we are running out of options.",10Aug2020,1

1062,"Hello everyone, I recently discovered my sister was trans after picking up on many things she was doing to hint at the idea. I am gay myself and 17 years old, but she is only 12. She told me about it, but for some reason I cannot bring myself to believe it. I feel like she is too young to make such a monumental decision about her gender, as I know I was still pretty clueless at her age about things like these. She hasn’t come out to anyone, and I feel like I cannot imagine her wanting to transition as she has always had such a distaste for boyish things. How can I accept this if she still goes by her female pronouns to everyone else and I still have to call her them? I obviously want to support her, but I still feel she is too young to know. What do I do?

1063,"I just learned that I’m starting band camp (social distanced) next week. I’m really nervous. Marching band was not that fun last year. The coach was horribly mean, and I felt a constant anxiousness whenever he would coach, which made me mess up a lot. And the visual director isn’t super fond of me either. I’m not blaming them for me being bad at color guard, because that’s on me and that’s my responsibility. 

But because of personal reasons, I had to quit winter guard. So now I’m nervous that they’re going to use me quitting, against me. 

But if I quit this year, I’m worried they’ll talk bad about me to the team and everyone will hate me, and I also just really don’t want to quit on my team. They’re the reason I joined 


I also have issues with one of the girls on the team. We were friends in middle school but she treated me horribly so I’m trying to avoid her. But she’s in color guard too and wants to be friends with me again. I don’t want to be friends with her, but I know if I don’t talk to her, it could paint a pretty messy picture. Because she’s
pretty dramatic.  

It’s a whole mess and I have no clue why I joined again. 

Any advice?",10Aug2020,1

I distribute coke, heroin and valium mostly, I also have ties to a legitimate car wash. In recent times due to several violent altercations, competitive rivalry and minor set backs my business is not what it used to be. 2020 has been an expensive year and people vastly over estimate my wealth.

Some guy named Mike messaged me this long message saying he wanted to be my sugar daddy and pay me 250 for each skype call. (yes I know that should’ve been a red flag cause it’s too good to be true) but I was just being an idiot and decided to go along with it I gave him my Skype and we started talking he said we could talk on video about the arrangement of a schedule and all this. I gave him my cashapp. We got on the video call I asked if I could have the money first he said he would pay me after and I honestly was just super nervous and made a huge mistake not receiving the money first. I did the skype show it lasted 10 minutes he hung up and said good job i’ll send you the money and I waited like 5 min and he blocked me on skype and deleted his Seeking Arrangements profile. I should NOT have trusted this person and I made a huge fucking mistake doing this I know but I need advice on what I should do next. I’ve been looking online to see if anyone has come across this scam before and I’ve found nothing besides people getting blackmailed. And he wanted my face in it too which didn’t alarm me until after. So I’m freaking out because I think I’m actually fucked and this person is going to try and blackmail me or something? He could’ve recorded the call and I’m so scared he’s either going to post it somewhere or try and blackmail me for money. He knows nothing about me besides my first name though.

1070,"We just recently celebrated his 30th birthday and I am kinda worried about my brother. He lives under us in my grandmas old apartment. 

The last time I was inside his place was 4-5 years ago. And already then his place was a mess. Big trashbags full of empty redbull cans, hundreds cigarette stubs lying in paper boxes of random products and sticky carpet.

Since then, we never were allowed inside his apartment again. He does not directly say no but when he opens the door to us, he covers the inside of his place as best as his body can. The conversation are short and fast. 

And he never opens the blinds, so no one can see into his place. Years ago when he moved in, he would open them and feed our dogs which would come up to his window and beg him for treats. No more. 

Two weeks ago my family and I wanted to brunch and I got down to ask him, if he wanted to join us. Right next to his door is the window of his kitchen and I was appalled. Emtpy stacks of plastic food wraps and dirty dishes with black stuff (maybe mold) on it? I could not tell what the rest was because his apartment is always in the dark. I can't imagine how the rest of his apartment looks like. 

I talked to my mother and she is also worried. She does not know how to talk to him about this. 

I am not sure on how to help him. I see him rarely and only talk to him about games we play together or new consoles coming out.

I am a little scared about confronting him, because I get the feeling he will definitily laugh it off or tell me, I should not bother.

I am playing with the thought of checking his apartment while he is away so I can see the state of the place and his situation, but thats feels wrong. I just don't know what to do. I just don't wanna see my brother dying in that trashhole he made of my grandmas old apartment.

1073,"I'm trying to move on from this high school drama as I am going into college and trying to find friends that I have more in common with. In this situation, I don't really have any problems with the rest of the girls but we have one girl in the group that I just can't stand anymore and she's really toxic and inconsiderate of my feelings. We're all 18 and 19 so this stupid drama is just not for me anymore. I have another friend group online who I've known since middle school and I enjoy talking to them way more than these girls. I don't have anything in common with them and I feel like I'm always just laughing along with their jokes until I can go home. This one toxic girl makes rude jokes and randomly apologizes when she feels bad I guess but then continues to make rude jokes. She always wants to copy my work and needs help with every little thing she does like homework or even registering for classes (which she could get help from her advisor or her parents like the rest of us did). Every time I say I don't want to hang out because I'm feeling bad or I have plans she makes me feel really guilty. She always sends loooong paragraphs over small issues. She's overdramatic and just plain toxic.  


A little over a week ago, one girl left the group because she didn't like this girl either. She had a lot of reasons like her being dramatic and controlling (which is true), not cleaning up water she spilt (on purpose) at her house, offering her house to hang out at without asking, her not getting her a secret santa present because she couldn't afford it yet even though she eats out constantly, etc etc. When she left they were all really confused and then were like good riddance and the toxic girl said she didn't like the way she treated the group anyways (even though they're both equally toxic). I have different reasons to not like her of course and this girl had a  better opportunity to leave because she's going out of state for college. I'm still going to the same college as this toxic girl and have two classes with her and another girl in our group. I feel like if I leave, I'll be put in awkward situations in those classes and if we happen to have mutual friends later on. I am also very introverted, have social anxiety, and I hate confrontation. However, I am getting to the point where hanging out with them just makes my anxiety worse. I think I'm ready to leave but I'm not sure how. I can't ghost them without blocking them on all social media as well as their numbers and even then, I'll see two of them in college. What do I do?

We had an amazing time. He reiterated how much fun he had like 3-4 times to me. He ended up spending the night but nothing too intimate happened. He’s male (22) 

We woke up in the morning, he wanted to to get coffee and we ended up walking around for another 3ish hours. 

When we parted he told me he’d hit me up and let me know what the rest of the summer looked like for him. 

When i got home i texted him just to let him know i really enjoyed our time. He texted me that he had a lot of fun too, but he felt like shit. Not realizing at the time he was talking about his hangover and upset stomach i asked “why?” 

He never responded to that message, nearly 5 days ago. Today i messaged him that he left something at my place and he hasn’t responded to that either. 

I feel stupid, dumb worthless ugly etc etc. I haven’t really felt this confident about someone in a long while and i feel like i did something to fuck it up.

1076,"Sorry, long post. Tl;dr at the end.

I’ve always been prone to bits of depression and anxiety, but they used to be mild and manageable. But now I have daily suicidal thoughts,no motivation, no interest left for my goals, I feel trapped and like I have too many problems to sort them out alone, which is why I’m reaching out for advice today. 


Two years ago, I decided to start a new chapter in my life by moving to a foreign country ( UK ) as I got a decent job opportunity there. 

Ultimately, I’m not a fan of the job. I like the work but I don’t like the work environment nor the city I live in. 
While the pay is less than average for the title, it’s a liveable wage and good benefits ( half from home half from office) , so I stay around. 

I’ve been applying to other jobs for a couple months though, no luck. My goal would be to go back to my home country, I feel like doing that could solve a lot of my problems but I can’t do that without a job.  
To be honest, I could just move back to my parents’ but I feel like it’s irresponsible in the current climate as I don’t know when I’ll be able to find another job. 

Also, I’ve been dating my gf for a year and a half and we’ve been living together for 6 months. I still have affection for her and I still love her but I know she’s not right for me. I’m not happy with her.

I’ve told her multiple times I wanted to end the relationship but she always makes deals with me, that she’s going to change. Kinda manipulates me into staying. Kinda doesn’t want to face the fact that this is over. I’ve been telling her I want out for months.

It’s hard living with her. I get very little alone time and our flat is small. I told her I didn’t want to live with her anymore, she made pleas and bargains with me. I tried being firm, she ignores me. I’m just so tired that I don’t fight. Well we do fight a lot actually but nothing makes her leave, she could move back to her parents but I know her relationship with them is not that great and that’s why she wants to stay no matter what. I feel like I can’t be myself around her I’m always anxious, snappy and on edge. 

I told her that she needed to leave for the sake of my mental health. She told me it’s either I’m depressed ( if she’s living with me ) or she’s depressed ( if she’s going back to her parents’ ). I told her I choose myself to which she said I’m an egoist and that’s it, end of the convo. 

There’s this other girl in my home country that I like a lot. As a friend. We’ve known each other for years, from before I spiraled and became so empty. I used to have a crush on her but now, I don’t want any relationship again. I feel like I can be myself around her through, it’s like breathing again for a bit. My gf caught up to that and I told her the truth, that she’s just a friend but she hates this girl which makes the atmosphere in our flat absolutely shit.

Tl;dr :  I’ve become morbidly depressed trapped in a foreign country I can’t leave because my job is there, in a relationship I don’t want anymore, living with somebody I don’t want to live with anymore, who won’t leave.
And my brain cannot figure out a solution anymore.

What should I do ? I can’t keep on living like this.",10Aug2020,1

1084,"Hello, I'm a seventeen-year-old high school student going into her senior year. I need advice and help desperately. So, I have always been at odds with my family, it's never been a good or healthy relationship with my parents or even my sibling at times, and as I get older the worse it gets. My father and I have just gotten into a fight with absolutely no encouragement to an argument. And I really try to avoid him when I can so our paths cross as little as possible. This one just pushed me further away from them and I only talk to a few people about this but everyone says that I need to move out as soon as I'm able. Which is where I need advice for, I want to be (somewhat) stable and independent financially from them as soon as I can, I've worked since I was fourteen and now I have two jobs and save everything I can but what job can I get while leaving high school that will help me to be independent from them? I like coding and general tech courses and was experimenting with the idea of going to coding Bootcamp once I graduate and hopefully looking for a job right away. Those jobs on average seem to pay well even when you're just entering the field and you can build you're way up as you work for companies or in the field for longer. I like the idea that I won't have to go to college right away (I also like the idea that once I hopefully land a job in the tech industry I can save some money and possibly go back to school at any time!) and won't have to live at home for another four years while going to a local college or go to college and move into a dorm but rack up thousands of dollars worth of debt. Would anyone recommend that path for my situation? Is there another career where there is a higher paying salary with little schooling? I'm interested in more or creative fields as well and I like the idea of having every day be different and not exactly the same. I also like the idea of being more active, the one thing I don't like about coding is that you seem to sit all day long, which I mean is what you sign up for. I know that this is the best-case scenario I.E. going to coding Bootcamp right out of high school and then getting your first job in the field right away and that most of the time it doesn't work like that but I'm really trying my best and that's why I need advice or maybe insight on another path I could try.

1086,"Two years ago I had to stop doing gymnastics, something I had been doing for over ten years and I always loved. Because I wanted to stay active and still have a hobby, I decided to start dancing. 
I was still very upset with fact I had to stop gymnastics, so I thought dancing would give me something new to focus on, and help me get over this. (I might have to add that I got bad self esteem and confidence issues after this, because of the way this ended. It really felt like a break up or something for me.) 

Now, two years later, I find myself having to sign up for my classes upcoming year. The problem is, I don't know if I want to.

In the first few months of my first year of dancing everything was fine, however after that I started noticing I got stressed out. I was nervous about going to classes, the days leading up to competitions were dreadfull and I wanted nothing but them to be over. This got even worse in my second year. I was stressed all the time, couldn't think about anything else than classes, competitions, routines... I take a combination of competitive and recreative classes and even the recreative ones give me the same feelings.

Now I need to sign up but I'm afraid that if I don't I'll be dissapointmy parents, my coach and my teammates. This will really come out of the blue for them and gymnastics and dancing is all I've ever done so I don't know what to do. Even though there were fun moments as well, I feel like if I stop dancing, the stress will stop and I'll have more time for school (because even though Its just 7-8 hours a week, combining those were stressfull as well.) Besides that I wouldn't know what to do to stay active. (I'm currently going into my last year of high school.)

I do stilllive dancing I really do.
I don't really feel that I have someone to talk to about this so I'm asking you guys for advice. I also don't know if I'm just overreacting and being dramatic or not and I really don't know what to do.

1089,"i’m 19f and i’m really struggling rn. i’ve been told my entire life that i’m way too skinny. i went to inpatient treatment for depression/suicidal two times when i was younger and they diagnosed me with anorexia while i was in there because my food intake was so low. i’ve always seen it more as a symptom of my depression though. i don’t count calories, i don’t really care about what i eat, i don’t exercise obsessively, and i’m not preoccupied with the thought of losing weight. 

i just can’t fucking eat. i don’t know what in the past few weeks shifted but right now it’s really bad, worse than it has been in a while. i’m never hungry so i don’t eat. i’ll eat maybe one meal a day, along with some coffee. i don’t even drink water because i’m consistently forgetting or just not thirsty. my body feels slow and weak and achy. my brain isn’t even working correctly, i feel incredibly dissociated and foggy. i can’t focus on anything, everything takes longer to understand. i’m constantly on the verge of crying and the thought “i’m dying” is constantly playing over and over in my mind.

despite not really being preoccupied with food mentally, it’s still extremely difficult to eat. it’s excruciating to try to force myself to get any food whatsoever, even getting water is a serious challenge. and as soon as i eat anything, just a few bites, i feel exhausted. like i could literally fall asleep instantly and my stomach feels uncomfortably full. 

i’ve told one person the extent to all of this and he was very insistent that i go seek help. i don’t even know how to get help for this though. i don’t know if it’s more mental or physical, and i don’t know what kind of help would be most beneficial. things right now are certainly much worse than they’ve been in recent history, but this is very much a consistent issue. and no advice that i’ve been given has really been able to help. if you have any input on where to seek help, or any similar experiences, that would really really help.",10Aug2020,1

I went to the same small private school for 9 years (from elementary school to junior high school) interacting with the same 30 people (the kids on my grade) all that time, I also didn't have a social media account until I was 15 yo. Needless to say I ended up with very poor social skills. 

When I graduated from junior high school, I entered a public school for the first time in my life. It went horrible at first, I had to interact and try to bond with 50-60 new people every 6 months and I sucked at it. About 2 months in, I still hadn't done any friends, when suddendly this random guy starts talking to me (let's call him John). John was one of the most outgoing guys in the class, he was friendly with everyone and could make conversation even with someone as reserved as I was. Fast forward two weeks later and we were a couple. I know, it was fast, but at this point of my life I had never had any kind of romantic relantionship and wan't used to being the target of male attention, so when he asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend I said yes without thinking twice. 

Not even a week into the relationship, John started making sexual advances. I didn't realized some of the things he said or did were sexual until other people told me about it (how he used to hug me from behind and put his arms together to feel my breasts is one example, that kind of thing). That used to make me really uncomfortable, so I usually changed topics or move away. 

At this point I had already made a facebook account because he asked me to (we couldn't talk by whatsapp because I didn't have a cellphone at that time, I had to borrow the laptop from my older brother) and we used to chat daily. One night John asked me to send a picture of me, I don't like being photographed thus I didn't have any, so he asked me to take one and I ended up taking a normal photo smiling. He did this several times after that. 

You can already imagine what happened later, one day he asked for a nude and I did just that, I sent him a photo of me in my underwear. No, my face couldn't be seen in the picture, unfortunately that doesn't mean anything, as he already had photos of me on that same room. I also live in a country where most people are brown skinned, however I'm pale and blonde. I've met a few other blondes here but not a single one with curly blond hair as I have, my hair was visible in the picture and it's very distinguishable. 

We ended up breaking up about a month later, I got over him fairly quickly, but he didn't. Over the past few years he has reached out to me several times trying to continue with out past relationship. I always rejected him. Yesterday he reached out to me again and tried to make small talk, I answered him a couple times in case he needed something, when I realized he didn't I just stopped answering and went for something to eat. When I came back I had 15+ messages from him. To summarize, he went on a rant about how tired he was that I would never answer him and that he only wanted one more chance. The part that scared me the most and the reason why I'm writing this, is that he mentioned how bold I was to ignore him when he still has that picture of me. 

I don't know what should I do, is there anything I can really do in this situation? I was just a naive 15 yo who did something stupid without thinking, I totally didn't think it would ended up having consequences. Is what he is doing illegal? Does that count as a threat? I don't know anything about that kind of stuff, I'd really appreciatte if you could help me understand it. Thanks in advance :c

TL;DR When I was 15yo, I sent a nude to my then boyfriend. Yesterday he reached out to me and implied that he still has that picture and may used it against me.",10Aug2020,1

1094,"We’ve been in the ER for about 5 hours now. Since we’ve moved out of triage and into the actual ER room no one has really spoken to us. Getting up to go to the bathroom and passing the PA who spoke to us in triage she mentioned the ultra sound was normal. A transporter just came into the room without saying who she was and she was taking my boyfriend to get a CT scan. I asked her if she could get someone to talk to us since we have no idea why he is getting that. She finds a nurse who comes in visibly annoyed. The transporter tells her we have questions she can’t answer. The nurse is so dismissive and rude to us it was shocking. We asked why are we getting a CT scan and she explains quickly to show a different view than the ultrasound and if you don’t want it I’ll go tell the doctor you don’t want it. I was so shocked my boyfriend is like no no I want it if that’s what’s needed we just had no idea what was going on. She spins around and leaves and that’s that.

I am shocked and disgusted. If we were some shy timid people we might of been like oh okay and not gotten the CT scan. I think it’s horrible to go somewhere because you need care and to be spoken to like that. Im just hoping she isn’t our actual nurse because I am over my shock and will not accept that behavior....

1095,"I’m so, so tired of everything. Nothing I do is right, I’m always messing up and don’t know why, I’m trying to live up to the expectations of me and be good to others but it’s leaving me tired and i seem to make others hate me anyways. 

I guess, to go on psychological and shit, it’s a pattern I developed from my mother when I was growing up. She was so critical, angry and always thought I wasn’t doing anything right or that I was good enough. I guess I’m acting out the pattern onto others as well, if someone didn’t like something I did I would adjust and fit into what they wanted.. and I’m so tired of it

1099,"I have completely no friends at all and I need real life friends urgently because I'm a social animal as a human being.

The only way that I know to get to know new people nearby quickly is trough dating apps. But I've been using it for a whole year last year and it didn't work well for me, guys there mostly just want sex and I hate ending up on bed with them and never get in contact later again like a year ago.
I have social anxiety and I'm really not socially skilled. I don't know how to start a conversation and I don't know how to keep it. So there's no way for me to go to a bar and start talking with a group of strangers and besides with the covid situation it's not wise to do so.


So should I try to use dating apps again? Or what else can I do?? One friend who can understand me is enough for me.



And a important reason for which I find it hard to find like minded people is that I'm a deep thinker and a idealist, so I can get very picky on selecting friends so if I find a person shallow in some aspects I would consciously or unconsciously refuse him.

But now I really don't expect to find the right person, I just want to know how to get to know new people in an efficient way.",10Aug2020,1
1100,"So my girlfriend has just gone back to work. She’s a bartender. But since the pandemic, all the usual bartenders have left. She’s been talking about this handsome guy who’s trying to work there for weeks now. He’s a bartender himself. She’s been gushing over the fact that he might work there, talking to me like a giddy school girl about it, talking to her friends about it, etc...   

So the other day, I notice some texts on her phone while I’m doing something else on there. We have full access to each other’s phones, no big deal. But I look, and there’s like a hundred messages between them, they started on Facebook messenger, and moved to texting. I feel really weird about this. He’s not being creepy, but she kind of is. Saying that she LOVED working with him, trying to get him extra shifts, asking if people she currently works with can be moved to different nights so she can work with him. She’s already admitted that she thinks he’s very handsome and she quite obviously likes him very much.   

I confronted her and she thinks that hundreds of texts to this guy, before they even worked together, is completely okay, and says she’s only talking about work. But he’s a bartender too, so I don’t get how this kind of extended conversation makes any sense. He already knows what’s up and what he doesn’t, he’ll learn. I didn’t look too deep, not trying to pry, but it made me feel like this is going to be an issue.   

I told her if some random person put in an application and started working there, she wouldn’t be exchanging all these texts and sending these after work, “that was so amazing” type messages. She skirts that fact, but I think she knows and doesn’t want to give any leeway that she might be in the wrong. When I ask how she’s feel if I did that, she doesn’t answer, just saying it’s harmless.   



Now this is a married man. I’m not concerned about him. I don’t think he has eyes for her. But she is acting very distant to me, and has been pushing their conversation for I suppose weeks, overly enthusiastic, after telling me about how great this man is. He doesn’t seem too interested, but she is obviously keeping the conversation going.   

Am I wrong to feel a certain way about this? She’s admitted he’s handsome, admitted he’s an “amazing guy”, and has sent 100 or so messages back and forth when she isn’t his boss, doesn’t pay him, and doesn’t make his schedule. He’s been a bartender longer than her, so there’s really no information I think she needs to pass off, and certainly not hundreds of messages worth. She has a crush, and I’m okay with that, but the way she’s pushing and going about it, is a little concerning to me. Am I right to feel a certain way about this? She would absolutely not allow me to do this exact thing if the shoe was on the other foot.    


Am I being an asshole for telling her that it’s not okay to gush over another man and send hundreds of texts messages, even if most are about work (she just wants to conversation with him)? Is it weird for her to say after one night she “loved working with him”, when she would never and has never said that to anyone else who’s worked there? If I said that to my new employees who are male, I feel like it’d be weird.   

Should I end this now, or what? I have a very particular feeling I know where this is going to go. I’ve had that feeling before and it’s always been correct.   

Is it normal to be distant to your boyfriend or years so you can text a married man you have a fairly obvious crush, that you’ve admitted is very handsome and very cool, etc... hundreds of times? To try and get other people’s shifts changed so you can have more time w this person? Am I crazy to feel like this isn’t okay?",10Aug2020,1

About a fortnight ago I went away for the weekend with my partner and we took his car, my car was left in our double carport (we are the second unit from the street). When we got back, I realised my rear windscreen wiper was missing. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until a few days into the week, so I was unsure of when it could have happened, over the weekend, while I was parked at the shops the day before or in car park at my work. I thought it was strange, like what a weird thing to steal, but I bought a new one (only $30 AUD) and forgot about it thinking it wasn't a big deal. But then this weekend just gone we went away again, and again we took my partners car and left mine in the carport. And guess what, my 2 front windscreen wipers are missing! What the hell, why is someone doing this, and what’s next are they going to loosen one of my wheels or cut my brakes, like what would have happened if I hadn’t noticed they were gone until I was driving and it started raining, that’s like super dangerous. Now I am 100% sure it happened over the weekend while we were away, I just don’t understand why someone is doing this to me/my car. I am so pissed off and a little scared what might happen next.

I’m at a loss as to what to do, should I even do anything, would it even be worth it. I am replacing them after work tonight.",10Aug2020,1
1104,"Hi, sorry for this post and I understand a lot of people will be bothered. I work at a fast food place and mainly just put receipts on the bag but because the store is really tiny, I’m stuck standing by the hot ovens all day, it doesn’t help that we have no air conditioning either. Usually I have no complaints but time to time it gets really hard to breathe with the cloth mask because of all the heat and normally I keep my mask properly worn but it does slide down my nose slightly time to time.

Some guy walked in not wearing a mask decided to take a picture of me (16) and my coworker, I was wearing my mask but it fell down my nose. 

I feel quite bothered by the review mainly because a stranger took a photo of me without my consent and put it up on our fast food place reviews

Is there anyway to get rid of it? Or what to do? I couldn’t believe that he wore no mask at all, but took a photo of me and complained his whole google account is just him angrily giving 1 stars most of the time to people :/",10Aug2020,1

Hello! 20F here.

My old best friend and I cut each other off around January.

She (19F) and her boyfriend (20M) ended their relationship around March (so around 5-6 months of dating). They had a looot of problems. And I heard she's been on dating apps and I think recently she may have found someone, not sure.

But anyways, today her mom came to my house while I was at work. Talked to my mom saying she needed help so my mom gave her my phone number. I called her after I got home.

Her mom wanted the ex-boyfriend's phone number because her daughter is in the hospital. I'm assuming she attempted suicide yesterday. But this is after around 4-5 months after they broke up, and cut each other off (I heard they do not talk anymore from mutual friends).

So, I don't have his number but I have friends who do. What is the best choice here? I'm not involved, but I don't know if it's okay for her mother to call the ex after they split ways. My old best friend is really toxic and he is emotionally sensitive (he is also depressed).

Should I give the phone number or not be the middle man?

Anyway, a lot of the guys treat me weird in this group and I'm not super close with any of the girls. Sometimes a few of them (99.9% just the guys) will gang up on me and say rude shit for no reason. One of them instigates all the time against me, which is a huge reason I want to leave as well.

Is it time to move on or is this just like...what online friends do? My other friends don't treat me like this, though this is the only ""group"" setting I'm in. Unsure what to do or if I just need to not be a pussy. I like to have fun in my conversations and I feel like the guys in this group take shit way too serious...especially if I say something they don't like or disagree with (or have their own issues with me for literally whatever reason.)

I am very upset as I recently lost my financial aid for college. Ever since I was younger I’ve been interested in science related jobs, first being a pediatrician then a veterinarian. Making my way through middle school and high school I knew this would be a joke because I am absolutely not good at science. When I started college I avoided science classes at first because I knew I would not be good at them and just decided to do my general Ed in hopes I would figure out something else I wanted do with my life. I ended up finishing most of my general ads and I still had no idea what to do so I started taking science classes and I did not do well so I would withdraw from them. The semester after that I I tried those basic science classes again which was a stupid thing to do and I had to withdraw from them again because I wasn’t doing well. I got a letter that I wasn’t completing enough classes and so I was on probation. I then tried different classes trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my major and ended up having to drop one of my classes, this time precalc because I wasn’t doing well. I ended up losing my financial aid and now I can’t go back to college unless I find the funds to pay for it myself. 

I did well in sociology classes and psychology and English but I couldn’t picture myself doing any of those for a living. 

I always envisioned I would get a college degree in something, so this is very upsetting to imagine myself continuing to work at the job I hate (grocery store) for the rest of my life.
