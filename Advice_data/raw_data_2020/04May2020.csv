4,"In the summer of 2019, me and my aunt went on a trip to Greece through a touring agency called EF Tours. 

Some background of EF Tours if you guys don't know: EF Tours is a touring agency that you can enroll in through your school. You travel to many places abroad (I'm from the US). I've already been in a trip in the summer of 2018 to the cities of London, Paris, Florence, and Rome. Usually, 2-3 groups from different schools are in a single tour group. In the Greece trip it was my group (Virginia), Florida, and Michigan.

Now, this happened on Day 3 of the trip. We were eating dinner in Athens. If you didn't know, most of Greece (especially in urban areas like Athens) has a stray animal problem. You'll see plenty of dogs and cats roaming in the streets, and in some areas, people even let them enter buildings.

 Anyway, the whole group was eating dinner in the patio of a restaurant. A stray kitten found itself under the table and brushing against people's legs. I, as a joke, rolled up a napkin to mimic a cat's tail, and started brushing it against people's ankles. One person I did it too was a fat lying bitch from Michigan (let's call her Emily). I chuckled and I said ""It's the cat doing it"", and Emily was smiling and chuckling back. After that, we didn't talk to each other for the rest of dinner.

Keep in mind that I also did the napkin thing to my aunt and another guy in my VA group. I also want to point out that I am GAY and my teacher (we'll get to him in a sec) is well aware I am. He's also the super-liberal type (I'm not hating anyone).

The next morning, we drove out of Athens to visit the Temple of Poseidon. After being toured by a guide, we took a break to wander around and take pictures and such. Now my teacher (let's call him Mr. Bell) pulled me aside and told me that Emily went to him and told him I was touching UP her leg in a suggestive manner, and claiming I was saying ""Where's the kitty, where's the kitty"" (Possibly referring to her vagina). 

I was never accused of something disgusting like this before, so naturally I tried defending myself, but Mr Bell kept cutting me off, and telling me ""she is not interested, leave her alone"". Remember, he is well aware that I'm gay, so I told him I would never do anything suggestive to anyone, especially a girl. Yet he acted like he didn't believe that I'm gay, because he said again ""she is not interested"".

Now this happened less than a year ago at this point, and I know its dumb to be dwelling on the past, but it hurts, at least for a guy, to be accused of doing something so perverted. It messes you up mentally, emotionally, and socially. What I should've done was tell Mr Bell once we got to the hotel that day, but I was so shocked and confused that even I convinced myself that I was wrong. This wasn't a simple misunderstanding either, because Emily knew exactly what she was doing, and decided to twist something innocent into this mess.

So what should I do, Reddit? Should I just put everything on the table with Mr Bell and tell him how I feel? He is one of the most liked teachers in the school, so maybe in a calm environment, instead of a rushed fast-pasted area, he'll listen to me.",04May2020,1

7,"TL;DR Friend said they wanted to start an OnlyFans, I didn't say or come across how I intended. I messaged the next day asking if they wanted to play games or just catch up. No response in 5 days, as a friend I want to make sure they're okay, or just forget about the whole thing. **Do I message them, or just leave it and wait for them to message me?**  


  


I've been friends with this person for about 6 years now, we sometimes go weeks or a few months without talking. Over the last couple of months we've talked a little bit more until five days ago. Four days ago she sent me a message saying she was considering making an OnlyFans account.  


Pretty soon after, I responded saying that I thought she did something similar a while back, I asked what made her think of it and how long she's been thinking about starting one.  


Looking back I wish I had just asked: How long she had been thinking about it, and that the important thing is that if she enjoyed doing it, and protected herself from getting DOXed.(She has little to no social media presence so that's pretty much covered).   


I messaged her later the next day asking if she wanted to catch up and/or play some game, - changing the subject as she didn't respond to my message earlier but read it. So, I'm not sure if I should message her again or not. Does she want to just forget about it? Is she mad at me because of how I responded, or how I didn't respond. Or this has nothing to do with me and she just forgot.  


Thanks!",04May2020,1
8,"Hello! I am posting this because I was just playing soccer with my friend and I felt inferior because I am not as good as him. Now, I know I need to practice, but when we were playing, I felt I wasn't good enough. I know where these feelings stem. I had one childhood experience I can remember where I felt this way, and I was playing soccer (it is not just from soccer though, this just happened to be the memory I have.) I need help. This feeling has led me to give up easily and not be and do who I want to be and what I want to do in my life. How can I stop these feelings?",04May2020,1
10,"1. I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry.
2. I don't want this on any other form of social media, so, please respect my wishes regarding that.
3. I don't know which community to post this too, so I'm kinda just ended up here if there are any suggestions to post this elsewhere for better advice, plz let me know.


      General background information: I'm a young person and I have a boyfriend. I also come from a very very Christian family, but I don't believe in that myself, (which they don't know about.) Some of this information I feel is needed so that's why I mentioned it.


        Now on to the issue. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and we've been wanting to try out some new things for a while. So, again I come from a Christian family. So, a lot of this stuff just feels wrong. Like don't get me wrong, I want to do this stuff with my boyfriend, he under no circumstances is pressuring me to do this, he's actually told me if I feel uncomfortable in any way I can just tell him and we'll stop. But I just feel wrong for doing this,  I feel like I just failed as a productive member of society. I know this is supposed to be enjoyable for both of us and I want it so badly. But I feel as if I'm a terrible person for doing this. Here's the thing too, when I'm with this dude I feel so calm and free, I don't have to worry about anything because I have him here with me, so I know when the time comes I'll most likely be able to just let loose. But what about before we see each other?


           The big question: I know what I'm fixing to do isn't wrong, I just hate feeling this way when I know I shouldn't. I just need to know how can I calm myself down before this? How do I not feel like I'm a disgrace for humanity? Is it normal for me to feel this way?",04May2020,1

12,"I moved into a top floor unit at the start of March this year. One bedroom one bath, the only other person on this floor is a 70+ year old man, so I was told I had peace and quiet in my future. I lived with a psycho roommate before this and because of this was very excited about having such a quiet spot (very residential neighborhood and from the 4th floor there‚Äôs no noise from the streets). 

When I was visiting this unit, it was in the winter (January-February). I saw it twice, the first time on a mild winter day and the second time more chilly. The bedroom window is tall and opens to a concrete balcony which is perfect. When I visited, the previous tenant still had their furniture laid out, so I didn‚Äôt even see this feature until the day of the lease signing. I saw that it bordered the balcony to my right, but figured that there was enough space between my window and their balcony door that I shouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Landlord said that it was very nice and quiet here. Plus, none of my visits did I hear any noise from the neighbors or smell any smoke and the windows in the unit were open during both visits. 

Fast forward two months and I‚Äôm going crazy. With the stay at home order, I‚Äôm working every weekday my normal business hours (9:30-5:30), and my balcony bordering neighbors are awful. It‚Äôs a man and his (seemingly heavily) pregnant wife, but mostly it‚Äôs the man. He‚Äôs probably late fourties and speaks French 99% of the time , but English as well. 

I‚Äôd say if I‚Äôm awake 18 hours of the 24 hour day, he sits on the balcony, facing my window, smoking cigarettes, hash, whatever and having 7 hour long facetime calls, interrupted only by him going inside for coffee and coming back out and continuing the cycle for 16 of those hours. The constant sound of someone else‚Äôs loud conversation is driving me over the edge. 

Every time he starts to smoke, I immediately close my bedroom window because the smell is so strong. Full transparency, I‚Äôm an ex-smoker (maybe smoked 2 cigarettes a day if that) and stopped over a year ago because of how sensitive my lungs became. He is the definition of a chain smoker and he easily goes through a pack or maybe two a day. He‚Äôs both seen and heard me closing my window every time he starts to smoke. Side note, I‚Äôve caught him trying to peer around my blinds in my apartment (I‚Äôm a 22 year old girl who lives alone). I‚Äôve also caught him stealing maintenance gear from my balcony and disfiguring it so that if I were to report him it would be hard to tell what exactly he stole. So, in short, he makes me pretty uncomfortable. 

Over a month ago, I asked him if he could please tone down the volume on his loud and very, very, very long conversations. He barked a short ‚Äúsorry‚Äù, got quiet for one minute, then immediately resumed the talking like he had to reach an audience of 50 people. Window closed or not, I hear his conversation as if he‚Äôs in the same room as me. 

I told my landlord about the smoking and the noise, but he doesn‚Äôt own the building next door (I live in a brownstone), so there‚Äôs not much he can do in terms of policing my neighbors. 

Today my lungs were so irritated I leaned out and asked him to please move away from my building and face the other side of his balcony (where he doesn‚Äôt border anyone and it‚Äôs open air) instead while smoking. While sitting on his ass and making no motions to even attempt this, he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs the wind, nothing I can do‚Äù. While I start explaining to him how my lungs are weak, he plugs his earbud back in and continues his conversation like I wasn‚Äôt even talking. 

I write all this to say: am I being hyper sensitive or overly dramatic? I know that there is no such thing as a perfect neighbor. I live in NYC for god sake. But I also feel like I‚Äôve bent over backwards to accommodate him (I‚Äôve bought heavy curtains that are supposed to block/lessen the smell, Im running my electricity bill through the roof having all fans facing against my window, I‚Äôm hand washing laundry multiple times a week to get the smoke smell out of my sheets and pillowcases), and all I‚Äôve asked is that he make a slight effort to move away from my freaking window. Any advice on how to proceed? Im at my wits end and constantly wake up with a sore throat.",04May2020,1
13,"Not sure if relevant but am based in the UK.

As the title says, I am failing university, but... I'm failing again. I'm currently re doing my first year of uni a second time - after completing a foundation degree course. I took a leave of absence towards the end of last year due to mental health, and came back to attempt again this year (while also changing parts of my degree programme). So currently a combined 3 years of university study with nothing substantial to show for it. It's not simply a case of sticking with it and getting a lower class degree - it's the case of I don't have the knowledge / ability to actually continue and pass the coming exams (for clarification, I am doing an 'East Asia Studies w/ Korean Language' degree - and I cannot keep up with the language side of the course). Failing the course at this stage, it's financially not viable for me to continue / try again / switch to a different course as I won't be able to receive student loans (and cannot self fund).

100% I take full responsibility for my poor performance, and don't want to lean on excuses. There have been a lot of factors but generally I am constantly unmotivated and my reasons for attending university didn't exactly stem from any lifelong passions / interests - so I don't feel I'm losing out in that regard?

I used to work full time retail for a few years prior to starting university at 22, and for the past few months my mind has been shifting to just wanting to go back to work again, finding a job and earning money once again (after Corona of course...), however I feel I'm at a loss by wanting to get into any career paths without a degree.

In addition to that, I have never, at any stage of my life so far, had any idea or goals of what I would like to do with my life, job wise or not. I have interests/hobbies but none I could attribute to a job.

I know 24 is young, but I feel like I'm now 'behind' everyone else, and it's somewhat too late for me? Not to directly compare myself to their situations but all my friends of similar ages have either all completed university with a degree and are working through that, or managed to find jobs straight out of college and  have stayed in their respected paths.

I just feel so lost, empty, honestly terrified, but also I feel like I've been a failure.

15,"I‚Äôm a 19 year old female in Atlanta, Georgia and I‚Äôve never had the best dental hygiene.
Growing up, my parents didn‚Äôt stress it enough. I was so reluctant to brush, and my one of my earliest memories was brushing my teeth and my mouth gushing with blood. I was only 6 or 7.

24,"Hello. This is a really long story but I'm going to make it as short as possible while still giving all necessary context. I'm totally open to giving more information if needed. I just want some advice on what I should do now.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into university to study medicine at the start of 2018 (in my country the academic year starts in March, as opposed to other countries like the USA where I believe it starts in the middle of the year). There I met this guy, let's call him M, who basically had every class with me. We started to talk and get to know each other and we became really good friends. However throughout the year I realized that I kinda had some problems related to our friendship, mainly because I consider myself to be a really sensitive person and I understood that he was really different from me in that matter. That meant I would often overthink about the things he did or said, affecting the way I perceived our friendship. My main worry was that maybe I felt that he was very close to me while he didn't really feel as close, and since I didn't want to come off as too clingy, I sometimes felt like it would be better for me to distance myself from him. However I didn't because I really liked him as a friend and felt like he was a good person. He also went through tough times the second half of 2018 because he was going to fail a lot of classes and that (along with other stuff) made him kinda depressed, so I started to take more time to help him study and all that stuff. Even though he ended up failing most of those classes, he still said to me that he was really thankful because I was the only friend that helped him through that, letting him express his feelings, convincing him to go see a therapist, etc. I'd say that was one of the periods where we became really really close.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2019 we didn't have all classes together because he had to retake the ones he failed. However we still spent a lot of time together and shared every little thing with each other. There were lots of times where I started questioning the friendship again, though, because I sometimes felt like he would just change his attitude towards me, out of the blue, and that made me insecure and anxious. I talked to him about that stuff a couple of times and he usually just told me that he was sorry and move on. There were some moments where I felt like he really didn't act right (for example, in my birthday he would barely talk to anyone else, he took a really bad attitude, he would just stay alone, and that made me really uncomfortable, and there was some other stuff where I felt kinda ""betrayed"") but I just justified his actions and told myself that was alright.

&amp;#x200B;

There was this moment in the second half of 2019 where I told him I was really worried because I started seeing that he looked really stressed and I just didn't want to see him fail his classes again, and that I would do anything to help him through that. He told me not to worry, that he would be alright (he did pass all his classes so that was true), and he told me that he was really thankful that I was such a nice person to him, that I made him feel less alone, and that I was the best friend he'd ever made and the best person he'd ever met. That was such an important message to me, I really kept it in my mind, because I felt it really came from his heart. However the insecurities about our friendship that I mentioned before came back from time to time even after that, because he would just act really weird and I didn't like that at all. In December I told him that I was kinda mad at him because I felt like he didn't care at all about me. For example when he was seeing a therapist at some point I used to ask him how it was all going, but when I went to the therapist he just didn't care at all about that. And also there was a really important event in my life that my friends and family knew about, that would happen that month, but he barely knew because he didn't seem interested at all. I felt like I was giving in too much and that he just didn't seem to be interested in our friendship. He just told me that he was really sorry, but he was just used to be indifferent because he grew up with friends that treated him that way as well. He didn't tell me he would change, though, he just justified himself and I guess I fell for it, because he didn't change anyway. He also had bad attitudes with my group of friends from university (which he was not part of), and even my girlfriend (he sometimes ignored her or didn't talk at all when we three would meet, but I talked to him about it and he did change that, though).

&amp;#x200B;

At some point during the year he invited me to his house on summer vacations to spend a couple weeks there. So on February we were all set and we both traveled by plane. I stayed there for two weeks. While in January we were both really excited to spend the summer together, when I got there and for the first days I started feeling like he was annoyed, that he didn't want me there, or that he just wasn't really excited. I felt so bad because he would take some attitudes like barely talking to me, staying on his phone all the time, even at some point he said something to his parents that, while maybe it was intended as some kind of joke, it really hurt me. His family however where the nicest people on earth and made it more bearable. At some point I really thought of buying a plane or bus ticket and leaving earlier because I felt so uncomfortable at the way he was acting. He didn't seem to be having a good time at all. One night, at some point during the second week, I just felt so bad that I asked him out of nowhere: ""M, why did you invite me here?"" (I know it was not the best thing to do at all, but I didn't know what else to do). He told me he just wanted to spend time with me. And then we just had this conversation that didn't end up well, and we both went to sleep kinda mad at each other I guess. At some point I asked him ""what do we have in common?"", and he just stood there thinking for like a minute and he couldn't say a thing. Then he said ""do we have to be exactly the same for us to be friends?"" and I told him that no, we didn't have to be exactly the same, but I would expect that just as we are very different in some aspects, we would have some other stuff in common. At that point I was questioning really bad if our friendship was ""real"". Anyway, next morning I told him I was really sorry but I just wasn't feeling well, and he told me not to worry. But after that I just felt like everything went into a nosedive. We still had great times, but there were lots of times as well where I felt like he wanted me out of there as quickly as possible. When I finally left, I couldn't help but silently cry in the airport and the plane back to my city because of how weird everything was, and how the vacations I had so many expectations for, because I'd be spending time with my best friend who I cared very much for, felt ruined (he stayed at his house, of course, so I was traveling alone this time).

The following days we barely talked. A week after, I sent him a really long message where I basically told him that: I was feeling really bad, because of some stuff that happened during those weeks but also some general aspects of our friendship. I needed some distance, I didn't want to end the friendship altogether but I just couldn't bear with being so caring about our friendship when he didn't act the same way at all, so I needed some distance, but we could still talk and play tennis from time to time (that was our favorite sport that we played together). I told him was totally open to getting an answer if he wanted to answer me, but I would understand if he would be mad at me, or didn't want to answer yet. He left me on read. My birthday also came a couple of weeks after that and of course he didn't send me a happy birthday message, which was totally expected, but still hurt a little.

&amp;#x200B;

A month after (around April 20) that I sent him another message where I told him that, while maybe I understood why he wouldn't answer me yet, I was feeling very anxious and couldn't stop thinking about it all. That I wanted to talk to him in person but coronavirus happened and so we obviously haven't seen each other yet, and probably won't in a long time. That the fact that he didn't say a thing made me feel like he didn't care at all about our friendship, and now I really needed some kind of answer. He left me on read for like 10 hours and then he answered me: ""The truth is, it did hurt me. I didn't and don't know what to say to you yet, maybe later, but not now.""

&amp;#x200B;

I felt slightly relieved to at least get a word from him. Some friends I talked to about this told me that, in their opinion, he didn't care about this at all, and I felt a lot worse than him, so I needed to let it go. However, we were really really close and knew each other really well so I'm like 95% sure he did feel really bad, probably as bad as I did, but he doesn't want to express it, because he's used to hiding his feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Right know I'm starting to feel anxious again. I didn't mention it before but we would be forced to see each other in person in March or April because we had some stuff to do in lab, and I also had to give him a Christmas gift that I had for him, and he has to give me a book back, so we would talk to each other again, but of course that won't be happening any time soon now. I've been waiting for an answer for more than two months now, and he has barely said a thing. I know he's definitely not ""entitled"" to give me an answer but I feel like it's the least he could do for ourselves, instead of just ending the friendship altogether and not expressing himself at all. I literally think about this every day, every hour, because it's just so fucking hard to lose my best friend just like that, and I can't help but remember all the promises we made to each other (like we would grow old together, work in the same hospital, buy tickets to an ATP cup, travel to Europe together, have our children in the same class, and so on) and feel like they've just vanished.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about sending him another message. Maybe tell him all the things in greater detail about why I needed some distance. But I know that maybe it won't work that well. I just can't stand this anymore. I've also thought of waiting until his birthday (July 25) and just say ""happy birthday, M"" to him just to get a reaction out of him. I don't know what I should do, really, and I'm starting to feel really bad again. Please just help me and give me your honest thoughts.",04May2020,1

29,"Background:
-we just put in a swimming pool (we just finished filling it today)
-the neighbors behind us have three kids, the oldest is about 6. 
-our kids are in their early 20s

Yesterday, as the guys from the pool company were working on the pool, the six year old stood at the fence and yelled at them (Why are you cleaning the pool? Is there going to be swimming?) They ignored her, but she just kept on and I finally told her they were working and didn‚Äôt have time to talk. 

After they left, she asked my kids if they were going swimming today. They said no, the pool was being filled. Of course, my kids are excited about the new pool, and were in the pool walking around (not swimming) and she kept yelling, ‚ÄúI thought you said you weren‚Äôt going swimming today.‚Äù They tried ignoring her and my husband eventually told her they weren‚Äôt swimming, the water‚Äôs too cold, etc.  It was a hot day so my daughters has swimsuits on and she just kept standing at the fence. 
‚ÄúAre you swimming?‚Äù ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô 
‚ÄúWhy are you wearing swimsuits?‚Äù ‚ÄòBecause it‚Äôs hot. We‚Äôre tanning.‚Äô 
‚ÄúWhen can I swim?‚Äù Sigh. 
‚ÄúCan you invite me over to swim?‚Äù Ugh. 

I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. I wouldn‚Äôt mind inviting her family over to swim once or twice, except...I don‚Äôt want them to expect an invitation all the time. We put the pool in for our immediate and extended family to enjoy. We had no intention of making it a neighborhood hangout.  I‚Äôm pretty sure her parents told her she had to wait to be invited which is why she asked us to invite her. Her dad makes ‚Äújokes‚Äù about putting a gate in our fence. 

We‚Äôve been talking about planting something to hide her view but it‚Äôs a long fence. Any other ideas?",04May2020,1

33,"Disclaimer: You may see this in multiple subreddits because I wanna get as much help and advice as possible from anyone...this is killing me...

I just wanted to share personal experiences and ask for genuine advice. 
Years ago, when I was about 12-13, I would say that my addiction to porn since I was 9, was rather extreme. Or so it progressed to be. It started as quick videos of straight porn, then eventually...... well, we'll get to that.......
So in about 2015, I moved to a new place, a new school and I ended up staying in the district for a while and this was, I believe to be where I found myself. Where my identity was created, and as I got older I knew who I wanted to be around. Who I wanted to talk to. Who I was afraid of, etc.. I met a lot of people, people that helped me figure out I wanted to be.....and helped me even craft new interests. (Not to say I didnt have a mind of my own, I was just a very open minded person and was always dying to fit in, so who wouldn't? Being the age I was)
But then it ended, and so I moved--- to a nearby city. It was a nice change of pace from motels, it was a brand new home. And as much as I hated the neighborhood, and the schools, a made a lot of memories here. And evolved as a person.... and well, also became more introverted.....
Eventually, that let to my moderate porn addiction becoming more prominent as I spent more time alone, as well as my new skills of pirating (movies, games, etc.) 
As porngraphic material began to become more addictive, from just daily quickies after school, to excessive binging and masturbation, to where i felt so shameful, physically in pain, physically incapable of even being able to fathom what's happened, because by then, I'm already craving it again........
After becoming so consumed, I ran to websites, chat room, making disposable accounts and messaging sexual texts to girls from school, and even joining random kik groups. To all my attempts, no success. 
After probably my 100th wank that week of month or how over many times-- I've lost track-- I knew I didnt want this....all I felt was shame and regret. My mind said no, but my hormones, my body said ""dude, we need more.""
Sometimes these random spikes in libido, or cravings would start from sad situations or rejection, where I would feel so worthless, I went to porn to get rid of it. 

‚Ä¢I would become existential--- porn
‚Ä¢Rejected my crush-- Porn
‚Ä¢realizes life is meaningless-- Porn!
‚Ä¢Make a mistake and hate myself-- Porn etc.

And eventually I would hit this stage where porn just wasnt doing it for me anymore--- and I sought nudes.......
This was new for me however, I did it maybe once or twice when I was 12 or 11, but only once from one girl who to this day, have no idea where she vanished to....but anyway, I started to try going full throttle and eventually found success after meeting girls on websites like Crush.Zone, where eventually, I would sext this girl regularly--- and every time, I would tell myself It was wrong-- (post nut clarity)
I told her I didnt wanna do it anymore, then a day later I wanna sext her again and she ignores me (for obvious reasons)
The cycle continues and I meet more and more girls, get left on read after a while and even decided--- ""What if I had real sex!?"" And a girl who weirdly enough lived in my city, I was tempted to ask to meet. But I knew it was out of character and that if i did this, I knew it will scar me. Haunt me. Follow me......and it still does and we never did anything. We just ghosted eachother. Eventually, I met the wrong girl.....on Crush.Zone.....she became the one who would morph my entire mental state and change my life for years.....

Long story short, I sent her a photo of me naked with my face in it, and she blackmailed me.....forced me to do very sexual disgusting things on Skype-- and I was so anxious-- I can remember shivering, forcing myself to have an orgasm when I was afraid for my life.....I'm shaking just thinking about it....I remember being happy it was all over until she asked......
""How old is your brother?"" 
She knew I had a brother because I told her that I couldn't record myself because my brother was in the bathroom....
So I replied ""8"" or was it 9? I cant remember if my brother was 8 or 9 when this happened......but then she said------
Send me a pic of him, um....without any of the cool angry birds pajamas if you know what I mean......
She claimed that she would upload my photos everywhere if I didnt do it-- and I knew I couldn't go to my parents--- because I didnt even know if she was in the US, I couldn't go to the cops because I would be charged for CP for even sending or asking for nudes in the first place...... and my parents were already going through shit and I just didnt wanna put that on them....
So......I did what I had to do and sent them. For the first time in any of this mess, I made a smart decision and left my brothers face out of the picture, so if it is out there...at least no one will ever see his face.......
She kept asking for more and said ""No, I thought you were done, I'm not sending anymore.""
Or something along those lines and as scared as I was-- I knew I had to be the bigger person and block her, and not do this to my brother anymore....luckily he didnt really know what was going on but even then.....that's why it hurts so much even to this day.......I wish I could start over....maybe even KILL the bitch who did this to me....but I soon realized, I did this to myself......
Eventually, my anxiety would get worse, I would be afraid to go out in public, afraid to get a job and all of my dreams feel impossible because if I wanted to pursue them, I was at risk of someone maybe seeing it and losing my job.....
So I threw it all away, all my hopes and dreams and a lot of my interests faded.....
I became progressively more traumatized as I looked back onto the event. I cried everytime I saw my brother....I cried every time I saw someone smile, or someone happy because I knew I wouldn't feel like that again.........porn wouldn't save me this time.....so I left it for a while....
I started feeling like I was being watched, thinking ""What If she hacked me, what If she knows where I live, my IP?!? What if she posts the photo and my name,"" because she claimed to have had my IP address. 
I started studying viruses and malware and became even more anxious.....or shameful because of all of the porn I watched.....
Everything.......
This made me the most suicidal I've ever been but I'll still never be able to be strong enough to do anything..

1 year later...
And after I accepted I cant live my life the way I wanted, I threw it all away and moved on....becoming more intersted in things like comic books and video games because I had more time for it....and would be disappointed and sad when I heard even one bad thing about it.... I would feel like ""Oh this is bad media and everyone hates it so I should hate it too""
And I would end up crying because I would attach myself to material things for the sake of happiness or joy of any kind. I became so invested in comic books, I spend hundreds of dollars on them all at once........I would always spend money recklessly, because it was just so exciting.....
Then eventually, that excitement is lost. To this day it still is and Video games are my only real escape.....the work sometimes but then they become frustrating...
So I quit and I'm back in my mind again....
I'm not trying to play the victim or ask for sympathy I just want some advice.....
Thoughts on my actions and ways I could overcome them......
If you want to say anything, it doesnt matter, positive or negative, I want feedback on how to not only fix myself, but my whole mind. How I can gain the courage to move forward, if I even deserve that opportunity. Because ever since then, I feel my entire mind has been fucked the last few years......
Negative or positive feedback helps...so dont be afraid...",04May2020,1

35,"Hi everyone. I am extremely obsessed with a guy and it is getting to the point where he is the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing I think about before going to bed. He is on my mind literally 24/7, and I fantasize about a life with him all day long. It has been months and months and months and this obsession is not even dwindling in the slightest bit. This is not the average crush that disappears after a few months, because my feelings are just as strong as ever after about 7 months even with no contact with him for over 4 months. I think I need help. Let me elaborate a bit further.

Our ""relationship"" was a major fail. We were too hesitant and didn't know what actions to take, as dumb as that sounds. We had sex one single time, but it didn't go anywhere after that even though we both liked each other, A LOT. He isn't a douchebag or a player or anything like that; he is genuinely a really nice person and everything I have ever wanted in a guy. Basically, he was in a position of authority over me and was not allowed to have a relationship with me, plus the environment we were in made it very hard for us to be alone together. I made it pretty clear to him that I was into him and he made it very clear to me as well, but we couldn't do anything about it. Everything basically fell apart. I don't want to get into the whole thing, but there is virtually no chance I can ever be with him.

I have been crushing on him hard for 7 months, but I last saw him about 4 months ago. And since then I have had absolutely zero contact with him. But I have thought about him every single day since then and it doesn't seem to be getting any less intense. I think I have a major major obsession. Everyday I replay memories of him in my head. I am literally in the same settings everyday of my life replaying the little moments we shared. I analyze every little bit of every single one of our interactions. I think about what it would have been like to have been with him, and have basically made up a whole life with him where we have a house and kids and dogs and everything.

I am getting extremely emotionally invested in this little fake life and I think my subconscious is starting to think it is real. He is practically like my imaginary boyfriend. I try to force myself to stop thinking about him because it is not normal but I just can't. It doesn't help that I am quarantined and stuck inside with nobody to take my mind off of him. I think part of it is that I am just really lonely and me imagining this fake life is a way of coping. But the other part of it is that I really really really like him and it feels like things were cut so short when we were together and I just wanted to see how it would play out a little longer. It feels really unnatural how things went and the ending didn't feel right, so now I think I am still living in the past because I wasn't satisfied with how it actually ended.

I don't know how I am supposed to take my mind off of him. I feel like I have no control over this. When I do manage to stop thinking about him, it's seems so boring. Like what am I even supposed to think about besides the little fake life I have created?",04May2020,1
36,"I'm attempting to use a translate app on my phone to understand Spanish speakers at my workplace. Most of them only speak Spanish and I need to know if the discussion is pertinent without slowing the process and asking if there's anything I need to know every 2 minutes. They're not very accommodating to meet my language needs to the point where even announcements and morning meetings are in Spanish only. Not against learning Spanish myself but that's going to take time and I'm admittedly not a fast learner/already tried that path once. Sometimes it's repeated in English or txt'd to me in English but not everytime.

Has anyone used a translate app and know how far a phone microphone typically reaches? If they're loud can it reach 10+ feet? I use a galaxy s8.

39,"Hi guys,

I have an issue that is eating me up. So, I had a roommate which I worked with at my grad school. He's older than me and he offered me a place to stay which was fully furnished which was really attractive. However, we didn't bond as roommates and we had a few issues and had a ""break up"" after two years. I moved out and that was that. I wasn't the best roommate which I completely get and I am not excusing my behavior as I was quite messy.

So, here is the part that's bothering me. My former roommate has been telling a lot of people our dirty laundry and has been badmouthing me. I know this is happening and a lot of coworkers are acting strange and distant around me. Also, another coworker of mine became his new roommate and he especially treats me strangely than how we were before. This hurts because I have been very adamant on not talking badly about my former roommate because I respect him and I think it is really hurtful to talk behind someone's back. I feel like a lot of my coworkers now think poorly of me and I feel his behavior is harming my reputation at work.

42,"Hello, I don't know how to start this so I'll jump right in.

If I see someone having an issue, especially with being lonely, or feeling like they're worthless, and any sort of self-esteem/social issue, I have this weird feeling that I NEED to help them. It doesn't matter how many red flags are waving in my face at 150 million miles an hour, or how impossible I logically know it is, but I just feel totally useless if I don't try. The urge to protect the weak is like so strong in me it over-rides my own health, which brings in the next issue...

What ends up happening is that I attach myself to them very strongly, and then it's like my issues catch up to my actions and I have my own breakdown. I am very insecure and have a strong fear of intimacy/abandonment, which makes me quite asocial. So, I talk to this person in need and try to help, but then I feel this horrible fear of talking to a person and I end up not helping them at all, disappointing myself further by failing to help them, and feeling scared and uncomfortable by talking to someone.

44,"Sorry in advance, I will try to keep this post short.

I am in community college in CA. My parents recently bought a house in the midwest and plan to move there by this Fall. I plan to apply to nursing programs to transfer into ADN (~7k) and BSN (~18k). I want to try and stay in CA for a multitude of reasons that I will not list here unless necessary but they do have to do partly with my education and also social life.

The reasons regarding the midwest is I dont like my parents, they are very emotionally and mentally abusive and exhausting and it has gone so bad that Ive already threatened to leave the house before. They are also very rude and homophobic to my girlfriend (who is currently a secret from them but they know of her and have been very rude about it). However, ADN is ~6k there and BSN is ~20k there. So almost the same. Likewise, my mom and sister guaranteed me theyd get me a job right after because they work in the medical field. Id have to work for a year or two after graduation. 

I have enough in savings to fund my entire ADN program (hoping I get in) for Spring in CA. The problem is, if I stay in CA, my options for housing range about a total of $34-40k for 2 years if I get an apartment with roommates. However, my aunt has a spare room in her apartment (she lives with my older cousin who is working in her company). She offered the room to me and said everything is for free- but obviously, I feel bad for freeloading so I plan to pay as much as I can by working part-time but in the end, it won‚Äôt be as expensive as living with roommates on my own. The reason shes offering it for free is because she does not want me to get a loan, which I would get if I had to get an apartment for myself.

So everything looks fine and dandy right? Well while I was talking to her and seeing how everythings doing, she told me she found out recently she has PV, a type of blood cancer with no cure but there is medication and treatment. Now, my aunt isnt very well off but she is very very kind. Im not sure where she is in finances but she is not bankrupt but she is in debt- I dont know how much. Morally, I dont know if living with her would be the best decision. I dont want to impose on her with having an extra mouth to feed and house. Of course I will try to pay her as much as I can but honestly, it might not be enough. There is also the issue of stability because what if something bad really happens and she loses the apartment (knock on wood).. but the situation could be unstable. I dont know how my cousin is doing in terms of finances and im sure she would help but I dont know to what extent.


TL;DR So, the dilemma is do I stay in CA for my happiness and education whilst staying with my aunt who was diagnosed with blood cancer? Or do I live with my emotionally abusive parents for another 2-3 years and they ensure a job for me after I graduate?",04May2020,1

We dated in the past but things just havent been looking good and she has been saying I've been emotionally abusive and manipulating. Everyone I have talked to has said that I've been in no way this way. Here is the last texts between us. 

Me: 
I just want to talk in a judicial and empathetic manner about how you really feel about us. I can see you've been distancing the past couple days. You asked for your guitar early even when it was already said that I'd bring the guitar when I move down and you said love ya, not love you or I love you. You know to me, the phrase ""I love you"" is very important and you've been saying ""love you"" and now ""love ya."" Which says something. You may not realize it but I do. I just want it be clear that you do in fact love me and not you love the idea of us or what we used to be. If your losing feelings for me just tell me. I dont want you to think you're stuck with me when you may want to talk to other people. I would understand if you dont want to hurt me or yourself. But I also dont want to hold you here and make your life miserable. 

Her:
Your insecurities are making me insane rn. Stop freaking out. I said love ya, I have love for you. We'll talk later. I'm hanging out with Anon rn.",04May2020,1
48,"**this is a few of many issues I‚Äôve faced with her regarding her behavior **

1)My mom had been talking about an accomplishment she achieved at work, and then she said ‚Äúbe quiet you always talk about work. You never listen to my accomplishments anyway‚Äù, or something along those lines

 **My sister came back from her boyfriend‚Äôs house a few days ago**. 

2) Today, I was doing my homework and my sister was irritated because she was doing the dishes while everyone else was relaxing. You see, you might me thinking *‚Äôit‚Äôs understandable that she‚Äôs pissed..‚Äô*, but she wakes up at 10 am and stays in her room until 1pm, while everyone is doing work from 9am-1pm. She does absolutely nothing from 1pm-5pm. My moms cooks for her too. We have to limit what we eat since she hates what we usually make when she‚Äôs not home. She had come downstairs, and started doing the dishes. Some dishes were already in the dishwasher, and she started talking very rudely to my mom since she put the dishes too close together. My mom had told her sternly not to speak to her that way, and she called her a ‚Äúcrazy woman‚Äù. I was still doing my homework, and she asked me to hose down the backyard so we could eat dinner. I was going to go on a  walk with my parents, so I had told her that I would do it when I come back. *Mind you, this was 6 hours before dinner*. After this, she said ‚ÄúI wish I could go on walks and actually do what I‚Äôm supposed to do.‚Äù I was stunned. First of all, she had about **8 hours** time prior to this situation to do her work, and go outside. Second of all, nobody asked her to do household work. She **chose** to. I‚Äôm very thankful that she did, but if she‚Äôs going to act like it‚Äôs a burden and treat everyone like crap then she *just shouldn‚Äôt do it*.  Lastly, what‚Äôs the problem with me hosing down the backyard **after** coming from the walk? I don‚Äôt understand. 

She had also started screaming because she couldn‚Äôt find PPE (masks), and had demanded that we find them for her. I don‚Äôt even know why she needed them. We weren‚Äôt even going out. 

She also gave my dad a dirty look today because the volume on the TV had *accidentally* been too loud. 

Yesterday, she told us to leave the windows closed because she has allergies, and we accidentally left one opened; she stated crying. Me, my mom, and my dad tried explaining to her that it was an accident, but she called us crazy and careless and said we were part of a ‚Äúclan‚Äù. 

She also often hits people, throws things, and screams for reasons as minor as the house not being clean. She also hates it when people give her tasks or tell her what‚Äôs/wrong, but she does it all the time. 

Why do I feel **uncomfortable** around her? Because she does this every. Single. Day. I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I feel very restrained and gutted around her. I want to be free, and as harsh as it sounds, it currently feels like I‚Äôm being held hostage when she‚Äôs around.",04May2020,1
49,"I recently moved into a slightly poorer city than the neighboring one. On a monthly basis someone tries to rob me. On a weekly basis I hear someone threatening me or yelling a racial slur at me.

50,"27F... I just feel sort of bored &amp; stuck with where I‚Äôm at in life. I have a food service job I don‚Äôt hate but don‚Äôt love &amp; an eBay store I make decent money at, a sort of boyfriend I truly care about but idk where it‚Äôs going (only 2 months in), an apartment that‚Äôs fine but nothing special, waiting to hear if my car is totaled (was hit while parked a few days ago), and 2 dogs that I love but they‚Äôre expensive/one has a lot of anxiety issues so I can‚Äôt do ‚Äúfun‚Äù dog things like the dog park. 

I have tried to imagine what I want out of life, but I don‚Äôt really know. I don‚Äôt know if I want kids or not. There is no career I‚Äôm interested in. I don‚Äôt really want to go to school (put in one year and dropped out because I didn‚Äôt want to pay/work  for a degree I didn‚Äôt feel passionate about). 

I don‚Äôt feel depressed. I‚Äôm not overweight. I don‚Äôt spend all day in bed. I feel generally positive day to day. I‚Äôm doing ok financially. I wake up and walk my dogs, check my eBay store, ship items that sold, do chores around the apartment, talk to my sister/guy, some days I go to work. 

Am I missing something? I‚Äôm just bored. I am interested in traveling, but am on probation for 1.5 years because of an ex that lied about vandalism. Is this something people my age just go through?",04May2020,1
51,"Background: My friend and I are roommates and have been for about two years. We live in a college coed dorm type of situation. She is dating (Kevin), seems serious. I love you‚Äôs and parents involved. He is an amazing genuine guy from what I‚Äôve seen. But she has two side dudes that she regularly crosses boundaries with. I have witnessed it multiple times. A lot of people talk about it as well but I give her the benefit of the doubt since she‚Äôs my friend. But since I‚Äôve actually witnessed it now, I‚Äôm struggling. 

If you were in Kevin‚Äôs position, would you want to know if your girlfriend was doing shady shit? 

If you were in my position, what would you do? I have tried to have a conversation with her about it twice. No accusations, just asking what is going on because it‚Äôs weird how I see her interact with all three guys. 

I see it as if I was doing something shady, or something that would ruin my character, I would want her to tell me that I am fucked up. It‚Äôs starting to affect me and people are questioning my character because I‚Äôm so close with her. 

I know we are not the same person with the same morals and judgement and I need to take that into consideration. Maybe what she and I think is wrong is completely different. 

I value our friendship and don‚Äôt want to ruin that but I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. Again.",04May2020,1

54,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (21F) are taking a 72 hour ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. Advice for dealing with the separation anxiety/going through rough patches.

Some backstory: My boyfriend and I have been together for two years and a month. We started out long distance, but I moved to his city 8 months after dating October 2019). 11 months into our relationship (December 2019) he admitted to me that he had cheated on me a month prior (November 2019). Later that weekend, he admitted that he hadn‚Äôt been faithful in general, and cheated twice previous to the incident in November. The first time was two weeks after we hooked up for the first time, where we agreed to see each other exclusively (we‚Äôd been casual friends for about a year by the time we started dating, so it wasn‚Äôt like we didn‚Äôt know each other at all). The second time was in October 2019, the same weekend I moved to his city. He is a musician and travels touring with his band often. The people he hooked up with were people he‚Äôd hooked up with in the past that were fans of him/his band - which is also how we met.

When he admitted all this to me, it was obviously very traumatic, as this is the very serious relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. He was extremely remorseful, in tears, and begging me to give him a chance to redeem himself because he realized what he was risking losing by being a selfish idiot. He explained having doubts about our relationship or being in a relationship in general in the beginning, which led him to act out. The third and final time he cheated, he claims he was drunk and was in a very selfish place in terms of feeling like he could get away with whatever he wanted, when he wanted, without repercussions. He went through a lot of soul searching and realized that the temporary fixes and satisfaction wasn‚Äôt fulfilling and eating him alive, because I was what he really wanted and needed and didn‚Äôt want to lose me. He felt by being honest, we could start over. I agreed because by this point I was already in love with him and I didn‚Äôt want to lose him. 
He started taking with me when he left town for tours sometimes, and we‚Äôve had the time of our lives traveling together in the past year. We‚Äôve been through a lot of hardship, painful conversations, tears, yelling, insecurities, and fears, and have made it really far in terms of how comfortable we both feel in the relationship. 

However, it still feels consistently difficult to some extant. We haven‚Äôt made it a month without fighting or having some pent up angst being brought back to light but have pushed through everything every time. We love each other and get along really well generally, and I am on my way to fully trusting him again, but there have been some moments the past couple months where I feel quite frustrated with him. 
He is not the most effusive person. He struggles with expressing himself verbally and my love language is heavily verbal and very much revolves around actually voicing feelings. Our physical relationship/sexual chemistry is perfect. We have no problems in the physical affection department or with sex. But I struggle with him not being super emotionally intimate a lot of times, which he knows and says he‚Äôs working on for me. In turn, I am working on not responding to every negative situation or crisis by crying or investing so much emotion into things that I end up having anxiety attacks. He‚Äôs always known I‚Äôm extremely emotional, but lately it seems to be grinding his gears. 

Since the whole COVID chaos started, he‚Äôs fallen into somewhat of a depression. His band‚Äôs concerts are cancelled for the foreseeable future and he is having financial struggles, since he bought the house he‚Äôs living in two years ago and doesn‚Äôt want to lose it because he can‚Äôt pay his mortgage due to dwindling savings and too much pride to ask for help from his older sister or parents. I am a student/aspiring writer who isn‚Äôt financially independent yet, so I have no way of helping him. I currently live with my mother.

In the past month, I‚Äôve gone through a couple of health scares, and so has my mother. This caused some tension to build between my boyfriend and I because I was taking the health struggles really hard and he didn‚Äôt feel I was ‚Äúreacting‚Äù logically because I was overly concerning myself and ‚Äúworrying for something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet‚Äù, which I get, but I also had to wait a week to find out if my mom had breast cancer or not, which I feel like is big enough to be pretty worried about. He can be on the more insensitive side. I can be over dramatic. He can be brash, and I can be fragile. He can be repressive, and I can be way too open. We are polar opposites in many ways, and very alike in other ways - we have the same sense of humor, agree on most things politically, make each other laugh all day, are both stubborn, are both strong willed, are both intense people in our own ways, respect each other‚Äôs careers, etc. I could go on about the positives.
However, he has seemed to be fairly weighed down by the negatives, specifically the negatives in his life regarding his circumstances but I feel that the negative aspects of our relationship are bleeding into his mindset as well. Every little argument he takes very hard (like, if he says a joke that comes across mean and I address it) and acts like it‚Äôs the biggest argument ever. He used to be flippant about the small shit, but the small shit seems pretty big to him right now. Now, I have admittedly been very stressed with work and family stuff and just trying to juggle life in general, so I am a little detached and probably not as supportive or present as I should be or have been in the past and he is noticing and it‚Äôs affecting him. But he hasn‚Äôt made it easy to be supportive either. Every time I give him a suggestion to help him feel better or get him out of his funk (eg: you should take walks, read a book, sit by the pool every day for an hour, swim, write new music, etc) he tells me I‚Äôm lecturing, telling him everything he‚Äôs doing wrong, and making him feel like shit. So depending on the day, I either don‚Äôt give any input to how he‚Äôs feeling at all, or keep trying to mindfully suggest things to him I feel like would help if he tried. All in all, we‚Äôve both managed to find ways to push each other away in the last couple weeks. We‚Äôve been arguing and bickering and I‚Äôm probably so irritated by how his attitude in general that I‚Äôm... harder on him than I should be and not cutting him enough slack.

Last night we had an ‚Äúargument‚Äù over dinner. He was playing piano and singing and I went to join him, but he kept commenting on flat singing notes and I got discouraged and frustrated that he was taking the fun out of something just FUN and turning it into something serious. This made me moody, because again, I‚Äôm stupidly sensitive and I really want to work on it. I was quiet at dinner and this frustrated him, then his frustration frustrated me and I went into how he seems as equally detached as I am. We somehow talked through this and the rest of the evening was pretty fine. We got a little drunk, watched a movie, had sex, and went to bed in each other‚Äôs arms fairly happy. I‚Äôm used to us dealing with things and moving on, which is why I was so thrown off when this morning, we got into a serious argument that resulted in him first saying something about breaking up (because ‚Äúlast night wasn‚Äôt fun for me and I‚Äôm not happy right now and none of this is fun for me‚Äù, that he dreads talking on the phone because I‚Äôve been giving him ‚Äúso much shit‚Äù lately, worrying about our compatibility, being annoyed with how emotional I am, being annoyed with how hard on him I‚Äôve been and our arguing), to us actually having a conversation (he worries about the relationship because my mother and I are very close and attached and he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever want to live away from her, even though I told him I‚Äôm just waiting for my dad to retire so she‚Äôs not alone, and for now, that is what makes me comfortable) and hashing shit out (admitting our own wrong doings, admitting where we need to work on things, admitting where we‚Äôre flawed and what of those flaws the other person is willing to accept), to us both coming to the conclusion of not wanting to lose each other and wanting to keep working on things as long as the other person wants to as well. But this also led him into saying he needs a couple of days to be alone and ‚Äúthink‚Äù. This obviously freaked me out and expressed that I felt nervous about putting that distance between us in the case that he might end up in a mind set of wanting to break up and be alone BECAUSE he‚Äôs alone. He said he was equally worried about that from my end, which is insane, because I know me and he should too and I am so far from feeling that way.

I cried out of nervousness. He held me. He reassured me that it‚Äôs only a couple days, that it‚Äôll be good for us, that it‚Äôs just a reset, and that we‚Äôll be okay. That he still believes in us, that he loves me, that he wants to be with me. He drove me home. We hugged, we kissed, he held my hand, told me he‚Äôll help teach me to drive soon (because I don‚Äôt know how) and we parted on generally good terms. We agreed to talk on Wednesday. It‚Äôs Sunday evening and I‚Äôm already going nuts. We talk all day (sending each other cute animal videos, memes, news stories, hearts, whatever) and just knowing that we wont talk for another two full days is making me feel so anxious because I‚Äôm so scared that he‚Äôs going to come out of this with a changed mind about me and us and after everything that we both have invested in the relationship, after everything we‚Äôve been through, that thought just makes me so nauseous. He‚Äôs my best friend and I hate how much we‚Äôve been arguing and how hard things been as much as he does. He promised everything would be okay and we could talk on Wednesday and make plans to get together this weekend, but a part of me fears it‚Äôs just him placating and trying to keep me from getting too stressed out or nervous about this break thing. I am so willing to keep working on us with him. I want to give us all the chances we can have.

We‚Äôve talked practically every night for two years. How do I deal with the anxiety of feeling so far and separate from him? How do I stop thinking about worst case scenarios regarding how we‚Äôll come out of this on Wednesday?",04May2020,1
55,"Shitty situation, i really need a second job to knock out my car insurance each month. Ive only smoked a handful of time (like 9-10) and it had been months since  the last time. It was my birthday and I was drunk and accepted the joint lol. Next day i get a call to come in for an interview.

I definitely failed the test, maybe even for alcohol too.

59,"Okay, so I apologize if this is a bit out of place but please bare with me. I live in the state of Ohio and I am 21 years old. I don't have my license, just my temporary permit. I plan on getting my license soon but I am unable to at the moment because of the whole pandemic situation. Anyways, I've been searching for a vehicle for a while and I've finally found a car that I'd like to buy from a private seller. I am set to meet with the owner in a little under a week, and if all goes well, I plan to buy it in ""cash"" up front. I don't plan on driving it illegaly, but I figure since I have an opportunity to buy the car that I want at a good price, I should take it. Now, it goes without saying that if I don't have my license, I also don't have insurance. My main question is, could I get the car registered in my name if I don't have insurance? The BMVs in my state are currently closed, besides a few that are only offering commercial services, so I'd have to register it online and get my tags mailed to me. I already visited the page and scoped it out and the first question is ""do you affirm that you currently have insurance or other financial responsibility coverage and that you will not operate any motor vehicle without FR coverage"". However, they have a little FAQ page and it says that the only things I need to register a passenger car or motorcycle are 1. A Ohio Certificate of Title or Memorandum of Title, 2. A Ohio driver license, state ID -OR- proof of Social Security number, and 3. Tax ID number if titled in a business name.

It seems strange to me that I would not be able to buy a vehicle just to store away for a little while until I get my shit together. If I lie and say I do have insurance and just park the car away, could they end up denying/suspending the registration?  What would happen then? Is it possible that this will impact me later when I decide to actually insure the car, since there will be a noticeable gap where I owned the car, but didn't have it insured? Especially since the first thing they ask is, ""do you have insurance""?

This stuff is just really confusing, honestly. I'd appreciate any feedback.",04May2020,1

I(14m) have an older sister(24f).

When I was 3 I remember her inviting me to take a bath with her. I said yes and when I got in she started touching me. She would also come into that bathroom while I was in the bath and touch me then. She did this until I was 8-9 when our parents weren‚Äôt home. She told me not to tell them what she was doing and I never did.

She lives with us since her college is in our city and we have to share a room since my grandma had to move in awhile ago. It makes me uncomfortable to sleep in the same room as her and I‚Äôm afraid if I tell my parents they won‚Äôt believe me what should I do",04May2020,1
61,"[Sorry for my english.]



I'm a 22 years old male and I don't really see myself having a future. Living in a third world country surrounded by conservative people, it would probably take a couple of decades before they start accepting same-sex marriage. 

I'm not sure if being gay is a life that I want to pursue. If someone offers me a pill that can turn me straight, then I would gladly accept it. 

I always try my best not to show any signs of me being gay to all the people around me. Coming out is not an option. But part of me knows that a lot of my friends and family probably suspect it already. My mom would occasionally ask me if I have a girlfriend but it's more like she's trying to keep me on check. 

Everyday I go to college and I'm always on guard. ""What if they find out I'm gay?"" Acting all manly when I'm with my guy friends and trying to act embarassed everytime a girl approaches me. I'm tired of it. 

........ 

One time, we were having some type of group activity, this girl in my class suddenly asked me, ""Are you gay?"" It was so sudden that I didn't even remember what my reaction was. I just stood there and probably looked so shocked. Everyone went quiet and some of them even looked at us. I just said ""no"" and she said nothing. After that, it became so hard to talk to my friends. I'm usually alone by myself lately. They would all still talk to me but it feels like they're always on guard.

........... 

I don't really know why I'm saying all of these here. Anyway, I have already decided. I will give myself another 3 years. By 25 years old, and I still feel miserable then I will end it all. I already have plans on how to do it and at this point, it's just a matter of courage. I don't really see any point in living this kind of life.

62,"Im in college living in a house with one other person at the moment. About a month ago he moved in with  two dogs. One of the dogs he is watching for a neighbor and one dog is his own.

 I don't mind him having dogs in the house but they can be agressive towards me. For example they will charge and bark at me if I leave my room to go the kitchen or the bathroom. They haven't ever bit me but i'm afraid to leave my room because they could attack me. He try's his best to calm them down but it is a scene everytime I go to the kitchen for a snack or when I use the bathroom.

 I think it is unfair for me to have to live in fear of being attacked by dogs.I have had to limit who comes over because of the dogs and tip toe around the house I pay rent in. His parents own the house and he has the opportunity to live with his parents but chooses to live in the house with me.

Any suggestions on handling this would go a long way.

63,"So I'll preface this with stating that I wholly understand this is a minute problem in a world full of more important issues than my own and people living in much dire straits through less financial means.  And these are definitely not problems of the world.  More trying to find some semblance of purpose or direction.  

I've also become somewhat of a hermit by design.  I know I let myself get to how I am and I am working towards fixing those issues but I lost a lot of confidence over the years to a point where I've said some awkward things to people I barely know that made the situations worse.  A lot happening in my head right now.  This took a lot for me to post.  Spent 3 days re-writing because I felt it was too chaotically written, which this may very well be too.  I appreciate your time regardless.

So I recently turned 31, I've been living a very uneventful life over the past few years.  From 25-31 I've done close to nothing with my life and this sense of dread is just looming over me.  Not so much of death but more like I feel stuck with no way out.  Like your locked in a room without a door.  When I was 21 I had this dream is be married with kids by now, and all I currently have to show for my life a semi successful job and I am able to live on my own, pay my own bills and afford some luxuries most can not. But I don't feel fulfilled.  I feel like I've let my life slip through my fingers and lost my way.  I had a direction and ambitions but now I'm filled with anxiety and depression.  I've definitely dug my own hole, I just want to find some direction in life.  I'm tired of feeling alone and unhappy with my career.  I feel like I work a lot of hours with little to show.  I make a decent amount, much more than the average median household income in my country(NA).  I have also worked in the retail field for the past 15 years (since I was a teenager). But I feel more is out there for me and I want to find/build the courage to look and explore my options.  This is where the question lies... Where do I even begin?  I've always been interested in a variety of subjects from art - movies as well as the tech industry(recently built my first computer and enjoyed the entire process) but exploring some of those field requirements and pay it becomes less appealing and I lose interest quickly.  Can't seem to zero in on something that looks worth my time.  I've looked into big system storage careers(tech field - coding knowledge required, I have little to none) to producing/directing in films as well as engineer type work(computer/architect/electrical)  I currently work with the public in grocery retail, have managed upwards into the 150+ employees at times.  Managing high volume stores to low volume.  But I don't know how long I want to do this for.  I never intended this to be an end all, but you kind of get stuck with the pay and consistency.  I need/want to move on, for my sanities sake.   If anyone can make any semblance of this, I'd appreciate any feedback you can provide.  Thanks all and cheers!

64,"I (15m) just started texting the girl I've like for a while the other day. We were facetiming A LOT for a few days and we just stopped facetiming all of the sudden. Because I had so much fun and just stopped it's made me realize how depressed I've been living. It's not a serious or deep depression, but it's just been worse recently. 

It doesn't help that the quarantine has a lot of places closed right now. I don't have many friends, but the friends I have can't really hang out right now. I've lived in the same neighborhood for like 6 years now and i'm just bored of it. I know a lot of people here and we've already done everything you can think of. We've explored all of the land within like 3 miles of the neighborhood. It's just boring. 

I get so excited when I get a text from any one of my friends. I sit here all day and play video games and that's really all I've done in my free time for the last 3 or so years. I don't get really any satisfaction from playing video games anymore. I'm only 15, so I don't drive yet (I just turned 15 last month and the DMV is closed, so I can't get a learner's permit), so I can't really go anywhere that i'd like to by myself. I might have a job lined up for me soon once I'm able to work, but that's all i'd do.

I don't know how much longer i'll be able to live like this, especially as an adult later on in life. I play sports right now, and that's really my only escape to have fun. I know that sports won't be an option later on down the road, and I don't plan on playing after high school anyway. When i'm on the field, I have a few people that I can actually talk to, and the upper class team mates make me feel wanted. I don't really feel special to anyone except my team. I'm not even really good at the sports I play. 

For the past 3 days, I've had time to sit here and think about stuff, and I don't have a healthy mindset towards the girl I've been talking to. I think I'm being obsessive and that has just made me really sad, because I have to fix that before anything serious can happen with that if it ever does. Since I've been thinking about her all of the time, it's made me sad to think about her maybe ghosting me, and she kind of is right now. I'm scared that i'll never find anyone like her if she stops talking to me. That thought along with others just makes me scared, more depressed and sad. 

I feel like I don't have much value. I'm very smart and knowledgeable for real life skills that a guy would know, but I'm not smart when it comes to school subjects, and I can't focus in class which makes subjects like math a lot harder. In saying that, I feel like i'm not smart (when it comes to school), giving myself less value. I also am not great at any sports that I've ever played. I'm not amazing at video games either. I can't do any cool tricks with anything like a bike. 

The only purpose that I feel I'd serve is to be in physical labor or auto mechanics. My only plans that I can guarantee myself are in the military, which is where I want to head right out of high school. My plans after that would be construction and auto mechanics. 

My dreams are even low thought of myself a little bit, but it's what I want and what I think is 'fun'. My dream life would be easy to achieve, but makes having a relationship incredibly hard, and a relationship is what I feel would make me happy in life. My dream is to become a Marine right out of high school, and then get deployed. If i'm not dead from being deployed, then i'd become a construction worker and save money for maybe owning a shop of some kind. I want to have a relationship sooner in life, and long term. It's very unlikely, but the girl i'm talking to is the one I want to stick around with. If that did work out, then my other dreams would get in the way.

This far into it, i'm just saying what's on my mind. 

I also didn't mention this, but I'm very shy and I'm always anxious about everything. I've improved A LOT this year, but being shy makes it a lot harder to do a ton of stuff.

Now, my question is: 

  
What's some advice for me?   
What will I be able to do to make my life more interesting and less depressing?   
How would I be able to work out my dreams?   
How can I get more friends (not fake friends, I only have true friends)?   
What can I do on a daily basis to avoid dark or depressing thoughts?",04May2020,1
65,"For privacy reasons we will call her Rose. Rose and I were talking for about 3 weeks which I know is really a short amount of time but for some reason we connected really well and went on a lot of dates in that short period of time. I treated her as respectfully as I could and even when we drank together I made sure to tell her I dont want to do anything physical because I wanted her to be comfortable and I didnt get too physical. The last time we hung out we had made a plan to hang out sometime this week however the other day I received a message from Rose that said, ""Hey so I want you to know that you‚Äôre really great but I‚Äôm just not in the right head space right now to date someone. I‚Äôm sorry if it seems like I was leading you on if I would‚Äôve realized it sooner I would‚Äôve told you sooner. I just want you to know it was genuinely nothing you did and you‚Äôre great.

70,"Hey. Art teacher (22f). I work at a small school where most the teachers are women in their late 20s to to late 30s. Most of them have kids, and almost all of them are married and have houses. I live at home currently (have been in and out) and never want kids. They're all very normal and polite. Maybe a little clichey, but thats it. Nothing is wrong with them.. Its me haha.

I have always been a little on the weird and awkward side and going to art school didn't help. All my friends are very open, expressive, and nonjudgemental and I'm so used to that. When I'm at school, its like I put on a huge professional mask. I try to ask questions about their kids, husbands, and families and try to listen as much as I can but I'm never included in any group conversation. I feel like a kid around them and its weird because I had no problems making friends in college with people their age too!  

Part of me wants to give up and just chill by myself and get more work done but the other half feels lonely sometimes. When I try to socialize more, I just get uneasy afterwards and start missing my non-work friends.

When I think of my adult life, I start stressing because I feel like I won't be able to fulfill. I see myself as a very creative person, and academically I'm just around average (I know if I'd study and take it serious I could achieve very above average results but tbh I just don't)

77,"Just curious if anyone has a similar situation. 

I'm 34 (male), married with 3 boys. Ages are 11, 8, and 3. We live in Arizona currently. 

I don't have a ton of debt, no car loans or student debt. I do have a mortgage. Right now I have a decent amount of equity in my house (like 60k).

I work at a town running heavy equipment. It's no dream job but it has benefits and retirement. The pay isn't great but that's typical, it seems, when you don't have a degree. My wife works opposite schedules from me serving at a restaurant about 3-4 nights per week.

Truth is, we've always stayed pennies ahead of bills (paycheck to paycheck). I'm not satisfied with my work nor the opposite schedules not seeing my wife often. Not that my career must fill all of my needs creatively but I'm in a mindless physical job and always have been. I just wonder if I would thrive more in something less physical and more heady or creative after getting an education.

I am a creative minded person. I've been playing music for 23 years and have composed a bunch of songs. I do enjoy writing and have even done it freelance for a few extra bucks here or there.

I did well while I was in community college but left when I was ""ready"" to get out on my own and marry my now wife. 

Her parents, my in-laws, have offered to let us move in with them in Florida rent free so I can go to school. They're great folks, they have quite a bit of room in their house and it may be a nice change of pace for us. Although it's totally different, I am originally from California so I do miss the ocean. 

My only hangups now are selling our house and living with other people for a while.

We got our house at a decent price but things have skyrocketed, at least where we live, and I worry that we won't get to buy again for a really long time. Not a deal breaker but a concern. We would save our equity that we get paid while we're there in Florida for a few years while I went to school. Our bills will be lower but so would the income.

As far as living with people, we have stayed with other people before for short stints (moved around for a couple years for work). Depending on who it was with it was either pretty cool or pretty awful.

The in-laws are real easy to get along with but we have also been independent for so many years, it may be too hard to adjust to that with our family growing up so fast.

Has anyone done something like this? As a creative introvert, I just want more out of my career even if it's just to get out of the physical low paying jobs. I feel like I'm at my earnings potential ceiling and am already dissatisfied with my career to boot.

TL;DR
Working low paying physical jobs my whole adult life. Looking for more pay and less physical work. In-laws offers to have my family (wife, three sons, and myself) move into their home across the nation rent free to got to school and get a degree. Would anyone do this?",04May2020,1

89,"So I been dating this girl for almost two years and the amount of stories I hear from her regarding her brother is astounding. At least once a month, I would hear from her how the brother would often try to open the door to the bathroom when she is inside. Most times, she manages to close it before he cracks it open too much, but there were several cases when she was not fast enough. 

Today, my girlfriend was in the bathroom, drying up after the shower, naked, and heard her brother asking her a question. She told him to wait but he started to open the door. So she tried to close it, but according to her, the brother used a bit of force to try to open the door, just to ask her where the coke is. 

She told her parents about it every time it would happen, but all they say to him is to not do it again next time. They live in a small apartment, and the siblings share a bunk bed to this day. At first, I could not understand why everyone in their family was okay with it, but the longer I dated her, I came to understand their financial situation, and I stopped telling her how weird I thought it was. But with what happened today, I feel like as her boyfriend, I should say something to the brother. Talk some common sense into him.

Is that too much for me to do? I met their entire family on several occasions, and I know that at least the brother is not a big fan of me. Being an only child, I cannot see how the parents don't see this as a big problem. Am I blowing it out of proportion?",04May2020,1

With a couple of exceptions, most of my clothes are from early high school or were gifts, and they aren't really my style anymore. I also lost about 20-30 pounds a year ago (didn't weigh myself until halfway though my weight-loss lol) so most of my shirts are a bit ill-fitting. 

I've been getting by just fine purchasing things from thrift stores, but there are a couple of items of clothing I want that are really hard to find in my size. Also, I really need a new bra and most second hand stores dont carry underwear. I went online shopping recently and realized just how expensive decent clothes are. Even when I got everything on sale the price ended up being close to 1/5th my monthly spending budget. While I could get everything from a cheaper store, I know from past experiences that fast fashion clothing wears down in the matter of weeks. I want my clothes to last me at the very least until I graduate. 

I kinda wanna ask my mom if she can help pay. My reasoning is that she has a stable job and still writes me as a dependent on her taxes, so she must be seeing some monetary benefit there.

104,"Okay. So I have this coworker. I am a step below her and a step above everyone else.

I'm in my late 20's and she is in her 50's.

For the most part we get along really well. But it is really easy to get on her bad side.

She is the type of woman who needs something or someone to hate and pick on.

So more often than not I am on her bad side compared to everyone else because I work with her the most.

And whenever I'm on her bad side she is intolerable. Not only does she use her superiority to disrupt my working process but she does things to try and sabotage me.

A minor example from the past. I had to put these forms together and date them. She was supposed to do them and never did them. We kept them in a box under her desk. They are all very particular about organization so they wouldn't be anywhere else. There was nowhere else for them to even be. Well on my shift we needed those forms and she didn't do them. So I asked the owner of I could print them out and asked what size to cut them. She mentioned that they should have already been done. We checked together. They weren't done. They weren't anywhere. So I made new ones. It took me no time at all. The next day on her shift I come in and she chews me out. I said hey and she ignored me. Then an hour later she cornered me in this little boxed off section at work questioning why I did the forms. I mentioned how me and the owner checked and they weren't there and that we needed them. She said they were there in the box. I said no they weren't, me and the owner checked. She said yes they were there. And yelled at me for wasting paper and my time when I could have been doing something else. I said something along the lines of ""wow I had no idea I was thag incompetent"" and left it at that. You know what she did? I went back and checked the form box.  This woman straight up reprinted and recut all the forms. Then rewrote the dates and numbers on them in her own handwriting. And replaced them with the ones I made. You know what she did with the ones I made? She put them in the shredder. I know because I opened it up and looked.

So that's one example. Lately it's been this. During this whole pandemic we were working together. I was on her good side. Then I had severe anxiety and couldn't take care of myself so I had to stop working. So I came back after some time and she was gone on a break. Well when she came back when I was back I was on her bad side again.

This is what has been happening since the both of us have been back together at the same time. Everytime I end my shift every single piece of paperwork and receipts are accounted for, double checked and filed away where they need to be. Everytime she magically starts a shift without me and I come in later that day then somehow papers from my paperwork from my previous shift are magically found crumpled up and hidden somewhere where they shouldn't be. And they are only found by her. And it's always when I'm on a shift alone closing and then she opens the next day alone. If everything I'm doing while closing is accounted and it's all clear as day, then how come my paper work os found crumbled up the next day ""hidden somewhere it shouldn't be""? I'll tell you. This woman is straight up going into my paperwork from the night before, taking it out, crumbling it up and ""finding it"" in front of the owner.

It makes me wonder if the owner notices that this only happens on her shift and that my paperwork is perfect whenever she isn't there. Because I know that the owner knows that her paperwork isn't perfect. 

Anyways. I'm not sure how to go about this. Whenever she says confronts me about these things that she does to try and sabotage me I tell her no. I say ""no that's bot possible, I remember I put it exactly here so someone else went into the file, took it out, crumbled it and put it *where it doesn't belong*"". Then she usually hust comes back with a vatty remark stating that yeah, she did find it there. Then I usually say well, not by me so figure out who it is. And then she spends the rest od our shift together having a horrible attitude towards me.

I know for a fact it is not me. The only people who have access to these things are me, her and the owner. It's definitely not the owner. So it has to be her.

What do I do? Should I confront her saying that I ak aware that she is undoing what I'm doing and crumbling them up. Or should I keep combating her the way I am? Or should I tell the owner? Because it's just a huge waste of everyone's time.

I am not seeking the ""find another job"" kind of advice. That's not an option. I need more practical advice than that. Especially during a time like this. I already know to document all of these things all in one place as well for the future. But I need advice for the actual confrontational part of it with her because everything I do doesn't work.

108,"I am currently a geology major, I just switched into this major the past semester. I was enjoying it a decent amount at the beggining, but that‚Äôs just because I think I was excited for a fresh start.

I‚Äôve realized that it seems like none of the career paths are really things I will be able to do, nor really want to do.

I have for the most part realized that giving up on everything is what will make me the happiest. 

My goals right now are to be as alone as possible, including alienating my family, and avoiding being sober as much as possible.

I feel like such a waste wasting all of my parents money in college. I know that a degree won‚Äôt make me happy, and I‚Äôm not really betting on anything to make me too happy which is why I figure I should just give up and drop out.

109,"So, I'm (18F) not really sure where to start. When I was younger (around 4 - 13), I witnessed at least 4 instances of my dad beating up my mum. I have never had a good relationship with him and I've hated him ever since I can remember. AFAIK, my younger sister (17) and younger brother (12), don't remember these instances. The only time I remember seeing this while my siblings were also present, was when they were both quite young, so this explanation makes sense for me, because they both have good relationships with my dad and I wouldn't know how to feel if they knew AND still loved him.

When I was around 15, my parents relationship started to improve and my mum began to pressure me to talk to my dad. She would constantly come into my room, sit me down and guilt trip me into talking to him by saying ""he always gets mad at me because you don't talk to him"". This would always scare me given his history. Whenever I asked my mum why he doesn't talk to me first, if he's so bothered by it, she would say ""he's too old to change"".

To give you more of an objective view, my dad migrated as a refugee and experience persecution and police brutality in his home country due to his religion. His parents are also very cold-hearted, and he likely grew up surrounded by a lot of violence. 

My parents had an arranged marriage at the ages of 25 (mum) and 32 (dad) and my mum moved to an entirely new country to live with my dad's family. They were broke, so they all (my grandparents, parents, and 2 aunts) lived together for a while. From what I've been told by my mum and mum's sister, my mum's in-laws treated her like absolute shit. They were the only support she had, but they emotionally and verbally abused her, spread rumours about her, basically manipulated things so my dad would get angry at my mum. 

My parents eventually moved to a big city so my mum could use her college education and get a job. The rest of my dad's family followed. I was born shortly after, and my sister was born a year later. Since both my parents worked full time, and my grandparents lived with us, my grandma was my primary caretaker for most of my life. She absolutely despised my sister and would neglect her, so my parents worked around it and once she got older she would go to work with my dad a lot of the time. 

I would sleep in the same bed as my grandma, and my sister would sleep in the same bed as my parents. I obviously grew up very close to my grandma, and when I was about 10 my mum told me everything about her. This was so shocking for a 10 year old, in my mind my grandma became a Bad Person and I feel like it turned so much of my world upside down. I didn't feel close to my parents because they favoured my younger sister (out of necessity, since my grandma was a dick) and now my caregiver turns out to be a horrible person.

So, naturally, I'm much more closer to my brother and sister. My sister (17) has recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder. She's always been on the chubbier side and my mum would always nag her about it, telling her she wasn't attractive and wouldn't get married because of her weight (she was a literal child when my mum said these things. I also can't believe it). She talks to me about it sometimes and it's very stressful for me. It gives me a lot of anxiety and I don't know how to deal with it.

My brother (12), still sleeps in the same bed as my parents. He's extremely spoilt and plays games all day. He gets breakfast, lunch and dinner specially made for him, because he's a picky eater and it also gets delivered straight to him. I'm so worried about him, because I know this is so bad for him, and if we don't change things now, it's only going to get worse. I've brought this up to my parents several times and they always brush it off, so it seems like I'm the only one who cares

Now, for me, I've been diagnosed with cptsd last year because I independently sought a doctor's advice. I want to see a therapist, but it's so difficult to do it during quarantine without alerting my parents. I'm not comfortable enough with them to let them know any details about my mental health. I was also extremely depressed and suicidal in my early teens. I'm no longer suicidal, but the fact that my parents let me get to that point and never once noticed, but are now supporting my sister through her ED kills me inside.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking for at this point. I guess I just need advice on how to process everything and deal with everything. I've been contemplating telling my sister, because I think she deserves to know everything, but also I deserve to know if she wants to have a good relationship with my dad even after knowing he was abusive. I'm only hesitant because I don't want to make her ED worse",04May2020,1

111,Like many people my dad was recently laid off from his job. Him and my mom always drink but tonight he drank way too much has he does sometimes and was blasting music when she came out and turned it off and told him that was enough for the night he lost it and started getting violent. He broke her bedroom door and almost mine but I prevented him from doing it and almost got into a fight with him but was able to avoid it. I was genuinely worried about the safety of myself my mother and brother. He then ran outside with no phone wallet keys or even shoes or shirt and started punching cars and ran off we think maybe across the street where a vacant newly built house it. I was worried the cops would come and he‚Äôd be shot trying to fight them but now I think he may be passed out there or in our backyard. He obviously has a problem and needs to stop drinking but my mom is also naive and doesn‚Äôt seem to see she was almost attacked by him as well.

i don‚Äôt know what to do. i can‚Äôt follow him, i‚Äôm in college, and he can‚Äôt stay here. i don‚Äôt think he would feel comfortable with me living with him anyways. he said he would visit on the weekends, but i don‚Äôt know what to do. i feel so scared that he‚Äôll find someone else. what do i do?",04May2020,1
114,"I'm an artist and a couple years ago, I made an art friend. (over the internet, not real life). I posted about this before in a different subreddit, so I'll just summarize.

Basically this friend has a lot of followers and gets tons of comments on his work, meanwhile I get like 10 likes and 0 comments on anything I post. I started becoming really bitter and jealous of his success. I want to clarify: I did NOT become an artist just to get attention and likes. I do it because I genuinely love it. I just wish other people cared, too.

But wait, there's more! I developed a crush on him not long after we became friends. He's so funny and charming on top of being successful. The problem is, despite us being friends for two years, we haven't really gotten to the part of our friendship where we can really be ourselves around each other. Plus the whole jealous thing really puts a damper on the whole thing.

I'm so torn. He has everything I want as an artist and that infuriates me, but he's also one of the sweetest, most genuine people I know. I want to be closer to him, but I get too nervous to start a conversation. Maybe if I get to know him better, I'll realize he's nothing to be jealous of? Maybe I'll actually be happy for his success and stop being jealous? I'm not sure.

Ever since I deleted my account on the social media site we interacted the most on, I've actually started to get a little better. I don't want to cut him out of my life entirely because he's such a great friend, but if that's what I have to do, then so be it. What should I do?",04May2020,1
115,"The beginning of the year everything seemed to be going great. To my surprise, my advisor pulled some strings, letting me in extra classes so I could graduate in December. Then suddenly COVID-19 hit. I was devastated. This was my senior year. I was heartbroken. But after living with my parents for a couple of months, on top of my job, the stress of classes, and a global pandemic, I‚Äôve had little time to actually care about anything at all.

I‚Äôm the first one to get this close to graduating college in my family. Although I love them, they do not understand the stress college brings. I‚Äôm happy to have a roof over my head, but they don‚Äôt realize how horrible it is not have my own room. My bed is in a hallway between my parents bedroom and younger brothers. I have utterly no privacy. There are literally no doors in this house that I can close so I can get peace in quiet. I‚Äôve had to go in my car for class it was so loud here. On top of this, where I sleep is right above the bathroom. I wake up to people shitting constantly. Today our water also stopped working and I can‚Äôt even shit until tomorrow afternoon. Their house is being foreclosed, so at least we have someplace still?

Living like this, I‚Äôve found it incredibly difficult to do any class work. My energy is simply non existent for schoolwork anymore. It‚Äôs incredibly weird to go on Zoom and listen to lectures in my car and pretend everything‚Äôs okay. And I‚Äôm pretty upset that I have summer classes to do in a couple of days. As if I want to learn about human relations right now?

Working every weekend in a grocery store, I see how customers act firsthand. Ignoring the arrows, going wherever they please, and this past weekend people stopped wearing masks since the state is slowly reopening. At this point they might as well be licking the floor. 

I should be happy, right? I‚Äôm going to be student teaching in the fall and graduate with a BA to teach. Last week my professors dropped a bomb on me and said that if I wanted to teach, I should probably move since I might get discriminated against here for being gay. Okay. Like, what the FUCK? If it was such a bad thing that I was going into teaching because I liked man ass, then why didn‚Äôt anyone fucking warn me before going through FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE?? 

Now my dumb ass has been searching for places that are affordable on art teachers salary and tolerates gay people. I would say my head is about to explode, but honestly I feel deflated instead anymore. It‚Äôs like, why should I try anymore? I‚Äôm 24, most of my friends are married, have kids and their own place. Yet here my dumb ass is sitting here learning about a ‚Äúhealthy community‚Äù while the other dumb asses in my actual community are literally going out having parties. I work in a grocery store. If you‚Äôre fucking buying a 1/2 sheet cake, you‚Äôre NOT socially distancing. Jesus. I have nothing to show for the last four years besides [possibly] a teachers certificate that I probably won‚Äôt ever use because I‚Äôm a fudge packer. If I do student teacher this fall, I will be surrounded by children- AKA germs-R-us. I want to teach high school, but because art teachers teach all ages, I‚Äôve been stuck in elementary for student teaching. Children will literally use you as nose whips. I‚Äôve been stuck in my parents house this whole damn time and more than likely will get killed because Johnny is a fucking germ bag. If I risk my life teaching, could I at least please make more than $30,000 a year?? 

So anyway.. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one, but nothing feels like it really matters anymore. My job. The place I live. My schooling. It all feels blah. Starting to regret going into teaching but I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do. I‚Äôve been looking at places to move to, and I just feel so unmotivated for it all. What the hell can I do with an art teaching degree in this economy? Extra toilet paper? 

Lowkey regretting everything but also not sure what to do. I‚Äôd start an Onlyfans account, but tbh no one wants to see this monstrosity. Any advice anyone would like to give?",04May2020,1
116,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. We have done long distance for 2 months of that, and have lived together for almost 2 months also, after I flew to another state to be with him. He is in the process of looking for another job and has continually expressed his interest in joining the army. I have known of this interest for a while, however it never amounted to anything. 

He is now pretty keen to do something about this interest, and would like to still be with me if he does join. Joining is something that would make him happy and give him fulfilment. I have expressed that if he wants to do it then that is something he should pursue. However I have also said I‚Äôm not sure about what that means for us if he does go away. 

I love my boyfriend so much and I do not want to end the relationship. But practically speaking I am not sure I am cut out for being the partner of someone who is in the army. I enjoy seeing the person I‚Äôm with on a regular basis, or if not seeing them then talking to them. I like the idea of us growing together and continuing our lives together. But with the other person physically not around I don‚Äôt really see how that‚Äôs feasible. Even though I would keep busy with my own job, friends, hobbies etc, it wouldn‚Äôt be the same. I would worry about his safety. If he was away for a long long time I know I would worry he might forget about me. That he might not be the same person when he came back. That he might not come back at all. That he might not want to be with me when he came back and I‚Äôve wasted years of my life waiting for someone. I wouldn‚Äôt want to succumb to missing him and spend my days miserable. 

I am a very loyal partner and I know that I could wait for someone for a long time, but I want to do what‚Äôs best for me, too. I said to my boyfriend if we had been together for years I would have a much easier time reaching a conclusion about what I wanted to do. In all honesty (and it might sound crazy, but if you can‚Äôt say it on reddit then where can you say it) I would rather be married before he went away. Because it‚Äôs commitment, and security, and just a promise that we will both be there at the end no matter what. But I also don‚Äôt want to have a rushed marriage for the wrong reasons. 

I would like for it to work. I would love for it to work. But I‚Äôm just sceptical, based on my own expectations from a relationship, how that could and would work. 

I would like to hear advice from people who have been in a relationship with someone who has joined the army, or if anyone has any positive, negative, realistic insight on this kind of situation, please comment.",04May2020,1
117,"I (F25) live in an apartment complex with admittedly pretty thin walls. I can hear when my neighbors are watching tv and even hear when they are talking at a normal level (sometimes I can even make out words). Stuff like that doesn‚Äôt bother me and I see it as something that comes with living in an apartment and is a small price to pay for cheaper living.  However I am starting to have issues with my neighbors on the right side of me.

Now I have lived in this apartment for a little over a year now. I have spoken to my neighbors as the one on my left is pretty chatty, and the ones on my right goes outside to smoke and I used to be a smoker. I would go outside and run into them every day before work for my morning cigarette and although most the time we would sit in silence we would occasionally have a conversation. They seemed like fairly pleasant people, but also the kind you wouldn‚Äôt want to step on their toes (I once overheard the woman talking to her husband saying if she gets woken up she is a bear). It is a couple, a man and a woman. They are fairly older (I am bad at gauging age but I would say in there fifties). And from what I have gathered the man works at a factory in town and the woman stays at home all day, possibly on unemployment. 

Now I have not had any issues with them whatsoever until about 4 months ago after My now boyfriend moved in. When I first moved in I was dating a guy from the next town over so I would stay 6 out of 7 days a week at his place and after we had broken up I worked 2 jobs so most days I would be gone all day and immediately go to bed as soon as I came home, so there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of noise going on at my apartment at all. When my now boyfriend moved in it relieved a lot of money from me paying the bills so I quit my 2nd job and we are both pretty lucky to have every evening and weekend off. 

Me and my boyfriend watch a lot of tv and play video games. Any time we are home the tv is guaranteed to be on but I am always conscious of the volume. I almost never have it any louder than what is necessary to be able to hear and always make sure to keep it even more quiet after quiet time hits at our complex (9pm).

After a few weeks of me being able to actually live at my apartment instead of just eat and sleep, my boyfriend and I stepped outside to walk to our cars to grab some grub. This was at 12 in the afternoon and as soon as my neighbor heard us leave she came barging outside in her nightgown and yelled ‚ÄúYA‚ÄôLL NEED TO KEEP THAT STEREO DOWN‚Äù I was caught off guard and even looked around us to make sure she was actually talking to us. Right before we  left my boyfriend was listening to music but it was honestly so low I thought he we just playing it on his phone at first. I‚Äôm not sure if this is what was bothering her this time in particular or heard us stepping outside and thought it was a good time to say something about our stereo. I awkwardly just said ‚Äú sorry‚Äù and we got into our car and left because I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say.

After this incident I even rearranged my living room so my tv and stereo were facing the opposite neighbors wall.

This next incidence was maybe 2 weeks later. My boyfriend is in a band as a bassist. It was his first time practicing in the apartment and I admit it was a little loud but nothing unreasonable at all. She banged on the wall connecting our apartments. This was at 4pm and he immediately turned it down.

The third incident was maybe a month later and we were watching a movie. I don‚Äôt remember what time it was exactly but sometime in the evening. It was one of those movies that had the music and sound effects way louder than the voices so I had to constantly manage the volume. This really loud part came on and I guess I didn‚Äôt get to the remote fast enough because She once again banged on the wall to which I immediately turned it down to were me and my boyfriend could barely make out the words.

This last incident happened just today,this is maybe1 and a half to  2 months after the last one. We were watching a movie at 4pm and I admittedly had it a few clicks louder than usual because I was also cooking in the kitchen (which is open to the living room) and it was a little hard to hear with the frying pan sizzling. We‚Äôve had the windows open the last few weeks because the weather has been so nice. In the middle of the movie we hear this voice yelling outside saying ‚ÄúBUY SOME FUCKING HEADPHONES‚Äù and then a door slam. We didn‚Äôt see anyone but it sounded like it was just outside our window and she was probably standing just outside our view. 

My neighbor on the the other side is home a lot and has never once complained. I turn the stereo down as soon as she throws her fit, and the pattern seems to be completely random as we will go weeks without her complaining, and she always complains at reasonable times of the day. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm throwing parties and have loud people over all of the time or even having the stereo super loud.

I am just afraid at this point that they are going to complain to the landlord. My boyfriend thinks we should say something to the landlord first but I‚Äôm not even sure what good it would do. I am afraid to approach the neighbors because I feel like they wouldn‚Äôt even hear what I have to say and just yell at me.

I am not sure what to do at this point, if I was living on my own I would use headphones but it‚Äôs not realistic when you are watching tv together. I have thought about sticking that recording studio foam on the wall but I don‚Äôt think my landlord would appreciate it. I have tried turning the bass down on my stereo but there seems to be no option on the menu or the remote. I have thought about pettily leaving a package outside their door with a pair of earplugs inside. 

And honestly I feel like just every now and then I should be able to have my stereo just a little louder than usual as long as it is a reasonable time!!

TLDR: neighbors are somewhat harassing us about our stereo even though it‚Äôs 99% of the time always at a reasonable volume at a reasonable time of day.",04May2020,1

Long story short... we were really close, I spoke to him everyday,we went on adventures,we always would have each other backs,we shared a lot.

The night after the fight we contacted me to never contact him again, he was very angry.

It's been over a month, I'm thinking about sending an email to apologize to him and tell him what he mean to me,my heart has been broken over this. I know he was mad but I do know I meant something to him (at one time)

I don't believe he will forgive me or actually believe our friendship can be fixed if If I reached out.

I respect when people need their space when they ""say don't talk to me anymore"", But I can't shake this, I know in time things will get better for me, I just feel its something I need to tell him. I know he was hurt and disappointed too .

120,"So, I(18 f) feel like my mom always takes advantage of me being her kid. I have a brother but he is a piece of work and will never do anything for my mom and also has anger issues. my mom generally makes me do everything in the house, generally things that she just doesn't want to do, and will throw a fit if I say I need to do other things.   


Today I got kinda annoyed because she took my pen, which is the only pen which I like to work with, and it annoyed me because she lost hers and was unable to use any other pen. She then wouldn't give it back until I went on this stupid wild goose chase to get her one which she liked. like, I don't understand why she had to take mine, which is the only one I have, instead of going upstairs to get one herself. This also isn't the only time something like this has happened before. Generally, we will all just make food for ourselves, but when my boyfriend was over, we wanted burgers. She has never had an issue with me grilling a burger or a few before, but that day she made me make them for everyone and claimed that ""she had them on the calendar for dinner"" when I can say for a fact that she did not.   
Its always a thing of where she wants me to take care of everything, and then will throw a fit if I don't and say that she's the one who does everything. Even my boyfriend and friends have noticed this, and my bf made a comment saying that it seems as though she just expects me to ""be a housewife and do everything I'm told"" or something along those lines, and my friends also agree that she treats me that way.   


I can't set boundaries with her, because she turns it on me or won't let me talk, and I have no idea what I should do because I feel like I have no respect and am just seen as a slave almost

&gt;don't you know the answer by now?

And in my head I went, ""Woah. HOT."" My question was very random but I assumed she thought I was about to ask her to be my girlfriend, and that her answer was a definite yes. Turns out she was saying ""yes, you can ask me a question"", because she loves when I ask her questions.

I didn't even plan to ask her to be my gf but misinterpreting this made me quite down :/ My brain had already developed a fantasy idea of how it would turn out, with us saying that of course we want to be in a relationship.

I'm wondering now if I should ask her. We only have a date planned so our mutual attraction is in the air but nothing is official, we are technically just friends. I don't wanna move too fast. I have no idea when exactly the date would be, but ideally I would like to see how it goes, hold hands, kiss, whatever, before feeling ready to make things official. I mean, what if we make things official now and then somehow during the date there's no chemistry? Right now there's a *ton* of it. I would hold off but man do I like her and just want to her to be my girlfriend already. Oh, I'm also not sure how she would respond. I don't wanna pressure her.

Should I ask her? If so, how?",04May2020,1

During this pandemic, we know that Amazon is crucial at being an essential workplace. They have taken precaution and safety measures gradually as COVID-19 draws nearer to our state. They've allowed time off without penalties to our accrued time off, and more pay. Still amidst the virus at its worst, starting May 1st, Amazon at my building announced mandatory attendance resuming. This means if you take time off, they will start taking from your accrued time, such as PTO, Vacation, Sick Time, UPT, etc. until eventually you are fired immediately. They're working backwards--they've even issued full-time positions to folks who were part-time. It's still too early during all this whole pandemic. It's still too early to re-open.

136,"So there's a girl  I like. She is under age. She was the one who came up to me and asked for my name and Snapchat. At first, I didn't really thought about her but then slowly and steadily we began talking. And I started to have feelings for her. But then we told each other that we can't be in a relationship because she was underage. Yes,  that was right thing to do. We became close like best friends cuz we couldn't go further than that. Then she got a bf which lasted for about like couple of months. We were still close with each other as we went to same highschool and saw each other frequently. She is in school's basketball and I went to her game frequently. After her breakup, we just didn't talk alot. just forgot about it. Then when the spring break started, I texted her and we began talking again. She told me that she had never actually gotten over her feelings about me. And I still liked her. We started talking again but recently she's been kinda ignoring me. Late replies and all. And I am here waiting for her reply like every five minutes. I open Snapchat and check if she replied.

137,"So I‚Äôm gonna try to make this short. I‚Äôm a bisexual junior in high school, and after ending a relationship because of my quarantine I became pretty heartbroken, so I confided in the only guy who would listen to me at the time, which is a freshman on my swim team. And we really hit it off. I knew he was a kinda nice guy, but as I got to know him he turned out to be so pure and kind. Because of that, we decided to do a little bit of a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù relationship, and started texting and FaceTiming way more often than we did when we were just friends. Which was fun. I really like talking to him and hanging out with him, even if just on FaceTime. But he‚Äôs sending me mixed signals now and I‚Äôm just so confused, so I want to tell you how it‚Äôs been to see if maybe I‚Äôm overreacting or if I‚Äôm right to feel this way. 

It‚Äôs been two weeks since we started this officially, and for the first two days he was basically texting me all day. We FaceTimed basically all day on the third day, but then he suddenly disappears for a day and a half. The day after that he goes back to normal, and we FaceTime all day for two days in a row once more, before he disappears for a whole day again. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been this entire two weeks, and I don‚Äôt know how to feel because he never wants to tell me what‚Äôs going on. We talk about it and he says he‚Äôs busy, has a doctor‚Äôs appointment, classes, etc but he never really gets into it that much. I know he can still gets my messages even while doing all that, so I feel like he sometimes ignores me on purpose.

In his defense, he had his phone taken away and he‚Äôs using an iPad, but I‚Äôm not gonna lie here, it kind of makes me jealous. Because even though we‚Äôre in a casual relationship, I know he‚Äôs kind of ‚Äúplayful‚Äù, if you know what I‚Äôm trying to say. He likes to get online and mess around with other boys and strangers on the internet. And I actually know that on the days he ignores me, he spends it doing that because I can obviously see his snapscore going up whenever he leaves me on delivered. Which is fine to me since we‚Äôre just in a casual relationship. But he never tells me about it, and kinda just says he has a busy schedule some days whenever I ask him about it. 

And that‚Äôs driving me insane. If I text him and he‚Äôs busy doing stuff like that, just tell me you‚Äôll text me later. Don‚Äôt disappear and just not tell me about it. And I know I may sound clingy right now, but it‚Äôs weird because on the other days where we FaceTime a lot, he‚Äôs always so clingy. I try to go, or I try to tell him I‚Äôm gonna be back cuz I need to eat dinner, and he‚Äôs always sad. He never tells me not to go or begs me to stay, but he always becomes pretty down, and will send me messages every thirty minutes or so telling me about how his iPad died and won‚Äôt charge, or how it‚Äôs raining and he‚Äôs scared of thunder, and all that attention-seeking stuff. I‚Äôm not annoyed at that because I know he‚Äôs just a little clingy, and I even think it‚Äôs cute, but where does all this go the next day? When he just disappears, and I know he gets my messages but won‚Äôt open them? 

It‚Äôs just so weird. Why does he suddenly feel like he has to ignore me, and why won‚Äôt he just tell me why? We‚Äôre in a casual relationship, so he knows I‚Äôll be fine with it, especially since I‚Äôm sure he already knows that I know what he‚Äôs doing. So why not just say it? And if he maybe just wants to take a break, why not just take the break during those days when we‚Äôre literally talking all day and we don‚Äôt leave our rooms? Why does he have to disappear for a day or two to take a break? And if he wants to take a whole day or two, why not actually say it, and admit to me what you want to do so I don‚Äôt get left hanging? I mean we‚Äôre in a casual relationship, why the need for all this secrecy?

I just feel hurt and confused, not because of what he‚Äôs doing when he disappears, but because he disappears and gives excuses about why. 

But in his defense today, is one of those days he said he‚Äôll be busy again (and once again I can see his snapscore going up), but this time he still takes the time to snap me and reply every half an hour or so. He even told me once that he‚Äôs going to the store before disappearing for about an hour and a half (his snapscore went crazy so you know what happened), and even though that made me feel better that he at least considered my feelings, I‚Äôm still mad and hurt that he lied. 

So, I guess I want to ask if I‚Äôm overreacting? Am I just smothering him, or am I right, and he should actually be more considerate? Or is it not even that simple? I just feel so bad because he‚Äôs never been in any kind of relationship before, which was why I said we should only do a casual relationship. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally hurt him because no matter what I know he cares for me, but I just I can‚Äôt help the way I feel and want to call him out on his lies. But then that‚Äôll make me look like a bad guy because we‚Äôre just in a casual relationship. 

I guess just feel so confused and really want to hear him speak from his mouth the real reason he disappears after every two or three days of us talking like crazy. I already know what he‚Äôs doing. I just want him to say it.",04May2020,1

142,"TL;DR at the end. Thanks for reading.

So I‚Äôve been dating a person for about 6 months. Everything is genuinely a dream come true, from personality to spirituality we click and bring each other happiness and joy just existing together.

I have exactly one issue within our relationship; a core value of mine. 

My partner has had sex with more than 15 partners. The issue I have isn‚Äôt the sex, it‚Äôs the value system behind the sex. 

My partner would have sex with someone after briefly getting to know them (within one week, no dates, just hanging out). The intention behind the sex and the meaning attributed to its occurrence conflicts with my value system.

I personally cannot be intimate with a partner until feelings have reached a nearly-in-love state. This is a core value of mine. 

I believe sex is an intimate sharing of the true person within each of us. Not only physically but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I‚Äôve had one intimate partner within a long term relationship. 

I considered waiting for marriage, even though I am not religious. It‚Äôs important to me.

Would it bother you if within a relationship, the person you were with had been having mindless sex hookups out of boredom and loneliness with any person that gave them attention; that they liked or felt liked by? 

To clarify, the number of partners was 2 going in to college. It reached 15+ within two years of college. 

I have fears about the longevity of our relationship when my value system around sex is so important and intimate to me and their value system has, by self admission, been meaningless, mindless, just for fun, out of boredom, given away due to low self esteem, been used as a tool to remain interesting to the new partners, and been done within early moments of meeting the new partners, repeatedly. 

My partner had a new sexual partner every 2.2 months on average for 2 years (with non-sex hookups all throughout this time period too). 

None of this aligns with who I am; but they have adamantly claimed that they don‚Äôt see sex the same way now with me; even though just a month before our meeting they had a mindless hookup and we met on tinder. 

I have a lot of questions about all this and I just want to hear other people try to dissect the issue for themselves and provide their 2 cents. Any advice or just general questions would help me. There‚Äôs obviously some details and background left out.

TL;DR

My partner has a sexual history which brings up fear about the longevity of our relationship due to a stark difference in a core value system; sexual intimacy. I see it as extremely important, they seem to have thrown sex to the wind with anyone they had a fling with. This occurred over two years in college, 13 new partners with zero relationships.",04May2020,1
143,"I work for a coffee company and my store open back up this Thursday.

I was FaceTime‚Äôing a co-worker who is an avid sewer. Currently making masks for when I return etc. and was having trouble with certain parts of the blueprint/design. Told him I would be more than happy to make him a mask as a thank you for helping me out. 

Even though he‚Äôs been making his own, I did my own research and now know way more than what I ever wanted too when it comes to weaves, thread counts and the difference between cotton based on the region of the world it grows in. Anyways, based on my findings, I went with a 1000 thread count, pure Egyptian cotton. The design I went with has a slip for a coffee filter. Based on the studies that are currently published a combination of these two items offers 70+ percent effectiveness when compared to a N95 mask. 

Anyways, my co-worker/friend and I are now just chatting and he asks me if I‚Äôm going to make any for the rest of our co-workers. Not all, but some of my co-workers bully me for various reasons. I explained that I have extra masks that I‚Äôll bring with me to work to SHARE if needed, I would not be making any for them to keep and that they could suck my male appendage. 

My co-worker/friend laughed and told them, jokingly, he could if he wanted too. Suddenly the FaceTime call ends and I get a text telling me that I crossed a line and that they need to decompress. I of course apologize immediately (not knowing what line I crossed). Ask for clarification and just get brushed off.   He says it‚Äôs late and that he‚Äôll text me in the morning. I ask if he‚Äôll be ok and wants to talk and get no response. 

This afternoon, out of no where I get this lengthy text from him, to sum up, says that by asking for a sexual favor in exchange for a face mask right before our store reopens crossed a line and that‚Äôs not what friends do. The text keeps going, and ends with how we‚Äôre no longer friends, he doesn‚Äôt want the mask I made for him and I‚Äôm not welcomed anymore in his home and to stay away from his property going forward. 

Of course, I sent him a lengthy text trying to explain everything and clear things up as this was clearly a misunderstanding to say the least and regardless of his decision I would respect his wishes. 

That text was sent over 7 hours ago and read immediately (read receipt). While I imagine he‚Äôs probably processing and mulling over the new information, I wasn‚Äôt even given an acknowledgement that he received the text and would think about it, which isn‚Äôt like him at all. 

So, after that lengthy setup, the million dollar question is... Did I miss something???",04May2020,1
144,"Hi all!

For reference, I'm a college student who is 20. I will be 21 in a few months. My parents are sober after both going through alcoholism themselves. I don't think I am an alcoholic, but this might be useful information.

I've been drinking since I was about 15-16 and it has been a huge part of my social life since. I used to go to a lot of parties, drink on the weekends, all of that. Upon arriving to college, I joined Greek life. It made sense to me, as I wanted to go out and party and have a set group of friends to do it with. Now, I don't drink very often. Not as much as I used to. Especially since as I've gotten older, my body started to react to alcohol differently. My habits have also gotten different when I drink.

Every time I drink, it isn't like I can have one glass of wine and call it a day. I have one glass and I want another, and another, and another. Until I am 2-3 bottles in and drunk. The thing that concerns me is now when I drink, I blackout almost every single time I get drunk. I've done a lot of things I regret when I have been blackout. I've gotten myself in some pretty bad situations as well. I'm not proud of it and my ""hangxiety"" is off the wall the next day. I cry, I lay around, I feel depressed. It is truly awful and I wish I wouldn't forget about that feeling every time I say I'm down to drink again. I have a partner right now who I just say embarrassing things to them when I'm drunk. Nothing terribly embarrassing, but things that are personal that I don't want to share yet. 

I just want to know if I am overanalyzing all of this.. or if I should seriously consider going sober? I am tired of feeling this way.

I know I probably sound silly or stupid. I really just don't have anyone to really turn to for these kinds of things since all of my friends drink. Thank you guys.",04May2020,1

150,"I can't do it, I just can't have a social life I was never ment to have one.

I'm 16, all of my life people have told me im ugly, im annoying, and thay no one likes me, I was especially told that by my big sisters

On my 8th birthday I was diagnosed with type one Diabetes and after I got out (maybe a month or so) of the hospital and when I went back to school, I was isolated. 

What I mean is that during recess (I was in 3rd grade at the time) when I went back to all my ""friends"" acted weird like they only gave small awnsers to my questions about what I had missed when I was gone. And then one short girl who I wasn't friends with told everyone else that they should go play, and when I tried to follow she pushed me out, I tried again and again to be with my supposed friends but she always told me to go away and eventually told me no one likes me. 

After that I spent most of free time either trying to get friends and failing or crying, according to my mom I would come home everyday crying, so when I was in 4th grade she put me in homeschool. I was in homeschool from 4th to the fall half of my 7th grade, when the spring half came I wanted to go to the local middle school (this was when I was living in my home town in CA which doesn't have the best schools) so I got over whelmed and wanted to go back to homeschool. My family moved to a different city in CA and I spent my 7th to my fall half of 9th grade, then my mom started dating, and next thing I knew my mom forced me and my little sister to move to Indiana with her... I think 5th(or maybe 6th) boyfriend at the time.. can't remember if that exact...
Anyways we moved and I started public school. Everything was...okay, the schools system wasn't great but the people there were fine. 

And then summer came when my mom had her 7th(or 8th) boyfriend and we moved... into his makeshift apartment on his parents property. He was a creep and my mom found out after two months being with him. Then she had a small thing right before he next ""boyfriend"" where he was also homeless and we had to stay in his car garage (he's a car mechanic), but the month the school year started we got a house right behind the high school, and of course I had to go. I only had one friend and through that friend I meet a guy who was perfect (no perfect but you get what I mean). I liked him and I was later told by said friend he liked me to, but I was scared to confront him because no one likes me no one ever has and ever will. 

I have a different post about that situation but it didn't end well. He probably hates me now he won't even message me back. No one's ever gonna love me so I give up.

The school like every school I've been to had its... quirks? Issues? They had a requirement that you had to take a speech class in order to graduate, of course I cried when I gave my second speech (the first time i had support so I guess it was fine??) And that after winter break the school changed every students schedule, like if you had science for first period you wouldn't have that same class after winter break. 

And that set something off in my mind, so I decided that I needed just one last break from public school in order to wrap my head around everything, mabye once I go back i can be normal have more friends, give that guy the chance he absolutely deserved. But I couldn't because my mom had us move again into a moble home park in the next town over. Everything broke after that, I can't be normal I can't stay in one place for even a full year I can't do anything. But I went to the local high school, junior year, where pretty much every knew each other from kindergarden or at least before middle school. I tried to make friends and the two people who ""know"" (they probably don't anymore) of my existence dont care they never did.

So now I give up I was never ment to have anything normal if I did then it's been gone and dead for 8 years, after summer I'll be going back to homeschooling and probably kill myself if I ever graduate. Hell even if I don't graduate that same outcome will occur anyways. I'll probably move again by that time if patterns have shown anything but I don't care I don't care anymore I give up

A few months ago my mom was really high and accused me of spying on her and all this crazy shit. She told me she was high and has been injecting cocaine. (A little off topic, but she told me she starting injecting cocaine because of another guy I was close with and she always would comment on how attractive he is and once told me she needed to get an STD test after hanging out with him.)

Anyways, while she was high she admitted to shooting heroin with Jeff. There‚Äôs also been times in the past when he was over and slept in the same bed and the door was locked and one time they went to a show and his stuff was all over the living room and the door was locked again.

I told my mom I feel uncomfortable with her hanging out with my ex who was verbally abusive to me and she just said ‚Äúwell, you talk to your father still and he was abusing me‚Äù which is TOTALLY different. He‚Äôs my dad. Do you have any advice? Should I even talk to her? Thanks!",04May2020,1

154,"Hey all! 

Apologies if this post is a little long but I would like some advice if anyone has some. I‚Äôm currently 20 years old (turning 21 in a few weeks) and have been working full time jobs ever since I was 16 (in customer service/sales and now marketing with Facebook). I graduated high school one year early and have been taking 1-2 classes a semester (with a few one offs) at a community college. I now have about a year of classes towards my associates done, and I‚Äôve come at a crossroads. 

I can either 1) continue with my full time job and classes on the side, and eventually in 4-6 years, get a bachelors. I have tried taking more classes but I don‚Äôt deal well with the workload and prioritize my job over schooling since I have rent/bills to pay. Or 2) I can leave my full time job, live with my parents, and attend GCU (a college I‚Äôve really wanted to go to) and finish my bachelors quicker. I do freelance marketing on the side (which brings in about $150-$300 a month at my current pace, so I could afford the basic bills at that point). 

What are your thoughts? Any input is greatly appreciated.",04May2020,1

158,"My boyfriend and I are currently living together. He and I, in the past two weeks, have been exposed to COVID (I had a severe case and was in and out of the hospital and he was sick as well beforehand). My older brother and him are best friends. My older brother lives alone in an apartment nearby, but has been somewhat trying to self isolate during this pandemic due to his serious heart condition - known as brugada syndrome. If he were to get
sick, he‚Äôd be very high risk for complications. My boyfriend nevertheless has been hanging out with him, and dropping by. He says it‚Äôs because he misses him, but every time he does this I get so terrified and upset. I usually end up panicking and crying that they are increasing the risk of something bad happening to my brother. My brother thinks that because they wear masks together they‚Äôll be fine, but they also smoke together and eat together (so they inevitably take off the mask).

Today my mom noticed there were two puddles on the floor of the pantry but none in the middle I'm assuming it dripped down. My theory is that the pantry or whatever you wanna call it built up moisture and ended up making puddles but my other theory is that it was a ghost just pullin a friendly prank, what do you think",04May2020,1

162,"I (F, 20s) have known my ex (F, 20s) for over a decade. We started off as best friends then became something more after a few years. We were together for six years total. Over that timespan, a lot of good (and a whole lot of bad) happened. She was my first dance and my first female lover. She helped me when I was down (when I felt sad, when I hallucinated, when my mom died, etc). I did the same for her through all of her familial abuse. But our relationship was never really *great*. She refused to tell her parents about me (understandably) so I helped hide everything we did. It made things difficult. Then she cheated on me with a guy coworker. My dumb ass forgave her somehow, and we ended up back together. Once a cheater always a cheater, because she did it again for months behind my back with a guy she's never met in person and who lives in a different state. They're still currently together. We broke up, of course. We decided to remain friends afterward. I got another girlfriend, ten times less problematic than her, and we're still currently together. So that should've been problem solved. Two friends, both in happy relationships with other people. But tonight she did something awful. For context, in May of 2017, my mom went into a psychotic episode of abuse so my dad and my brother, along with me, went to a friend's house until it was safe to come back. We told her where we were going, why, and explicitly reassured her we would be back in a few hours. When we came home we found her hanging in the basement and we knew she died because she had no pulse and there was urine trickling to the floor. We called the police of course, we did CPR as they instructed over the phone, but they confirmed what we all knew when they evaluated the situation.

Fastforward to now. My ex posts a video on her snapchat story that mocked suicidal people, called them toxic, and was overall extremely aggressive towards the mentally ill. You can bet I got on her ass about how insensitive that was. She blew it off and every reply was just ""ok"" before she exited the chat to go tell her boyfriend what I was saying. Her boyfriend holds the same mentality as her so I can only imagine the fuckery they said about it. I removed her chat to cool myself off then posted on a private (venting) story that only my alt could see, saying the following:

""How fucking dare you? You broke me down to an antisocial shell of who I used to be and you post what you did? Mocking how my mom hung herself in my basement when she though my dad was leaving with me and my brother? You didn't even seem sorry. Just annoyed that I dared bring up how fucked up that was. You haven't done anything nice since we broke up. No support, no friendly conversations, just bickering and stupidity. And so much hatred from you that it hurts to see your name in my notifications. We've known eachother since elementary, but now that you've turned into the shallow cheater that you are, what motivation do I have to keep you in my life? You'd better prove yourself. I hope you and your cuck of a fake ass internet boyfriend are happy.""

Needless to say I was blowing off some steam. Now, hear me out. I don't know if I want to cut ties with her. She's my only friend I talk to (besides my gf, obviously, but I mean non-romantically). I'm not exaggerating. I have exactly 0 other people who talk to me, not by my own choice. On top of that, my dad heavily encourages us to stay friends, and I really don't want to let him down. He's been through so much and I don't want him to have to go through his daughter becoming even more of a suicidal outcast. And even moreso, my ex and I have tickets to my favorite band's concert. We're seated right next to eachother. We also both get to MEET THE BAND which is an experience I'll likely never have again. The VIP tickets sold out within minutes. Can you imagine me sitting miserably next to her the entire time if I cut her off but have to see her there? I want one of my happiest experience to be, well, happy. So now I'm torn. There are factors for both sides of the coin and now I'm lost. What do you suggest is the best plan of attack? Maybe some sort of middleground? I need help asap.",04May2020,1
163,"A few months before spring I started working on a shawl I had planned it for months and months and was always talking to everybody about how I‚Äôm gonna make a shawl and have sunflowers embroidered onto it and how exited I was.

For Christmas I got yarn cause at the time I was super into crochet, and I started work on it a little while later. So I started work on it later in December and after along time (around 6 hours) and a ton of weekends and aching hands I was halfway done.

My dad walked into my room at around 10:00 at night and asked what I was doing and after explaining, he told me that what I was making was stupid and how under his watch I‚Äôll never be allowed to wear something stupid like that.

It. Crushed. Me. I cried myself to sleep for a while cause until now I thought they were supportive but he came into my room and said what I loved to do was stupid.

So I stopped that project and didn‚Äôt do any others for a long long time cause they hated what I wanted to do so what‚Äôs the point. This coupled with my sexuality and school contributed to my depression and suicidal thoughts that I had for a long time.

Now tonight we were talking and I brought it up and my dad basically said ‚Äúwow I didn‚Äôt know I said that‚Äù sounds good but then he told me ‚Äúbut I was saying the truth, I‚Äôd never let you leave with some scarf on‚Äù

He and my mother continued to laugh at me and say stuff like ‚Äúthat would be a nice gift for your grandma‚Äù and ‚Äúyou should thank me for stopping you from being bullied‚Äù

At last my dad told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I said that, but again I was doing it to protect you‚Äù I was done with his s*** so I told him ‚Äúoh so what your saying is I‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings but I did nothing wrong so really you should thank me‚Äù

He shut up but kept saying the same thing about how he was sorry but I did it to protect you, I kept saying what I said in my last paragraph and he shut up and changed the subject.

I hate that they laugh at me and call what I like stupid and then are surprised I‚Äôm upset at them, I feel like nothing I do is good enough for them, and that I can‚Äôt do anything. 

I hate being depressed and feeling with like I‚Äôm worthless while they sit in their bed and laugh and talk about how my of a psycho I am.

anyway he reached out later and we talked a little. then we didnt talk for a month. but we started talking again yesterday. everything was cool we were talking about music and playing games. but i went on discord to delete some old conversations and came across our old texts on there. i screenshotted a conversation about music. and said ""this was before i fell in love with his music lol."" and then he randomly says ""just so were clear here for reasons i have a gf now.""

im guessing he said this because our old messages hsd some flirting. but the conversation i sent had nothing to do with that and i wasnt flirting with him at all. so i got annoyed because i felt like he was trying to say i was trying to get with him. because he only said that after i showed the texts about music. was i wrong?",04May2020,1

171,"My little sister is 17 years old. She has a quite strong personality, doesn't take criticism well, and has a bad habit of cutting people off. I have to admit that at times, she can be quite rude and offensive. However, she's a good person overall. I love my sister and because we've always been really close, I know her character well and what things set her off, how to handle her moods. I'm so used to her personality that I understand the mood swings. 

My mum, however, does not. For example, my sister hates physical affection. She's never in her life been touchy/cuddly. She does not hug people (this applies to everyone, even me). She's been like that since she was a wee baby. She's affectionate in the sense that she will tell you how much she loves you, but never physically show you. My mum is the total opposite and takes great offense at this. She gets really angry when my sister squirms out of a hug or kiss. And because I'm an extremely affectionate person, my mum has taken to comparing her to me and kind of prefer me over her. 

My mum and I are very similar in personality and are like best friends. We have very similar priorities and values, and my sister is the opposite of us. Because of this, I know my mum thinks of me as the ""better kid"" because she always complains about my sister to me. She's always putting my sister on a negative light and always gets into fights with her. For example,  my sister tends to listen to music at very loud volumes and kind of zones out when doing so. She can't hear anything when she's wearing her headphones and if you try talking to her, she won't notice you until you step in front of her or touch her. I find this extremely annoying, but I'm used to it and so I don't take offense because I know she doesn't have bad intentions. My mum's blood boils when my sister does this and they ALWAYS fight about it and afterwards, my mum rants about her to me and tells me how bad of a person she is. I am very uncomfortable when she does that. I hate the fact that they have such a sour relationship. They can't stand each other and spending more than 10 minutes together has them fighting for hours. It hurts me a lot because I don't want my sister to resent me and think that I'm the favourite. I've tried to talk to both of them but they never listen. 

I know my sister is also at fault here, but my mum is the one that always starts the fights. How do I stop her from doing that? How do I stop them both from ruining their relationship?",04May2020,1

Though she makes it very clear she does not want to date anyone, but continues to act that way with me. I had decided that I'd be fine with just friends and it was working up until she started not responding to me (we would usually text back and forth for a lot of the day, usually a few messages back and forth every couple hours, now I get about one reply a day) and we'll make plans to hangout and she'll just go to hangout with someone else but continue to say that she misses me and we should hangout. I've decided that I've had enough and that it's just toxic for me to keep trying, my problem is that I still find myself checking my phone and acting like everything's all good. So I guess my question is how do I move on and stop letting her walk over me?

174,"So, I (16M) like to go and chill in this one park and watch the sunset. However, this park is popular and as such many people frequent it, even during quarantine.

176,"TL;DR I want a dog and can afford one but it‚Äôd be a really tight budget. Should I wait?

My mom grew up really poor so she‚Äôs very frugal. Sometimes I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs actually bad to spend money or when it‚Äôs acceptable. Things she thinks are irresponsible include makeup, video games, and clothing. So I grew up being really discouraged from spending. 

I‚Äôm a college student and will graduate in 2022. I‚Äôm moving to a new apartment by myself soon which will be $150 cheaper than my current. 

I think I‚Äôll be pretty lonely and can see a lot of benefit in having a dog. I think it could help a lot with my depression to have a companion and have a responsibility for a dog who‚Äôs dependent on me. I‚Äôve owned dogs before with my parents and I know this will be something that will make me really happy. 

I hate to think that because I‚Äôm likely going to have student debt for the next years that I can‚Äôt get really indulge in anything. I 100% know I can afford a dog since I work in a hospital, so job security or money won‚Äôt be a problem, it‚Äôll just be maybe a little tight. 

More dog/financial details but might be unnecessary:

I want to adopt a greyhound or a dog with similar temperament/energy levels. It will probably be a 70-140 lb dog. From reading online, I expect the monthly food/meds costs to be around $90-$150, in addition to yearly vet visits which could be up to $400. The initial costs like dog bed, cage, leash, etc may be up to $350 I estimate. 

During the summer, I make around $1,400-$1,700 a month and during the school year, I‚Äôll make around $700-900 a month. My parents are likely to cover my rent so my expected monthly expenses during the school year are food and netflix/meds which is around $335.

178,"At a young age I used to look up to my father. He wasn‚Äôt perfect but he tried. We were you‚Äôre typical father son duo not best friends but pretty close to each other and I admired him

As I grew up I started opening eyes to some his flaws. He was selfish, lazy and sometimes an asshole to people ,but it didn‚Äôt matter much to me cause he was my father and I knew that he would always be there for me unconditionally(he wasn‚Äôt).

At 13 we had an argument about me being ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù to my mom (I was 13 and had a little bit of attitude nothing more). We both got into a shouting match that ended with him slamming me on the wall, he was full of rage and I was terrified. My shirt also got ripped in the process.

My dad then stopped speaking to me for a full year after this incident. I felt unloved by my own father wich is a terrible feeling. My confidence was then shattered I started struggling talking to people, I became very insecure, had to deal with depression and severe anxiety. Many of my most important relationships were destroyed due to this and it completely ruined my life completely and destroyed my family.

After a year, I was pretty much pressured into apologizing to him (wich I regret) We were then fine for a while (kind of )on speaking terms but it wasn‚Äôt the same. After a while, I thought about all the pain and mental suffering he made me go through (wich i still go through every single day )and decided to cut him out completely. We still live in the same house but we don‚Äôt ever ever speak and I avoid even being on the same floor as him.

He has made a few attempts at talking to me recently but I‚Äôve rejected it every time. A month ago, he got mad at me for scratching his car wich led to both of us attacking each other and him slamming me on the wall and then putting me on the floor saying he‚Äôd break my neck.

Since not speaking to him(again) I realized what kind of jerk he is: he ignored his 13 year old son who was still young and didn‚Äôt deserve that, he has cheated on his current girlfriend and tried to hide it until she found out, he doesn‚Äôt do any work around his house and just lets his girlfriend do all the work(cooking and cleaning), he is immature, he acts like or situation doesn‚Äôt even phase him and continues to watch his shows go out with friends as if he didn‚Äôt have a problem with his child and there are so many more things about him.

It‚Äôs been five years since the first incident and he is yet to apologize for it or show any remorse. He works a lot of hours every week to put food on the table (like 70 hours) but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me as I don‚Äôt even wanna be alive cause of him so, Am I in the wrong for not forgiving the man who has brought me into this world and what should I do ?",04May2020,1

I wish it hadn‚Äôt taken me so long to reach out in public about this. My little sister (in-law) and I used to be very close. She is a minor and addicted to ‚ÄúXO‚Äôs‚Äù and off and on with crystal meth. Her mother (my in-law) is a frequent user. She recently found the product in her moms dresser, which was such a huge trigger for sober sister that she started using again, because her mom didn‚Äôt care enough again to stop. 
We live about thirty miles apart, and both of her biological parents are users of meth. 
Her half-sister is in federal prison for meth right now. 

I‚Äôve hoped and tried to find her for her mother, resources to help sister, but it seems like nothing is enough to make her fucking try. I called out to every local mental health clinic and got quotes and referrals for her, and her mom didn‚Äôt do a damn thing, not even returning their calls or opening the links I sent. 
I know that right now they‚Äôre both using.

Sister lives currently in a very safe, drug-free, home right now with my father-in-law/not her biological family member but grew up close with (who, I don‚Äôt want to get into this, but is a VERY good person and have experienced this first-hand. This is my partner‚Äôs biological partner).

I need some help. 
I need steps. I can‚Äôt stand the idea of losing another person I love to the drug long-term.
Please help?
How can I get her sober? How can I keep her sober? What, if anything, I do about her mother? 
How can I fund this?",04May2020,1

**tl;dr:**

My next door neighbors, two brothers Jon and Bob (names changed) are in their 70s, and have no local family. Jon had to call an ambulance for Bob yesterday after he fell twice. We‚Äôre now worried about their well being. How can we help?

**Longer Story:**

Jon called 911 yesterday after his brother Bob fell twice. Bob said both legs were numb from the thigh down, painful, and could not stand or walk. EMS tried to get Jon‚Äôs phone number to call with information, but he did not know his or his brother‚Äôs number. Bob was taken to the Emergency Room, and my wife took Jon to be with his brother since they do not have a working vehicle. The Hospital understandably would not let Jon in the Hospital due to covid-19, but were shown a card with information. My wife took a picture of the card, and sat out front with Jon to figure some things out. While sitting out front several things were learned and done. 

1. Wife put her number in Jon‚Äôs phone and made sure he knew how to find it. This way he could contact her if they needed anything.
2. Wife also entered in the info from the hospital card in Jon‚Äôs phone, and wrote it on a piece of paper, saying the first number is the one Jon should call to learn what was happening with his brother.
3. The brothers have a sister out of state, but Jon did not know her number, and thought Bob might know it.
4. Jon mentioned when he had surgery years prior for cancer, the sister was upset that she did not know about the surgery. (It was an outpatient surgery.)
5. The brothers attend a church on Thursday and Sunday, and cannot wait for it to open back up after the virus stuff is over.
6. Jon seemed a little off‚Ä¶. Jon kept trying to give the paper with the hospital information back to my wife, forgetting that the first number was the one he should call in an hour to get info about his brother. As a result, my wife decided to stay with him until he got in touch with the hospital. 

My wife eventually took Jon home so he could find Bob‚Äôs phone. Later that night, Jon asked for a ride back to the hospital as Bob was being discharged. Bob was put in the car, and the three drove home. While trying to get out of the car, Bob fell, but my wife was able to catch him. She had Jon grab a chair and set Bob in it. My wife came to get me, and we had to carry Bob into his house. Over the next hour several things happened and were learned‚Ä¶

1. The hospital discharged Bob after an MRI to the head, legs, and feet. No trouble was found, and he was told that he probably just sat for too long. Bob still couldn‚Äôt move his right leg, and he was in pain.
2. The entryway to the house is a choke point created by a non-operational vehicle and some juniper bushes. Wife and I had to shuffle sideways to carry Bob.
3. The brothers are big hoarders: stuff piled at least knee high in their entire house. Narrow walking ‚Äútrail‚Äù to get around everywhere. There was only a 1-2 foot space leading into Bob's bedroom. All three of us could not fit in at the same time. 
4. Sister has 2 kids. One might be within a 4 hour drive, the brothers didn‚Äôt have any contact info.
5. A nurse will be making a house call in a couple of days. 
6. We put Bob on his bed, the brothers said they would be fine. We got Bob some water, and left them with some of the delivery pizza we had ordered for dinner. 

After 24 hours, we are really worried for our neighbors. The hospital discharged Bob so fast, 3-4 hours, and he was in the hospital alone. We‚Äôre not sure if he was capable of being a good advocate for himself or his healthcare. Without being able to walk, and the issue of hoarding, we are not sure if Bob will even be able to safely go to the bathroom. What we have done so far:

1. Called Jon back today to see how things are going. Bob is still in pain, and says he is not sure where the sister‚Äôs contact info is. They have food and are ok.
2. Called the hospital to see if the sister was listed as next of kin. She was not. Tried to get info on the primary care physician, but since the phone number Jon gave me was not in the system, the person on the phone claimed she could not pull up his information to help, or even have the doctor‚Äôs office contact me.
3. Tried contacting the church to see if anyone is good friend‚Äôs with Jon/Bob. The office is closed due to covid-19, and they have not responded to email yet.

191,"Backstory:
I [23] am feeling lost. I returned home and to study (3rd year) after traveling for nearly a year and then almost immediately everything shut down due to corona-virus. Upon returning home I decided to wait before finding a job while studying as I had a 5 week placement in my trimester and figured it would be to stressful trying to get that much leave off after just starting a new job. My mum also agreed and even suggested I wait 6 months before working (I thought that was extreme) although I would‚Äôve preferred to work after my placement would finished (5 weeks from now).

Everything is still closed, my placement has been canceled (due to Rona) and my parents are now asking me to pay board...
I would have been okay with this however I feel it‚Äôs a little insensitive to demand $80 a fortnight from a full time student who is unemployed. (I‚Äôm trying to get youth allowance but because of the virus I‚Äôve been having the toughest time contacting them). It was brought up to me at the weirdest time as well. Apparently my mum mentioned to my dad that I have been struggling to get onto centrelink and he perceived that as laziness. So he attacked me out of nowhere and gave me no context to his frustrations. Said some thing like: ‚Äúyou have to stop being lazy and get your payments‚Äù, I told him quickly how I‚Äôd been calling periodically for the past two weeks and tried to go into a creature and got turned away. He replied ‚Äúthen try harder‚Äù...

So I asked mum to not speak to him about things I tell her because he didn‚Äôt get the true picture through her and now is mind is set on his opinion of me in this situation. She said he was asking me to hurry up because he wanted me to pay them with my youth allowance. So I felt annoyed as he wasn‚Äôt concerned about me getting screwed over by the government initiative he was concerned he wouldn‚Äôt get any money out of me.

I should also add that my family is middle class and not at all struggling for money. My parents are both essential workers and have continued with working full time. My dad merely has a fear that his kids are squeezing all his money out of him. He often brings up the amount he has spent on school fees and sport/music activities. He gets upset that he had to spend any money on us at all basically... before I went traveling I funded myself the same. I first started working at 14 and juggled 3 jobs in my first year of uni. Ended up burning out and took a break to work and then traveled. (I just went on a tangent).

Issue:
Anyway, they are asking me to pay the same as my brother [27]. Although, I have a boyfriend and spend half of my time (if not more) at his house. My brother always has his AC and desk top computer running and I don‚Äôt have an AC (I have a laptop) and my mum also cooks him dinner every night, I am a vegetarian and cook and buy my own dinners. Also, I do all my own laundry and my mum does his still. So, I just don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair to charge us the same amount.

I was seeing a psychologist before I left and he described my family dynamic as dysfunctional and I always feel (depressed?) super anxious at home and think maybe it would make more sense to just move out. I also think I am just being petty because $80 a fortnight is really not that much compared to real rent costs. But I think I could use this as a good reason to move out without feeling guilty? Obvs wouldn‚Äôt be rude just say like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to take the full leap into adult responsibilities rather than paying board at home‚Äù. 

I guess I am asking for advice on how I should feel? I have about 1 year left of study, should I suck it up and pay my parents. Or move out as soon as I can financially afford it? How can this transition be less scary? I‚Äôm scared to live with a stranger, but feel it would be better then living in loneliness in my family home.",04May2020,1

193,"My (28f) roommate (31m) and I have been living together for almost a year. Before this, we were best friends for quite a few years and share the same friend group.

When it both came time for us to move out and find new places to live, we decided to move in together. He brought his 2 cats (roughly 5yrs old) and I brought my one cat (5yrs old) and adopted a dog (6yrs) a few months ago. Due to quite a few reasons, we are basically no longer friends, although we are still friendly with each other. 

One of the main stressors on our friendship has to do with how he treats his cats - or I guess, how he neglects them. 

I feed his cats, as well as my own pets, every day. I'm the only one who cleans the cat box, and when his cats make some type of mess I'm the one to clean it (one of his cats recently peed on an uncovered wooden plank in our basement that took DAYS to get the smell out), he's constantly changing his cats food without properly transitioning them to a new brand, and the list goes on. He keeps promising that he will take them to the vet, but he still hasn't.

I have issues with all of these things, but also know the cats need to be taken care of and won't let them suffer due to his lack of caring. As much as I do for them, I do have my own to pets that I need to take care of as well and need to think of first.

My biggest concern is that his cats puke EVERY single day, without fail. I know this can be cause of eating too fast, him constantly switching their food, etc. I am also aware this could be caused by ulcers, cancer, diabetes, and other more serious issues. Since we've moved in together I've been trying to get him to take his cats to the vet to get them checked out, but all he says is ""I took them to the vet a few years ago and the vet said it's because they eat too fast"" but has done nothing but put golf balls in their food dishes - which has not helped. I'm concerned about the fact these cats puke every day - on top of being tired of constantly seeing and cleaning up cat puke. I don't have the money to take his cats to the vet myself, and I can't be spending my money on someone else's pets when I need to take care of my own. What do I do to help these cats? As we still have a few months left on our lease and friends in common, I want to do this in the least negative way possible as I don't want him to retaliate against me or my own pets as moving before the lease is up is not an option for me. His cats are solely indoor cats and if anyone was called due to their neglect, he would also know it was me. I don't know what to do, please help!

TL;DR: My roommate neglects his pets and I can't afford to take them to the vet, looking for advice on how to help them in a way my roommate won't retaliate against me or my own pets (ex. rehoming behind his back). Please help!",04May2020,1

197,"My sister, E, was dating this guy, A, for about a year. They were fine for a while I guess, but eventually he became abusive towards her. A cursed my brother out over the phone (which is a whole other story) and my whole family hated him. She dated him after the whole thing with my brother, but the relationship deteriorated and it was on and off again for I don‚Äôt even know how long. During this on/off again phase, he started becoming violent. E only told me that he had sexually assaulted her and on another occasion, he pulled her hair to keep her from leaving a room. The day she told me and my little sister this we both begged her to leave him and not go back because we were genuinely terrified he was going to seriously hurt her. She laughed it off and about two months later, she told our mom that she was going to go to a friends when really she was going to A‚Äôs place. My brother addressed this with my mom asking her if she knew where E was really going. This evolved into a discussion with my brother and his friend cracking all sorts of jokes. I was horrified because I knew what had happened the last time she went over there and my little sister had to leave the room because she was getting emotional. My mom has always had a huge influence on all of my siblings, and after talking with a friend I thought I could tell my mom about the hair thing secretly and she could help my sister get away from this guy. I didn‚Äôt say anything about the sexual assault. When my sister came back home the next day, my mom went off on her saying that no matter what the family did to try to help her she would always go back to him and that she didn‚Äôt trust E anymore because E was making such awful decisions and putting her safety at risk. I didn‚Äôt hear the whole argument, but E knew something was up and she confronted R, my brothers friend(it should be noted that he had feelings for her and would do anything to stay in her good graces). R told her that I started all of this and that I told my mom everything. My sister believed him without a doubt and then E went off on me saying that I‚Äôd humiliated her and that our mom didn‚Äôt trust her anymore because of what I‚Äôd said. Truthfully, my mom and hers relationship had been going south for a while at that point. There‚Äôd been so many times where E tried to leave A but, she always went back to him. My family hated that she always chose A and my mom had been holding back a lot for a long time and I guess she just couldn‚Äôt anymore. This happened around nine months ago and I still feel awful. My sister used to work at my job so she still has a lot of friends where I work. One of her besties is a woman there and there was another girl who had been talking shit about me for a while to the bestie. At that point, I thought that everyone there hated me so I was really insecure. It‚Äôs very hard for me to bond with people and I was trying really hard to bond with the people that were there. One day I was waiting for my dad to pick me up when B(bestie) approached me and asked me why I told my mom what I did. I was shocked because I didn‚Äôt think that she knew about what had happened yet. I told her that I told my mom because I was worried out of my mind and my thirteen year old sister was crying to me every other night because she didn‚Äôt know what to do. I told her that I was done emotionally picking her off the floor only for her to take him back. E would come home and be awful to everyone around her because she would be angry at A and I was done with it. My dad came after that and that was the end of that convo. I tried so hard to fix my reputation after other events there and I felt like all my hard work was going down the drain and now people at my work wouldn‚Äôt trust me. I struggle to make friends and that is a huge blow. I feel like if I think about this then I‚Äôm a hypocrite for expecting her to understand what I did and then hating on her for telling B what I‚Äôd done. My sister has a history of stirring the pot and she‚Äôll tell secrets when she feels like it and I feel like I was being treated unfairly. This whole thing happened a while ago, but recently my sister and I had a ‚Äúconvo‚Äù about this and while I was trying to tell her how I felt about her belittling me all the time, she turned it back on me saying that I broke her trust and how I was awful and she would never trust me again. I was already feeling shitty and I just couldn‚Äôt stop crying after that. I feel so much resentment and I want to get over this because she used to be one of my best friends and now I feel a lump in my throat whenever she enters the same room as me.

I (20m) was in a relationship with a (19f) and it was great for almost an entire year. Honestly it was such a pure happy relationship with very few problems. I should mention that she attended a college close to my home so I could visit her often during the school year, and we live in walking distance of each other when we both are home. 

&amp;#x200B;

She transferred to a school much further away last semester and we couldn't handle being apart from each other, and we broke up. For no other reason did we break up other than the distance. However, due to the corona-virus, we're both back home. We've been hanging out again and it's quite clear we still have feelings for each other although we've done nothing but hug. I know that next semester or the semester after we will all probably be going back to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very lost and unsure if I should even broach the subject of dating again or if its not worth it because breaking up would be inevitable (hi Thanos) when we go back to school.

Hey there I‚Äôm from BC. Just finishing up high school and I want to get into the Heavy Duty Mechanic field. I‚Äôve been researching this job for the past 3 months now and I know this is the field I‚Äôve made my decision on pursuing now. I have no previous experience in this field at all but I have a great interest in this trade and have a strong work ethic and I‚Äôm eager to learn/work. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak I‚Äôm thinking of trying to avoid any foundations programs offered at VCC/BCIT etc. because I don‚Äôt want to lose any money if I enrol in a program that may stop part way through. BCIT has already said that they aren‚Äôt going to be refunding or partially refunding any of the money you put into these programs so I‚Äôm assuming most of the other colleges and post secondary institutions won‚Äôt be doing the same either. So as of right now I would possibly like to get into this field as an apprentice. 

Please let me know if:

You know of any companies offering apprenticeships to no one with previous experience 

Have any contacts to someone/company looking for an apprentice 

Companies who are partnered with HD Mechanic schools

208,"I left my boyfriend after he screamed at me to leave for the last time. I got sick of it. I am tired of living in anxiety and fighting and stress. It‚Äôs awful. He tells me he treats me like shit because it‚Äôs my fault and I deserve it. He‚Äôs lashed out at me, screamed at me, thrown things at me, etc.He tells me I owe him to clean the house and be a housewife basically. (Even when I‚Äôve paid equal rent). Anyways, I decided to leave because we were fighting (he decided to get high before driving and hide it from me then proceed to tell me it‚Äôs my fault why he‚Äôs getting high) It‚Äôs 10pm now, I currently have my bags packed and I‚Äôm in my car. I just turned 20 years old, and I‚Äôm currently in nursing school at a community college. I have not been able to work the past couple months due to Covid-19. I can not afford rent in Colorado, it‚Äôs absolutely outrageous. I was paying my boyfriend $400 a month rent, and I cannot even find a bedroom in someone‚Äôs house for that. My parents house is an option, but I grew up with a lot of chaos and abuse there. I have gotten pneumonia from their house being mold infested. (They have dogs and cats that shit all over the house and they don‚Äôt clean it up.) the house is covered by trash, things are broken, windows missing, etc. I do have friends, but most of them have no room for me to stay, and even then, not long term.

214,"okay that was a little exaggerated, but since my family isn't doing anything about it, here i am.

so, my dog (1 year old) koda is a bichon frise/shih tzu mix, and he's extremely aggressive.
by that, i mean the kind of vicious that people THINK pitbulls are like, when‚Äîin fact‚Äîtheyre angels.

koda bites 24/7, and even breaks skin, sometimes really badly. i have a scar on my face from when he jumped me for no reason. i have scars on my ankles, thighs, and arms from him as well. he also punctured the groomers hand while he was getting a haircut. since then, we had to learn to give koda haircuts on our own because we arent allowed back there with him (we dont have many pet groomers in our area).

we saw a trainer once, and nobody bothered to contact her again after we tried some training methods (which they all failed).

sometimes i think that maybe theres something mentally or physically wrong with him. but it seems there isnt, besides separation anxiety. we‚Äôve gone to the vet, and even got prescribed calming pills for him, and it works for a while, yes, but i am so scared to touch him, even when the pill kicks in.

and i dont think it has anything to do with the environment, we were very careful with that kind of stuff. although, 5/6 of the household suffer from depression and anxiety, so perhaps that made an impact on him?

idk yall, i just want to cuddle him and give him belly rubs without being scared that he‚Äôll snap at me.

so, please, if you might know why hes so aggressive, or know a training method that might work, tell me.

I don‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time with a long story so I‚Äôll keep it sort (if you need more info, just ask) I (27m) am graduating with my bachelors at the end of May. I took a hiatus for family reasons for 4 years and just went back and finished my degree(accounting).

I received an offer from a local company that offered $4k more that was I was making before I went back to college. The job sounds quite boring but is more of a professional type of position compared to my previous employment. I also have the opportunity to go back to my old company and old job and work there. It is labor work but with a great company that offers great benefits and plenty of room for growth.

My question is, should I accept this job with the smaller company that I doubt I will like with little rom for growth? Or go back to my old job where I know I am good at but is completely out of my field of study, with hopes to move up into the corporate office?

Can anyone speak from experience? If anyone needs clarification, please let me know.",04May2020,1
217,"I have a friend who told me they wanted ""space"" in our friendship. Nearly 8 weeks have passed since and I have barely said a word to her. Her birthday is soon and I am conflicted on if I wish her a happy birthday or not. 

For brief context, I was asking her if something was wrong. She simply told me she wanted space. I have not been removed or blocked from any social media we have in common and can still she her posts and all. But I was removed from her private snapchat story and ended our streak. We are University students. Our contact since the 8 weeks has been brief in common group chats and all, but I have been quiet in all of them. We do have common friends as well. 

I feel she is using the Quarantine as a way to ensure this space. Since we are University students, I will see her again in the fall since we are in clubs and share the same friends. This little worry has been stressing me a lot. I'm certain I am making a big deal out of nothing. 

I also sit torn if I should just cut her out of my life or if I should give her one last chance. She has cut me out before but it was brief, just a few days. I don't really want to waste my time on someone who can not exactly be trusted after all this. But I am not sure if she deserves one last chance either. She has had some shit happen in her life that did not impact me, but she was telling it to our common friends and I only figured it out from context clues. Just thinking about her makes me angry I wasted months of friendship on her.

222,"Hi. I needed to talk about my problems somewhere and I wasn‚Äôt sure who to talk to. If you don‚Äôt care then that‚Äôs ok, memes are nice. Anyways, I‚Äôll explain the months before my decision to leave the house my mother and stepfather (and little brother) were in. So they (the adults) began to not get along soon after they got married, money was a big issue. My mother used to work a lot because she was a single mom with four kids and all were needy at the time, let‚Äôs call my mother Jackie. Let‚Äôs also call my previous stepdad George. George worked all day everyday, he was pretty wealthy but very cheap, he never bought us anything, he spent his money on watches and clothing mostly. My mother and him verbally fought very often, I was aware it wasn‚Äôt a healthy relationship they had but my brother (who was 2 years old when he met George) began to think this was normal, he saw George as a dad because his actual dad was out of the picture. Jackie was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety about three years ago. The pills she took caused her to have a huge change in personality, she began to sleep more and work less. George just said she was faking it all and she was a lazy bum who only loved him for his money. Jackie had worked before she met him, every single day she would be doing some kind of job to support her kids. George began to act really rude to not only her, but my brother and I as well. That‚Äôs enough backstory. About two months ago Jackie had put some raw chicken in a pan to cook, but she had to pick up George‚Äôs nephew. She put the stove on simmer while I was in the kitchen watching a video on YouTube. George was washing his car and came in while Jackie was biking to get George‚Äôs nephew (the bike ride was less than a mile to and from the house.) George came in very mad about the stove being left on, he called Jackie stupid and asked me if he was correct. I pretended to not hear him because I didn‚Äôt want him to yell at me or get more mad. After she came back, she immediately asked me if he said anything mean to me. That is what point they were at in the relationship, no trust. I told her exactly what I heard. She wanted to confront him but I was scared he would do something. He called me a liar and other rude names while I was in the room. I left the room and called my aunt to pick me up. The next day, my mother and brother also left. Jackie went to her friends house, and my brother went to my sisters house. My brother has been seeing George because he thinks that‚Äôs his father, my mother seems to not know what to do since she‚Äôs bringing him. My entire family disagrees with what shes doing. I do as well, how should we go about removing the relationship between George and my brother? It‚Äôs all so confusing to him and I don‚Äôt want him to be this way anymore.

disclaimer: english is not my first language so please excuse my mistakes

To make a long story short my mom and dad had me and lived a happy life, when I was around 2 he got incarcerated to save his best friend from a life sentence lol. My dad was basically living a double life and as soon as he got caught my mom could not believe she had been so dumb for not having realized before. My mother was furious and I would only speak to my dad on the phone or through letters, we never visited him. When I was around 4 my mom met my now step dad, I grew up with him and although we never had a relationship as the one a father and daughter would I do refer to him as my father when talking about him with other people (never called him dad tho). I grew up with my step dad and as time went by my siblings were born. I had a pretty normal life hearing from my father every once in a while, but that was it, I was never told where he is, if he is already out or how many years of sentence he has left.

Today I turned 18 and I received a call from my dad like every other year, the thing is he told me I HAVE A BROTHER of whom my mother does not know about, he is 27 years old and my dad brought this up because I decided to major in the same thing as my brother did. I believe my dad did not give me the news the right way or appropriately(?

I feel very confused, or lost idrk. Also I am really curious as I want to know more about my new brother, however I do feel as I am keeping a secret from my mom. I am really close to her, however, the dad subject has always been a bit of weird and difficult to talk about.

I need advice or comments from a different perspective and this is the place from where I believe I can get some. My friends don‚Äôt know this about me and I really don‚Äôt feel like telling them this whole story yet.

Every comment and view on the matter is appreciated.

227,"Hello, I have this friend that I go to school with (obviously not now becuase of quarantine). Me and him have been friends ever since 2nd grade. He was one of my first true friends. In the 6th grade, me and him didn't really talk because of class separation, but in 7th grade we started talking again, and we became good friends again. Even since then, I have sat at lunch with him, and talked to him a lot. But honestly, over the past few years, I realized I'm not happy when I'm around him. Just for backround, he has aspergers, which is perfectly fine, it's just that he has some behavioral issues. He rambles on and on about the same thing whem we talk for days on end, and he's a little arrogant as well. Also, a lot of the time he always wants to know what I'm doing, where I'm at, for how long, and it's just getting annoying and tiring.

Now, I have this other friend as well. Me and him have been friends since 3rd grade. He used to be friends with my other friend, but then separated in 5th grade, leaving me in the middle a little bit. In middle school my other friend introduced me to some friends of his, and we all became great friends.

The thing is, my other friend is a person I'm happy to be around, a person to talk to and a person I can tell secrets to. A person I'm glad to be friends with. With my other friend, I'm just not happy to be around him, and I don't really relate to him anymore.

Now, it's hard to tell him these things straight because I'm kind of the only thing he has right now. Nobody really wants to be friends with him, and it's kind of sad. His parents are also going through a divorce, and I want to be there for sympathy, as I also know what parents divorcing feels like as well.

So, overall, I don't know what to do. I'm not happy when I'm with him or talk to him, and I have other friends. Yet, I'm kind of his only best friend according to him, and his parents are divorcing, and I want to help him through it. I just don't want to be stuck in this wedge like this. Any advice?

232,Hi everybody am a 15 year old guy who cannot trust anyone. It started about 1 year where this one girl asked me out now I had asked her friends if she was being serious and they all said yes so I booked reservations for a restaurant for her. Turns out it was all bullshit.(now this was more a smalIer reason but that‚Äôs where this started) I make a lot of money compared to other kids my age (they make about 11$ per hour) the main reason is because I work at a bakery that my dad owns and I‚Äôve been working for a long (my dad started teaching how to work there when I was 10) so he pays me a lot more then other kids in my age. That has made me the target of people useing for money by begging me or being my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to buy them stuff and when I say no the people started treating me like shit telling people lies about me. I had to learn martial arts because people started trying to rob me. The time when ALL trust was lost for everyone but one person was when people started telling that this girl had a crush on me. I believed it so SHE ends up asking me out. Well guess fucking what 3 minutes later she dumps me because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have brown hair‚Äù everyone laughed and treated me like completely fucking shit. After this I thoughts about suicide and even wrote a suicide note however I decided that suicide would not be a good idea as am very good at playing guitar and I am very good at chemistry.

237,"You're aware that throughout your life, whenever you start doing something and actually get good at it, you start feeling bored and your mind starts to come up with very logical arguments to drop it and start something new, more challenging. It's not an urge to procrastinate, because you always drop this thing and immediately start the new thing. You don't rest. Moreover, sometimes these things you drop entirely can even be video games and not just a school subject, a sport or something serious. I remember as a kid when I used to regularly create new accounts to start all over again in video games after reaching a specific level to ""start right this time and apply my knowledge better"". Another example is when I stopped weight lifting as a teenager after 3 years of dedication, because suddenly I felt like it wasn't for me, so I stopped it altogether, even stopped pursuing being an athlete and started doing other sports but as a hobby instead, just for my health and well-being.  


I'm asking this, because I am going through something similar again. I have been studying web development since last July and I have been very productive, determined and serious. I have wanted to be a programmer for a long time, mainly because I genuinely enjoyed solving problems as a kid, especially mathematical ones. Web development was everyone's advice when I started and I knew nothing so I went with it. Now that I know my way around the field to an extent, after a ton of progress and dedicated hours, I am having the same feeling again. I feel like it's not fulfilling, not what I wanted to do. I mainly sticked with it, because it seemed like an obvious choice back then and it's everywhere in the job market, but I wanted to be a programmer to do what I love, not to just get a high-paying job.  


As usual, I am coming up with hard-to-ignore, logical arguments to convince myself to drop the whole thing and start all over again with another programming- or cs-related field, but I just don't want to mess up again and waste months of effort, or even years like I did at some point in my life before. Is it sabotaging to keep experimenting like this? Should I believe my arguments this time and drop web development, experiment with other fields instead and stick with whatever feels right to me? Or stick with it and ignore my thoughts this time, until I get a job in the field and then decide?",04May2020,1

240,"I just recently moved with my boyfriend back to his home state. For a year he we were long distance and for two years he lived in my home state with me. While we were long distance his brother had a girlfriend who he clearly was extremely close with. They‚Äôd hang out when his brother and her would break up. When I‚Äôd visit he‚Äôd die laughing and joke with her in front of me and kind of ignore me almost. Either way I might of just been high and uncomfortable, but it just rubbed me the wrong way. 

When he moved in with me they talked all the time and when we‚Äôd fight they‚Äôd talk shit about me. Mainly just him venting and her calling me a bitch, but I mean he‚Äôs her friend so I‚Äôm not that angry she didn‚Äôt really know me. I saw messages of him calling me jealous and telling her how good of a person she was. 

Now I live here and didn‚Äôt find out they were dating again until 2 days after the move. Which put me in a really shitty spot mentally. I was struggling bc I moved states and here I am living with his brother and that girl and I know my boyfriend has vented and told them shitty things about me over the years when we went through some hard times. While I was clearly struggling he just kept making comments about how goofy she is and how she‚Äôs so nice she‚Äôd hang out with me whenever and at the same time was kind of making comments about me being bored or too angry all the time &amp; it just spiraled me into  depression.

Now I really like the girl, she‚Äôs honestly one of my best friends, but I have a sort of weird resentment towards her bc my boyfriend clearly thinks more of her than he ever would of me and she truly is such a bubbly, sweet, giving person. She is always making sure everyone is happy &amp; it‚Äôs just spiraling me even more. I‚Äôm so depressed and my mind races 24/7 thinking about how these people perceive me and how I‚Äôm just a shitty person &amp; every time my boyfriend and I fight I lose him bc I know they can hear and I feel like I always look like the bad guy bc of things he‚Äôs told them and bc he‚Äôs generally more ‚Äúhappy‚Äù than I am. 

Basically to make it short my boyfriend is just pointing out how obviously great she is. She‚Äôs like sunshine and rainbows 24/7.

241,"(Kinda long, sorry)

The title essentially depicts the short of my concern. I'm 24 M for reference and I'm in an early-ish stage relationship with a girl I met online before the pandemic ensued. We liked a lot of the same stuff, spent lots of time together, yada yada, I wanted to see where it went.

I was initially, truthfully enjoying the time together. We were both very pragmatic about our expectations. We could make each other laugh. Finding things to do was easy.

But over the past few months of social distancing (and the distance, I don't think, is the sole reason for this), I've been slowly falling out of it all. And it's mainly little things adding up to a ""she's-not-the-one-for-me"" conclusion. Sometimes it's something small but frequent, like struggling to keep up a conversation. Or there's the truth of how our family and friends are polar opposites. But a lot of other times it's honestly just getting bummed out all the time by what she goes through mentally. 

Now please bare with me, I try my absolute best to be as sympathetic as I possibly can to everyone; I listen, I'll give my advice, etc. I have many close friends who have gone through all kinds of shit. But I'm also struggling trying to reconcile this with accepting that I don't have an obligation to be with someone if I don't feel it's right for me.

What makes this even harder is that she says things like ""it really is wonderful that I met you, I'm so glad I have a friend I can talk to after moving here,"" or, ""I thought about you all day and I miss you like crazy."" She really paints it like I've been one of a few outlets for her during a difficult time in her life.

It's not been that long of a relationship; I don't feel I've been ""leading her on"" because I've truly been using the time to get to know her and determine if I thought we'd be good together. I know I have to break this off if I feel this way, I just will feel terrible knowing the negative repercussions will be far greater for her than they will for me.

Does anyone have any advice on how I might approach this? I do care about her and I don't want to hurt her but that's the same reason I'm needing to do this now. She went though a year-long dark period after her last break-up (granted, it was a long relationship, but still), I hope that she won't have to relapse into something similar.

Anything is appreciated, thanks~",04May2020,1
242,"So let me start off by saying my dad is by far not the worst father in the world and genuinely cares about my brothers, my mom, and I, providing for us and everything. That being said, I can‚Äôt help but feel like the growing resentment that I‚Äôve been building up towards him has turned into straight up hatred to the point where he is the motivation for me wanting to move out.

To start off we are both pretty far apart on the political spectrum, me being very far left and him being very far right. Whenever I‚Äôm hanging out with my family he will start blasting far right conspiracy videos or Fox News on the tv and it‚Äôs my immediate cue to go to my room because I can‚Äôt listen to that stuff without getting unreasonably pissed off. He knows I does this but still watches them all day, every day. I mean literally everyday, we have a summer business, so the only time he isn‚Äôt watching that stuff is during the season (which he plans on opening despite the pandemic because y'know, of course he is). I really enjoy the days he decides to sleep for long periods of time or is out buying stuff, which I feel pretty guilty about, but I can‚Äôt really help it. Hearing him wake up, drive into the driveway, or just start speaking in general fills me with so much dread.

It‚Äôs not just the politics though, his personality irks me to god awful amounts. He goes out of his way to do things for us as a gesture of love and will get immediately upset if we don‚Äôt respond with pure enthusiasm. He will throw shit and guilt us while saying things like ‚ÄúKay fuck it, don‚Äôt know why I try‚Äù because we don‚Äôt eat all of his really horribly made food (like eggs with a puddle of water underneath it that I almost got kicked out of a group chat for posting) or make use of whatever instrument or weird bicycle he buys at the pawn shop. He never cares about our interests or anything anyone has to say. He will spend HOURS talking to you without you having to say a single goddamn thing and even if you do manage to get out an interrupted statement he will either barely acknowledge it or straight up ignore it. I used to try to shape my interests towards the things he talked about, but even then he barely cared so I gave up on that. 

I remember when I was little he used to tell me a story about how he did this grand amazing gesture for one of his ex wives, i don‚Äôt remember what it was exactly other than it was expensive and grand, and her only reaction was ‚Äúyou did this for you, not me.‚Äù I used to think that lady was such a huge bitch, but now looking back on it as a 20 year old I completely get what she meant, it really feels like he just does this stuff for anyone but himself.

Onto the least trivial reason, my oldest brother committed suicide before I was born which really messed up my dad. This is why when I started feeling depressed he responded with anger and guilting. My school made him take me to a hospital for screening (or else the state would take me away)  after I said something along the lines of ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to exist anymore‚Äù to my counselor. On the way to the hospital he was sobbing and screaming at me about how shitty his childhood was compared to mine, how hard he tries, and how he can‚Äôt go through this a second time. There was another time where he reacted to me being depressed with getting drunk and passing out in our garage with a hand gun. These are some of the most traumatizing moments of my life and it‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt tell my parents anything. The worst part is my little brother has also been feeling really depressed and my dad‚Äôs been having the same reaction. He‚Äôs been convincing my brother not to tell mental health professionals anything about being suicidal because of his fear of the state taking him away and now my brother sort of just stews in misery and doesn‚Äôt tell any adult anything. 

The reason I‚Äôve been feeling so guilty about my hatred towards him despite his obviously horrible parenting skills is because of how much it really seems like he tries and cares for us.  If I end up yelling at him over something after being more aggravated then usual he ends up sad and crying on the couch. I think he wants me to spend more time with him and feels really lonely, but i genuinely can‚Äôt, his personality makes me so aggravated. I may also blame way too much of the bad shit in my life on him instead of myself. I feel really isolated from my family sometimes and I can‚Äôt help but feel like my relationship with them would be so much better if he just wasn‚Äôt in the living room blasting political bs or making things political when they don‚Äôt need to be. The only place I can‚Äôt hear that stuff is in my room while listening to music because we live in a really small house and I have the room farthest from the living room. I don‚Äôt like people going inside here because it‚Äôs a typical messy depressed person‚Äôs bedroom, so the only time I interact with my family is when he‚Äôs not around. I feel immensely guilty about having these thoughts, but a lot of the time I feel like my life would be nicer if he wasn‚Äôt here.",04May2020,1
243,I just wanted to say that I find it annoying that some people are reaching out to people they would never talk to in a million years just because quarantine is happening. I think this time period has made me realize that my self worth of not throwing myself at every possible person I could try to have sex with and working on my mental stability when it is thrown out of wack because of this has been more important. This time has just really shown me that there is a fine line with self worth and some people can really cross some that shouldn‚Äôt have ever been crossed just for personal need. I hope I‚Äôm not coming off as narcissistic but it really bothers me that people don‚Äôt look at the whole picture that you shouldn‚Äôt just do this shit because a pandemic has made it easier; you should actually care to not fuck around all the time with other people‚Äôs feelings.,04May2020,1

245,"Advice Needed!

I‚Äôm trying to decide between two places to move. 

My lease is up May 31st and I was in a tight spot with money before a recent job offer, and I had a friend who recently bought an old house. The house is small and not very functional, the kitchen has a washer and dryer in the middle of it, no counter space, the bathroom is gross, but he offered me a place to stay for free, just pay half utilities. My two main concerns are one, there was mold in the bathroom and bedroom that was just sprayed with bleach and painted over, and two that he has a habit of inviting a ton of random people over and being very intrusive. He‚Äôs also never had a roommate and is still in college. However, he offered me this when I thought my only option was to move back in with my parents. A genuinely good guy, but I‚Äôm worried since I‚Äôm rent free I‚Äôd be used as kind of a maid in the house. I don‚Äôt want to pick up behind a grown man. 

2 of my other friends have a room for $400 a month plus $50 utilities that is a newer home with modern amenities and is clean and they offered me the room. The house has no issues, and both guys work full time and are generally quiet respectful people. 

I‚Äôm stuck because although finances would be better with the first, the quality of life would be better at the second. I just don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful because the offer of me moving in rent free is huge and I am so appreciative at that opportunity.",04May2020,1
246,"I'm so sorry, I had no idea where else to post this but I need a lot of help...I had an awful dream last night.

I was friends with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, my dream took place on April 20th, 1999 at Columbine High School. Its scaring me so much because I've barely ever thought of this event in my life.

In the dream, they began doing what they did and I watched from the window of a closed classroom door, but instead of committing s*icide, they were swormed by a S.W.A.T team and dragged away, disarmed. Their eyes were full of fear and they were screaming for me to come help them, it was awful. 

Later in the dream, it was years later and they were serving life in prison and I got to go and see them, they were so happy to see me. 

I'm writing this around 12 o'clock but all day I couldn't get that out of my head, I've been trying to distract myself but I couldn't. I've been trying to see if I had an connection to the victims that would make me feel this way or if there was anything that I was missing. I also watched the TEDTalk made three years ago about Dylan Klebold's mother finally opening up about what her son had done and I feel so bad for this woman because people are blaming her. 

I dont know why I had this dream, I've never thought any violent thoughts like that, much less being a school shooter. I hope it wasn't my brain giving me a sign that something bad will happen when I go back to school.

264,"Sigh...been trying to help my friend - Bluebell - through this. I'm at my wit's end and my friend is too. She doesn't know how to help her niece who's terrified out of her mind about her parents fighting and is being mentally scarred, but hasn't been able to get through to Bluebell--nor Bluebell to her. 

I'll code everyone under names and see if this isn't buried so please don't mind them!

So...

* Bluebell has an oldest brother called Red; he is...not a good guy, he sexually assaulted and perhaps even raped his younger brother--17 and 13 retrospectively...I wish I were kidding. He was never tried for this in the court of law as their mother, Purple, wanted to ""keep the family together""
* Red ended up going on to marry Yellow; Orange is born. She's 10 as of now 
* Bluebell and Orange used to be great friends, but overtime her mother has increasingly started isolating her from everyone. 
* Yellow is emotionally disturbed due to being abused in her past, possibly bipolar. I don't know about narcissism
* Over the years increasingly has become manipulative and emotionally abusive towards everyone
* Yellow will spam paragraphs basically screaming at Bluebell for not ""caring about her niece and never calling or texting"". Bluebell has called and texted - as I've seen screenshots of - **dozens upon dozens of times to all three people in that house...no one picks up.** Yellow also been deleting evidence of these calls and texts, according to the very, very rare time Bluebell actually got through to her niece and her niece said that it's been over a year since she saw a text from Bluebell...Bluebell has been texting her on and off for **months** and confirms she hears phone calls that her mom doesn't pick up constantly
* Basically a huge part of it seems to be trying to get Bluebell to have an emotional reaction--at least that's her theory. Yellow is constantly feeling ignored, alone, and seems to enjoy when people get upset over her or feel pain over her daughter seemingly
* Yellow is in charge of her husband's and daughter's phones, obsessively controls everything her daughter sees. Bluebell is maybe able to get through to her niece once every few months
* Yellow seems ultra-paranoid about certain things, like Orange finding out about why she's not allowed to talk to her grandma anymore (her grandma stole some money from Yellow) and has threatened to cut off my friend and Purple just because Purple said to Orange once after asking, ""why can't I talk to grammy anymore?"", ""well, your mom has her reasons."" to which Yellow went batshit crazy with threats and venom because she doesn't want Orange to ask about it. I'm assuming this is the case with many other things as well; isolation, trying to keep Orange from being exposed to anyone else, etc. 
* When asked Yellow usually comes up with excuses why no one can talk to her husband or daughter--that's the rare time she does actually pick up the phone
* Orange - which tbh I'm still shocked that she noticed - fears that her father has an alcoholism problem
* She has seen her father try choking her mother during a fight, this violence has been happening more and more
* **Orange still has begged Bluebell to not tell anyone about this stuff--that it's her worst fear to be taken away**
* I don't think my friend nor her mom would ever be able to get custody; they live in a trailer...and have bed bugs. Ouch
* Also, Bluebell lives states away from her niece. Double ouch

Seems like Bluebell is sympathetic and says that even if she was in a home where she was directly abused by her father - attacked and beaten - it was more traumatizing to her to be taken away. 

So...yes. That's it. I'm tired and I'm not sure how to help my friend help her niece. Apparently therapy is a possibility for the parents, but as of now Yellow is being ridiculously obstinate and Red being off in cloud cuckoo land and a deeply fucked up person as well, I'm not really sure how Bluebell might approach encouraging them to go to therapy. At this point it's like they need to be enforced by someone. 

I ask now because Orange actually JUST saw the choking incident for the first time after things have been escalating for a while a few weeks ago during a very, very rare allowed call so...yeah, things have gotten worse. I hope I said things clearly enough. I'm so afraid of this being buried. I want to help my friend.",04May2020,1

266,"when i was 14 i fell in love with a guy in my class. we were very close , we would wait for eachother after each class when the bell rang we already knew we had to wait for eachother .he was really sweet with me (this lasted for only 2 years.) i never dated before and he was the first guy that didn't see me as just a fat girl. he would tease me alot and so did i but he never teased me about my weight or never did he say i was ugly. all of our classmates would say things like oh you two should date and he wouldn't respond. he got bullied alot by evryone because they all said he was ugly i always defended him and even lost friends because of how blinded i was by love . my friends would say hes not a good guy i didn't see that because with me he was different .i fell madly in love with him but i never told him.one day he asked me if the rumors were true because i told this girl about my feelings for him but she told him( i know it'a her because he told me it was her ) .i was so scared to be rejected that i said well i loved you but now my feelings are gone. he continued talking to me and things were like before. months after he started hanging with people who were bad influences and thats when it all went down . because at the end he started to become distant and i thought to myself like he's probably tired today and doesn't feel like talking to anyone but no.he was already talking to one of my friends ( she even knew that i loved him ) i remember one day i was sick and didn't go to school and when school ended i had messages from all my friends saying that he declares in class that he was dating this girl . that really broke me and i stopped talking to him. the two only lasted 5 months. after he broke up with her because she cheated on him he came to me and was talking like nothing happened but when he was dating her we never talked so i screamed at him i said dont come and talk to me now that you have no one and he say wow you changed why are you so mean i never knew you like that and i said the girl you knew is in the past. today since it's been 2 years and i can't stop thinking about him i tried getting to know other guys but i just can't i guess i still love him ... i know it may sound dramatic so please don't judge it's just that i've never been appreciated by a guy like i was with him and now i don't have him anymore and i really miss him and i got all of this memories that won't go it keeps haunting me i need someone to tell me what to do why can't i forget him ! when i open up to my friends they all judge me because they say i'm a drama queen and it wasn't love cuz we never kissed or had sex or even dated but i know my feelings and i know i loved him and still love him i guess ... :(",04May2020,1
267,"Throwaway account not because my parents have Reddit but because my mom is reading my phone and any notifications to my other accounts will be read .-. This will be a long one, I feel like there's a lot of context needed? But I may have gone overboard, I tend to do that haha. LMK and I'll cut off most of the context!

**TW for suicidal thoughts and self harm topics.**

I'm 16, nearly 17. Female. Ever since the whole situation with COVID-19, and me and my parents have been in somewhat lockdown since March 13th. I say somewhat because they have very social jobs and have recently been going out more often lately (spent the weekend on the lake from 10-9/6 both days). They do practice safe measures, but that's not what this post is about.

Today has been really tough on me. I struggle with a phone addiction and I will admit this. I spend 13 hours on the phone on average. What do I do? Roleplay and talk to a few online friends, but the majority of the time is spent roleplaying with someone who's very close to me. It's a bad addiction and I am not afraid to tell myself that. I need to work on it. And that was what I promised my mom a week ago.

I didn't work on it, and to be entirely honest, I didn't think she was serious about taking any action against me. Today, I was tasked with dusting the 3 story house and to treat it like a job since I would be paid. Instead, I slept in and stayed on the phone until I got a text they would be home soon, then quickly managed to finish dusting the basement in just over an hour. Mom comes home, is pissed I didn't do it. I'm stressed about her anger so I quickly start making dinner while she's working on getting the boat in the backyard. I make it, have a panic attack as I worry about burning the food and it not tasting good, she has to help with final touches.

Without going into extreme details here, we had four arguments. One over why I was anxious, not that important.

The second was about my lack of interest in talking to her. I will clarify she started by complaining about me always being on the phone and I retorted that if she wanted to talk I would gladly put my phone down, but this was a lecture, not a conversation. She went on to say that I don't have any interest in joining their conversation. I respond by reminding them they talk about adult stuff that I need context for, or the news which I also need context for. Here's the kicker. I'm hard of hearing. Around 80% hearing loss in both ears. So it's really difficult for me to keep up with a conversation involving two people, even my parents. This ended with me storming into my room because I was upset she kept complaining about my phone. I left my phone downstairs and decided she's right, I should take a shower and read a book in the bath.

She took my door closing as a door slam (I rarely close my door so I forget how sensitive it is when I DO close my door ;w; It's always loud) and came upstairs to argue some more. How I neglect my in real life friends, don't ever text them or try to meet up with them. I remind her we're in a quarantine. She says so, places are open! I need to get out of the house! I try to get in the shower before it gets worse and I *need my phone to vent*, but she follows me and goes on about how it's an addiction. I never want to talk to her. I tell her this is because she makes me feel like a failure because every time we DO talk, it ends up with a lecture. She says no, it's because I don't want her bitching about my constant phone usage. Well. Yeah. That's part of the whole lecture thing, I know it's a problem and her constantly yelling at me about it doesn't help.

She leaves. I try to push myself to shower but need to vent about the situation before I can calm down because I am that upset, goes to ask about my phone and she says I don't need it. Great. Grounded. So I go upstairs and release the pain with a pocket knife I unfortunately remembered I kept around. I do chores, go downstairs to calm down by watching a Netflix show.

She comes downstairs and tells me I'm taking a 'detox' from all electronics and will no longer have Discord when I'm done, because that's where I roleplay. After a lot of arguing about my addiction, she won't give me a chance to actually put some effort in and limit my time. No more Discord. I talk to friends I never talked to from in real life on a server, and quite a lot of them. I talk to my boyfriend. And I talk to online friends who are honestly so much more understanding and friendlier than in real life ones because my disability is not present. This hurts. A lot.

I told her this would push me to self harm. She called me self centered if I did. That I would be thrown into a mental institution and pumped full of drugs till I wasn't coherent.

I decided not to admit to her that I started two years ago and have done it at least ten times, including just 30 minutes ago. And because of this, which I accurately predicted she would be mad at me for admitting this would hurt me this way, I can't tell her about my actual feelings about this situation, so it only led to me exploding and yelling at her while angrily crying. Finally she let me walk away after staring at me forever.

I lied in bed for an hour cursing myself for being too chicken to act on my suicidal thoughts, then realized I don't really care at this point. Maybe I should take my parent's medications or something. After a while I chickened out and went on and got onto the computer. Which is where I am now. I don't want to die anymore thanks to my lovely boyfriend and roleplay partner as well as other friends, but the same can not be said for self harm.

Do I think this is an overreaction? No. There's a lot of stuff that build up to this. Over the two months we've been locked together, I've gotten only one or two compliment and have been insulted or reprimanded nearly every day. It's tense. I hide from her actively now, as I mentioned before. I want to go somewhere else, but with the quarantine it's hard. The only family that can support having me for more than a couple of days has 10 cats... which I love... but her house smells horrible and she doesn't take good care of them. Total crazy cat lady. I do have another pair of grandparents, but they live 8+ hour drive away from me. I wish I could drive to them, and I've had my license long enough to do so but.. I don't know. That's why I'm asking you guys for help. I don't know what the best result to do here is.",04May2020,1
268,"My mom and dad (I‚Äôm 18yo male) have been acting crazy imo but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right. It all started recently when my moms dad starting dying (he‚Äôs now in nursing home close to dying) and she was under stress. I was committed to a college and they made me switch to another that was better but I had no friends there and it made me upset. I fought w my mom about it and she told my I‚Äôm killing her, I‚Äôm gonna be the death of her, and I‚Äôm a horrible person. Then I was mad at her over something else today and fought with her. She said I‚Äôm causing her more stress along with everything else and she‚Äôs gonna have to move out cause of me and everyone is basically saying I‚Äôm an asshole in the family. She said to my face I caused her suffering and stress. But I can‚Äôt just sit back and act like everything is how I want it to be when I‚Äôm not so happy.

269,"So it‚Äôs pretty self explanatory, I had an account where I was a sugar baby but I was anonymous on it. It was a new account, maybe a week or two old? I had a fake name, no face, just trying to make some easy extra cash to help out my family. Somehow, some kids from my school found the account and figured out it was me from the pictures (bikini, partially clothed, etc). They had no proof, but they said they could tell based off the body and based off the background. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I kind of panicked and I was getting a lot of hate so I said it wasn‚Äôt me. Some people believed me, some didn‚Äôt. Even still, a month later, anonymous accounts of kids from my school message me and bully me about it. They tell me to just admit it was me, but I‚Äôve stayed strong that it‚Äôs not, and to be honest I made sure the pictures couldn‚Äôt be traced back to me and all their ‚Äúevidence‚Äù it was me was pretty weak. For a week I was hurting badly because of this, but I slowly got over it. It got brought up again tonight and the whole situation makes me so sick to my stomach. Should I have just owned up to it? I feel like that would‚Äôve just made the bullying worse. Do I just ignore them? If so, how? I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm a senior and thanks to lockdown I don‚Äôt have to see any of them ever again. Just any advice or words of wisdom would be really appreciated :)
TLDR; schoolmates found an anonymous account I created that I used as a sugar baby and began bullying me over it but I denied it was me since they had no real proof. Some still don‚Äôt believe me and are still hating on me (through anonymous accounts) and bringing up a month later.

She constantly criticizes everything. The way I walk, the way I talk, the way I breathe.

Can I come?‚Äù Sometimes she‚Äôll be nice to me and then the next day when I talk to her she‚Äôll lash out again.

It‚Äôs not like I can have a rational conversation with her. I can‚Äôt begin imagine how badly she‚Äôd react to that. I‚Äôve been told to ignore it so she won‚Äôt get a reaction from me, but there‚Äôs only so much I can take.

276,"Hi there!

College is on the horizon for me and I want to go into the games industry. My dream job is a designer role (level, environment, gameplay, I don't care). I've made standalone games and mods in GameMaker and Unity respectively, so it's not like I'm saying this because I only like PLAYING video games. And making both games and mods has led me to the conclusion that I like the creative aspects of game-making more than programming.

There was a time when I was dead set on getting a BS in computer science. Problem is, while I enjoy programming, I feel like a computer science degree wouldn't allow me to get one of the more creative/multimedia jobs, which is where graphic design comes into play. The problem with THAT is that I don't have experience with it besides my natural talent at drawing. So I looked at majors specifically called ""Game Design"" or something like that. The problem with THAT is I feel it will pigeonhole me if I'm unable to get a job working for a game company.

I have also heard that it is extremely difficult to get a job in the games industry and my safest bet is to pray I get a job in QA and work my way up to a mid-senior/senior designer role.

278,"So a little context to explain the situation. I moved into this apartment and I'm renting out the room from this lady, who has a husband and two children (a boy and a girl). They are 13 and 10 respectively. The boy has told me some concerning things. Now I haven't heard her side of the story, but he's told me a few things that concern me

1. Apparently he got a 'whupping' from a her a few years ago that lasted around 30 minutes. I asked him what he meant by a 'whupping' and he said she spanked him and it didn't hurt, which I know is legal in the us so there's nothing I can do, but it still makes my fucking blood boil.

2. He told me another story today while he broke down in tears. Basically, he had his phone and she was trying to take it away from him. She was chasing him around the house and and he was of course running away because he didn't want to get hit. He pulled out a pole to defend himself and then THIS psycho bitch got one to and started whacking his pole like a fucking child. Then she called the cops on him and the dumbass officer took her side and took him to the children's hospital. 

3. He said that she physically used her body weight, as in sat on top of him while he screamed for help. 

These are three biggest incidents that stand out to me, the ladder two being qualified as illegal child abuse in my eyes. She also mentally abuses both of them. When the kids say they don't want to do something with her, she retorts by saying 'oh so I guess you don't love me then'. She constantly criticizes and whines at them, accusing them of stealing her things when she's just dumb af and lost them. A fucking 45 year old woman mind you who should know better. 

Now I know he's not my kid and its none of my business. I really don't want to call CPS because I know how much they can fuck things up (I've seen it happen). I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place here y'all. I don't plan on doing anything rash or drastic, but the whole situation makes me uncomfortable and I'm not sure if I should do something or not.

Basically, ""I'm not lesbian"", but she still loves me. I didn't put that in quotes, because I do believe that she does, and I love her too, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to be as comfortable around her again. Also, apparently it's fine for my friends to be queer, but her own child is off-limits. I doubt she'd kick me out or anything, as I am a minor, and she still loves me, but she just won't accept who I am.

I'm currently fighting off a mental breakdown. I feel like straight people/non-queer are the luckiest people in the world. Now, just to clarify, my dad completely supports me, but just isn't very vocal about it, and I definitely won't be very vocal either from now on. He's all about science, like me, and believes sexuality is genetic, like me.

So, Summary: Came out of closet, mom refuses to acknowledge it, Dad is supportive, but wants to avoid drama or divorce, and I am swiftly hiding in the closet again.

Fiance and I were supposed to be getting married this year but now with the social distancing orders we are looking at having to postpone (we're in a state with a pretty strict stance on the situation). We can't decide if we want to do it at all at this point. The issue is that we've already had a long 18 month engagement and we are both so tired of prioritizing this one day. We want to move on to other financial commitments--buying a house, kids, putting more finances towards a small online business we have. It's really unfortunate that everything worked out this way but it's unavoidable and it's not anyone's fault. I wish there was an option that we're excited about, but honestly nothing seems exciting or even enjoyable right now. 

Our financial situation has also changed drastically because of COVID. Things were pretty good before but we're now both taking a big hit, so recommitting to the financial side of things is not a fun thought. If we postpone, we're thinking of November 2021 so that we have time to regain some normalcy. We also want to keep our options open and look at homes in the meantime. If the conditions are right, we may decide to go for it and scrap the wedding entirely...

It's a hard decision to make. But at this point the only thing we can agree on is that we both feel burdened and miserable by the thought of having to add another 12+ months to the timeline. We agreed that our ideal situation would be to have a small legal thing now and try to have a reception when things go back to normal. But by then we will have been engaged/ married for over 2 years. Is it even worth it at that point?

What do you guys think? Should we postpone the wedding until next year, or should we just cut our losses now and consider the event cancelled? So far we have only paid $5k to the venue so we're not too tied up there.

So, I was unsure where I should go from this point because our family dynamic is different from the U.S.. We moved here from the Pacific island and we still instill plenty of traditions from there to our lives now. 

As a little backstory, we moved here when I was 4 and my siblings were 10f, 12m, and 19m. We always look out for each other, just like any other family. However, there a certain rules. Brothers can act like fathers when the mother isn't around. The youngest, aka me, has to do whatever the older siblings say. Just like every normal family, we have fights and afterwords, we all hug and make up with each other. 

Well, my younger brother joined the military right out of high school. We were all so proud of him and we still are proud of him. He was just recently honorably discharged from the army. We invited him and his fiancee to come live in our house till they can get a place of there own. Things were amazing at first, but now, me and my mother live stressfully. 

I am a full time college student and I get a financial aid check for going to school and doing well in my classes. All the money I get, I give it to my mother because she's letting me stay home and study and she takes care of cooking, cleaning, laundry, and more. It's my way of supporting her and myself as I go through college. My brother moved in and he got angry at me for doing such a thing.  I tried to keep the peace because I was happy to have my brother home, finally. But then, he started picking on me for my depression. 

My father passed away when I was 15, due to cancer, and for 2 months before his passing, I quit school to become his full time care taker. Everyone else was trying to arrange his funeral because we all knew that he would be passing soon. It took a lot out of us, but I was the one who took care of him, bathed him, fed him, helped him drink water, etc. When my father finally passed, I couldn't grieve right because I jumped back into school and was given 2 months worth of missed assignments. Even at the funeral, I shed a few tears and that was it. I never cried. 

Well, all those feelings festered inside me and my mental health crashed. Ended up attempting suicide multiplr times till finally, i saw my doctor and i was prescribed 200 mg of Zoloft. Up to a couple months ago, I took medication to help my brain function at a semi-normal level. When my brother found this out, he flipped. He said it was my fault I felt that way, that I had no reason to feel depressed. I caused myself to get this way. He yells at me and makes me stand at attention and look him in the eyes as he berates me for being a disappointment and I am not allowed to laugh or else, he hits me. Now, as I said earlier, up to a couple months ago I was taking my meds. He threw them out and monitors all phone calls made to ensure I don't get them. When I first dropped off the meds, I was sick for about 2 and a half weeks. He said it was my fault for getting addicted to the pills.

After the withdrawal symptoms calmed down, I felt like I was floating in space, and not in a good way. Most of the time, I would stare aimlessly at the floor, the walls, and/or the ceilings. One day, he ordered me to stand in front of a door and he swung it open and hit me hard in the head. He told me it was to snap me out of my depression and that he also planned out my days for me. I work around the house from 9AM-2PM, then I do my homework and assignments, and then I can have free time. I hate having my days planned out and lately, I haven't been able to think because of the door thing. 

And now? That's not even the worst he's done. Between me and my mother, we pay all the bills in this house and him and his fiancee live here for free and all they have to do is buy their own groceries. He yells at the top of his lungs at my mother, who is almost 60 years old. He yells if she does the dishes wrong, if she uses something of theirs accidentally, if she does anything wrong in the slightest way, he will get in her face and yell at her. Even when she cries, he threatens to yell even louder in her face because he doesn't care about us trying to ""impress him with our crying""?! 

My fianc√© wants to report him but, if he does, my whole family will blame him for putting my brother, who served in the military, in prison. I know all the evidence we have could put him away for years, but we would be losing our brother and we feel that he doesn't deserve to be in prison after what he has done to fight for this country. I can't report him due to the family dynamic. My oldest brother would be the one to decide what happens to my younger brother because he is now the head of the family. If I report my younger brother, my family would disown me. I have no clue what I can do as of now. Also, what police officer would arrest an ex military man that finished 8 years in the army and served a tour in afghanistan.",04May2020,1

305,"I met this guy on Reddit in early 2018 after posting lengthy cries for help during a really lonesome period of my life. We hit it off really well and could message for hours and never run out of things to talk about. At first I was a little annoyed by how much he messaged me but soon I found he and I had a lot in common, and he was very interesting to talk to. 

He had a lot of problems himself and after a while I felt safe to share my problems with him, something I had never done with anybody. It was a very liberating and freeing experience. I soon found I felt like I could tell him anything and everything, and I slowly opened up. 

The messaging on Reddit turned into exchanging numbers and texting each other. After a while I realized the guy had some pretty serious emotional issues like myself, and he had very low self-worth. He went through a lot of pain during his childhood and it sadly screwed him up. I still wanted to get to know him anyhow.

In summer 2018  had a health issue come up and had to leave my job for a few months to recover and he was the only one there for me, even though he wasn't ""there"" with me. He would send me pictures of sunsets and funny videos of him at work or playing the piano and whenever I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling scared he would somehow text me right when I needed him. He'd say ""I'm here"" and immediately I felt safe. We'd fall asleep texting each other talking about cuddles and how we'd snuggle if we were together and all that cutesy stuff and when I was feeling bad it really comforted me and gave me strength. I thanked God for this guy every night, almost in tears. 

Soon we did a video chat and I was nervous as fudge because I have social anxiety, but we ended up talking for a little over an hour. He gave me a tour of his home and showed me his yearbook pictures. I looked in his eyes and I swear I could have melted. Even though I wasn't ""there"" it felt like it. I was his ""Ladybug"" and he was my ""Snugglebug"". We'd make  up nicknames for each other all the time. 

I loved everything about him. His brokenness, his childhood, his quirkiness, his sarcasm--everything he shared with me. There were times we got into conflict and swore off texting but we always ended up talking again. We were supposed to meet up several times but since we live 1,000 miles away from each other it was near impossible because neither of us had the money or opportunity. We talked about the future several times, what if we meet and want to be together,

 I always got upset that he said I would have to move to where he is . He has a huge house his father used to rent off to tenants and gave to him. Completely paid off. He had moved so many times in childhood and never felt like he had a stable place to call home and now he has one. I will not take that away from him. I do not want to rip his home from him, but at the same time, I can't leave my family here where I am. 

This year we came to an agreement that it would be healthier and better for us if we just keep things platonic and not talk about lovey stuff or plans to move. But lately my feelings of wanting to be close to him have come back and I don't know what to do. I feel like I love him. After two years I can't seem to forget about him. I've tried getting to know other guys but I still want this one. He might have BPD but I know I cannot fix him, that is not my job. But I want to take care of him and love him through it. 

So what is wrong with all of this? I have never met this man in flesh and blood and by a normal standpoint I should not be acting like I know him or love him--because I have never met him. I realize what a mess I got myself into. Now I'm literally stuck with intense feelings of wanting to be closer to him that I can't make reality--at least not yet. I don't even know if I should, or can. 

I don't want to forget about him or move on or love anybody else. I want him.",04May2020,1

308,"Obligatory it's 1:30 in the morning and I'm just,,, Straight Up Not Having A Good Time so apologies if this is a little all over the place and extensive. I haven't really said any of this to anyone so idk how this will be interpreted but I know at least one person will tell me I'm an overdramatic teenager and I need to shut up, so just,,,, please don't.

Important Info: I'm 15, female, and living in middle-of-the-woods America. Before things went to shit (early-mid February), I was a straight-A student. Teachers liked me, parents were civil with me, and I had some friends. I was struggling with my mental health as I have been for most of my life (mostly depressive episodes and suspected BPD {I LOATHE self-diagnosers, I do, and I'm not saying I have it - but I've done extensive research and have no access to professionals, and the symptoms match up very well, so there's at least an idea of what I'm like/dealing with}). I have a pretty high IQ too, not sure exactly how high, but an estimated 135-145, so I'm not stupid. 

Here's my series of unfortunate events that has led me to my current predicament. 


Early February, my parents got into a fight. 

My parents are,,, complicated. They're not entirely terrible people, but they are 100% not people who should be together and definitely not people who should have brought children into the world, but there's nothing I can do about that now. My father displays sociopathic tendencies and hasn't had a job for more than 6 months, ever, to my knowledge. My mother is a nursing home LPN and is a high-functioning alcoholic, opioid addict, gambling addict and smoker with (I believe) anxiety and depression. Their relationship is codependent as hell and for as long as I can remember I've wanted them to divorce, but they never will. 

Either way, they got into a bigger fight than usual and my father said some,,, nasty things I'd rather not type out, but the general gist was threats of familicide and killing our pets. I didn't doubt for a second that he could/would do it and in that moment I realized how my life could end in an instant and I didn't have the invincibility every teenager thinks they have. 

So, that spiralled into a major depressive episode. I stopped doing any work at school and started skipping classes and my after-school activities. I wanted to lay in bed and listen to music, because what's the point in doing anything if it can all be taken away from you in an instant? 

In early March my english teacher kept me after class and basically accused me of being depressed and told me she ""thought I had too much potential to waste"" or whatever.

I guess I felt bad for letting her down and wanted there to be an adult that cared about me, so I started planning on getting my life back together. 


But then coronavirus hit, and quarantine started for me on March 14th. 

Since then I've re-lost motivation for anything and have continued hating myself for not doing my work all while not doing my work. 

I also got into an argument with my friends because they're disobeying stay-at-home orders and hanging out- I got angry and told them they were being selfish by doing so and tried to explain that they could spread the virus and possibly lead to someone's death by doing so. 

They told me they were doing it for their mental health and that their parents sucked so they had to hang out and hug each other and whatever. All of them (5 people) told me I needed to stop ""laying in bed being angry all day"" and should be happy because my family owns land that I can be on. They then blocked me on every social media I had them on.

So now I have no friends, save for one boy that has a serious case of Horny For Anything That Moves. 

All I do anymore is lay in bed and play Animal Crossing. I hate my family, friends, and school. I'm basically doomed to repeat this semester of English, Science, History, and Math. I just want out. 

I've considered running away, but I know I'd end up dead or found and put in a mental hospital or juvie. I also want to drop out &amp; get my GED but you either have to be 18 or 16 with parental and school permission. 

Suicide seems stupid, because I know that in three years I can leave and none of this will matter anyway, but I can't stop thinking about how easy that would be. 

I don't know what to do. I'm alone in this world, it seems, and at this point I might just have to up and leave.

311,"Hi guys, 

I have a lot on my chest that I can‚Äôt let go of, and I thought maybe typing it out and sending it into the world might be therapeutic in some way.

About 4 years ago, I started my undergrad at university. I met two girls and automatically became close with them. One of the girls, we‚Äôll call her Tori, never seemed to really like me, and would often act catty towards me in regards to the guys I would see. She would always claim she had liked the guys I dated ‚Äòfirst‚Äô, which she never mentioned until I‚Äôd already been with them. She would then message them behind my back and try to fuck them.

Our other friend, let‚Äôs call her Haley- shared her first kiss with a boy who then ghosted her. She was really into this guy. Little did she know, Tori was inviting this guy to hang out in her dorm at night behind her back. Later I found out that Tori had told people that I was the one doing this. All of my friends believed her.

I had a best friend who was male. We had been friends for 3 years. I set him up with Tori in the hopes that he would stop pining after me, and I wanted them to be happy. They began dating and she forced him to stop hanging out with me. She used find my friends to track both of us whenever we would. This resulted in the loss of my best friend.

In the second year of university, Tori, Haley and I became roommates. Huge mistake, very obviously. Tori would slide notes on my door that said ‚Äúshhhh‚Äù whenever I had my boyfriend over for the night, in instances when we were just quietly watching movies and things (she heard us having sex once and was really upset about it, so we only did so at his place thereafter). Her boyfriend (my ex best friend) told me that she would actually put her ear up against my door, listening. 

We went to a party with friends at the campus bar, 5 minutes from our dorm one night. A few hours in, I felt like puking, so I told her I was going back to the dorm with my boyfriend. She was livid. Keep in mind she wasn‚Äôt alone, and it was a safe environment with other friends there. When she got home she literally screamed at me and when I asked her what I did wrong she yelled at me to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù.

After that I had a massive amount of anxiety at the thought of going home to my dorm. It made me physically ill. My boyfriend and I fell out, and because she spread those false rumours about me going behind Haley‚Äôs back, I had lost all of my friends. At the time I hadn‚Äôt known about the rumour, so it really threw me off waking up one day and having no fucking friends. When they came around the dorm they would often get quiet when I was around. That was really great!

I started cutting myself and not leaving my room. I had struggled with depression and self harm in the past, but never to the point of cutting. I didn‚Äôt even go to class. I felt so hopeless and suicide was constantly on my mind. I made it through that year, though. Although my gpa suffered terribly, and I now how scars that will NEVER let me forget this shitty period of my life.

A year later I was back with my boyfriend. The start of our relationship was toxic, he was a smooth liar who I now assume was probably cheating on me the whole time. I broke up with him because he had an awful temper, but we remained very close and would talk on the phone nearly everyday.

I found out a week after our awful breakup that he and Tori were exchanging nudes. He knew all of what she had done but still did this. He could‚Äôve chosen any other girl. They had no prior relationship. She wasn‚Äôt attractive. 

It‚Äôs been nearly 4 years since all of this. I never talk about it because I know I should be over it by now. But I can‚Äôt let it go. I‚Äôll go for months not thinking about it, but there‚Äôs always nights like this where I‚Äôm up until 3 am ruminating and feeling the urge to hurt myself again. Often I give in. It‚Äôs humiliating. This one person singlehandedly isolated me from my entire support system- my best friend, our entire friend group (whom she only met because I set her up), and the person I loved. I feel like I hadn‚Äôt met her, my life would be so much better at this moment. 

How can I let this go? I truly appreciate anyone who has read this far. Thank you.",04May2020,1

313,"I am writing this as my boyfriend (24), who loves me so much, is sleeping.

I am very worried that as a 24 year old woman that if I want to have the career I have always dreamed of I need to forfeit my relationship and chances of ever having a family.

I know I seem young, but let me put this all into perspective for you in three convenient points.

1) I did not do well in my undergraduate degree that I completed a year ago. My GPA was a 2.56. Most grad schools or programs dont look at you unless you got a 3.0. I dont have professors I can confidently ask for letters of recommendation. I do have some I will ask, but not any I feel like they know me well enough. This degree means nothing. I will need to take extra classes and what not if I want to further my education, which I do.

2) I want to further my education, and I believe I want to become a nurse-midwife. This will take three years, not including prereqs or this year because I am currently involved in starting a year with AmeriCorps. 

3) The earliest I will finish by is 28, but it will be more like 28 or 29. After that, I was really hoping to travel in my profession. Or even work within the military. How long can I do that for though?

3A) I was considering doing a masters in public health too or instead of the nurse-midwifery thing.

I do genuinely want children, but I feel like I have no time. For me being successful has always been important because I always felt like such an idiot. I am not idiot though, despite my grades, I was just unfocused. I have been going crazy working two jobs to pay for classes. The thought that lingers in my head is ""when will you have children though."" I dont want them so old they are more likely to not be healthy.

She‚Äôs really insecure about how she treats her friends, despite being a really good one herself, and she thinks she‚Äôs fat and will sometimes starve herself. She has nightmares a lot, so she takes pills to help her sleep. On the first day of April, she had a dissociative episode, and started ranting about how fat and ugly and stupid she thinks she is. She said she wanted to take the entire bottle of pills, but I managed to partially talk her out of it. She ended up taking one extra, and was fine the next day. I made her promise she would never do it again. Today, one of her closest friends revealed some personal information to someone that was bullying her. She told me she felt betrayed.

317,"I have gone through a lot this year. I think I've been blinded most of my life to the real bitch my ""best friend"" has been. A lot of people have been telling me I'm too nice and I don't want to hear it. I can't imagine myself being any other way. If i want to I can point out flaws of anyone in the same room as me. Anyone I know, in the blink of an eye I can think of something they have done wrong. For simplicity, Jack = old best friend, Debbie = ex gf, Melissa = new girlfriend, and Jeff = current best friend, and me = me. I can name at least one flaw or bad thing each of them has done.

Jack - I can list a novel of things he's done but let's just list them instead of details. Kicked me in the nuts, called me a rapist, tried to steal my girlfriend, twice, succeeded with Debbie, failed with Melissa, threatened me because Melissa realized what a dick he is, lied about me to whoever would listen, need i go on?

Debbie - Novel 2, Electric Boogaloo. Believed the lies Jack told about me, dumped me and made up some bs excuse even though it was just to date Jack. Hid her relationship with him then lied about it for months after it happened and even lied to my face while I found out about it and was pissed that she ignored Melissa for dating me. She is just as bad as Jack and they are perfect together. Anyways she came to me when Jack ""dumped her"" and ranted about him. She ranted like i knew they were dating (i did but she didn't know i knew.) For all she knew, I just found out about it through that rant. What a way to find out my ex dumped me and started dating my ""best friend"" two weeks after.

Melissa - not much for her. I love her, but she listens to whatever I advise her to do. I tell her my opinion on things and while i think it's really sweet that she respects my opinions, she takes them as facts. I even told her once that i thought it was a bad idea to do something and she didn't argue with it, at all. I think she's a great person but should argue her opinions more and not be as passive.

Jeff - not a novel but I'll name one thing that pissed me off. He used the situation i have with Jack and Debbie to say I mishandled things comparing a situation where they called me a rapist to a situation where a mutual friend ditched Jeff and they started arguing about it. I said ""the situation could've been handled better"" and Jeff straight up says ""like the Jack situation? Could you have handled that better?"" That pissed me off, he compared false allegations to being ditched... Okay.

There's a point to all of this. I can list bad or inconsiderate things they have done, just like i did now. I can find the worst in people, but I don't think I should. I've given every single one of those people multiple chances (except for Melissa she is unproblematic.) The question is, if I'm seeing them as people who learn from their mistakes instead of you did this, this, and that and you don't learn and never will. If I always choose to see the best in people and let them get away with wronging me, am I being a bad person for being nice? Am I being a bad person for always giving multiple chances (expect for Jack and Debbie they don't deserve it and i hate them.)

Am I too nice? Should I be more rude and see more of peoples flaws instead of seeing people that 100% will learn? Is my ideology flawed?",04May2020,1

319,"To preference this post before I even start, I know Reddit is not the place to ask for any medical advice and I indeed in fact have talked to a therapist already so I have someone to call if I make the decision to get on medication. I also don‚Äôt have a bad family life or any other stressful factors for being at home with my parents to trigger such attacks. I also have no history of depression or other conditions. 

To start, I have been having terrible unexpected anxiety due to this pandemic and I‚Äôm sure many others are as well. My main problem right now is I had really bad panic attacks in the very beginning but once I got adjusted to quarantine they have gotten better for around 4 weeks. But now, I am having random panic attacks again and some of them are so bad I feel sick to my stomach and have to calm myself for over an hour and use the bathroom frequently. I have all the classic symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks and the problem is I don‚Äôt know if I should contact my therapist again to go on medication. I have seen friends from a distance and no anxiety during these times so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs just situational. The problem is I don‚Äôt know how long this will last and I don‚Äôt know how the side effects will present themselves since I also am drinking and using my vape frequently. My sole purpose for this post is to just get some advice from someone with experience prior to this so I can make a decision whether to call about medication or not.

320,"I‚Äôm coming to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm an incel. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm admitting, but I am. I am NOT Part of their online community and I do NOT believe in a lot of the stuff they say. 

However, I hate women. I see them as scum and trash. Simultaneously, I am very sad and depressed that I am a virgin and girls don‚Äôt like me. I hate immigrants because I feel they come to America and ‚Äústeal‚Äù the girls. It‚Äôs all wrong. I need help, I have to stop this I‚Äôm worth more than this. I‚Äôm a cute young guy trying to make it in this world and my head is so twisted with these thoughts, life is so short, I can‚Äôt waste it like this. 

I need a way out. 

Here are My views: 

- women have much more sex partners than guys, they created hookup culture and have zero sexual morals. 

- women hate having kids and family, they love abortion. 

- most girls cheat and they can‚Äôt be trusted in a relationship. 

- most relationships are ended by women. Girls don‚Äôt get sad after breakups, or get hurt. Guys get destroyed while girls go and party and hookup 

- girls are incapable of love. They only ever dated guys because they were forced too, now that hookup culture is the norm, girls have abandoned monogamy. They seek sex with strangers not relationships 

- dating a girl makes you a loser, as other guys fucked her before you, and they just had all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù with her meanwhile you have to be there for her and date her, she is using you to settle and gave her fun and youth to other men 

- girls are shallow, only caring about looks, having ‚Äúracial preferences‚Äù due to dick size, caring about how good a guy is in bed, how much money he makes etc. 

- girls lives are much happier than guys, girls can‚Äôt get hurt or heartbroken. Girls can‚Äôt get depressed or suicidal if they are even remotely cute and receive attention 

- when girls cry it‚Äôs just to manipulate those around them. It‚Äôs fake 

- girls hate their families and parents, choosing partying and friends over family. Leaving their home town as soon as they can to move to huge cities.

Okay that‚Äôs most of my views towards girls. Please don‚Äôt insult me, I‚Äôve already attempted suicide and am seriously considering it again. I wish I was never like this. I want it to stop. 

I‚Äôm not even 20 yet and I‚Äôm screwed. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I just wanna be normal. Not be depressed, have a healthy mindset and healthy life. I‚Äôd give anything for that.

I still go to school with this person and see them frequently. They are still adamant on not wanting anything to do with me. 

I am not pushing it at all. Even though I wish I could explain to this person that I regret with every ounce of my being what I did, that isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs important. What‚Äôs important is that this person can process what I did to them in the best way possible, so if I‚Äôm not granted the right to talk to them, then I‚Äôm fine with that because I have no choice. No problem there. I want this person to heal and I‚Äôve made it clear I am willing to support them in any way possible. That might even be having to face the music. 

Admittedly, I am fearful that they‚Äôll expose me at school and I‚Äôll lose my friends because of it. I‚Äôve come to accept that I deserve this. However, would it be worthwhile trying to explain to them that I was drunk and didn‚Äôt mean to do this? Is that even a valid thing to say?

Additionally, I have a SO who I am very in love with and they love me back. I have never felt this way about somebody before and I feel as though I have found the love of my life. I want to be with them forever. One thing about them, however, is that they are strongly against abusers. Is it worthwhile explaining to them that I was drunk? I know that I would never abuse anybody sober, or even somewhat drunk. The night that the assault happened, I was blackout. 

What do I say to my friends? What do I say to my SO? I am telling my SO, I just don‚Äôt know how to go about it. I regret what happened, but I trust myself enough for it to never happen again. Is there any other steps I should take?

324,"Hello!

So, me and my boyfriend have almost been together for 10 years and we were thinking about eventually moving in together in the next year. Only issue is, I would like for my mother to live with us. Her and my boyfriend have had a really weird relationship from where she loves him for a couple of days and then says that she hates him and then she's back to loving him. He could care less what she think's about him, but he also doesn't like the toxic behavior .

After finally getting older and really looking back on her actions, I am a firm believer that she is not mentally well. Ever since I was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and have taken notes on my habits due to the positive effects of medication and just studying the subject, that I'm a firm believer she also has a bipolar disorder as well with probably some other mental disabilities. If you didn't know her as well as I have, you would probably find her normal.

She doesn't work, and is handicapped, however mostly independent . At the moment, she lives with my older brother with his abusive wife (my brother and his wife are equally abusive with eachother) my 13 year old neice, his wife's son and the son's ex girlfriend. They live in a 2 story house and my mom sleeps in the dining room on a medical bed because she fell and broke her leg and can't go up stairs by herself. The household is a complete disaster, my brothers wife is constantly yelling at my mother while my mom minds her own business, my brother and his wife are constantly screaming at each other and there is always drama happening in the household. My mom feels like such a burden and so uncomfortable that she tried to kill herself through an overdose and no one noticed the fact that she was sleeping for 2 days straight. Thankfully, nothing happened and she woke up as if she just took a long nap.

I am dying to get my mother out of that place, but unfortunately I live with my grandmother from my dad's side (they had a really nasty divorce) and they won't allow her to visit/live here, understandably so, however the house is in my name when my grandmother passes away (she's 93) and I am to do what I please with it, which is to live in the house and to bring my mother to let her live here with me. I told my boyfriend he is more than welcome to live here as well, but that I completely understand if he doesn't because of her. I just don't know what to do, because I want to live with my boyfriend, but I also want my mother to live with me and have a stress free environment.

What is the best way to go about it?",04May2020,1

326,"Hi,  
I'm not really sure how this subreddit works, but I thought I'd give it a go as I don't really have anywhere else to go.  
Basically, I have an extremely germaphobic 13-year-old brother, he is germaphobic to the point where he takes 2-3 hour showers a day, he will not let himself be touched by anyone at any time, and he will not let anyone touch his washed laundry as he fears it will be covered in germs if you do. He often sleeps on the floor as he doesn't want to wear his ""dirty clothes"" to his clean bed (he deems these clothes ""dirty"" as I may have accidentally bumped into him at dinner earlier).  
As of recent, my family has started to fall apart due to him. He has destroyed my mum's makeup and jewellery as we have not bought him industrial-grade dishwashing soap to wash his hands with. He has also gotten violent on many occasions, punching and kicking our parents in the face and chest. As of the past two days my mum has mum has given on him, she now ignores him and the rest of our family, and now doesn't leave her room. My dad now sleeps on the couch, as my mum doesn't want to interact with us if we continue to pander to his demands.  On multiple occasions, my dad and I have brought up counselling for him, however he just laughs at us and locks himself in his room in order to play video games. He has even become a compulsive liar and manipulator, telling different lies to each member of our family so he can wash his hands another time. He has refused to go to school for the past 3 months and hasn't left the house in months either.    
Watching my family fall apart due as a result of his mental illness is crushing me, especially this destroying my parents' marriage. I just want to get to help and overcome this mental illness, but he doesn't want to help himself.  I would appreciate any advice on what to do to help him and my family, or any advice for similar situations you may have encountered.  
Thank you all so much &lt;3",04May2020,1
327,"I'm so overly sensitive, it takes next to nothing to make cry uncontrollably and I have no control over it. When my body wants to cry, it cries, no matter what my mind has to say about it. It's like I feel my emotions more intensely than most people, to the point where I think I might have something seriously wrong with me. It's like I'm a slave to my emotions and to be honest, I'd rather break free and not feel anything at all.

It's keeping me from being a functioning a member of society. I'm 20 years old but afraid to get a job because what if I'm dealing with a rude costumer or mean boss, than I break down in tears at work and embarrass myself. I already cry 4-5 times a week and that's from minor inconveniences. 

As soon as the lock down is lifted, I'm scheduling an appointment with a psychologist (I was supposed to see one in Late March.) I'm also considering going on medication but I'm worried about the side effects.

328,"  disclaimer:sorry for my spelling and grammar.

so before quarantine I reconnected with an old friend at school that I haven‚Äôt talked to in years. Something felt really off about her from the beginning. These suspicions were confirmed when my mom gave me a warming about her.

Apparently she was being abused when I first met her years ago, and when I lost contact with her. She‚Äôs not anymore , thankfully. But she has came out of it with some....changes. Mom didn‚Äôt tell me what , and tbh I don‚Äôt know. But she did tell me that she had hit her mom before and to be careful about her. So I tried to be.

my friend who we will call A for the sake of privacy, is a kind and well meaning person. But tends to be controlling, and clingy. By clingy I mean follows me everywhere at school, even to the bathrooms! I have talked to my family about this, and they tried to get her help, talked to social workers about this. They said that the case would be pushed to the front, and she would get the help she needs, and go to another school until she‚Äôs better.

i genuinely want to help her, and I thought it was a good solution since she had been denied access to she school before. And when she came back, she would be back to normal. And I could have a happy friendship with her.  


but the system has done nothing, it‚Äôs been a couple of months, and I‚Äôm worried that the longer I‚Äôm around her, the more likely she is to hurt me. Two weeks of her following me around broke me, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to tell my family about this, I don‚Äôt want to worry them even more since they have a lot going on.

335,"Like in title... I am 21 male, living in a small city in Poland. Went to uni, but dropped out after not even a semestre, as my major wasn't something I wanted to pursue in life.... and my psychical health problems... I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1, and also suffer from severe case of Adhd.  I take my bipolar meds, but I don't get adhd meds anymore.

  
But now, year and a half after dropping out I'm still in a bad situation. I work a no skills low paid job in very bad environment ... I don't have any notable skills, only recently I overcame my social phobia. I used to learn to code (around 15hours a week for 2 years) , but after a big wall of unability to comprehend certain things - I gave up. I just couldn't understand how am I supposed to comprehend this whole multitasking thing - I realised I just am not suited for java coding. I didn't give up without a fight - just realised that even if I somehow managed to find a method to work it out I would still never be able to compete on oversaturated low skill java coding.

My only positive traits, of course they are overshadowed by bad ones, are   
\- After years of therapies I am kinda good at communicating - explaining things, and always try my best to help other person   
\- creativity in approaching problems - well this is a catchy one, as it also means that normall approches to problems are really hard to comprehend, and I always do things my way - commonly resulting in redundancy and wasted time...  


Living at my parents house isn't good either, as they both have mental problems, and render them upon myself, just this year I had to call police on the male 2 times. I don't have any friends to be honest, but I am used to it being like that -I just have this aura of someone unpleasant, and people tend to dislike me immediately - got used to it long ago. I'm just looking for a way of slipping away from my toxic family and be able to .

There is that thing - a guy from my workplace - says I should move to Hamburg with him... At first it looked like a really good oppurtunity, but what job can I get there without any skills, not even knowing German launguage well enough to maintain proper conversation???   
I started learning basic german, but still I don't think 4 months of learning will land me a job I won't shout at the heavens for...  
Going to uni, for now,  is impossible for me - it needs too much of attention, and also locks too much in one place. Maybe in the future when I'll have overcame my biggest fears I could go for it, but now it is too big of a responsibility.

To be honest - I don't reallly want ""loads of money"", I don't like travelling, though my dream would be LIVING not visiting, in Thailand or Japan, but in their smaller cities. I am content with rather frugal life, though I have one big expense I will have to do in 3-4 years - repairing my teeth - myriads of conditions lead to me having awful teeth - some I could have prevented were I smarter, some were totally forced upon me.  Also I would go for a medical check-up if I could.

The best would be a job where I could develop myself step by step - something which is unfortunately not present in low-skill jobs...

I was thinking about becoming a medical assistant - even though I never had anything to do with biology and such, it is a rather stable job with lots of opportunities, and even a way of developing myself further in the field, if I'll ever feel the ambition to.

We broke up in the fall of 016 and moved on with our lives. Eventually we completely stopped talking but kept following each other on social media.

Around 2018 she started posting pics with a dude and in a few months they were engaged. She posted several pictures of them at the school, which made me think the dude is also an educator who works there.

A month ago, a friend of mine who works at a private Catholic school sent me a couple of pictures of Chelsea's fiance asking if I knew him. After some small talk he told me why he was sending me those...

The dude who is gonna marry Chelsea was fired from this Catholic school some years ago because he was DATING a 15 yo girl. A STUDENT. His student. His former coworkers exposed him after some months investigating his suspicious behavior and managed to get his ass fired.

The girl was living with him and they would go to school together. GROSS AS FUCK! He was even responsible for chaperoning her group on an exchange trip to Italy. The dude is nasty as hell.

346,"I‚Äôve never been to a therapist or psychologist or anyone for this but I really want to. In the mean time, I just want to know if you guys have anything that ease your mind when it comes to being paranoid. So basically for the past few years (maybe 8 years or more. I‚Äôm 16, almost 17) I‚Äôve been really paranoid and my mind likes to race to the worst case scenario with a majority of things, although outwardly I do try to have more of a positive outlook on things because I know that thinking negatively about something and make the situation worse. Anyways, my mom used to go out a lot last year so I was stuck at home watching my brother with my sister. She‚Äôd say she‚Äôd be home r a certain time, but at times she‚Äôd be late and I got scared that maybe she was either kidnapped, murdered, or got in a car crash and died. Or a mixture of all. I even get thoughts like that when I‚Äôm home alone and the rest of my family goes to the store or something and it feels like it‚Äôs been a long time when really it hasn‚Äôt been. I start to think they‚Äôve all died and crashed? I wish I didn‚Äôt think that way. Even when I get into a car I think to myself ‚Äúthis could be the last time I get to see everyone‚Äù because I think that I‚Äôll die. I‚Äôll even be laying in bed and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a heart attack or die of some horrible disease right now and won‚Äôt be able to say bye to all the people I love.‚Äù It‚Äôs bad. It only makes me cry when my family doesn‚Äôt respond when I‚Äôm not with them. That‚Äôs when I worry the most. Usually I just like to dismiss these thoughts and distract myself but I‚Äôm getting really tired of it and I just want a good solution to ease all of these thoughts I have in my head. It just sucks.

Ok, so I've been hearing about onlyfans for awhile. I have no idea what it is though except like a premium porn page? I have a few questions. How does pricing work? Do I have to show my face at all? How do I deal with creepy men? I'm a little afraid of someone hacking my account and finding out information if I make one.

My other thing is my morals, like I wouldn't mind making the money at all. I need it right now, but I've never put my body out there for the world to see. I've always been a very shy person. I also talk to my therapist about everything in my life and I feel like I couldn't be able to hide this from her. I actually feel like she would be genuinely disappointed and advise to not do it. I would never show my face for privacy but I really feel like something could be made out of this in a good way.

We were not allowed to leave the room or have anything in the room with us. After 8 we were allowed to stay in the common area until 9:30.

352,"Apologies in advance for formatting (mobile) and my brain is all over the place so hopefully this makes sense. 

I had a dream/nightmare last night that caused me to wake up this morning in fear. I could feel my heartbeat pounding and my breathing was really fast.
I don't want to be too descriptive, but I'll try to outline. The dream was about my father sexually abusing me. Or attempting to. I dreamt I was at my parents house, reading a book when my father came upstairs. He sat beside me and then tried to make advances on me with his mouth and hands. I pushed him off, we then talking about little red riding hood and how bad guys wear hoods??, he then tried again. At this point I screamed and shouted, he bit my finger, and then laughed at me. In my dream I managed to run downstairs to where my mother was, who didn't do much but ask what was going on, he chased me, and I hid behind my parents sliding glass doors so that he couldn't get to me. I then loosed my dog on him, who barked and treated him as a threat.
In my dream I was not a child but an adult as I am now (28). And I've only owned my dog for 3 years so obviously my brain was depicting a recent image of me.

The problem is I have no memory of sexual abuse, and have an OK relationship with my father. Better than its been in years since I now have a daughter and he appears to be a great grandad. I have had this dream twice now, and woken up drenched in sweat and afraid both times.

I don't know what to do... I don't have access to a counsellor or therapist, and Google didn't help. Should I give any credence to these dreams or should I just ignore them as an overworked overtired brain doing weird shit?

I also didn't know if this was the best place to ask, but I just feel so freaked out today. Not sure if NSFW so tagged that just in case...",04May2020,1
353,"I'm 17m and I get that my life basically hasn't started yet but from what I've heard and from what I've experienced myself, life just seems like a long journey where suffering is default, and happiness is more or less small distractions that inevitably go away.

I've been told that the best years of my life would be now, a kid playing with his friends, going to parties, going on dates, falling in love, going on adventures. But now that I'm on the edge of my childhood, I realize that my life was terrible.

I had no friends during my developmental years so I'm socially retarded, I've never been on a date (hell I've never even had a crush), I've never been to a friend's party, my family was made broken and I've never had a stable relationship with either of my parents, and the farthest place that I remember going to was a town 4 miles away from my home town.

And I'm no cool guy either, I'm fat as hell (I've been working out but now I'll lose all my gains because I don't have a calm place to do calisthenics), I'm annoying, I'm an asshole to everyone I care about, I'm too emotional, I'm too smart to be relatable and too dumb to have common sense, I'm unmotivated, and my depression has been a debilitating factor in my life for as long as I can remember.

And now that I know that the life that I've been living was the greatest years of my life, I'm deeply deeply terrified to go further.

What's the point in raging through all the bullshit in life when I have no reason to do it?

I'm terrible so I can't live for myself.

I don't have any friends so I can't live for them.

I don't have a girlfriend so I can't live for her.

My family would probably like me to die.

And my future in all likelyhood is going to be in a dead end job working with people I hate, married to a woman i hate, talking to friends that i hate.

354,"TL:DR I‚Äôm 20 years old, in college, and my parents still track my phone. 

(M20) I have been tracked with the Life 360 app since my parents gave me my first iPhone during Christmas my freshman year of high school. It‚Äôs always been something that‚Äôs gotten on my nerves, not because I‚Äôve been prevented from doing anything I shouldn‚Äôt but because I feel I haven‚Äôt done anything to deserve being tracked. I was type of kid that rarely got in trouble. I can only think of getting ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù twice, one of those times was in high school. I‚Äôve occasionally brought it up casually to ask if I can delete the app. I can remember one time was when I bought my first phone which was during Christmas my senior year of high school. My parents expected the app to be downloaded pretty much immediately. I brought up the conversation while the whole family was in the car one night. My points were basically that I had just bought my own phone (still on my parents phone plan though), I hadn‚Äôt done much to break trust throughout growing up, I was 18 years old, and I was getting ready to go to college with great grades. They basically shot me down immediately without giving it a thought. Their excuse of continuing to track me while I am in college is to make sure I‚Äôm okay. This has never made sense to me because I go to college in a different state. My grades did suffer when I got to college but I recently changed my major and they are doing way better. Even though they could improve a little more, I feel like I‚Äôm doing much better in life. The reason I included how my grades are doing is because they have been unhappy about my grades and absolutely refused to consider not tracking me. I think this semester has been a good demonstration on how I have turned my life around since I started college, I have been trying to show them how mature and responsible I am since I‚Äôve been living with them for the rest of the semester. I‚Äôm just sick and tired of being tracked 24/7 and I just don‚Äôt know what to say to my parents to convince them to stop tracking me at the age of 20.",04May2020,1

I was seriously working like i never did before the lockdown, i didn‚Äôt play any videogames, reading books, reading articles for classes, etc, etc. Now i work like 2 hours a day ? And play like 4. And every day i try my hardest to get back to work... i am really conflicted. The past weeks were such great times playing with friends like we were in 2016.  

The reason i can‚Äôt get back on tracks are : me, my teachers, and myself... Right so except one of my teacher, the rest just doesn‚Äôt give a shit (we are a 30 students class btw). The only thing my ¬´¬†head¬†¬ª teacher he tells us is ¬´¬†lockdown doesn‚Äôt mean less work¬†¬ª and ¬´¬†lock means actually means more work¬†¬ª. And then he manages (even after we asked for it) to not give us class (via computers). So last grade was 2/20. Worst grade of my year Yoohoo...  

And now, i start being stressed. I know the more i do nothing the more i will face tomorrow, i know it will be even harder, and i know my grades will be worst, and i know my future is at stakes.  

I tried to have a schedule, i tried to split different subjects over the week, i tried to wake up very early like i used to do, i tried and tried, but i lost motivation, and i lost that little flame which just started to ignite before the lockdown.

371,"I dislike my life, there‚Äôs a lot I dislike that I can‚Äôt change. My living situation, my job, and my mental illness to name a few. However I know there are some things I can change. For back story on myself hi I‚Äôm A ,I‚Äôm 19, I weight 280lbs I have no special skills, I don‚Äôt have a license because driving gives me anxiety which makes me panic and makes me make mistakes, I have a good group of friends (for the most part) I‚Äôm currently in love with my best friend, and women don‚Äôt even look at me like I‚Äôm a human deserving of love. My friends describe me as smart, supportive, and happy. But I‚Äôm a lie, I‚Äôm smart in the sense that I haven‚Äôt done shit with my life, I barely socialized for 18 years and what else is there to do inside than read stupid shit on the internet? I had a strong interest in science which sparked a passion for it. But that once roaring fire is now nothing but a single burnt match. Passion fades for me, and now that it has I feel empty. I‚Äôm pretty well spoken, I have a great memory, and I like to share ideas, however I feel none of these things actually make me intelligent. I‚Äôm supportive at least that ones true. I‚Äôm not happy, I create the idea that I am because I don‚Äôt care for others worrying about me (because I‚Äôm not worth their worrying). And once people know how down you feel they always want you to talk about it. I hate talking about it, it does nothing for me. It makes me feel stupid and small, so I‚Äôd rather keep my feelings to myself, and a few friends online because they are removed and anonymity protects me. My situation is better than some, and I still hate it. I‚Äôm a pretty lonely person, the only time I ever stop feeling alone is when I‚Äôm being touched by somebody. Cuddling, hugs, stuff like that. Being told somebody loves me does nothing for me, it makes me wonder why? Why out of all the people, why would you love me? I know it‚Äôs ridiculous, but in my head I‚Äôm this fat retarded monster who is useless and will always remain that way. Anyhow now that you know a little about myself, I want to be better. I haven‚Äôt felt a single shred of happiness in months, and I‚Äôve been clinically depressed for 6 years. My depression goes as far back as the 2nd grade, but it wasn‚Äôt until I turned 13 that I finally got some short lived help that ultimately went nowhere. However I will tell you these past 7 months I kinda broke out of my shell in a sense, I still enjoy my alone time, but my social anxiety has calmed down quite a bit. And however great gaining the ability to be extroverted is it came with a huuuuge drawback for me. I realized how I‚Äôve spent my life, and how much time I‚Äôve wasted (I know I‚Äôm young blah blah blah, but I‚Äôll honestly be shocked if I live passed 35 so I‚Äôm middle aged) I wasted my formative years jerking off to porn and playing video games, and up until 7 months ago I was happy doing so, but now I‚Äôm not. Internet porn isn‚Äôt enough to make me feel ok being single. Video games aren‚Äôt enough for me to feel ok never accomplishing anything. And having a single conversation a day (typically with my mother or brothers) is no longer enough to satisfy my social needs. Now that I‚Äôm out of high school I‚Äôve lost a good chuck of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, and for the most part I‚Äôm ok with that. I‚Äôve had the same 5 friends for most of my life, and I went to a different high school than all of them so my school friends were purely situational. And even then I never really felt accepted, because I didn‚Äôt fit in with that crowd, I‚Äôve had a hard time fitting in, I‚Äôm not a nerd, I‚Äôm far from a jock, I‚Äôm not a musical person, I‚Äôm not artistic, I‚Äôm just all over the place. So because I‚Äôm not a clich√© I have never really felt like I fit in. In high school I hung with the nerds, but would often jump from group to group, and sometimes just be by myself. There is one person however that did come with me out of high school, my best friend J. And there‚Äôs issues with that too, I‚Äôm hopelessly in love with her. She knows, and we talk about it and joke about it, but I‚Äôm still in love with her, and it still hurts knowing she doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I‚Äôd move on romantically speaking, but there‚Äôs issues with that. I have no ways of meeting women (when quarantine wasn‚Äôt going on of course) I‚Äôve tried dating apps but very rarely get matches, with one exception, a girl named K who I don‚Äôt really vibe with the way I do J (lots of one letter names I know and I‚Äôm sorry but bare with me here). So I want to move on, but dating apps don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt get invited to parties, and the ones I do get invited to or throw are all close friends and people I know (for the most part) not too many single ladies coming around. And the ladies I do talk to describe me as sweet, and awkwardly charming. But that sweetness and awkward charm only bring me so far. And that is the friend zone, time and time again (Incel energy I know). My scene is definitely more gauged towards the bar (closeted alcoholic in the making) and that‚Äôs problematic because I‚Äôm 19. I would go to clubs, but I have nobody to go with (except J and that makes me feel weird) so I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I‚Äôll be honest, the thing that‚Äôs fucking with me the most is definitely my current romantic situation. I can‚Äôt get it out of my head that nobody I like will ever be able to get past my hobgoblin looking exterior. And my standards aren‚Äôt even that high, just somebody I‚Äôm attracted to and somebody I can vibe with, like seriously that‚Äôs all the criteria. I‚Äôve probably gotten 20 matches on dating apps in the past year and around 3 have actually replied to me. I don‚Äôt want to be single forever but I feel like I‚Äôm destined to be. It‚Äôs like how could somebody ever be in love with a waste of space like me? I try to remember all the fucked in the head nut jobs or people with real disabilities or horrible disfigurements who find love and I wish I could say it gives me hope but it doesn‚Äôt. Like I‚Äôm somehow an acceptation to the ‚Äúeverybody finds somebody eventually‚Äù rule. And if I‚Äôm not how far is eventually? I know it‚Äôs not the most important thing in the world, but I feel so fucking lonely. Basically I‚Äôll end this asking for advice, you (the reader) know me a little bit, I‚Äôve given you at least an idea of the type of person I am. So how can I improve my social life (go out meet new people grow my social circle) how can I meet women and improve my dating life? And how can I grow mentally without the therapy I most definitely need? Advice isn‚Äôt required but it is appreciated. And if you somehow made it through this swamp of a post, thanks for reading, hope you at least had a good chuckle.",04May2020,1
372,"Long story short my ex, I guess we'll call her Bella, recently came back into my life amidst this whole corona virus outbreak. We were friends and then that lead to feelings and then our ups and downs whatever. She was there for me when I went through cancer and honestly despite not being in a relationship romantically anymore I still care for her and she does for me too. The main reason for the break up was long distance but the connection was always strong. 

She reached out to me and I originally ignored it because I wasn't trying to really get back down that path I guess so after a few failed attempts she found one of my friends on IG and dm'd him asking about my well being. He replied and told me to which I contacted her and we made amends and honestly we're on a good friendship basis I guess, time heals aye. 

Now heres were things get messed up. After my friend told me she reached out to him I contacted her and even told my friend ""Hey thanks for letting me know me and her started talking again all is good etc"" He was cool. Now today we we're talking and he casually mentions ""Yeah so funny thing I messaged her a few days ago asking if she ever reached out to me and got in contact with me"" to which I was a little thrown back because he fucking knows the whole story. I lightheartedly said ""Youre playing ha send a screenshot man"" To which he got really weird and said ""No I'm not gonna send a screenshot"" and from knowing him all this time I know he did something/came onto her. Additionally may I add that after he messaged her a few days ago she kind of went MIA but thats neither here nor there. This feeling of not knowing what he actually said and this new found lack of trust in my ""friend"" is beyond messing with my head right now. Knowing him he either said too much about me and my views of the breakup as he has a tendency to do so or he tried to spit some game.

My issue with this is on a few levels:
1.) Firstly, Why in the actual fuck did he even hit her up? They're not friends and know nothing about each other. They've never even met. When he got the first message from her when she was seeking me he made a weird comment about her ""Damn dude shes actually kind of hot"" to which I didn't think much of.  He had no reason to contact her and he knows I still care for her etc. Furthermore he's halfway across the country since he's in the military like wtf. He just broke up and his tendency is to get drunk and fucking message every girl that'll give him the time of day. 

2.) Secondly, Like dude you fucking completely went against the guy code here and in general you're a dick for being such a bad friend here. I would never do this type of fucking shit to him, like have some fucking boundaries man. Like of all the fucking girls man she's the one you want to talk to? Randomly? And like what the fuck about?  

3.) Lastly, I'm always here for this fucking kid man. Every stupid girl issue he's had, and there is a whole fucking lot of them man, I'm his fucking shoulder to cry on and vent to, when his mom passed recently I was there etc. The fact that he did this just feels dirty, grimey, slimey and fucking wrong man. His tone and the way he went about it makes me think there was more to it. I can't shake this feeling. I'm not even mad at the girl at this point since she's my ex I guess but I'm more so pissed at him. This guy was like a brother to me. 

One final thing I want to mention: He's the type of dude to have no luck with girls and has in the past gotten involved in his friends relationships to points were he's caused fights and admitted to trying to get with other dudes girlfriends and shit which is shitty in itself but the reason I'm bringing this up is because it makes me question his motives here. He broke up with his girlfriend recently because he felt she didn't care for him and he told me that when she found him on IG he thought it was kind of sweet of her. Really making me question his every action here man.  Like he has no reason to fucking hit her up man wtf. 

Am I crazy for feeling this way? Am I in the wrong? Is he in the wrong? How do I even go about addressing this? I'm so fucking upset and heartbroken right now man. It feels like loosing a friend and a brother in one man. Like this is a principle thing at this point. I'm totally alright with her moving on and doing her thing I'll wish her the best but for my friend to do some shady shit like this I can't look at him the same way.",04May2020,1

374,"Hi everyone,

I lost my mother suddenly about a month ago. That leaves me with no immediate family members (no brothers, sisters, never met my father. I am doing my best to stay physically active and focus on a hobbie, but it doesn't seem like enough. I am furloughed (work in the travel industry), have no significant other, and it is hard every day to stay focused and grieve at the same time. I have no idea if I can even go back to work or if I will have to start over in another industry until it bounces back. Any suggestions for me? It seems so overwhelming right now.   


Thank you for the help, I appreciate it.",04May2020,1
375,"I‚Äôm graduating college in a few weeks, and it was obviously switched to a virtual graduation because of COVID. As a quick background, it took me way too long to graduate because I had so many family problems that took away my focus from school. I‚Äôm so proud that I actually went back and finished. That makes this all the more important for me.

To make this graduation feel somewhat special/real even though it‚Äôs virtual, I thought it would be nice to have both my parents over to watch the virtual graduation. (Before anyone attacks me, it would just be those 2, we would do this outside, more than 6 ft apart, wear masks if necessary still, and it wouldn‚Äôt be for another few weeks when hopefully things are a little better). 

My parents had a fairly nasty divorce bc my mom was an awful alcoholic. She cheated on my dad. My dad is the best person ever to walk the planet earth, no joke. It‚Äôs been 7 years since they divorced, and she‚Äôs since gotten sober (5 years) and has done everything she can to make up for what she did to me. She hasn‚Äôt really had the chance to do that for my dad, and he wouldn‚Äôt want to have it anyways. 

Back to graduation.  I asked my dad if he would be okay with the both of them coming over to watch, and he FLIPPED at me. He said things like he couldn‚Äôt believe I would ask him such a thing. I told him I thought he could just suck it up for one day as this is one of the most important days of my life. He angrily and hastily told me ‚Äúfine‚Äù, but then proceeded to say a bunch of statements to make me feel guilty like ‚Äúthat woman ruined my entire life‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are making me do something that is so incredibly uncomfortable for me‚Äù. 

I feel like it‚Äôs important to note that my dad is my best friend. He is literally the best dad in the world. But when we fight, it hurts a thousand times worse than it could with anyone else. To hear him say those things broke my heart. 

Am I being unreasonable to ask for such a thing? I feel like it‚Äôs supposed to be my day. They separated 7 years ago. He‚Äôs usually a very forgiving person. I get that I‚Äôm asking a lot, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much. I just want to be with my family as I graduate. That‚Äôs literally it. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of what else I could do? It‚Äôs supposed to be a live ceremony on YouTube, so I don‚Äôt think I could do it twice and even if I could, I don‚Äôt really want to sit through the same 2 hours ceremony twice with each individual parent. I‚Äôm open to suggestions though. It‚Äôs obviously hard to be creative with what I can do because of all these different measures in place. 

TLDR: my divorced parents refuse to be around each other for my virtual graduation (social-distancing friendly) and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being unreasonable to ask them to both be there for me. What else can I do?",04May2020,1
376,"Look whenever I get get excited it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWhoa cant wait,THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME‚Äù then what ever I was excited about never happens.about 2 years ago my dad was looking at houses and told me and my older sister that he talked to some guy that could help him get a big nice house,he showed us the blue prints of the house,he even drove me my brother my sister and my mom to see it.But it never happened because money issues.Fast forward to 2 days ago I found out my dad is looking into the same thing the big nice houses.

378,"Sorry for the long post, buckle up. 

I was friends with this girl, let's name her Rea, since childhood- we met in kindergarten. Me and Rea grew to be incredibly close, as did her and my sister. We were all best friends for the next eleven or so years of our lives, and I couldntve asked for a better friend.

She was amazing. She always listened to my problems, and helped me through some of the more difficult times in my life.
When we were both sixteen, she came out as openly bisexual. While I was still confused on my sexual orientation, I found so much solace in Rea. She helped me work through it, and I could tell her anything. Eventually, I knew I was bisexual myself- because I developed feelings for her.

Skip to 2019, where the three of us (Me, my sister, and Rea) all had a sleepover.
Things were going amazingly, and me and Rea were in my room alone. It's always been a thing with me that I'm very shy when it comes to ladies, and we joked around. Things got a little heated, and we had a moment- basically, lots of sexual tensity, her straddling me and pinning me to the bed, brushing lips together, that shit. My sister came back and saw us, so we stopped, and everything went to normal, and the sleepover went fine without any further actions between me and Rea. 

Now, here's where it all goes downhill.

My sister seemed very angry, both at me and at Rea. I was on edge, and I went to my room to clean up and play my videogame. I come out of my room a few hours later, and there my sister is, talking to my pastor and my parents. 

Apparently, my sister and Rea shared a bed the last night. Rea began to get playful (touching my sister up, basically, touching her breasts, etc) and my sister told her to stop. Rea stopped- and let me say this again. She /did stop/ immediately after my sister requested her to,and apologized for her actions. Everything was fine after that apparently.
I was about to say something before my sister turned to me, and said, ""What about you? Did something happen to you?"" She was glaring fucking daggers at me. Wanting me to tell or else.

Of course.

So, she began to speak, and I stepped up, and told her what happened between me and Rea. My parents instantly forbid me from having contact with her, and my sister ghosted her, my pastor rejected her. This obviously broke my heart, but because I was in an already horrible mental state, I didn't want to add onto the plate, and I bid my friend farewell. 

It's been a year since this has happened, and my feelings for my friend haven't died. I want to contact her again and see her, but I'm terrified if the consequences. My sister has contacted people who've abused me in the past, and my parents haven't done a thing to her, but because of the nature of the situation (they're homophobic), I'm scared of how they'd react, let alone how my sister would. 
However. Losing my best friend and crush of eleven years to something so trivial and seemingly minor is killing me. I respect my sister's feelings, and if I contact Rea, I'll most likely tell my sister first- but I doubt anything she said could stop me, if I decide to do this. I'm sick of being away, sick of having pushed someone so close to me away from me. 
So, Reddit. What should I do? Would it be an asshole move to contact her, or should I go for it?",04May2020,1

Lately, I've been finding slug tracks inside my laundry room which is next to my porch in my backyard. The place is well insulated to my knowledge and there's no holes or anything under the door. Anyway, after seeing these tracks I became suspicious but ruled it out as maybe a couple of stragglers on my shoes. After all, it has been a bit rainier lately, I live in California. Last night I came face to face with a demon. A HUGE garden slug about 2 inches long. I was scared shitless. I have a special relationship with slugs and by that I mean I hate and fear them. At first, I thought it was a cat turd it was so big. After having a stroke I picked it up with a plastic fork and flung out into my front yard hoping a bird would eat it. I thought that was the end of the mutated slug drama. Tonight I find myself in the kitchen at 1 am and I see two more sitting there. One of them is eating granola. I am horrified and scared for my life. I look at my backyard porch and there's 6 waiting to get in. How? I don't know! All of them both inside and outside ones are also huge not as big as the first one though. I fear the stuff in the granola is altering their DNA. How long was the first one sneaking around and where was it hiding? I am trembling in fear and I'm scared to go out into my kitchen/laundry room for fear of coming across these invaders. They're taking control of my household and I can't do anything about it. What do I do? Where are they hiding? HOW ARE THEY GETTING IN?????",04May2020,1

385," I don\`t know how to start it. English is not my native language so I am sorry if my post sounds weird. I suffer from anxiety and its cousin depression. But lately things were improving in my life. So I started to nail down the exact source of anxiety as some big improvements didn\`t remove it. And I found it . I cant live just for myself. People say do hobbies, draw, play games etc. But the root problem is, I need to live for another person. Life is very boring if it is all about me. No. I have to live for another person, for my future family, or just for my friend. But all around me are very incredible toxic people. I am that person who draws something, surprises with something, understands you very deeply, someone you can connect with. Others know this too - so they just use me and toss me down when they no longer want to spend time. I removed them from my life, I have confidence now - but how can I find good people? because if that someone doesnt exist, there is no meaning of life for me. And its just my philosophy - this thought is NOT caused by anxiety, it is just part of me. How can I find that someone? It is killing me. There is so much potential inside me.",04May2020,1

387,"My boyfriend got out of a really bad marriage a couple years ago and his mom has acknowledged many times that they were not good for each other and that they should have never gotten married. They got married semi-young because they felt like it was something they should do after being together for so long and was just an overall bad, toxic relationship. His mom has even told me how she never liked her as much as she wished to because of how depressed she made him, although he still had a lot of trouble getting over her. When I came over the first time to her house, she still had their engagement pictures displayed which I thought was kind of odd. Then the next time i came over, the engagement pictures were gone but I noticed she still kept photos up in the house of trips she had gone on with them (also, it‚Äôs not like it was a special trip that she just happened to be on, which I would understand, it was a trip that his mom goes on about 3 times every couple months lol) . I have been over there multiple times and still has pictures of her and my boyfriend around the house. I asked my boyfriend why she keeps them up (I was not mad at my boyfriend and am aware he cannot control his moms actions lol) but was just curious. He said because they were together for 8 years, that his mom probably keeps them up because it was still a huge part of his life that happened and she is still friends with his ex-wife‚Äôs mom. Although I completely understand that, I feel like it is just a respect thing? Just because they were together for a while doesn‚Äôt mean it is necessary to keep old couple photos of them up when he is in a healthier/happier relationship (that she has acknowledged).

389,"I have already posted this a ton of times but I just can't get a conclussion or I keep putting more details.

Three weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend because he said that he wanted to suicide once he was older (in 50 years or so, he said) at first I asked for some time for him to realize that what he was saying was horrible but he said he should just end it. He has anxiety so that was kind of part of why I asked for time too. For him to get better because it god bad, specially now in quarantine.

A week later, I texted him telling him I wanted him to go to therapy and basically that I cared for him. I kind of wanted him to say we were just over because I somehow couldn't get that idea into my head. After some talking I told him we could try again if I could see he was getting better. The next day I totally regretted it and told him so, because I thought it would be cruel not to. He never answered me to this, I never knew if he even saw them.

Now (One week after I told him we should end up already) I'm regretting it again. He was such a sweet guy, we were making plans, he was willing to move to Canada with me (Moving to Canada is my dream). Talking to him made quarantine so, very much, more easy. I can't stop thinking if he saw my messages, I can't stop thinking thta he hasn't deleted our photos from his social media, I can't stop thinking he might hate me. I don't know if I should tell him how I feel because I keep changing my mind. I feel so lost, I don't know who to talk to. I feel confused. At times I don't even know how I feel.

391,When i was around 6 years old i heard my parents having sex. We lived in a two room house and in one we had both beds. My parents and mine. One night turned into many. Its like somehow during the night i would wake up to my parents having sex. I dont know how but i then discovered masturbation. I then discovered porn when i was a little older. I am now 22 (f) and i still masturbate and watch porn. I have always been good at school but ever since i was little all i would think about was sex. Sex was constantly on my mind and that's all i could think about. I feel like me thinking about sex enabled me to focus to my full potential in school. I am going to graduate college next week but i feel like i didnt enjoy it very much or tried as hard. Its been really hard for me to focus in school. I also have a father who abuses drugs and alcohol. He has supported my family financially and i know he loves me but i just wish that he could have done more like being there for the emotional stuff. Or like when he missd my high school graduation for getting drunk. Things like that. I sometiems feel like i dont belong in the world. I have had so many friends and with them its like i smile and pretend to be someone im not but when i get home i feel so lonely. I have my parents and brother which i love and we have good times and lots of fun but when im alone i cry myself to sleep and feel so sad. Its like i pretend to be Someone i am not and once im by myself i feel so lonely. When i found out what masturbation was i still couldn't stop. When i first discovered it i just knew it felt good but didnt know what it was. I feel like my brain and my thoughts are so wrapped up in so many things and i cant think clearly. Nothing really makes me happy and its like i sometimes enjoy things but temporarily. There's not anything that i like that Sticks. I feel so damaged and i just never want to let people in and let them know my real self because i know that she is not worth or interesting enough to get to know. I have really bad trust issues especially with guys. I just dont think i could ever share this with someone who would want to be intimate with me. Like i could never reveal myself to anyone. They will think i am damaged and crazy. I just felt like i needed to put this out there. Eventhough ill be graduating school i dont feel anything because just the though of having to take that next step into the adult world scares me. I just wish I had never heard my parents having sex that night. I didnt have an innocent childhood and Ive been through so many things that i have lost count.

397,"This is my first ever post and there‚Äôs a lot of background info so please bear with me. 

So me (19f) and my boyfriend (20) have been together for just over two years. When we met we were both in high school living in our home state, about twenty minutes apart from each other. A few months after we started dating, my boyfriend moved to another state for college. We decided to do long distance. It was challenging because he‚Äôs not good at answering his phone and I often felt ignored because I would go all day without hearing from him. 

We did this for about a year, seeing each other every few months until I graduated and wound up going to the same college as him. (I didn‚Äôt go because of him, I genuinely like the school). Anyway, we decided to move in together, which was back in august. 

Things were good, but a few weeks into it, I learned that his mom had no idea we were living together. This is relevant because she was the one who bought the house we were living in. I had specifically asked my boyfriend to ask her permission before I moved in since it was technically her house and he lied and said she was fine with it. If I had known it wasn‚Äôt okay, I wouldn‚Äôt have moved in. I was upset that he lied to his mom and to me. I pushed him to tell her, but he said he would lose the place if she knew. He wanted to wait until the place was officially closed on and presumably in his name. I agreed mainly because I had nowhere else to go and I figured when she found out it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad. 

Well this was in September and then a few months later in January, we are both back in our home state for winter break. My boyfriend calls me and says he has something to tell me. He says that he failed out of school and is moving back to our home state and his mom found out I was living with him and I need to find a new place to live. I had no idea he was failing. I also didn‚Äôt agree with him moving back because I thought there were other ways of handling the situation, but apparently this had already been decided. I was angry that I had to find a new place to live. I ended up moving back home for two months until I could find an apartment near my school (they don‚Äôt have any dorms or anything). I found a place and moved in last month. 

He was here visiting me with his family for about a month, but ‚Äúhad to go back‚Äù because he needed to ‚Äúget work done‚Äù. I told him he can do whatever he wants and he doesn‚Äôt have to go back just because his parents are going back, plus there is no work for him to do because of quarantine. (All he‚Äôs been doing is playing video games since he got back.) Before he left, I fell and broke my foot, and I asked him if he could stay with me until it heals because I live alone and don‚Äôt really have anyone else and he was already there. He said no, which I wouldn‚Äôt have minded as much if he were actually doing things. 

So now we are doing long distance again and I really hate it. I try not to be demanding of him, but I really like talking to him and stuff, but he‚Äôs not good at texting me back. I don‚Äôt like feeling ignored, but I also don‚Äôt want to seem like a bitch. He‚Äôs been acting very immature lately and given what happened a few months ago, I feel betrayed. Even though I got past the pain of being lied to and kicked out of what I thought was my home, I still feel like I can‚Äôt trust him. He has a habit of telling people what they want to hear and not following through. I‚Äôve been asking him when he‚Äôs gonna come back and see me and he isn‚Äôt giving me a straight answer. He says soon and I say when and he doesn‚Äôt say anything and then I say I don‚Äôt believe him. 

If he doesn‚Äôt want to come, I want him to say so and stop beating around the bush. I just want him to be honest with me, and I try not to judge him, so I don‚Äôt know why he would feel uncomfortable telling me straight up. I feel fed up with dealing with his immaturity and I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm considering breaking things off. I don‚Äôt know how I should handle this situation. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about how I feel, but it gets me nowhere. I just want to see his actions match his words for once. 

Is it stupid of me to stay with him after everything that‚Äôs happened? I really love him and I want to make it work, but I feel like he doesn‚Äôt consider me at all. I‚Äôm really torn up because I‚Äôve never been in this situation before (he‚Äôs the first and only person I‚Äôve ever dated/been in a relationship with). 

I want to know how I can talk to him about this and how to know if and when this relationship has run it‚Äôs course.

Of course i dont pick up cause i wasnt sure who it was and i tried to call back but it wasnt possible

Then i get a text message: ¬´Hey Teacher, i have to talk about something with your student¬ª

So i was thinking (without responding): Wait what? im a student, not a TEACHER...

Then i see another text message coming from that SAME number: ¬´Hey *my real name*, i accidentally texted your teacher, but i want to talk to you in a real life meeting at school this Thursday¬ª (12 in the morning)

SENT FROM MY PRINCIPAL.

- i have 1 friend and i texted him for help RIGHT AWAY, he told me i should NOT admit to anything, even if they show screenshots

You probably understand that i dont wanna admit to it, and i really wanna get away with this

im sweating for some reason, and my heart is beating really fast, but i just wanna know: 
HOW DID THEY EVEN KNOW ITS ME?

So maybe it really was the police that came at my door? ... and why hasnt my crush removed me from ANY social media?

Do you think my crush knows about it or is it just her ex?

- WHAT do i tell my parents when i go to school: ¬´i got a NORMAL meeting with my TEACHER?¬ª

is that a good enough lie to my parents? i HAVE to lie in this situation TRUST ME

- im sorry but i REALLY need help i hope you understand",04May2020,1

401,"Earlier this month I got accepted into a scholarship program run by the state department to study in Germany for my senior year.Because of covid, the program was cut to just one semester. I was disappointed, but at least I would get to spend half of my senior year with my friends and finishing my final year in my sports.

I thought that would be my plan, but recently I was accepted into another state department program that I wasn't expecting. This one will let me go to north Macedonia for my senior year, and as of now it is still a full year program. (This is because the German program is mainly funded by Germany, so they call the shots on the duration.)

Now I'm really confused because I don't know what I want to do. German seems like a more useful language. If I choose that, I'd get to finish my credits easily, be with my friends, and is a simpler option in general.

but the Macedonian program is a full year, it's run by better people, and I get paid to go in that program. It seems more rewarding, but I'd have to do online courses while abroad.

I hate not knowing what's going to happen in the future with this covid because that directly impacts this. I feel like the Macedonian program has a chance of being cut to only half a year too, but I honestly have no idea. It depends on what happens in the coming months with border closures and stuff.",04May2020,1

Today, was a particular tough day on top of this he has heart issues and is just overall a ticking time bomb strapped to a Lamborghini on a highway to hell‚Äôs gates. His blood pressure was down for awhile today as he sat in the garage with my mother and I as we waited for him to get better to be able to go up the stairs. 

It never came so he went to the hospital to get a blood transfusion. At the hospital he had x rays and tests done. Eventually showing that he has a kidney infection. He was given antibiotics and was told to stay at the hospital for further treatment, but decided he knew better and left on his own accord. 

As I write this it‚Äôs 4:44 in the morning approximately 2 hours ago he gets a call telling him he is at heightened risk of a heart attack and really needs to get back into the hospital. He says no. 

I was on the phone with the hospital less than 30 minutes ago the woman on the phone tells me he really really needs to go in. 

I tried calling my brother and sister to see if one of them could convince the my dad but no one is awake. I can‚Äôt call an ambulance I think because what emergency is there? Just a dying man‚Äôs wishes to be left alone as he pretends he‚Äôs reliving a more sedentary version of his 20s

403,This might be a long one so strap yourselves in for this one. Lately I've been having a hard sleeping i'm  17 and m so i'm not sure how much that can affect my sleep schedule. I have a lot of emotional and psychological issues i can't talk to about with any of my family which has made life really hard. I've had trouble sleeping most of my life. When i was in my early childhood i couldn't sleep well. My brother who is 6 years older than me took out his frustration on me and a lot of his personal issues by attacking me. This made me angry all the time and frustrated and i couldn't sleep because of this. After this time my parents got divorced and i stayed with my mom one week then the next with my dad. I would frequently pull all nighters then go to school i also missed a lot of school in these times as well. Skip to now where i can stay up for 24 hours no problem or more i get like 8 hours of sleep then i'm awake for 18 hours. I can't sleep my mind is running at a million miles per hour constantly thinking about what i'm going to do and just planning out things. I love learning new things and i try to learn as much as i can every day i watch youtube all the time channels like Thunderfoot Scishow stuff like that. It almost feels like i will forget everything tomorrow or that there's no guarantee for tomorrow and that sleeping could mean that i will die or something like that it just feels like everything could end by giving in and sleeping.

409,"Back story:

To keep this as short as I can. My family consists of my Mom, Dad, my half-brother (We share the same mom), my younger brother, and me. My half-brother has been in and out of our lives since I was around 10 I think. He really doesn‚Äôt get along with my dad and there have been multiple altercations between them over the years. When I was just entering high school we found that my brother had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. Before I knew it my brother and his expecting girlfriend were living in our guest room. Things took a turn for the worst soon after my nephew was born. My brother and his girlfriend were constantly fighting, and soon we were calling the cops on them weekly. My dad ended up kicking him out after a particularly bad incident involving my nephew. Things have been messy ever since and I haven‚Äôt seen my nephew in about 4-5 years. 

So 8 months ago. After not talking to my brother for about 3 years he starts to reappear when my parents are going through a separation. He tells my mom he wants to move in and help her keep things afloat for a while. Things were going good for about a month and then he suddenly stopped going to work. He was doing nothing but playing video games all night and sleeping all day. This is when we find out that he has knocked up his new gf and she is due in a few months. He told us that their relationship is pretty rocky but he wants to be a part of his child‚Äôs life. After his girlfriend gave birth, she and the baby moved in. 

That brings us to now. My niece is now two months old and the only way she can express her needs is to cry. My brother has very low patience and has been getting frustrated with her very easily. His girlfriend is back to work and has early shifts, so he should be taking care of her during the nights and she should take care of her during the day. Lately though it has gotten to the point where my mom watches her all night because all he does when she cries is yell in her face. He will yell things like, ‚ÄúWill you shut the fuck up!‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you run out of oxygen, so you will pass out already!‚Äù Then he will swaddle her super tight and keep tightening it every time she starts to scream louder. This happens nightly. Watching it happen makes me sick, and I really have no idea how to handle the situation. It seems like everyone is aware of what is going on but they continue to brush it off. I really can‚Äôt handle seeing this happen any more. If any one could offer some insight I would really appreciate it!!

Tl;dr: My brother is very aggressive. He has been yelling at his newborn because he's fed up with her crying.",04May2020,1

In the last few days I seem to have developed a significantly troubling insomnia. I am no longer feeling naturally sleepy or tempted to go to bed, and this has often led to me stating awake on account of not being tired.

Hey guys, I need some input. Some background info: I(18) am currently enrolled in a local community college pursuing a major in psychology, and eventually transferring to obtain a doctorate in a neuropsychology-related field, which honestly I‚Äôm mostly only considering because my psychologist mother told me would make good money. I do find the course work very interesting though. However, I myself struggle with ADHD, so 8+ years of school seems very daunting, not to mention the financial aspect. I‚Äôve started considering training to become a firefighter, which my girlfriend‚Äôs dad, who is also a firefighter, said he could help me with. I‚Äôve also considered becoming a beach lifeguard and moving up, maybe also enlisting  in the coastguard. 

However there‚Äôs a speed bump in those plans. 

I have very bad eyesight, to the point where I can only see around 5 inches in front of me w/o correction. In order to realistically pursue either of those, I would need laser eye surgery, which I cannot afford without borrowing money from family. So, I can either stick with my current plan of 8+years of school, which scares me immensely, or get laser eye surgery and completely upend my current lifestyle to pursue a less paying job, but with less student loans and emotional drainage. 

Tl;dr
I need input on whether I should attend college for 8 more years with a potential for emotional burnout and financial loss for a high paying job, or get laser eye surgery to pursue another career.

I just want to clarify something first,  according to doctors I have spoken to recently, I do not have insomnia, and also I will not take medication. I often get these half-assed responses from people I know that are just like ""Oh yeah just take these sleeping pills, that's gonna make it easier to fall asleep"" or ""No no, just like stay up one night and fall asleep at the right time and keep doing that until it sticks with you"". If those seem like an appropriate responses to you, then you probably wont really be helping me out.

Alright, I noticed that recently I have been having some serious problems with falling asleep. I often feel tired at night and even hoping to go to sleep soon, but for some reason I prioritize staying up and thinking about stuff, or watching videos, or something like that. Like I just cant lay down and turn all the lights off, I (for some reason) decide it would be better to stay up and think, or watch videos. I heard that reading books helps, but I don't think it actually does for me because I suppose I just get interested and keep reading and thinking about the book. Podcasts may work, but I will likely get interested in the topics and stay up again. What do you think will help my body realize that it is way better to go to sleep and wake up well rested then do whatever it wanted to do at night, rather than try to do stuff inefficiently at night, wake up really late, feel awful, and repeat the process next time?

Should I just work with SO instead of finding another job? We don't have problems working together with one another. And of course i like working together cos it means more time spent together!

The chat usually goes pretty silent and our group chat has pretty much died now, at least the one I'm a part of. I'm not calling them out on social media or lecturing them daily, but when they bring up dumb ideas I don't hesitate to point it out.

Some background: they organized a big surprise party for one of our friends a few months ago which I attended. They organized a ""social distancing"" movie night for another friends birthday a few weeks before my birthday. My boyfriend and I did not attend. I wished them a happy birthday and left it at that cause he was surrounded by our other friends and was having a movie night with them. Maybe I would have called them if I didn't feel like such an asshole for having to point out a potluck during a pandemic is not ok. I was feeling pretty down thinking everyone hated me for not agreeing with them, they were all very excited about this outdoor movie night and I kinda buzzkilled it. 

So my birthday rolled around and... Nobody called me. No one face timed me or asked how my day was. Just did the obligatory "" happy b day"" in the chat and moved on, most of them anyway a few just ignored it all together. They know I've been isolating with only my bf and havent seen or talked on the phone to any one of them in weeks while they have been hanging out with eachother almost everyday. 

I luckily got to chat with some other long distance friends.

But that piled on top of how I was already feeling really hurt me. We haven't talked at all since and I'm taking this as a sign I've been voted off the island. If I do say anything in the group no one really responds or acknowledges it.

What makes this incredibly difficult is a lot of them are my boyfriends best friends since they were kids. They havent been very chatty with him either. I feel extremely excluded and isolated as these were the only people I spent my time with before COVID.

Should I just leave silently and take the hint?

Am I overreacting?

Should I say something? How could I say anything without looking like a desperate weirdo? 

Sorry this is so long and ranty just feeling a lot of feels",04May2020,1
435,"Hello~ (This is quite long sorry)
My older step sister warned me to get dependent as soon as I graduate cause my mom and my step dad would want me to be dependent towards them and I would miss my chance to basically be a grown up.
 This had been on my mind for the past year or so and it isn't exactly a big issue but it's been giving me a lot of pressure and stress at the moment, so I would like to hear your opinion and some advice if you can.

I'm currently living as a senior student (currently 17) in Australia. My mother has been taking care of me since I was 4 and she is now engaged with my step dad.

My mom is a good person, she works nearly every day to pay off her loans (she had to give money to my fathers family) and to pay off my schooling, food, house, pets ect. 

However, for some time now I've noticed she's quite manipulative towards me. There are so many stories in my journal when I was younger of broken promises, hurtful words and negative rants from my mom about my father and his family (this influenced me to basically ignore my dad until he died, which I really regret).

However, most hurtful thing she did so far, whcih made me realise that I need to move out was when I opened about my breakdown (cut my hair cause I'm basic). I explained to her about my growing nihilism, depressive episodes and stress. This is where she recalled on an experience from when  my dad thought she was cheating on him which caused her to feel depressed. She then told me that she 'got over that' and that I should to. She then ended her lecture by basically saying that hurting myself would put me in hell.

Now that I'm ending my high school years, I choose to go to take a course in Social Work or Psycology in New Zealand.
My mom always said that she was supportive in anything I would choose to do, before my senior year started but now shes nagging me and leturing me on choosing to take medicine, nursing, dentistry, ect. 
I understand that she just wants me to get a stable job where the demand is high, but I've got backup financial plans,  I've been talking to career councilors, adults with a similer job to my desired degree/course and messaging students in the uni I want to go to.  I've never told her this cause it would just end with a fight.

My mom and I aren't open with each others and whenever I would try to share my feelings or share my plans in the future, I can never finish cause she would spend hours lecturing me and finally concluding on what I should do and believing she 'helped me'.

She is a good person though, shes helped a lot of people, she really did her best to raise me on her own and she didn't deserve all the crap she got when she was younger. I do feel really guilty trying to do move away, but I want to be independent and start my own life instead of always being a side character in hers.
So if you could share any stories on how you moved out for uni or some advice it would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you :)",04May2020,1

However, I've seen so manh computer science majors be so faat. I wouldn't mind this except that it takes me back to those days of constantly being bullied. In fact,  I almost killed myself because of all the fat-shaming (it wasnt just at school, my father always called me a pig and told me many times to go kill myself).So, I just need to know, can one be skinnh and a computer scienec major, yes or no?

So, should I consider risking discrimination and reiginitjng trauma? I really do love video games, and if I could, I wish I could go back to being straight and homophobic sometimes, like I was 4 years ago. What should I do?
Edit: I also want to major in comp sci since I want tob

442,"Okay, gamers, for the first time in my life I cannot see my options. Let me provide you with a little background. 22 yr old male, I have called one person my girlfriend in my life and she dumped me when I was 16. That was my first heartbreak and I couldn't understand how something like that could happen to me. After some time struggling with my emotions, I got my act together. Free of my addictions and back to normal thanks to my closest friends and family. I was happy and where I wanted to be in life. for a while. Up until two weeks ago when my beloved golden retriever stopped eating. I watched her lose weight hoping she would get better, eventually, she required help going to the bathroom and that was when I decided to do what was best for her. these past weeks have been terrible to me, I have had too many anxiety attacks to count, even syncopes. the anxiety has become so unbearable I can't breathe half of the time. I have been to a doctor, I am on medication to help. Last night my friend shows up at my house and tells me to get ready we got a party to go to. he knew I was upset and wanted to get me out of the house. 

We go to this party in another friends backyard and there's a fire, a bong going around plenty of booze. I was in fucking heaven, smoking, drinking having the time of my life. (it was a small gathering no more than 10 ppl ;) halfway into the night my Best Friend decides he's going to invite this girl over that he fucked a couple nights ago. I thought nothing of it just kept smoking talking shit, I was getting kind of a buzz, and not too much later this girl shows up. Real pretty broad, 20 years old and fine as fuck. this is the girl my boy had a one night stand with. she sits down beside him and makes some chit-chat, but I know my homie and I could see he wasn't interested in her. she sat there quietly before going inside to go to the bathroom. at that moment he had already moved on to talking to various other girls that are there. 20 minutes go by I thought she had left I gotta piss. I go inside to the guest bathroom there because it's on the other side of the house with a tv and retro porn mags. epic right? I open the door and she's sitting there on the tub wiping her eyes. I looked away and pulled the door shut before slowly opening it again to ask if she was okay. now I found myself in the bathroom alone with this gorgeous girl telling me how she's so ugly because my friend doesn't want to have a relationship with her. I was her shoulder to cry on. After comforting her and listening to her she pretty much ran out of words and so did i. I knew the conversation was dead at this point and she was no longer crying. in a short awkward moment of silence, I poked her under the ribcage just to see if she was ticklish, soon enough we're struggling on the floor I end up on top of her and we make out. we rejoined the group and sat by the fire just talking and feeling each other up till morning. have thought about her nonstop since. (22 hrs) 

should I talk to my friend and see how he actually feels about this girl and give it a shot? or am i just looking for something to latch into in place of my dog dying? all and any advice is welcome here.  


  
TL;DR     my best friend fucked this girl and broke her heart and now i think i might be falling for her. am i simp or what?",04May2020,1
443,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôll try to keep this short n sweet :)

So I decided to take on a foster puppy a few weeks ago. She is such a sweet little pup and she‚Äôs completely stolen my heart, and my other dog loves her as well. 

This is the problem. I feel like I‚Äôm having to choose between keeping her or going to school and being able to travel to see my boyfriend. I know it sounds really selfish but I‚Äôll try to explain.

Her foster period is up in a couple more weeks when she gets neutered and officially goes up for adoption. Foster parents have first choice of course. I LOVE this puppy and I want to keep her. But with my school schedule (I‚Äôm an engineering student), working full time, and traveling over two hours once a month to see my boyfriend I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôll be able to give her the attention she deserves.

To further clarify about my boyfriend - he loves her too, but it‚Äôs been making it very difficult for us to have any quality time together having her there. We barely see each other as it is and there will will be no date nights or much hiking this summer.

I know I probably sound stupid and selfish, but I want what‚Äôs best for everyone involved, including the pup.

Should I adopt her and try to continue to fit her into my already packed schedule or help her find another family?",04May2020,1
444,"I (23F) have been currently staying at my boss' (61F) house the past 2 months (going on 3mos.) since being stranded due to the quarantine.

Aside from her, we also have his son (30ish M), his 4-year-old son, another 12-year-old grandson (of my boss'), and two middle-aged household help (both F) in the house.

A little back info: I live in a small town we'll call Orange Island. Our place of work is also there. However, I was stranded here at (let's say) Apple City due to a business trip. My boss lives here at Apple City, has a home here in Apple City, but her work assigned her to Orange Island. So she often travels back and forth. It just so happened that we were both here when the lockdown happened.

For my entire duration here, they have fed me well and have even given me my own room. However, my boss would never, NEVER take money I would offer to contribute in the house. Although, from time to time she borrows from me from as little as $10 up to maybe $100 (for when she orders groceries). When she pays me back, I try not to take it (as a form of paying my contri) but she would have none of it. It's like having an argument with your grandma who insists on feeding you all too much because ""you're too thin, child!"" Anyway, you get the picture.

When I get home after lockdown, I plan to pay her back ""in kind"" by giving her the stuff she really likes from Orange Island. These meant mostly food like fresh produce, fish (i can't stress how much she likes eating the fish from our island), and other delicacies there. My parents can get these easily and have offered to do so.

The thing is: I still also want to pay her back with money. 

How do I sneakily pay her back??

446,"As a full time student in college working a full time job, I get stressed out. Well recently the covid-19 virus has put me in online school which is much harder for me to keep up with. So naturally I am falling behind in school and working as a security guard for a Walmart. 

So as I am sitting in bed after a 10 hour shift I start feeling really sad about what is going on in my life. I start to think of things that could make it worse. I start to think what if my girlfriend broke up with me on our anniversary this next Wednesday; that would make my life much worse. I start to imagine myself sitting on the side of the road as my girlfriend drives off telling me just minutes ago that it was all a joke. That's when the theater of my mind starts to picture myself halfway as shadow and person joined at the waist.

I instantly went into a state of revenge and thought in detail of how I would take my revenge on her and her family. All of which I don't want to write here. 

So her I am now, in bed, thinking what the hell was all of that. I have read up on the psychology of what Carl Jung called ""The Shadow"". He said that the shadow was the part of the human soul that reached all the way down to hell.

Now do t get me wrong, I love my girlfriend and her family. I want to marry this girl. But I was just so shocked that I could even begin to imagine the things that I could do to her.

Hi Reddit! üòä This post may be a little confusing and all over the place, but it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been worried about and am attempting to put into words, so I‚Äôm thankful for any advice or input anyone might have. With that being said, I struggle with anxiety, depression, and PTSD to please be kind to me. ü§óüíì

Two and a half years ago I decided to go blonde, (which may have been a result of getting out of an abusive relationship but that‚Äôs irrelevant)
 Anyway, I was starting from dark brown (almost black) hair that had been dyed using henna and as I assume most of you don‚Äôt know, you can‚Äôt bleach hair that has henna on it so I was only able to bleach the parts that were grown out, thus having to cut the parts that weren‚Äôt. So I was left with hair a little past my collarbone and although it was cute and I rocked it for a while, I missed my long hair so I ended up getting tape-in hair extensions. I‚Äôve been wearing them ever since, for the past year and a half.

Fast forward to last summer, I ended up falling in love with an old friend from my hometown named John, despite him not being ready for a relationship and still being in love with his ex (sad I know) I ended up cutting him off and we barley spoke for the last 9 months besides an insta DM he sent saying he was sorry and loved me....I replied back (dumb I know)

Now this month of May 2020, John and I have reconnected again and he‚Äôs asked me multiple times to come over to his house, (here‚Äôs where my hair problem comes into play) my tape-in extensions are growing out to the point where they‚Äôre almost visible and it‚Äôs time to take them out in a couple days, and I have to do them myself since were under lockdown and I‚Äôm not able to go to any hair salon. So I‚Äôm wondering what to do... I don‚Äôt want to rock my natural hair because John told me out of nowhere that he loves my hair (I‚Äôm not sure if he knew they were extensions) so I may feel weird not wearing them around him, and my natural hair is so much more thin, brittle, and short without them. I could always wear clip-ins, or I could hangout with him in the next couple of days while my tape-ins are still in. But apart of me thinks I should maybe make him wait a little like he did to me.

What would be the best thing to do? 
I appreciate any advice or comments in advance. Thank you.",04May2020,1

So I don't really know where to begin, this is going to be all over the place so strap in I guess. I just kind of hit kind of a rock bottom I think? I was talking to this cam girl from Colombia and I guess from maybe a combination of bigotry and loneliness, sometimes I think that I can convince some foreign girl to move and be with me in order to live in America. Either that or I just feel so different that there's no way I could be compatible with anyone in my entire country. Anyway, I was kind of probing that sort of thing because I guess I thought it could work and it turned out she was totally irritated by it. Who knew?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a time when society and pop culture really put a lot of pressure on teenagers to lose their virginity and honestly, I really resent that. At 18 I found myself in a relationship and even though I didn't escalate myself or really try to even have sex, I lost my virginity to my first gf. Mostly because it seemed like what I was ""supposed"" to do, and in retrospect I believe that this is my biggest regret. We had a really unhealthy relationship for about a year and a half, and later I did a terrible thing which I will not specify. But I will say that it made me quite dislike myself. Enough to basically self-sabotage, and eventually try to kill myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 25, have no real experience with women, and even though I really don't know what I want (more on that later) I'm pretty sure that my time is over. I seem to only elicit disgust or mild hatred from a lot of women, and to those that do like me I push them away. I don't really see ever succeding per se, and I don't really like being rejected especially when it seems virtually certain. But also, I guess I see myself as ""tainted"" or otherwise deeply flawed. I would have liked to meet a nice girl and waited until marriage. But now there's no reason to wait, and I don't like cheap sex because it makes me uncomfortable, so I would have to kind of deny sex if that's what she wanted. Plus I have these horrific scars on my body that would be very difficult to reveal. Idk I'm just deeply insecure about sex in general and I feel like there's this pressure to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I don't know if I would want to get married or have kids either. I mean, in my heart that is probably what I want but I've seen so much divorce. Three between my parents. Plus a couple long-term relationships each, and an engagement. And my sister is now separated to my brother-in-law. They're raising my niece and nephew. (8 and 12) I don't think I'm emotionally mature enough to raise a child and I'd be no help as a parent as I was pretty much fully neglected through 80% of my childhood, so I have no real road map to go off of.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to next point, that my family is kind of a pile of shit too. My sisters are really unsupportive. One hates me because I'm a ""privileged white male"" and the other one basically just puts me down (at the risk of using pua terms, she ""beta-male shames"" me) and I resent the way they handled my almost dying. It was more of a drama to them, and to this day I don't think they really cared at all. My mom expects me to be Mr. Fucking happy all the time since the attempt but she suffers from major depression so she's constantly telling me how awful and terrible the world is, and she's not exactly supportive of the way I got better (I am now religious and \*gasp\* conservative, which by the way please don't let me be the ambassador of conservatism. I believe a lot of their ideas work but I have a hard time living them as I will describe later) she seems to have a problem with it. My dad abusive trash too I don't want anything to do with him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Generally, I just kind of resent the way I came up and I wish someone would have showed me a thing or two. Then I might not be so lost. Neglect also robbed me of an extremely useful tool, which is discipline. I am able to exhibit precisely 0 self control in most situations, which leads to me making lots of bad decisions. Plus it's made it very difficult to be interested in things, mostly because I lose interest in things as soon as I realize it requires effort. This usually results in me trying lots of things and giving up on them. Which leads to some guilt, depression and wasted money. Right now for example, since my expenses are low, I'm nearly out of debt, and I'm actually benefiting from the coronavirus because I've been deemed ""essential"" I was prepared to spend up to $700 on racing sim equipment and another $700 or more on gear to play Microsoft flight simulator when that comes out and get into simming. I might still do it but I gave up on cycling and reading and video games and music and lifting weights and so on and I spent far less on those so I'm worried that I could give up on that too. The problem is that doesn't really leave anything. I'm back where I started. It's kind of a paradox. I try to find things to fill my life because I know I won't experience the important things in life, only to not really be able to enjoy those distractions in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

462,"I have to get 7 teeth extracted. The pain has been intolerable for years but Ive been using pills to function. 
Pills dont work anymore and If I keep doing this I will literally be killing myself by putting off fixing my teeth. 
Im scared, terrified to be exact.
 Ive gobe to the doctors for smaller tooth issues but surgically removing my teeth is something that Im FUCKING terrified of. 
In my country, using anything but local anesthetic while getting dental surgery is illegal, no laughing gas or IV anesthetics or anything is possible and I cant afford going abroad to get it. 
I dont know how to face my fears and the fact that most people with anxiety can just get laughing gas or be put to sleep for the procedure is making me so angry because Ive been dealing with so much pain for years without the balls to get it done with just local anesthetic. 
Does anyone have a similar experience and if so, how the FUCK do i force myself to go?",04May2020,1
463,"Coronavirus is more important then my mental and social problems so no hard feelings if this gets ignored due to serious problems in which frontline workers or people dealing with corona need advice, they need it more then i do. Ever since the coronavirus quarantine thing has started my friends have started to act differently towards me, my friends almost 'ghost' me or just do not respond to me and when they do their responses are very closed, and do not allow for a longer conversation. I feel like this is a somewhat normal thing that is happening to me due to age or immaturity, but has happened before which is alarming. I have been on again and off again with the group of individuals i reference as friends, and the emotions i receive from them are similar emotions that i have felt from them when i am essentially temporarily 'kicked out' or in a way somewhat excluded from things. you can't force people to like you or be friends with you so it's something i have accepted. the thing that makes this rather challenging for me however is the loneliness that i experience because i simply do not like connect in a way with any other individual on what feels like this planet. I feel like no one understands me or gets me. Most people that read this may believe this is due to social isolation with quarantine but this has been an ongoing problem that i distract myself with by taking on addictions to gaming and abuse of things that worsen my physical health, the feeling of isolation. I could handle not having friends or even just like one person that could somewhat relate to me or help me with my mental issues, but i don't. i also feel deep frustration ultimately in trying to find someone of the other gender who will even give me the slightest bit of attention, for example no female i have tried to talk to or engage in a conversation reciprocates the effort or energy i put into trying to talk to them. the ultimate isolation or lack of a feeling that a person is there for me keeps me up an night yearning for a human connection. I wouldn't dare to say i feel suicidal feelings but i do get very low points i would say in my day to day life, which is really irritating because with a really low day i also will sometimes have a day where i feel great joy or happiness. the opposite feelings hurt me a lot. i went from crying in my shower at the beginning of the day to being happy because a female texted me about her personal experiences that made me believe she trusted me, ultimately leading me on. i hate that when people i live by reject me they attempt to do it nicely by saying ""you aren't my type"" or ""i don't do relationships"" or ""i don't want a boyfriend right now"" but i'll the same girl(s) who say those things on another guys story later on with a guy.",04May2020,1

467,"I didn't know where to post this, I'm sorry if it doesn't fit here. 

So, my grandma is 90 years old and she lives in a nursing home for half a year now. She has really bad  dementia and it decreased so fast in the last month. The nursing home thinks she will die in the next days. 

Due to the Corona Virus, my family couldn't go inside the nursing home and we had to go into the garden to see her. Then they brought her out and we weren't allowed to go near her (which I think is a great way to let families see their grandmas and grandpas). So we just stand there and sang the songs she used to sing with us.

Now that she doesn't have weeks left, the nursing home can't bring her outside and we are allowed to go in her room. We can even touch her and hug her but we aren't allowed to stay since there are many elders in the nursing home obviously.

Yesterday, we went to see her and we put a strong smelling hand lotion on her hand, so that she can smell us, while we are already gone.

I also think that she recognized me, because as I was going, she pressed my hand and looked me in the eyes with her big blue eyes for a while. Since she can't talk anymore, I think that this was her way, to ask, if we could stay. I cried the whole way home. 

I am so scared, that she will die all alone in her room. She loves her family so much and she's always been like a glue that sticks all of us together.

My Grandma earns it so much, to go by peace and with all of us around her.

So my question is, if anyone had or even has this situation right now and has an idea, how my family can comfort her during this time.",04May2020,1

474,"Where I live, we've been doing social distancing/quarantine for about 6 weeks. I hadn't seen my friend for a few weeks before that, since around the end of February. I've felt that we've been drifting apart for quite a while even before COVID. She calls me one of her best friends and I previously considered her one of mine but the reality is that we rarely talk 1-on-1, and mostly only hear from each other in a few group chats. 

For a bit of context, we have been friends since we were about 15 (we are now 20, almost 21). In high school, we were very close but the past 2 or 3 years I really feel like I don't recognize her. 2 years ago she got together with her current on-again, off-again bf. They have both cheated on each other multiple times and get in big fights constantly. Almost every week she says she's done with him for good and expects sympathy from our friendship group, only to get back together with him within a week every time. This has been going on constantly for 2 years. All of this is completely unlike how she was before she started dating him, but after 2 years of it I barely recognize her to be the person I became best friends with. I used to think she was a responsible person but now she refuses to social distance from her bf, who is constantly at her house, even though she lives with her mother and grandfather.

Now, due to COVID, I haven't seen her in months. We try to video chat but so far we haven't had a 1-on-1 call, only ones with other friends also there. Otherwise, our only communication is in group chats. I've realized that I actually don't miss seeing her. I feel like a terrible person because even though I found her behaviour frustrating and a bit alienating before, not seeing each other/talking to her directly has had basically no impact on me. While I look forward to seeing my other friends after this is over, I don't look forward to seeing her and almost dread it because I expect the same behaviour to continue. 

I don't know what to do. It would be very difficult to cleanly end the friendship because ALL of my friends are also friends with her. However, the fact that I really don't miss her tells me that to continue to ignore the obvious problems I have with her wouldn't be fair to her. The other aspect of the situation is that she has diagnosed depression but hasn't taken her meds in about 4 years. I worry about sending her into a spiral if I were to try to be completely honest about my feelings with her. She has some troubles in other areas of her life and constantly seems to be on the edge of a major breakdown or even doing something rash if she felt one more thing was going wrong in her life.

How do I handle this? I know I'm in the wrong for not telling her way sooner that I've been frustrated with her, and I really don't know how to tell her that I'm pretty sure social distancing made me realize our friendship is dying. Theoretically, it would be nice to be straightforward with her and then see if we can repair our relationship, but I don't know if she realizes anything is wrong in the first place, and I don't want to upset her.

Any advice would be great, especially if anyone has been in a similar situation. I know I let it go too long without addressing it but I would like to try to address it if that is still possible.",04May2020,1

476,"TL;DR at the end. Thanks for reading.

So I‚Äôve been dating a person for about 6 months. Everything is genuinely a dream come true, from personality to spirituality we click and bring each other happiness and joy just existing together.

I have exactly one issue within our relationship; a core value of mine. 

My partner has had sex with more than 15 partners. The issue I have isn‚Äôt the sex, it‚Äôs the value system behind the sex. 

My partner would have sex with someone after briefly getting to know them (within one week, no dates, just hanging out). The intention behind the sex and the meaning attributed to its occurrence conflicts with my value system.

I personally cannot be intimate with a partner until feelings have reached a nearly-in-love state. This is a core value of mine. 

I believe sex is an intimate sharing of the true person within each of us. Not only physically but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I‚Äôve had one intimate partner within a long term relationship. 

I considered waiting for marriage, even though I am not religious. It‚Äôs important to me.

Would it bother you if within a relationship, the person you were with had been having mindless sex hookups out of boredom and loneliness with any person that gave them attention; that they liked or felt liked by? 

To clarify, the number of partners was 2 going in to college. It reached 15+ within two years of college. 

I have fears about the longevity of our relationship when my value system around sex is so important and intimate to me and their value system has, by self admission, been meaningless, mindless, just for fun, out of boredom, given away due to low self esteem, been used as a tool to remain interesting to the new partners, and been done within early moments of meeting the new partners, repeatedly. 

My partner had a new sexual partner every 2.2 months on average for 2 years (with non-sex hookups all throughout this time period too). 

None of this aligns with who I am; but they have adamantly claimed that they don‚Äôt see sex the same way now with me; even though just a month before our meeting they had a mindless hookup and we met on tinder. 

I have a lot of questions about all this and I just want to hear other people try to dissect the issue for themselves and provide their 2 cents. Any advice or just general questions would help me. There‚Äôs obviously some details and background left out.


TL;DR
My partner has a sexual history which brings up fear about the longevity of our relationship due to a stark difference in a core value system; sexual intimacy. I see it as extremely important, they seem to have thrown sex to the wind with anyone they had a fling with. This occurred over two years in college, 13 new partners with zero relationships. 


Would this bother anyone else? Discussion/Advice would be greatly appreciated. I reposted as I did not realize the bot marks the post as advice received when you thank a helper.

477,"My parents weren't there for me and my brothers in many ways growing up. They didn't beat us and they didn't do drugs so they thought they were killing it I guess, but we all ended up depressed, suicidal, and poor. We all wanted to die by the age of 12. I won't go into the complicated aspects of our relationship but basically never taught us to clean (we lived in absolute filth) or take any responsibilities at all. They didn't really do anything with us. I don't know I needed to BRUSH MY TEETH until 3rd grade. They are the reason we were all 3 bullied horrendously throughout school. The older I got the more I'd try to speak up and every time I just get told that it was all our fault that we are the way we are and that they tried everything they could. We are all adults now and they don't help with our kids but constantly post about them on SM and ask to take them places randomly (but not my 1 year old....because they won't change diapers). They've blown any money they had but when we need to ask for help they tell us all we do is take and how it's killing them. I want my kids to have a relationship with them so I don't cut them off and they just act like it never happened when I lose my shit about once a year on them and tell me I'm making it all up. Our whole childhood. I'm just...making it up. Since this quarantine, all I can think about is them. My husband tries to comfort me but his parents are literally drug addicts so it kind of makes me feel guilty. Since he went back to work without me, I haven't been sleeping because all I can think about is how much I hate them. When I do, i have nightmares that I'm screaming with them. I get huge panic attacks constantly just thinking about them, in fact I'm shaking typing this. I can't stand the way they live or knowing that they don't KNOW how SHITTY they are! Like half the small town they live in makes fun of them and they seriously still have no clue. They just don't get it. I want them to see it and they won't and that just kills me. They are the reason for so much of my pain and they just.....think i was born wrong I guess? I know I'm gonna have to deal with them the rest of my life. Especially considering I'm the only child who does anything for them. My mom kind of just gave up on her health and can't get around, brothers have kind of given up on life as well and don't really do anything. My dad works full time at an easy job and complains about it constantly and doesn't do anything at home. My husband and I both work our asses off and have tried desperately to break the cycles of our families but I just can't move on. I know they won't ever care what I have to say so WHY can't I just get over it?? What can I do with this anger and how can I move on with my life in peace? I just don't want to care anymore....",04May2020,1

I bought a dvr,that comes with 4 cameras,it didn't collect much since the cameras aren't placed in the best places.I simply need advice on where i should put the cameras in order to catch her.

Here is a small map i drew of my property : [https://i.postimg.cc/GmbR568j/property-map.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmbR568j/property-map.png)

My partner is at pretty high risk for cardiovascular illnesses and has several risk factors as well as a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol. She's fairly young, 21 but I keep worrying because she's somewhat overweight. Of course she's aware of this and fairly insecure. She also has a physical disability so she can't exactly go running or anything and she can't really do a lot of moving around in one day because she'll be in a lot of pain. She's planned on loosing weight in the past but going on a diet made her mental health worse. Of course also with the whole pandemic situation we are currently stuck inside most of the time.
I'm really worried I'm coming across like a dick, it's just that when my brain gets stuck on something it doesn't really want to leave it alone until I can share it and the fact that I feel like I can't exactly say this makes me even more anxious.
I love my partner so much and her body shape doesn't bother me at all. I'm just worried about her cardiovascular risk increasing even more.
I'm not really sure what to say when she says that ""she's getting very fat"" I've seen she may have gained a little more weight over these past few months but it doesn't bother me and obviously I don't want to make her feel worse by being like ""yes"" or anything.

484,"For context, I live in the UK. I'm 17M, going on to university later this year, and recently a girl I knew in secondary school started following me on instagram and Snapchat. She was a couple years below me in school, though I'm not sure how big the difference is, and she always had a pretty open crush on me. I never led her on and we had a sort of brother/sister relationship if you get me, though we weren't super close. She made me a ton of cute things and would hand them to me on the bus and I'd always thank her and tell her it was sweet, but I made it clear I wouldn't be able to date her cause of our ages at the time and she knew that was clear. When I graduated secondary school, I was 15 and I **think** she was 13.

Fast forward to a few weeks back. I hadn't spoke to her since I last saw her and I've recently just finished college (early thanks to you-know-what). She added me on Insta a while back and messaged me once, though it didn't go anywhere. Then recently she added me on Snapchat because it's tagged in my bio.

I'm 17, and I turn 18 in a few months. I honestly don't know how old she is and obviously I would ask if I even considered talking to her. But I think she's either 15 or 16 right now and she's gotten really cute since secondary. I've seen a lot of people on here who say they met their SO at this kinda age and have a similar ""origin story"" (lol) so part of me wants, if she messages, to give her a chance. 

At the same time, it kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm quite young for being done with college - literally a couple more weeks and I would be in the year below - and I've been in relationships with girls older than me (me being 16 and them 18) - but I don't know if talking to her would be considered weird.

I hope I don't sound horrible when I make this post. I don't want to do anything that would be considered wrong which is why in making this post and getting people's opinions. Should I just make sure things are platonic and if something happens when she's older, so be it?",04May2020,1
485,"Prior information:

I am living in Australia
Australian government is giving out payments of 750 weekly (before tax) to small businesses to pay their for their employees who have worked there for over a year due to the current economic situation.


Before covid I had recently started university full time and only worked a maximum of 18 hours which is the maximum I could afford. Coworkers who needed the money and could work the hours did so.
Also I should say that I am casual and I work for a small business (restaurant/takeaway), and we are quite close(ish).

When covid started I lost all my hours because those who needed it most (for rent and stuff) had priority, which I was fine with. Then the government brought in the jobkeeper stuff so now they have brought everyone back to work and we are all doing the somewhat same hours to make it ‚Äúfair‚Äù since we are all getting paid the same.

Though my issue is that with my current hours (generally 21-30hrs a week now) I don‚Äôt have time for my university study &amp; it keeps me up at night worrying about what I am going to do during the exam period (4 weeks away) if I can‚Äôt get less hours. 
Those who were working more prior to the jobkeeper payments no longer want to work as much because they can get paid the same for doing less, and my employers refuse to hire someone else because they don‚Äôt want to have to pay for them.
I‚Äôve asked for less hours but get told I have to work so that it is ‚Äúfair‚Äù. 
4/6 workers have uni and will all need time off for exams. 
At this point it would be less detrimental for me to quit my job so that I could focus on uni, but I don‚Äôt want to leave my coworkers in such a situation where they will have to work even more hours (and they can‚Äôt bc they too have uni).

And I don‚Äôt want to get into bad waters with my boss and manager but I am really struggling to maintain a balance between this and it is taking a toll on my mental health.

I had her on social media and such but a while ago I deleted my account. I have made a new one for Insta and was re adding some friends. When I came across hers I was completely surprised. My female friend had started an only fans account (the one where you post nsfw photos and videos and set a monthly fee for people to look at). I had mixed feelings but ultimately knew I wanted to pay for this and in doing so I would be both supporting her and getting to so her in a new light. Before doing that, I wanted to message her saying ""Hey long time no talk, I noticed you started your own onlyfans account and I wanted to know if you would feel awkward about me paying for it."" Something along the lines of that. If she says yes I would do it obviously and if no I would do it under a fake name.

Now the question is do I just go straight for the fake name so she doesn't know it's me or see how she feels about it first with my own account and go from there.

Tldr:

Former Coworker/Female Friend started a Nsfw only fan's account and I wanted to know if I should ask her if it would be awkward if I payed for it and if she says no buy it and if yes buy it under a fake name or just buy it under a fake name because either way it would be supporting her financially.",04May2020,1
488,"I've been friends with my best friend since our 8th grade year. We're now both 22, but lately I've been noticing a lot of bad traits about her I never seen before. Well, here's some backstory. We both were pregnant last year, she was 3 months ahead of me, both having girls. I ended up losing mine full term, she had a healthy baby. I was happy for her regardless, you know? I wouldn't wish anything bad on her like ever. Well anyways, during the grief and loss, I really didn't want to ""drink the pain away"" but anytime I went to go visit my friend she would always wanna drink. She got to have her perfect baby and was still wanting to drink meanwhile I'm fighting the depression of losing mine and not wanting to drink? It didn't make sense so I would always decline until one particular bad night I was having and I really just wanted out of my own head and of course anytime I visited her she would always offer to drink. Mind you, I'm on Zoloft at the time and I'm not really talking to anyone about what's going on then again no one was really asking. They seen me smiling and laughing so they assume I'm okay. So anyways we drink and there it starts the bad habit of drinking the pain away. I really hated it but it became the depressant to my depression. 

Fast forward to months of this behavior and me finally snapping out of it and actually trying to help get me and my bfs relationship back on track because we fell off after losing our baby. Well, getting a relationship back to normal takes a lot of work especially when dealing with a loss. But anytime I would complain to her, she seemed to always relish in the fact that something was going wrong. I got those vibes from her so I stopped complaining to her about the little things he would do that would get me mad and instead started praising the things he would do to make me happy and she would never seem happy for me the way a friend should. It's not that she's my only friend but she's the one whose been around longest and knows me best, but it seemed like she didn't want our relationship working out because it meant less time of me going to visit her. 

So fast forward more months, me and my bf are in a good place, I've stopped the negative behavior, and my best friend decides one night to tell me my bf is flirting with her. She tells me things he's saying and that hes wanting to drink with her alone so they can talk and how he has a dating app and he sent her a screen shot of her profile she had on the same dating app. The entire time I know it doesn't sound like him at all because why would he flirt with my best friend knowing she's gonna tell me? Anyways he gets home that night and he immediately tells me she had snapped him asking for him to bring her some wine and he tells me the convo they had and that was completely different from hers and I tell him what she said and he was so confused. He brings up their chats and she was the one who sent him her dating profile and he just made a joke about her having a dating app. I ask her why she's trying to start problems between us knowing we're just barely moved on to a better place and her only excuse was she was drunk. After that, my bf has been uncomfortable around her and I don't blame him. If any of his friends did that to me I would not wanna be around then either, so I stopped my visits to her and would only see her if she happened to come to town. She lives an hour away from us and until then, me and my bf would sometimes randomly pop in and visit her and her bf. 

So after those shenanigans it's been like 3 months since we seen each other and during that time I find out in pregnant again yay. Of course she's the first person I tell and when I do, her reaction was so cruel in my opinion. She literally said ""my daughter can finally have a real life cousin"" talking about my baby that I lost.. I kind of just brushed it off and was like ""yep"" I also had some problems during the beginning of this pregnancy and since she was one of the only people I told then, I was asking her for advice and she just didn't seem concerned at all. I wasn't asking her to drop Everything and give me her undivided attention but I was thinking she would give me her support. So whatever, me and my bf figure everything out and things eventually become better, but the entire time she hasn't asked one question about it. She knew that I was at a high risk for miscarriage. She didn't even bother to ask how my family took the news but was sure to update me every day on each milestone her daughter was hitting and if I didn't respond she would send me a lot of pics or ask if I got them basically begging for a response, which I would respond to most of them but honestly the reminder that her baby was hitting milestones that mine should've been coming up on hurt, so it would always take a minute to let it pass but like I said I would never wish for bad on her or her daughter. I was happy for her and her daughter is so smart, she deserved to be bragged on. But even my own sister knew how much things still hurt, knew that even with me being pregnant, i wasn't no where close to being over losing my baby. She had my niece 7 months after I lost mine and she never once forced her daughter on me and instead let me go to her on my own pace and was never once offended that I didn't want to hold her sometimes. 

So I've still tried hanging out with my friend for no reason other than the fact that I'm a sucker for guilt trips. She moved back into our home town and I imagined it would make us closer but instead she was always asking to borrow money, asking for rides somewhere, asking to hang out etc knowing I was at least 7 months pregnant and working 10 hour shifts at the time and getting mad when I didn't want to hang on my days off, so it was really wearing on me then she would say something like how she misses me and that I'm the only friend she gets to be herself around because mind you, shes really random and makes weird noises and will narrate everything around her so it's funny hanging out with her because she's like a tv basically and she's really easy to talk to. And our minds are always on the same wave length. If I have a thought and start it she can literally finish it because she was thinking the same thing, so it's fun being around her when she's not annoying. But we only hung out once or twice during this pregnancy due to her attitude towards me and the covid quarantine where she would still try and make me go over to her house like I'm not pregnant and she doesn't have a daughter at home. And during that time I realize a lot of our conversations are from me initiating them, asking her questions, or offering up details of my life. So i stopped updating her about my pregnancy which she never responded to anyways, stopped asking and sharing details about our lives. And lo and behold we literally have no convos now because she never reciprocates. And when she would try and complain I would treat her how she treated me. It sucks because her character isn't mine and I feel ugly acting like her, but she literally doesn't care about anyone but herself. She isn't interested in anything but things that can further her needs or info she can use in the future. During a weak moment I was feeling, she asked for me to stop by so I was going to. I haven't been out of the house in ages so I was excited just to see another human being. I get ready and by the time I'm driving to her house I let her know I'm coming and she comes up with some excuse as to why she's gotta cancel on me, something about her daughter so I'm like ""okay, understandable"" then later on that night she's out drinking with some other friends of hers. It's not the first time she's canceled on me to go drink either I just felt ridiculous for actually thinking she would put someone other than herself first. I'm literally so close to being done with this pregnancy, I was due on May 26th but my doctor wants to induce my on the 19th instead. We have a name picked out, we've gotten extra ultrasounds done, theres so much to be excited over and I'm over the moon on telling my mom, my sister, my two other friends who I've been updating about my pregnancy, everyone seems just as excited as I am except my supposed best friend. She hasn't asked anything except for once when I accidentally sent her a bumpdate but that was only to tell me how huge I am. She's been my friend for years but maybe I'm just now seeing her true colors? Other than her partying friends I'm the main one she comes to when she has a problem. I'm not sure if I want her to stay around in my life after my baby is born. We seem like we're going two separate directions, her staying immature and me growing up. Maybe if I wasn't forced to deal with a loss so profound at such a young age I would still be where she is but idk. I'm just not sure if I wanna have this around or if maybe she'll change once I have my baby and I'm just being super sensitive",04May2020,1
489,"My best friend name is Anthony he‚Äôs 17 years old now. Me and Anthony met when i was 16 years old and he was also 16 that time. We both met each other from a friend of ours. Me and Anthony started to hang out a lot more then I expected. We started playing video games much more then we used to and we also started hanging out more at school (before the corona virus started). He is nice but also bad boy person and I‚Äôm the really shy depressed not so confident girl. The more I started hanging out with him the more I started to feel happy, free confident and more comfortable with myself. I have problems with my parents we don‚Äôt get along and we‚Äôre always arguing with each other and I still have issues with them. Anthony didn‚Äôt know that so I kinda had to fake my smile and laughs. One day I noticed that Anthony wasn‚Äôt being himself and then I realized that he probably also has depression just the way he acted and dressed. One day I decided to ask him if he had depression and I also told him he didn‚Äôt have to tell me anything and that I won‚Äôt force him to open up to me and he told me that he does have depression. I also noticed that‚Äôs he wanted to cry bc he voice was getting rusty and he kept in being quiet his eyes were also getting watery. I felt very horrible and I told him that when ever he feels like sharing his story I‚Äôm here to listen. His eyes went wide open and hugged me saying thank you I was never hugged before I kinda felt good but at the same time I felt weird. After a couple of days later I had another argument with my parents so when I went to school Anthony noticed I wasn‚Äôt feeling myself so later on the day he wanted to talk to me and he took me outside where we always hang out out at. He said he wanted to tell me about his problems and that he really trust me. He told me that when he was little his parents used to lock him up in a basement for weeks without food and water. They would lock him up in there Bc they would get mad at him for not having good grades or if he didn‚Äôt listen to his parents they would just lock him up in the basement with no light it‚Äôs was just darkness. He also told me that his brothers never liked him either. If he‚Äôs brothers didn‚Äôt like what Anthony did they would snitch on him and make lies so that he can get in trouble. One day his dad just left without saying a word. His mom was so angry she took Anthony and locked him in the basement without feeding him and giving him water after weeks. He even tried to kill himself bc he thought there‚Äôs no point in living. When he told me this I felt to bad and sad I didn‚Äôt want to cry but I ended up crying a lot and he was shocked that I was crying and he tried to comfort me but I kept on crying and then he said that he really really trusted me and that he never had a best friend who actually cared about him. I was happy and sad at the same time. I was happy bc he trusted me and I was also sad Bc I didn‚Äôt trust him completely yet. I have a really hard time trusting people Bc nowadays everyone betrays you. After like 2 months later Anthony started acting different he started hanging out with horrible people. He would just leave me by myself. I would get mad for him doing that to me and he knows I don‚Äôt like being by myself but then I thought it was okay Bc I can‚Äôt be jealous that he‚Äôs hanging out with other people. I also didn‚Äôt mind him hanging out with other people Bc I was used it already. One day I asked him if he wanted to play some gta and he told me he couldn‚Äôt get on for the rest of the day and I guessed that I was gonna play by myself after like a hour he went on to play gta but he was playing with his fake friends so I text him saying that I thought he wasn‚Äôt gonna get on and he told me that he wanted to play with them and that hurt me so bad. I didn‚Äôt know what to say or think anymore. He never knew my problems but he knew I had trouble dealing with my emotions. I felt like he didn‚Äôt wanna be my best friend anymore. I was so hurt and on the same day my parents came and started arguing with me Bc I didn‚Äôt want to wash the dishes. I was going crazy on the same day. I stayed up all night in my room thinking what I should do I was tired of living I‚Äôm always getting hurt. When I went to school I saw that his fake friends weren‚Äôt hanging out with anymore and Anthony came up to me saying that they betrayed him and they were saying mean stuff to him. I didn‚Äôt know how to feel and I told him that he left me alone and that he betrayed me and he got mad at me saying that he never betrayed me he wanted to meet new people and I felt horrible thinking maybe he‚Äôs right I can‚Äôt always have him with me  so I apologized to him. After that day Anthony started hanging out with me more then used to and I felt happy again like how I used to when we used to hang out. When I told this to my cousin she told me that he‚Äôs just using me (i really trusted her she‚Äôs been always there for me but then she had to move states.) I didn‚Äôt know how to feel when she told me that. So now I‚Äôm here to see if I can get advice for your guys. Maybe my cousin is right. I‚Äôm having a hard time processing this....",04May2020,1
490,"Hey.

So this is something I wanted to talk about with someone for a long time. My parents divorced when I was 12 and I kept spending some weekends with my father for around 2 years after that. Then they got into a big a fight, I was told by mom that he never really wanted me there just took me because he had to and since than we had no contact. 

That is until a year ago. I contacted him because I wanted to visit my grandparents grave and I wasn't sure where exactly it wasn't. They were amazing, I loved both of them so much. Anyway he agreed to show me where it is and we talked for a bit. He told me that I should come over for a weekend sometime so we can spend time together and talk properly. After that we went to no contact again. I didn't call hoping he would. Than in winter I called again. We met again this time he took me to his place and we just sat there and talked. Then he took me to my train and stood there outside the window till the train left. I felt like he was being honest and realized that if he's not it will hurt a lot. So he stands there by the window picks up the phone and calls me. All he said was:""Hey don't be sad, keep your head up. We're gonna make this work."" And we went no contact since than. 

I could call but I feel like I'm the only one initiating contact. During all this time he never called me or texted me. It just feels like he isn't interested since he won't make any effort . 

But it keeps bugging me. Am I stupid if I keep contacting him? Should I just let it go? I just want to get closure. I want to know the truth or this will keep eating me alive. 

What should I do?",04May2020,1

492,"So this is a bit of a long one and slightly complicated but please try and follow me here. 

I am a manager in retail, the store I work in just always has something going on. Mostly drama and animosity towards each other but we were all under the impression it was being fixed and things would get better. About 7-8 months ago, we had an older Russian lady (let‚Äôs call her Anne), 58 to be exact, (it absolutely does not matter BUT this is important to note) transfer into our store on a promotion from a cashier to a manager. I‚Äôm not sure how that conversation went with my manager (the one who hired her, we‚Äôll call her Beth) but she convinced her that she already knew how to be a manager. 
Small backstory: Anne is also coming from a store where Beth could see this as being true because Anne‚Äôs previous store manager sucks. When Beth got her promotion to our current store as a store manager (SM), she actually was the SM of Anne‚Äôs previous SMs daughter. She alone was a nightmare so I think this is my store manager giving her a chance since she knew it was a shitshow with this family. 
Continued from before: As in Anne does everything a manager does anyway but as a cashier. We didn‚Äôt see this as an issue since we didn‚Äôt have to train her, she could transfer in and immediately help us get the store into better shape than it was (we needed it BAD). But over the course of these months, she‚Äôs become extremely problematic. We could tell Anne she did something incorrectly and show her the right way to do it and she gets mad because she thinks we are attacking her. She says we don‚Äôt respect her when we offer constructive criticism and demands respect because she‚Äôs 58 and everyone else (including our SM) is in their 20s. We‚Äôve had to go to Beth so Beth can tell Anne what to do because she only listens to the SM. She doesn‚Äôt like to do anything strenuous because ‚Äúher back hurts‚Äù every single time it‚Äôs her turn to do something. Even though there is a clear morning routine and a clear closing routine. She complains she always has to close but the morning routine involves trash that she won‚Äôt do. And I‚Äôll clarify before someone says we are being unfair to her because of her age, it‚Äôs not that she can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that she refuses. She doesn‚Äôt like to collect any of the trash throughout the store because it‚Äôs ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. This includes small office trash cans (ones that you‚Äôd trust your 6 year old to change), bathroom trash cans (though they are bigger, they‚Äôre typically filled with paper towels, random candy wrapper or empty drink bottles, and your occasional feminine products). We haven‚Äôt been able to get caught up on trash partially due to the people who collect our trash but also due to her never putting the trash into the actual dumpster when she does do it, she sits it on the outside because she doesn‚Äôt want to lift it. And then no one picks it up. When it rains, it becomes disgustingly soggy, wet, and smelly. And we get complaints and cited by corporate when you could‚Äôve just.... put it in the dumpster! When we get truck, it‚Äôs either myself or Beth offloading it. Which is very strenuous in itself but it‚Äôs apart of the job. Until we got a few guys in that Beth hired, it‚Äôs always been me and Beth. And it still is because they‚Äôre so new, they can‚Äôt do it solo just yet but it‚Äôs nice to have the manpower every now and again. It‚Äôs worth noting that Anna has never had to even touch the truck. She doesn‚Äôt like wheeling totes out because it‚Äôs labor. She just doesn‚Äôt like to do anything. Another issue: Anne is always late. Another reason why she mostly closes because she doesn‚Äôt open the store on time. She‚Äôs opened the store 30 minutes late before. This also affects our pharmacists as they can‚Äôt go catch up on the prescriptions in the queue. I mean 99% of the time she is late. Granted, our operational hours have changed a ton due to COVID-19 but everytime Beth never had control over a schedule change due to that, Anne claims she didn‚Äôt get the memo when Beth has team meetings with all of us, Anne included, letting us know of these changes. She‚Äôs shown up as much as 2 hours late to a shift and is still here. She argues with any and everyone, picking fights because it‚Äôs her way or the highway. Beth (25/26 I think) will give her instruction and she thinks that because she‚Äôs 58 she doesn‚Äôt have to do it because it‚Äôs boils down to respect in her book. She‚Äôs also blatantly called my white manager racist because she gets reprimanded when she doesn‚Äôt do her job but days it‚Äôs because Beth doesn‚Äôt like her because she‚Äôs Russian (no correlation whatsoever). Amidst all of this happening, we have all (and we‚Äôve gone through at least 5 employees over the course of 8 months for various reasons) complained about her. We‚Äôve told her our concerns and for the absolute longest Beth brushed them off because she thought we were being dramatic. I mean no one likes to work with Anne, at all. My cashiers are pretty good at their job and they listen, even they are like yeah no. Beth started scheduling herself to work with Anne and now she sees the problem. Now she sees why everyone dislikes Anne so much. And that‚Äôs when the calls to HR begin. Now technically, this is confidential. Beth absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be telling us anything she speaks to HR about regarding Anne. I think she does it because we are all frustrated and it‚Äôs reassurance, idk. HR continues to tell Beth to give her more chances even though we she‚Äôs been gone months ago. 
So here‚Äôs where my concern now lies. The conflict between Anne and I has gotten out of control. Anne has lied to Beth and told her I flicked her off (on camera white Beth saw no evidence of). She has disappears for hours when she was supposed to be at the register which means I couldn‚Äôt do my job for the day (which was in the back room). She has shown up late when we‚Äôve had deliveries and cash pick ups which means I need to be mobile at any given moment and Anne is nowhere to be found so I can‚Äôt leave because there will be customers. And most recently, the straw that breaks the camels back. I have NEVER been written up a day in my life. My reviews are always ‚ÄúExceeds Expectations‚Äù. I am also in the process of trying to finalize my promotion which may be in jeopardy. Anne doesn‚Äôt like to clock out on time. She will come in early with no approval and we go over budget. Something Beth has to deal with, that‚Äôs above my pay grade. But when I come in, I immediately relieve Anne so she doesn‚Äôt go over her allotted hours. I told her she can clock out and I‚Äôll take over the register. I had a young lady trying to make a purchase and Anne keeps telling me she needs to final sign off (so that no one rings under her numbers) so she can clock out. She doesn‚Äôt. She can clock out at the other computer and I can sign her off when I‚Äôm done. In the middle of my transaction, Anne is literally arguing with me in front of a customer because she refuses to clock out on the other computer and let me finish ringing this customer out. She is physically turning the computer towards her (in the middle of my transaction) trying to void it so she can final sign off. I swatted her hand away. This was more of a reflex like when a fly is in your face but because I physically touched her, Beth had to call HR and report it. Anne said I discriminated against her because I was trying to ring this customer out. And I get that Beth has to report it. But now I‚Äôm in fear of my job being in jeopardy and my promotion being taken away. We all can clearly see Anne is the problem every single time. But I‚Äôve been thrown in the mix and I just can‚Äôt. And now I‚Äôm having a hard time enjoying my days off (my birthday is tomorrow) because I can‚Äôt afford to get fired. I really can‚Äôt. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the hell to do. I would like to call and give my side of this story but I don‚Äôt want it to look like retaliation and make it escalate to something bigger than it is. My SM has said she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll lose my job, at the end of the day or boils down to her decision. I know she wouldn‚Äôt fire me but it may honestly be a little out of her control because of the physical contact part. I‚Äôm honestly considering just leaving and finding another job with another company altogether.

499,"Firstly, I want to say, everyone in my family has had pretty much constant weight issues as long as I can remember. Myself and my auntie have both had anorexia in the past, my other aunt has severe food issues (she wanted a feeding tube to not waste time eating)‚Äî so I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any biological basis for it all but I thought it worth mentioning. However, a key point is that my mum doesn‚Äôt believe in eating disorders. 

She was obese since I was small, and always on diets (taking me along with her on them) but in the past 1/2 years she‚Äôs actually lost weight. However, she does this by eating perhaps 500kcal of unhealthy food (sweets, ice cream) in the evening and claiming she eats a massive breakfast, she thinks she gets up before everyone but I can hear that she just makes a coffee and sits there. 

She only eats meals with us 3x a year: Easter, Christmas, her birthday. Otherwise she does not eat dinner or breakfast in anyone else‚Äôs presence. Even when my young siblings bake something and ask her to taste a cupcake or whatever, she refuses. 

She will not stay still, when she has nothing to do she‚Äôll make up jobs to keep herself busy and moving until at least 8 o‚Äôclock. She always says she‚Äôs still overweight, but wears the clothes my 12 year old brother has grown out of, her favourite jacket is literally for 10-11 y/o children. 

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs overly skinny, but my view is definitely skewed. But this isn‚Äôt normal, is it? Especially since it‚Äôs been going on for a good 2 years, jt isn‚Äôt just a fad diet.

Me and him met before I sold my own company, or even had one.

We were both tech nerds, and we met at convention, we got to talking and we actually live near by.

Long story short hes been with me through everything, before I even started my company, and had what I have.

Im  not a very happy person, I had to lie cheat, and steal to get where I  am, and I constantly find myself being a horrible person, I feel like I live in a world of punishment for what I did, but hes my sun shine through it all.

I always check on him to make sure hes okay, and I tell him if he ever wants anything to ask me and Ill buy it.

Sometimes I also buy him expensive gifts at random just to see him smile.

But he told me one day when I called him 4 times that I was being too clingy.

502,"So I'm starting to study archeology in September. I am really excited for it but the school is 3 hours from where I live. I live with my parents right now.

So because living at home will mean I have to travel 6 hours a day. Because of this I'm thinking of moving out

However I have a terrible case of homesickness and anxiety. For this I do synchronized swimming to let the anxiety out and relax with my friends. Moving out would mean having to switch teams  or not swimming at all. But staying home could mean the same thing with the travel time.

503,"What would you make of this situation?

So this is a bit of a long one and slightly complicated but please try and follow me here. 

I am a manager in retail, the store I work in just always has something going on. Mostly drama and animosity towards each other but we were all under the impression it was being fixed and things would get better. About 7-8 months ago, we had an older Russian lady (let‚Äôs call her Anne), 58 to be exact, (it absolutely does not matter BUT this is important to note) transfer into our store on a promotion from a cashier to a manager. I‚Äôm not sure how that conversation went with my manager (the one who hired her, we‚Äôll call her Beth) but she convinced her that she already knew how to be a manager. 
Small backstory: Anne is also coming from a store where Beth could see this as being true because Anne‚Äôs previous store manager sucks. When Beth got her promotion to our current store as a store manager (SM), she actually was the SM of Anne‚Äôs previous SMs daughter. She alone was a nightmare so I think this is my store manager giving her a chance since she knew it was a shitshow with this family. 
Continued from before: As in Anne does everything a manager does anyway but as a cashier. We didn‚Äôt see this as an issue since we didn‚Äôt have to train her, she could transfer in and immediately help us get the store into better shape than it was (we needed it BAD). But over the course of these months, she‚Äôs become extremely problematic. We could tell Anne she did something incorrectly and show her the right way to do it and she gets mad because she thinks we are attacking her. She says we don‚Äôt respect her when we offer constructive criticism and demands respect because she‚Äôs 58 and everyone else (including our SM) is in their 20s. We‚Äôve had to go to Beth so Beth can tell Anne what to do because she only listens to the SM. She doesn‚Äôt like to do anything strenuous because ‚Äúher back hurts‚Äù every single time it‚Äôs her turn to do something. Even though there is a clear morning routine and a clear closing routine. She complains she always has to close but the morning routine involves trash that she won‚Äôt do. 

And I‚Äôll clarify before someone says we are being unfair to her because of her age, it‚Äôs not that she can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that she refuses. She doesn‚Äôt like to collect any of the trash throughout the store because it‚Äôs ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. This includes small office trash cans (ones that you‚Äôd trust your 6 year old to change), bathroom trash cans (though they are bigger, they‚Äôre typically filled with paper towels, random candy wrapper or empty drink bottles, and your occasional feminine products). We haven‚Äôt been able to get caught up on trash partially due to the people who collect our trash but also due to her never putting the trash into the actual dumpster when she does do it, she sits it on the outside because she doesn‚Äôt want to lift it. And then no one picks it up. When it rains, it becomes disgustingly soggy, wet, and smelly. And we get complaints and cited by corporate when you could‚Äôve just.... put it in the dumpster! When we get truck, it‚Äôs either myself or Beth offloading it. Which is very strenuous in itself but it‚Äôs apart of the job. Until we got a few guys in that Beth hired, it‚Äôs always been me and Beth. And it still is because they‚Äôre so new, they can‚Äôt do it solo just yet but it‚Äôs nice to have the manpower every now and again. It‚Äôs worth noting that Anna has never had to even touch the truck. She doesn‚Äôt like wheeling totes out because it‚Äôs labor. She just doesn‚Äôt like to do anything. 

Another issue: Anne is always late. Another reason why she mostly closes because she doesn‚Äôt open the store on time. She‚Äôs opened the store 30 minutes late before. This also affects our pharmacists as they can‚Äôt go catch up on the prescriptions in the queue. I mean 99% of the time she is late. Granted, our operational hours have changed a ton due to COVID-19 but everytime Beth never had control over a schedule change due to that, Anne claims she didn‚Äôt get the memo when Beth has team meetings with all of us, Anne included, letting us know of these changes. She‚Äôs shown up as much as 2 hours late to a shift and is still here. She argues with any and everyone, picking fights because it‚Äôs her way or the highway. Beth (25/26 I think) will give her instruction and she thinks that because she‚Äôs 58 she doesn‚Äôt have to do it because it‚Äôs boils down to respect in her book. She‚Äôs also blatantly called my white manager racist because she gets reprimanded when she doesn‚Äôt do her job but days it‚Äôs because Beth doesn‚Äôt like her because she‚Äôs Russian (no correlation whatsoever). 

Amidst all of this happening, we have all (and we‚Äôve gone through at least 5 employees over the course of 8 months for various reasons) complained about her. We‚Äôve told her our concerns and for the absolute longest Beth brushed them off because she thought we were being dramatic. I mean no one likes to work with Anne, at all. My cashiers are pretty good at their job and they listen, even they are like yeah no. Beth started scheduling herself to work with Anne and now she sees the problem. Now she sees why everyone dislikes Anne so much. And that‚Äôs when the calls to HR begin. Now technically, this is confidential. Beth absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be telling us anything she speaks to HR about regarding Anne. I think she does it because we are all frustrated and it‚Äôs reassurance, idk. HR continues to tell Beth to give her more chances even though we she‚Äôs been gone months ago. 

So here‚Äôs where my concern now lies. The conflict between Anne and I has gotten out of control. Anne has lied to Beth and told her I flicked her off (on camera white Beth saw no evidence of). She has disappears for hours when she was supposed to be at the register which means I couldn‚Äôt do my job for the day (which was in the back room). She has shown up late when we‚Äôve had deliveries and cash pick ups which means I need to be mobile at any given moment and Anne is nowhere to be found so I can‚Äôt leave because there will be customers. And most recently, the straw that breaks the camels back. I have NEVER been written up a day in my life. My reviews are always ‚ÄúExceeds Expectations‚Äù. I am also in the process of trying to finalize my promotion which may be in jeopardy. Anne doesn‚Äôt like to clock out on time. She will come in early with no approval and we go over budget. Something Beth has to deal with, that‚Äôs above my pay grade. But when I come in, I immediately relieve Anne so she doesn‚Äôt go over her allotted hours. I told her she can clock out and I‚Äôll take over the register. I had a young lady trying to make a purchase and Anne keeps telling me she needs to final sign off (so that no one rings under her numbers) so she can clock out. She doesn‚Äôt. She can clock out at the other computer and I can sign her off when I‚Äôm done. In the middle of my transaction, Anne is literally arguing with me in front of a customer because she refuses to clock out on the other computer and let me finish ringing this customer out. She is physically turning the computer towards her (in the middle of my transaction) trying to void it so she can final sign off. I swatted her hand away. This was more of a reflex like when a fly is in your face but because I physically touched her, Beth had to call HR and report it. Anne said I discriminated against her because I was trying to ring this customer out. And I get that Beth has to report it. But now I‚Äôm in fear of my job being in jeopardy and my promotion being taken away. We all can clearly see Anne is the problem every single time. But I‚Äôve been thrown in the mix and I just can‚Äôt. And now I‚Äôm having a hard time enjoying my days off (my birthday is tomorrow) because I can‚Äôt afford to get fired. I really can‚Äôt. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the hell to do. I would like to call and give my side of this story but I don‚Äôt want it to look like retaliation and make it escalate to something bigger than it is. My SM has said she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll lose my job, at the end of the day or boils down to her decision. I know she wouldn‚Äôt fire me but it may honestly be a little out of her control because of the physical contact part. I‚Äôm honestly considering just leaving and finding another job with another company altogether.

Basically, over the internet me and this girl started talking. Super sweet, funny, shared the same interests as me, yadda yadda, we're basically the same person except she can draw really well. Eventually, there was this joke between friends that we were ""married"", and then that evolved into us dating. She's admitted multiple times that she has literally fallen in love with me and my personality, and to be honest, I've also kind of fallen in love with her. Nothing ""serious"" has happened and to be honest, we're basically just really close best friends. But like, √ºber-best-friends.

The issue is, I'm 13.

What do I do about this? I love her dearly, and she is an absolute cinnamon roll of a person, and I don't wanna break her heart! This whole situation has got me pretty stressed out, man! What do I do?

So I'm (14f) living with my mom. My parents aren't divorced but court cases are going on. My mother was/is a housewife and doesn't have any income of her own. Also she has many health issues (slip disc, legs hurt and many more). My parents will never be living together again, I know that now. 

 My grandparents are middle class and they live in another city. All expenses are paid by them that includes my school fees.
I don't think that my grandparents should spend anything for me and also my grandfather retired from his job a few years back. 

My dad can afford everything and he even wants me back. He's an amazing dad! He doesn't like anyone from my mom's side. I've lived WITHOUT my mom for a while with my dad, and it was okay, pretty nice actually, I did miss her sometimes,  but it was alright.

But I'm living with my mom and my mental health is too bad, I think I really need a therapist but I can't say that to anyone especially in my country. Where my dad lives, I have so many friends, I have everything!

But my mom's health conditions are worse than ever. She's not hospitalised the doctor has advised her to rest. It's my 9th grade/first year of high school (as you would call it) and the online classes suck! And I do all the chores. My mom cooks. My mental health is at its worst, I have NO friends here,  I've become too introverted. My mom does love me a lot, she cries because she loves me, but she's pulls me down, a lot. She criticises me a lot about wearing shorts. 


If I choose my dad, I can have everything, my friends, cousins, own room, maybe visit my brother where he studies, I can even meet my mom on vacations ( she'll be living in another city),
but who will take care of her? 

She has a boyfriend(they're pretty serious, I don't like him but they love each other, (won't ever marry officially). He lives in the same city as my grandparents. They(mom and her bf) won't ever live together, but still. My mom isn't a huge fan of her parents and I don't think will live with them, she'll probably live alone.

Who will take care of her? Even if I choose my dad, I don't even know how to tell that to her.
I'll be selfish if I choose my dad. And choosing my mom will be what I am right now. Idk anything, life is hell. I can't sleep at night. Please help.",04May2020,1
508,"So, for a bit of context, I've been well and truly struggling with my mental health these past couple of weeks. I've had problems in the past, and my friend knew this, and so she said she would call me everyday until I was okay. 

She blew me off a few times for various different reasons, some totally fine, such as when she had to care for her boyfriend, others (in my eyes) not so much, as she was watching a murder documentary when she said she would call me. This happening started to plant a thread of doubt in my mind, as I am horrendous for over thinking things, and I started to think she didn't care about me, and was only helping because no one else would. 

This leads us to yesterday, she is stressed out about something in her own life, and greets me rather aggressively. I get taken by surprise, and forget what I wanted to talk to her about, and she eventually pries out of me, the feeling that she may not care. She gets really upset, and shouts down the phone about how I can even think she doesn't care. 

I stupidly say ""If you want to stop helping, you can"" and she takes this as me trying to manipulate her. When in actuality, I thought she would want to stop helping me after what I said. 

She has said I can still vent to her over text, and she'd call me in a few days, but I think things will be really awkward between us now. 

Any advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.

510,"I procrastinate with everything and it makes me depressed. Sometimes it's so bad that I don't realise I'm doing it.

Literally everything: studying, exercising, sleeping, waking up, showering, eating breakfast, cleaning my room, literally anything that requires effort I will procrastinate on my phone or whatever and I'll make up excuses in my head as to why I'm doing what I'm doing. Sometimes I think about the amount of things I could get done if I were to not procrastinate and that frustrates me a lot.

513,"I am really ashamed to talk about this, but my sister is frequently masturbating right next to me while I am on my pc while I have my headphones on or playing my vr games( I guess since i can't see her with the headset on). Since the quarantine started, from time to time I started noticing what she does. She thinks she is doing it really sneaky, but she is defenitely NOT. I was suspicious at first, I thought she had fever or something was wrong. I frequently asked her if she is ok and she replied that there is nothing wrong. We share a room so there is not a lot of privacy at home, and since my parents have ""No closed doors"" politics. Yeah the ""alone"" time is really not an ordinary thing around here.

One day I decided to confirm my suspicions and what I did was just put the vr headset on and play a game, then just wait until I start to hear the hard breathing and use the oculus passtrough( the oculus rift s let's you see trough the cameras what's going on on the outside world without the need of removing the headset). I just started to play skyrim vr as usual( during afternoon when parents are asleep, since the only place we can both go is our room), she later came in my room and hopped on her bed.

For about 1h, everything was fine. She was doing stuff on her phone and I was playing, when I started hearing the hard breathing. I quickly turned on the oculus passthrough and yeah. She was masturbating under her blanket. So after 1 second after I saw it I continued with my game, but was really uncomfortable.

Since then, everytime she can't go anywhere besides here with me. She does it. And I am absolutely aware of it, but I can't just look at her or say anything. Mostof time I ignore her or put the headphones on and listen to music really loud so I don't need to hear it. But still...

I don't blame her. Everyone goes through this, but I don't know how to tell her that I am uncomfortable.I don't know if we should talk about this since I am a guy and really don't want to get my parents involved(especially mom, since their relationship is not great and she really wouldn't understand and I think it'll make things worse).The situation is like that for one week, since I caught her with the headset on.

Sam moved to London -near me- at the beginning of the relationship for work reasons, leaving her family in Portsmouth. This is where her little sister (16) lives, who is autistic. Sam works night shifts, so during the day if her sister needed to talk to anyone, she would call or message me. I had no problems with this, I know how much she is struggling at the moment with the pandemic and I adore her sister like my own, her sister trusts me. 
Now Sam and I have broken up, I wasnt expecting her sister to message me, but she did this afternoon. She just wanted to talk about cats. I contacted Sam to let her know her sister was messaging me (and if she was okay with that), and Sam replied saying she was currently on call with her mother due to her sister being upset over whether I was still there or not. She said she trusts me, and doesn't have an issue with me being there for her sister despite our own differences. I said I dont mind being there if she still needs me as she did nothing wrong to me personally and I know how hard it can be for her to trust someone to talk to. 
As awkward as I feel myself, and as much as it is bringing up my own hurt from such a recent breakup to talk to Sam and her family, I would rather be there for her sister if she needs someone rather than come across selfish and inconsiderate, especially if I know I can help.
However, my mother and my friends think its is completely weird and I shouldn't do so. My mother is completely convinced this is a ploy by Sam to keep me in her life (with context, this could be valid) and that Sam is masterminding this. My friends think its very wrong talking to her sister, especially if I'm not talking to Sam herself, and that I'm just doing it because I cant let them go. 
Am I in the wrong for still being in contact with her little sister even though I'm only doing it to be kind and considerate, or should I stop incase this escalates? I feel very confused",04May2020,1
525,"I worked at my previous job for nearly a year. It was a previous employer from several years ago who re-hired me, and the only reason I accepted was because I was desperate for a job after being laid off at the time due to budget cuts. I hated that job in the past, but needed income, so I took it. The work environment was extremely toxic and got worse and worse. My boss treated me like a personal assistant, making me use my lunch breaks to run his errands, pick up cigarettes and beer for him, get his meals and such. Other employees had quit because he did the same to them. Complaints were made but ignored because of the culture of the company (small finance company) and family ties involved.

I was miserable but started hitting my breaking point when a new employee blamed me for her mistake and lied. She was young and only got the job because she was related to someone high-up in the company, and I was not allowed to defend myself or try to explain what really happened. 

I‚Äôve always had mental health issues, but I began truly contemplating suicide due to my treatment at work, and was also having near daily anxiety/panic attacks. Applied for several other jobs and interviewed for them, and was verbally given an offer at another company.

Now, I know this is on me, I made a mistake by not getting it in writing. So it‚Äôs my own fault - but I got a verbal offer and then after a particularly horrible day of getting verbally abused at work, I quit because I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and was on the verge of suicide. 

Well, that offer fell through for reasons I am unsure of (clean drug test, decent credit) and I was left unemployed. This happened in early March, so it could have been related to COVID-19, even though I can‚Äôt definitively say that. I was told in the email that due to circumstances they weren‚Äôt hiring any longer and could look at the possibility another time. 

I‚Äôve been unable to find a new job; interviews are happening but not nearly as often would be expected due to the pandemic, and I have applied for unemployment, but I‚Äôm certain I will be rejected for having quit. Any advice? I live in MS if that helps.",04May2020,1

527,"I have a friend who has proven himself to be quite dull, in that he feels this pandemic is ""overhyped"" and that quarantine is unnecessary as the virus is supposedly meaningless. He lives with quite old and rather unhealthy relatives. He goes around shopping and traveling as if nothing is happening and sees the quarantine as an unnecessary activity people do because they are too scared of getting sick. I've tried many obvious arguments against his claims but I suppose you can't reason with some people who have decided they know more than medical professionals. I have direct relatives who work in a major hospital in my area and they certainly consider this an extremely serious matter. Now I am not one to trust the news as no matter what source, left or right everyone distorts the truth in some way. But I am getting enough evidence directly from people on ""the front lines"" to prove that this is not something you can shrug off and call it a little bug going around.

528,"I'm currently employed in a full-time permanent role as a HR administrator. Sounds great, right? Except it's not. I moved into this role two years ago under the guise that if I worked hard and got the necessary qualifications I'd see career progression and a bigger salary (as someone who lives at home alone with her physically/mentally-disabled-due-to-a-stroke mother, this was super important to me). 

Two years later, I have the qualifications. Still, my pay hasn't changed since I started the role (though my responsibilities have increased), in fact, I  earn less than the individuals who are employed in my previous position in the mail room. In addition to this, I've also developed a severe repetitive strain injury in both my arms as a result of the repetitive nature of my role (lots of typing and mouse work). So, now I'm poor and broken... awesome!

Unfortunately, as my job pays me minimally, I can't afford to see a physiotherapist about my arms. I've spoken with several GPs who offer numerous painkillers but no real solutions; one told me the issue was simply that I am weak...

As the pain in my arms progresses (I can no longer chop vegetables, vacuum the house or even sleep through the night without hurting), I have come to reluctantly accept that I need to change *something*. On Monday, when I go back to work, I plan to request a decrease in my working hours (35 down to 25) so that I can rest my arms for more extended periods between tasks. Financially this is not something I can do in the long-term but can do temporarily whilst I work out what else I can do.

I have also looked into going to university to complete a degree in counselling which is something I have an interest in and has the added bonus of minimal typing requirements. Unfortunately, I am unable to get on the course this September as I am not able to complete the required volunteer hours between now and then.  This plan will, therefore, have to wait until 2021.

But I don't know if I can wait until 2021. I can't keep going down this route with my arms, and I spend more time crying than not; either due to physical pain, frustration over said physical pain and overall stress. 

So, the advice I'm looking for is, what do I do? What jobs are out there that can hold me over for a year until I can (hopefully) go to university? What jobs don't require a university degree and have zero expectation of me being able to work long hours on the computer? Is there any resolve for my janky arms?

I'm so lost for what to do and so scared of what is going to happen to my arms as time goes on. Honestly, whilst I know this will get lost in the litter of 'new' posts that come through every day, I really do appreciate any comments or advice anyone has to give. If you've read this far, thank you.

On October I (Jake, M22) started going to university where I met Naomi (F26) and Michelle (F20). The three of us became part of a group with a bunch of other people.

Michelle and I became close since we have a lot in common and we're on the same page most of the time. Naomi was always a bit weird for me but after the three of us had study date where Naomi just didn't talk or study (we really tried to incorporate her but she wouldn't take part in our talks or assignments) that I talked it over with Michelle.

Now I knew beforehand that Naomi was lesbian and was crushing on all of our female teachers but Michelle started telling me how Naomi made advances on her, despite Michelle being hetrosexual and having a BF. These advances included - buying her things, showing up at her house unannounced, trying to engage a three way with her BF as well as making other sexual remarks toward her. 

As time went by I started to see into Naomi's behavior and how she was obsessive towards any female  that came close to her or our group and how she consonantly wanted to be around Michelle.

And to top it all Naomi said she was willing to leave confinement to see Michelle. I'm really worried Naomi might do or act out something bad and I don't know how to explain to her that she is - stalking, manipulating and is generally abusive towards Michelle, all while she is entirely unaware of her actions.

I've talked to Michelle about it and we want to talk to her (over the phone) and explain how she's being acting is problematic and harmful but I don't know how to put into words.",04May2020,1

533,"You see, I have a bachelor degree but tried so hard to get something with it, working on my portfolio and doing work for free and volunteering but people don't tend to take me on because my art seems too ""cartoony""...

I kind of given up since my passion for it has died since I love my art but it's just not commercial (for eg: my art is very rough and hand-drawn, whereas nowadays everyone likes round and vector shaped art that is neat and clean and I just don't like that)...and...well...probably just suck anyways.

Well, after graduating I've been working in retail for hte last 6 years, trying to work on my portfolio but haven't had any luck...

So the last 2 years I thought of going back to school and have been doing an online course in vet nursing. I really love it and was working at some vet hospitals and clinics to gain experience. But problems soon came up, as girls much younger than me actually got hired with less experience whereas I was always asked to just volunteer (here if you are over 21 you have to be paid a little more). I have changed 3 placements now because the 1st one told me to not do any tasks so the ones they will hire have something to do, the 2nd one I had to wait for 4 hours to do nothing until surgeries started (and then we were only allowed to watch behind a glass window) and the 3rd one they just got frustrated with teaching me as they just didn't have enough time to take me to the side and signs things off.

I tried so hard, I kept asking if I could stay back with someone to catch up on work but nobody would want to volunteer to help me...

I am working now again casually but now am on call because of the COVID-19 incident and not getting any work, plus trying to get through my course 's material that I can complete without a work placement...

I feel like such a loser, I see or hear about everyone at least having a job and working from home or a full-time job at my age and it's killing me...

537,"My girlfriends (Kristen)'s half sister (Erica) lives with her mother and step father (Kristens biological father) (Marty and Denise) in Long Island, NY. Marty and Denise are elderly. They are only 18 minutes away from NYC so the area has been heavily affected by the Pandemic. From what I have heard, the fire department/police/EMS aren't even responding to what they consider non life threating emergencies. 
    Erica has had a difficult life, and has tried her best to make a living for herself over the years. She is 30. Lately she has been on a very bad downward spiral. She is currently in probation for a DWI and a guy and run and nearly went to jail. She has already slipped up on probation for cocaine use, but was ordered to go to rehab abd was given another chance to straighten out. Sometime after the hit and run, she met a pretty terrible piece of shit. (Tim). Tim I don't think has worked in over 20 years, make little to no money selling weed here and there. Tim drinks heavily, smokes pot (possibly other drugs) and is very unreasonable and has gotten physical with Erica and has nearly gotten physical with Marty on serval occasions and even Denise at one point. He occasionally abuses the family dog. He has a child he is not allowed to see. As far as I know, none of his family wants them in their houses. He occasionally is busted by his mother. 
    Before they knew how Tim was, they welcomed him to come and love with them in their apartment after the apartment the Erica was renting was sold by the other. Over the course of the following months, all of the skeletons in Tim's closet came out and be began arguing with the family often. 
   This past Friday, there was a pretty serious incident. This was all told to Kristen by her sister Sue, then to me so I can not say I personally observed this. Kristen's youngest sister (the 3rd daughter, Sue) was walking the family dog. She saw a chip monk and began chasing it with the dog (not intending to hurt it, just playing with the dog). Tim observed this, and became enraged, began shouting in Sue's face, and grabbed the dog by the leash and picked it up, choking the dog in the process. Sue ran up stairs crying and told Marty and Denise. Marty, Denise, and Erica all came outside. Marty began telling Tim that that is his dog and he has no right to abuse his pet and shout at his daughter. Tim began shouting at Marty and may have attempted to fight him. As stated before, Marty is elderly so he is not able to fight. I believe Sue attempted to call the police, but no dispatcher picked up the phone and she was met with some sort of system. I am unsure how it concluded, but I believe they could not reach the police and everyone just separated. 
    The police have been there before. On one occasion, during a domestic between Tim and Erica, they could not do anything because Erin would not come out of her room and they could not prove evidence of brushing so they left. On a second occasion, Tim was arguing with a neighbor, and the police were called. Tim ""chest bumped"" an officer and was then held at gunpoint and arrested. He was released the next day. I am unsure why, but I believe it was improper use of force and they let him go to avoid a lawsuit. 
     They were going to attempted to evict Tim and Erica legally, but I believe all court sessions are cancelled due to the Virus, and they were already backed up as it was so I feel like they will have to wait two years for Tim to get Evicted. 
     Myself and Kristen live over an hour away, but she goes down to visit for a weekend every month (prior to the Pandemic). I am worried for her safety is why I am posting this. I am worried for her safety, as well as my own legal freedom as I will probably get myself in trouble by going down there and taking care of it as any other guy would do in this situation and I don't want to go to jail because we are trying to begin our lives. 
    We have one Idea that doesn't include eviction, but it would involve Erica going to jail due to probation violation. She continues to violate her parole and does not control Tim and allows him to harass her family, abuse her dog, and damage the apartment (he has punched holes in the drywall). We believe if Erica goes to prison, she will straighten out and Tim will leave because he will have no food, source of money, and overall does not like living there.
     Marty further has a criminal record and is not allowed to posess firearms or weapons so he is further unable to defend himself. 

What should I/they do short of frontier justice? Normally I would not get involved with something like this but now my girlfriend could be involved and her parents have been suffering for over a year and it is just really hard to see.",04May2020,1
538,"Hello,

I hope everyone is staying safe and washing their hands. If this post is too long, forgive me, but I feel I must provide proper context in the hopes of getting the best advice.

I'm a 22 year soon-to-be university dropout. (I haven't dropped out yet, but the workload will be immense next year, since I'll have a whole semester of baggage and my ESP on top.) I've been struggling with depression and have been suicidal for most of my life, including my childhood. My one and only passion in life is my instrument. I am very bad at it, but I had a fire in me that compelled me to learn and improve, and made remarkable progress. I've never had anything quite like it. It truly was, maybe still is, my purpose in life. Mentally, I've improved largely over the last 3-4 years. You could say I found my ""will to live"", even through hard times. But for some reason, I haven't been able to go near my instrument for nearly 2 months now. 

I think it all started after my best friend hung himself around 5 months ago (mid January iirc.) After spending 2 weeks with his family, making arrangements and helping with paperwork, I came back to resume studies feeling like a complete stranger. My friends have different lives, they talk about things that i can no longer relate to. I can no longer fit in effortlessly. 
I've been having repetitive and compulsive thoughts and imagery. I keep picturing myself tying a noose. That imagery keeps repeating itself in my head compulsively. Yesterday I came very close to doing it, after finding rope in the basement, but it passed, I'm good now. These thoughts interfere with my daily pastimes (which include browsing the internet while zoned out for hours on end, and sleeping/trying to sleep.) I feel like such a lazy piece of shit. Sometimes, I become acutely aware of my consciousness being trapped in this disgusting meatsuit of mine. I can't escape it, unless I abuse the shit out of some old medication I have. 

I have no one to talk to, since everyone is pre-occupied with their own lives during these stressful times. My friends barely talk to me anymore. I try to make an effort, but I lost track of time so much (weeks at a time) that I give the impression that im ghosting them, I think. Besides, everyone has their own issues right now, and I dont think I would open up anyways, not anymore, because everytime I do, I become a whiny bastard. No one likes a whiny bastard. 

I don‚Äôt want to die like a street dog, cowering and crying. I think I have to double down and go all in on what I can do best (which im mediocre at, but that‚Äôs okay.) If anyone has been in a situation where you feel like giving up on your passion, how do you recover from that and save yourself from sinking into darkness?",04May2020,1

She was short and had hair all the way down to her butt. She had an obsession with anime and was in my Chinese class. When we met she would stand extreamly close to me and she would tell me everything. We would text all the time on snapchat. She would even stare at me in class. And this was consistent all throughout highschool. I would do some playful jabs at her taste in anime but yeah. My Junior year she called me on snapchat for the first time to help her with her homework, she was on mute for some reason the whole time IDK why.

542,"I work in a small department. There are 3 of us- boss (36F) who has tons of experience. Me (25F) who‚Äôs been in the department 4 years, and coworker (35F) who‚Äôs been in the department for a little over a year. 35F did not have previous relevant experience in this field, so she did not come into this job with any experience or expertise that would aid her.

When I started at the department, I was the newest and we were a department of 4. Due to being the newest, I had a lot of the ‚Äúshit‚Äù tasks. I understood my coworkers were more experienced/had more seniority, and thus had more opportunities than me because they worked their way up. That‚Äôs fine. I just continued doing my job and getting better at it. Eventually, the two coworkers ahead of me both left, leaving my manager and myself. At this point, I began doing 100% of our project work. I quickly became very good and efficient at it. I did a lot of extra hours so we wouldn‚Äôt fall behind. I developed very strong relationships with our clients to the point where client services would automatically direct them to me because they knew I‚Äôd get them taken care of quickly.

So, we eventually hired coworker. She‚Äôs fine, I liked her. Due to how specialized our work is, the training process can be long. It took her 9 months. So, from the time my colleagues left to the time new coworker got trained, I ended up doing all of the project work for a year.

So, she eventually finished training and could start taking projects of her own. And ever since then, it‚Äôs been a nightmare. Because she‚Äôs now trained, she views herself as being on my level, and is very competitive with me. She doesn‚Äôt act that way to me directly, but often will throw herself into panic attacks or crying fits to my manager because she‚Äôs not keeping up with me. 
She‚Äôs new. It would look bad on me if a newly trained employee was already at my pace.
This has been an annoyance of mine for a while that I would just never mention. It is what it is. 

Well, due to Covid-19 things have just gotten worse. We are deemed life-sustaining so we are still operating, but to minimize employee overlap every day my manager is in the office, but then it is either me OR coworker. This is dependent on whose projects are due next. 
Generally, because I am faster and more efficient I do have a few more projects than coworker. I can do about 3x the amount of work as coworker in the same amount of time. We were at a point where we were completely swamped with projects and were having a lot of them be late. Because of this, I took more because I was able to get them done and get things caught up. Despite this, coworker was always left with enough projects and work to keep her busy. She was never without. She just had to work from home a little more so I could wrap up the excess of overdue projects.

We rotate fairly evenly, but my coworker has started complaining to my manager about me having more projects than her. Something also worth noting is that to cover myself, I do not initiate ANY project without asking my manager first, for this very reason. That way, if my manager thinks I‚Äôm taking too many, etc, she can tell me no. However, my manager recognizes that I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs necessary for us to stay afloat right now. But despite this, because coworker was upset, my manager has started forcing me to stay home more days even when I have projects due, so that coworker has more time in the office. 

It‚Äôs at the point where I feel like I‚Äôm essentially being punished and having work taken away because my coworker is upset I‚Äôm more experienced and more efficient.

I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this because I feel like I worked very hard to get to the level I am now, but due to coworker‚Äôs feelings, nothing matters now and I‚Äôm being knocked down and expected to due less and have projects fall behind.",04May2020,1

547,"*possible trigger warning*

Back in October of 2018 I was going through a rough patch. I was suffering PTSD symptoms from a traumatic event that I was not part from a few years prior. While going through this, I woke up one morning remembering something that happened in my childhood. I should also note here that I have trouble remembering anything from before the age of 12. It‚Äôs always been a sore spot for me and something my family makes fun of me for.

Anyways, that day I dreamt that I was sexually assaulted by someone close to me and what I was feeling emotionally felt way too real. I remember being home alone and just crying my eyes out and not being to control my breathing. I was shaking and for a period after that I didn‚Äôt want to live. I tried to look for help for a period of time to figure out if these dreams were real or just some experience my mind made up. However the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a real event that happened to me when I was 8.

Anyways, here‚Äôs what I need advice on: my family continuously makes fun of me for not remembering my childhood and after that day, I‚Äôve felt more uncomfortable when they bring it up. How do I get them to stop? I‚Äôve tried to just play it off when they bring it up but it never really works. Obviously none of my family knows and I‚Äôm not too keen on letting them know because I know they either wouldn‚Äôt believe me or it would fracture the family. Thoughts on what to do?

Also, I‚Äôve been wondering if my assault is in relation to why I‚Äôm gay (I‚Äôm a 22F). I was assaulted by a female and now I have a wonderful and caring gf and can‚Äôt help thinking that the reason I‚Äôm this way is because I liked some aspect of what happened to me. I try not to let that get to me because my relationship with my gf is different and it‚Äôs beautiful and healthy but I can‚Äôt help thinking that sometimes. She is also unaware of what happened to me.

Any advice?",04May2020,1
548,"I have been talking to someone for a few weeks now. I have noticed a few weird quirks about this guy that have raised some questions. I want to know if someone who has dated a man with schizophrenia or bipolar can tell me what early signs they noticed in the beginning of the relationship? Certain behaviors that you didn‚Äôt understand, until you found out about their diagnosis? This guy has joked about having schizophrenia and bipolar a few times, and sometimes i think it is because he is testing the waters. Testing my reaction for once he decides to disclose it to me. I told him I don‚Äôt care, but I will have questions and want to make sure he is doing everything he can to take care of himself. He gets kind of impulsive, and indecisive. Changes his mind about things often. For several days he will be sweet, and then several days where he hardly talks to me or acts pretty annoyed at everything. He admits he gets indecisive and impulsive and bored easily. He has a quick temper. I actually suspected ADD or ADHD at one point. I‚Äôm sorry if this post sounds insensitive or anything towards those with these issues.....I‚Äôm just curious. Anyway, basically just want to know if anyone has dated someone hiding a mental illness, and what signs showed through despite them trying to hide it? Thank you!!",04May2020,1
549,"I graduated high school last year and took a gap year unlike all of my friends. Anyway, during that time my life kind of fell apart, I chose not to confide in any of my friends as I didn‚Äôt want to bring that kind of negatively into their lives. Eventually I just cut them all off and went MIA to deal with my situation. In retrospect ignoring them and leaving them high and dry with no explanation was wrong. 

Because of the quarantine, all my friends have now returned home to the same city. Once things start to settle down, I most probably will see them. Because of this I thought it was in my best interest to attempt to make amends with at least my closest friends. I expect nothing from them, especially since I‚Äôm re-entering their lives abruptly- I know I cannot have it on my own terms. 

Long story short, I spoke to one of my friends about this conundrum after deciding to message my ex best friends. Apparently they have been speaking maliciously behind my back, saying things like ‚Äúim fishing for attention‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI expect them to talk first‚Äù and that they really don‚Äôt want to talk to me, when they in fact message me and carry the conversation forward. 

I want to know if I should just let it be. Should I just be content with the fact that I‚Äôve tried? Should I be more apologetic towards them? How do I resolve this issue, I know things will never go back to the way they were and I do not want nor expect them too. I simple want to be on good terms for the future since we all live in the same area and have the same friends. 

P.S if I were to explain myself to them, I don‚Äôt think I will be able to tell them why I went MIA in detail because it was a very traumatic and difficult time for me. Only one friend knows because I couldn‚Äôt handle the pain and panic.",04May2020,1
550,"Hi

Short version: are there any small or big actions I can do to help my girlfriend through her grief?

Longer: So I'm just fucking lost. I've never had anyone in my own family die, had an abusive dad of my own, and now I find out the man who was going to be my in-law is on his last few days after battling cancer. Worst of all, my girlfriend has had the shittest hand in life, and even has old documents from doctors where she cited him as her primary reason to fight her own depression in her teens. I just want to know how to help her, or the best way you've seen someone help a grieving loved one?

We drove from one end of the country to the other yesterday during lockdown with her brother (who is 20 years older than her), after getting a phone call from her older sister that we might not get a chance to see him. 

My GF is at the hospice now, presumably seeing him for the last time - only one person can visit a day due to coronavirus, and he has a lot of relatives waiting to see him. I will never see him again.

So please, if anyone here can please help, give advice, personal anecdotes of how to help, I need it. I've cried a lot about it already, but I dont know if my GF is worse affected by it, or if anyone knows from experience whether that helps her know I'm in it with her or not. She is just so disconnected from her family, her mother is a bit of a monster (she literally wished cancer upon him), and her siblings are both 2 decades older than her, and has trouble mixing with my family because shes never known proper functionality. She also has manic depression, ADHD and a history with EDs.

I know there isnt a true fix or magic way to help, but I just want to know what else I can do besides hold her and fight my own tears cursing the world for being so horrible. Anything tiny that has helped you guys or has helped people you know. 

If anyone else is going through something like this, my heart genuinely fucking bleeds for you. This is horrific",04May2020,1

Is this really possible, to spy on other devices like that? 
Is it through the internet? 
How much can he see?
 can he change anything on my phone through another device?

It came to a head right when coronavirus shut everything down. I took about 6 weeks off to try and recover and took some steroids to try and fix it. I have an appointment with a specialist in a few weeks. Overall things improved. I was called in to work last week and It has been nothing but torture since I started again.

554,"I live with my boyfriend and my roommate. She always gets on my nerves, and I've been getting increasingly emotional about it. She'll make jokes that don't actually feel like jokes to me, and it makes me extremely angry. I think I have anger issues, but no one else agrees with me. I never get physical or violent, or scream or anything, I just swear a lot when I'm overly angry. It just doesn't feel healthy to me. 

This morning, for example, my roommate made a joke about how I never unload the dishwasher. I explained that I don't really use the dishwasher, I do all of my dishes in the sink because it's faster. She replied ""you don't use the dishwasher because your bf does all the dishes"" and laughed. This set me off, because I cook all of my boyfriend and my meals and, most of the time, I wash all of the dishes right after eating. He probably washes the dishes once per week. So I kept arguing back and forth with her, and my bf stepped in and said ""it was a joke.""

I got very angry and just put my headphones in and ignored both of them while I worked on my computer. I was trying very hard not to cry. My boyfriend tried to come say goodbye to me before he left for work, but I ignored him. So he left without saying goodbye and I went and cried in the bathroom for a long time. Usually, when I start crying, I can't stop. I don't even know why I got so angry or started crying.

564," I'll readily admit, since exiting the education system when I graduated University, I've really struggled to continue with self development. I've been massively struggling with choice paralysis with the things I could be doing with my spare time, and have been for years.

I want to land a job in game development, so keep meaning to work on my skills for that field. I have a bunch of game projects I want to start. There are dozens of courses online that I have waiting to ""attend"". I'd like to learn to code. I want to learn some basic digital art techniques on my iPad. I've always been interested in the idea of learning a language. There's other things too...

When I go to start one of these things, whether it's an illustration course on Skillshare or an interactive coding tutorial, I freeze up. I think to myself ooh but what about that other thing? Shouldn't I do that first? Or the other thing?

And then I just end up doing nothing. And another week goes by where I end up avoiding the situation entirely, watch some movies, play some games. Fun, but not fruitful.

Some of the courses I have downloaded go as far back as 2018 and I just think... if I'd started one of them then, I might have a game dev job by now! Or I'd have learnt to code already! And that just makes things worse for how I feel.

Other benefits with skip are very customizable shifts, I can make up shifts the day of to a week in advance of basically the exact hours I want to work, i can also pause or end shifts whenever I want.

After this I noticed it was related to the future, the control of the future, and the fear of lack of control. But I can't say that's the only cause.

So, what can I learn or do? The pandemic is making it impossible to visit any doctors, but I desperately need to see a psychologist and a physio. My psych, too, but that's not important.

My symptoms right now are heavy sweating, slight muscle tension that persists, irritability, anger, cravings, fatigue (my eyes are heavy), torpor (easily fall asleep during meditation) and torpor-like brain fog. Lack of mental energy.

My previous symptoms were severe inability to relax or calm down, severe brain fog, stiff posture, irritability, depression, cognitive issues. I didn't notice the fatigue previously or torpor. I wasn't aware of my postural stiffness until it resolved. I didn't have anger, just irritability.",04May2020,1
588,"I'm really upset and torn about what to do. A very good friend I've had since childhood, the only one I still talk to daily, just bought a puppy and a kitten within a few months and hasn't gotten them shots or fixed. She doesn't get them groomed either and doesn't know how to trim nails. They have another dog her boyfriend has had for years who has NEVER gotten fixed or its shots, yet she keeps telling me she'll ""do it soon"" (get her puppy and kitten shots/fixed). She also has another cat which she got several months ago that has no shots. She was even asking me advice a few weeks ago on training and said her family member told her the best way to train a puppy not to play bite is to squeeze its mouth shut. She told me all he does after she does that is whimper and keeps biting. I told her NOT to abuse her puppy, as it might grow up aggressive, and to try positive reinforcement training. I told her what to do and she seemed thankful but I don't know if she'll stick to it.

I've already told her that what she's doing is neglect but she keeps saying she's ""really bad with money"", ""has no money"", yet every time she gets money (like the stimulus check we all got) she spent it all on something unnecessary. I warned her that if her dogs or cats catch anything, they could die. I told her that not trimming nails could cause them to grow into the pads or the quicks in the nails to grow out so long that you'd be cutting veins if you trimmed his nails. She said she understood and would be trimming them on her own. I told her if she ever doesn't want to trim them, nail trims are really cheap, but she ignored me.

What should I do? I'm really tempted to call on her in a few months if she doesn't get her pets shots but I feel like she'll never talk to me again. Her state also doesn't have good animal protection laws so I feel like nothing would be done anyway. I'm at a loss, I almost want to have her take her animals to the vet and have them bill me for it but I really can't afford to take care of all of her pets.",04May2020,1

590,"Hey Reddit,

These kind of questions are propably seen very often here, nevertheless I would be really happy to receive a serious answer. 

I am 20 years old and managed to never have a girlfriend.

I met a girl at a friends house a bunch of days ago.

And I don't know why, but I don't get her out of my head. 

The thing with me is, that I always manage to leave the first impression of someone with a lot of selfesteem. I have self esteem, but only if I know that this person is not leaving me, or if the person is unknown to me. 

I am pretty sure that she is single, but am going to ask my friend to be sure. 

But if she finds me attractive and we meet, she will probably recognise that I don't have a clue how to handle a girl outside of the friendzone. 

By just thinking about it my anxiety rises. 

So I would really appreciate it if you have any advice on how not to show my inexperience.",04May2020,1

My anxiety and depression was already really s\*\*\* before so this really didn't help anything, especially because right before I had a lot of opportunities. I was doing well in school, which was rare. I asked out my crush, and she f\*\*\*\*\*\* said yes. I was able to be out with friends every night and was still successful. With corona starting I lost a lot of my drive because those opportunities were all taken away from me. I lost my job, my girlfriend, and my grades plummeted.

597,"In brief, I (21F) had a casual relationship with someone who I was previously friends with. Before doing anything, we talked about our expectations and I made it clear that I don't want any serious relationship as I was just finished with my ex (again, but that's another story). In hindsight, I am not and was not at all attracted to this guy, and in the back of my mind I didn't really want to do anything sexual with him, but as bad as it sounds, I was just done with my ex and this guy was close and available.

Before long it was clear he was catching feelings, and I ended it because of this. However, we stayed friends, and he asked me to do him a favour. The favour was to sign his sister's friend into our building (residents can only sign in one guest each, and he was signing in his sister) after they came back from a night out (2am ish). I did so, despite having work early that morning, and he explained to me that he didn't have anywhere to sleep that night because his sister and her friend were taking his room. He showed me pictures of blankets on his kitchen floor and chairs and asked if he could stay in my room otherwise he'd have to sleep there in the cold. I didn't want him to stay in my room, but felt I couldn't really say no. I said he could, but to remember what I had said before about how I don't want anything to happen. he agreed.

That morning, shortly before my alarm, I woke to find his hand slipped under my pyjama shirt, groping my chest. I sat up and told him no, and he left. I cried in the shower, and felt guilty for crying because I know others have had worse happen but I just felt so violated. After that I cut contact but he continually found ways to message me, but I believe now I have blocked him on everything. He apologised and made pathetic excuses, but he still refused to respect my boundaries when he ignored my wish to not be contacted.

In hindsight, I can recall many times that he made me uncomfortable, like blatantly stating he would walk behind me on stairs, or when he asked me how to use a squat rack in the gym just to stare at my ass. He would also ask me to send him nudes even when we were just friends, and once even told me, completely unprovoked, that he had masturbated to a (fully-clothed) picture of me. I regret not listening to myself and saying no more and being stronger when I felt uncomfortable instead of just accepting it and feeling like I need to let it keep going to make people happy. I'm angry at myself for ever doing anything with him; what was I thinking?

This happened months ago, but now all I feel is regret for ever having letting him near me and giving him something he didn't deserve. I feel ashamed of myself for anything ever happening with him, including things that were consensual. I feel like I have lost worth as a person for ever sleeping with him and wish I had listened to myself when I knew I didn't really want to do anything with him (I do believe it was because I had just ended things with an ex and at the time, I struggled with turning down attention, if that makes me a terrible person I don't know, but its the truth). I feel hatred for him for what he did, and that I can manage, but I struggle with the regrets and shame.

Why do I feel this way? How can I deal with it? Should I feel this way? 

TL;DR: How do you handle regretting a casual relationship with someone you don't/didn't find attractive and turned out to be not so nice of a person? How do you deal with feeling like you've lost self-worth?",04May2020,1
598,"  Hey guys, um so my phone that I worked my ass off to get (Beautiful Note 8), may potentially die in the next few weeks because of my incompetence, I spilled coffee and then went to wash it, the fuck up starts here, I washed it with warm steaming water and the steam got into my phone and that was 2 days ago, I took the sim card tray out to inspect and there's tiny water droplets in the tray area, fast forward to today, I noticed my light sensor and front camera has water vapor beneath it. And I took the tray out just now, it still had tiny droplets. 

  The problem is, there is no phone repair shop I can bring it too now because my country is still on lockdown because of the virus.

602,"So I did post this before, but I realized it was too much of a rant for anyone to understand what I‚Äôm asking. So here is a better version. 

So I‚Äôm gonna try to make this short. I‚Äôm a bisexual junior male in high school, and after ending a relationship because of quarantine I became pretty heartbroken, so I confided in the only guy who would listen to me at the time, which is a freshman on my swim team. And we really hit it off. I knew he was a kinda nice guy, but as I got to know him he turned out to be so pure and kind. Because of that, we decided to do a little bit of a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù relationship, and started texting and FaceTiming way more often than we did when we were just friends. Which was fun. I really like talking to him and hanging out with him, even if just on FaceTime. But he‚Äôs sending me mixed signals now and I‚Äôm just so confused, so I want to tell you how it‚Äôs been to see if maybe I‚Äôm overreacting or if I‚Äôm right to feel this way. 

It‚Äôs been two weeks since we started this officially, and for the first two days he was basically texting me all day. We FaceTimed literally all day on the third day, but then he suddenly disappears for a day and a half. The day after that he goes back to normal, and we FaceTime all day for two days in a row once more, before he disappears for a whole day again. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been this entire two weeks, and I don‚Äôt know how to feel because he never wants to tell me what‚Äôs going on. We talk about it and he says he‚Äôs busy, has a doctor‚Äôs appointment, classes, etc but he never really gets into it that much. I know he can still gets my messages even while doing all that, so I feel like he sometimes ignores me on purpose.

In his defense, he had his phone taken away and he‚Äôs using an iPad. But still, I‚Äôm not gonna lie here because this whole thing is kind of making me jealous. Because even though we‚Äôre in a casual relationship, I also know that he‚Äôs kind of ‚Äúplayful‚Äù, if you know what I‚Äôm trying to say. He likes to get online and mess around with other boys and strangers on the internet. And I actually know that on the days he ignores me, he spends it doing that because I can obviously see his snapscore inching up whenever he leaves me on delivered. Which is fine to me since we‚Äôre just in a casual relationship. But he never tells me about it, and kinda just says he has a busy schedule some days whenever I ask him about it. 

And that‚Äôs driving me insane. If I text him and he‚Äôs busy messing around, just tell me you‚Äôll text me later. Don‚Äôt disappear and just not tell me about it. And I know I may sound clingy right now, but it‚Äôs weird because on the other days where we FaceTime a lot, he‚Äôs always so clingy. I try to go, or I try to tell him I‚Äôm gonna be back cuz I need to eat dinner, and he‚Äôs always sad. He never tells me not to go or begs me to stay, but he always becomes pretty down, and will send me messages every thirty minutes or so telling me about how his iPad died and won‚Äôt charge, or how it‚Äôs raining and he‚Äôs scared of thunder, and all that attention-seeking stuff. I‚Äôm not annoyed at that because I know he‚Äôs just a little clingy, and I even think it‚Äôs cute, but where does all this go the next day? When he just disappears, and I know he gets my messages but won‚Äôt open them? 

It‚Äôs just so weird. Why does he suddenly feel like he has to ignore me, and why won‚Äôt he just tell me why? We‚Äôre in a casual relationship, so he knows I‚Äôll be fine with it, especially since I‚Äôm sure he already knows that I know what he‚Äôs doing. So why not just say it? And if he maybe just wants to take a break, why not just take the break during those days when we‚Äôre literally talking all day and we don‚Äôt leave our rooms? Why does he have to disappear for a day or two to take a break? And if he wants to take a whole day or two, why not actually say it, and admit to me what you want to do so I don‚Äôt get left hanging? I mean we‚Äôre in a casual relationship, why the need for all this secrecy?

I just feel hurt and confused, not because of what he‚Äôs doing when he disappears, but because he disappears and gives excuses about why. 

But in his defense today, is one of those days he said he‚Äôll be busy again (and once again I can see his snapscore going up), but this time he still takes the time to snap me and reply every half an hour or so. He even told me once that he‚Äôs going to the store before disappearing for about an hour and a half (his snapscore went crazy so you know what happened), and even though that made me feel better that he at least considered my feelings, I‚Äôm still mad and hurt that he lied. 

So, I guess I want to ask if I‚Äôm overreacting? Am I just smothering him, or am I right, and this guy is just not being considerate? I just feel so bad because he‚Äôs never been in any kind of relationship before, which was why I said we should only do a casual relationship. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally hurt him because no matter what I know he cares for me, but I just I can‚Äôt help the way I feel and want to call him out on his lies. But then that‚Äôll make me look like a bad guy because we‚Äôre just in a casual relationship. I guess what I really want is to hear him speak from his mouth the real reason he disappears after every two or three days of us talking like crazy. I already know what he‚Äôs doing. I just want him to say it.

TL;DR
Didn‚Äôt want to get in serious relationship with a inexperienced dude so went for casual, but now I think I‚Äôm getting hurt by him messing around, but feel like I can‚Äôt confront him about it because we‚Äôre ‚Äúcasual‚Äù.",04May2020,1

Last summer for the first time I spent 2 months away from my family in a foreign country. It was for an internship in a university and I was staying in a student hostel. There were no external problems really but I started feeling lonely and anxious pretty soon after I arrived. This effected the way I ate (I would barely eat anything) and discouraged me a lot from cooking. One day when my anxiety was at its peak, I tried to cook for myself and I just freaked out soon after and had sort of an anxiety attack and just left the kitchen.

After that I just started eating more in school cafeteria and made some friends who I would eat out with and things got better. However, since then I have a ‚Äúkitchen fear‚Äù sort to say.

611,"The title is the TL;DR. The long version is here.

I'm an admin of an online club. In it, there's this guy who I'll call Dwayne. Dwayne is an awkward 19 year old still learning the ways of the world. Sometimes he reminds me of my younger self. I don't know the full details of his life, but he's emotionally stunted. He runs his mouth. He's anxious. He craves attention. He only knows how to talk about himself. He tries to be nice, he tries to be funny, he's honestly wished me well at times I wasn't expecting him to. He's even said he sees me as a father figure.

Dwayne is also very creepy.

He's self-absorbed without being self-aware. He's terrible at taking hints. He is cringy on purpose: not just in the domain of dad jokes, but in the sense that he thinks he is being entertaining by making people uncomfortable. He talks regularly about how he is depressed and takes shots at himself as if it's entertaining to - despite how no one else likes it. He procrastinates from his projects and talks about it like it's a joke, then complains. In our club, he never practices and then complains about being bad. He struggles with anxiety, but decides to let that anxiety force him to run his mouth. It is clear that he is being an emotional vampire to our community, that he is using us for validation without actually accepting our help. I feel that no matter what we say at this point, we're not being supportive friends so much as enablers.

Just last night, Dwayne dropped out of an event we were running, and hours later complained over being unskilled. We told him that often the only way to get better was to challenge people better than us, and to practice. He refused and tried to derail the topic into more references to depression and cringy jokes, until the rest of us wanted to move on. Then he DMed me in private, telling me he wanted to practice but that my advice wasn't helping him. I offered to watch him train, just needed a time that suited him. He says no, because he feels his sadism coming back.

Being sadistic? He never spoke about this before. Yet he swears to me he's fine and that this is a natural thing for him. Iunno about you but sadism doesn't seem natural to me for anyone. He doesn't take the hints to stop, either: he just goes on about how when we first met, he was ""being sadistic towards...something else..."" 

I see red flags when I see people using ellipses like that. Even redder ones when they go on about being sadistic. To what? Other people? Himself? Jesus Christ.

It's at this point I give up beating about the bush and tell him to get help. He doesn't realise how painfully transparent he is being. This isn't the first time, but clearly he hasn't done anything like go see a therapist or change his environment since last I tried talking to him. I'm trying to be supportive, but also explain that I can't actually be that sort of person for him. At this point I'm not dropping hints, I'm clear-cut spelling my intent out to him. Go get yourself in order or you can't be someone I can be around. Which he sees as the exact opposite: of me wanting to be involved. Even when I spell out to him that I want to quit the conversation. Even when I express how uncomfortable he is making me feel. Even when I say ""Keep replying and I'll block you"".

He kept replying. I blocked him.

An hour later, I see he was spamming me on another social media account, trying to continue the conversation there. What the fuck. 

Now I've some experience with this sort of thing: of stunted people going down the wrong path. At this point I'm terrified I have a stalker on my hands, that I'm going to be reliving some days of my past I promised I'd never relive. I don't even reply to him this time: I debate it but I ultimately just block him. When I wake up the next morning, I see he was up at 6am for some ungodly reason, and left me some DMs - on yet another platform. He says he's sorry, that he understands if I'm done with him, he knows he would be. 

Again, what the fuck.

I've blocked Dwayne from everywhere now. I don't ever want to see or hear from him again. He's met me IRL but with the quarantine right now that's not a worry. What is a worry is that he's a member still of the community I'm in. He's not bothered anyone much since last night, but just seeing his messages there disturbs me. I'm still sympathetic, but I no longer care. The only reason I haven't yet is I'm wondering if that's fair: I'd have to make his private behaviour to me public. He'd be ostracised from the community for good. But every day this goes on, I'm worried he'll become something worse. I was on tilt last night, and I've been on til for all of today. I just don't know what to do.",04May2020,1
612,"I've (18M) been recently pondering a lot about what I want to do with my life, e.g. what type of work I want to do, what I want to dedicate myself to. I've come to the conclusion that humanitarian work really interests me (say working for the UN as an example), but I'm not really sure my study choice really reflects that. I'm currently inscribed for computer science (which also interests me), is this a good choice for what I want to do? Is it possible to do UN work working in informatics and then potentially branching out with the experience gained, or do I need to change my course of study?

I feel ugly and i dont know what to do. 
I recently started birth control and a side effect is weight gain. It seems like no matter how much i exercise and eat right the weight keeps coming. :(( it's to the point where i don't even want to fly down to see him. Im so embarrassed.

I think it's the right decision. I'm ready to quit now and go right down to my old job and talk to my old boss. The only downside to this, is the overnight shift. 3rd shift is brutal.

Then I get a notification and see that her best friend texted me and immediately started cussing me out. She didn‚Äôt have an argument, she just threw offensive things at me and it didn‚Äôt bother me so I just blocked her.

Then I get a notification from my now ex and it says she‚Äôs screen recording. I got upset, knowing that she was probably meaning to show people this. I looked at what she was sending me and i didn‚Äôt bother to read it because I told her that if she was to act this was she can forget it. I then blocked her on everything.

I fucking hate interviews and I hate being judged by these people lording over you and picking and prying at you. When people say that in the 90s, jobs were being handed out to people, I never can imagine what that looks like as interviews are always awful, long, painful, drawn-out experiences. If I have an interview coming up, I can't stop thinking about it until it's over but I also don't know how to prepare in the most perfect way possible.

Then once i hit 7 my parents began resenting each other and had a 7 year long court battle trying to break each other. They spent over a hundred thousand dollars trying to screw each other over with custody. I remember screaming for years for them to stop because I was tired of seeing my mom arrested constantly on trumped up charges and my houses constantly changing due to financial issues. I would go to bed hungry, never had clothes that fit, and couldnt do anything. Sports and friends were out of the picture because my mom went to a baseball game i was at and didnt see my dad, so my dad called the cops because he had a restraining order. My parents became physically and verbally abusive towards me because of all their pent up anger and I couldnt go through a day without worrying about where im gonna live and which parent im going to lose. Once I hit 16, both of them finally came to their senses about how much they were destroyingn everyone involved. I moved out once i turned 18 and have had very little to do with them since. Now im almost 20, but i have so many mental issues that prevent me from making it through a day with any sort of happiness. I actively want to put a bullet in my head, but cant because both of my parents are suicidal and have said they would kill themselves if i did.

629,"I had a best friend who was really like a soulmate in terms of the connection we had as friends. And we had this project we were working on together that was making a website on original research for a competition.

Website-making and research are two of my biggest skills. If I were working alone, I know that I would have had a really good shot at getting a state, or even national and international award that could strongly improve my college application and even qualify me for scholarships. But I chose to work with her because she told me she'd help me and she wanted to do it with me as Besties‚Ñ¢. It was supposed to be made throughout the course of a couple of months, but because she didn't want to work on it earlier, we waited until the final month to do it. Which was fine with me, but we needed to really put a lot of effort in that month.

Despite this, she didn't help me *at all* and I had to do it all by myself. On the final day, I gave her a list of things to finish up the website while I attended a service trip. She promised she'd do it. When I returned, she hadn't done ANYTHING. Our website wasn't complete and we were disqualified.

I was completely livid that I had spent a double digit number of hours on this project for nothing. It could have added a lot to my college application and she stole that from me, and she lied to me multiple times that she'd work on it that day and didn't. I literally even messaged her while on the trip asking if everything was going ok with the project and she said that she was making good progress and was almost done. When I sent her messages telling her how pissed I was after the deadline had passed - long messages with a detailed and clear list of exact reasons I was angry - she turned the tables on me and said it was my fault it wasn't finished because I gave her tasks to work on and I shouldn't have expected her to do them.

So I told her to message me why I shouldn't just end our friendship right then and there if she's willing to waste my time, lie to my face, and get all defensive when I told her my side of the story. She said that I was making a big deal out of an irrelevant thing. So I said oh, you wanna see a big deal? Ok! And told her never to talk to me again, ever.

She messaged me a couple of days later asking if we could have an in-person talk to discuss things and I told her no, I already texted her all my opinions and then blocked her.

I try to be a positive person, so whenever someone breeds negativity, I tell them that they do so, then cut them off completely. It‚Äôs better to pretend they don‚Äôt exist then let them bother me by existing. Every time I think of what she did it makes me angry, so I blocked her in order to not think about it again.

A couple of months later (today) she sent me [this](https://imgur.com/a/QXXBmrB) message through a groupchat. The blacked out part is the name of the competition (which she again called irrelevant).

What should I do??? I‚Äôm honestly shocked that me cutting her off hurt her this much. It hurt me deeply too, but if someone makes me angry, it is so easy for me to let go of their memory because I‚Äôve learned how to do that due to trauma (which she referenced when she talked about my parents hurting me. I‚Äôm stuck at home with them because of COVID-19). And I‚Äôve trusted so many people and gotten betrayed so many times that I have no tolerance for liars - and she lied a *lot* \- and people who don‚Äôt listen to the other side of the story.

She even made [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tLb9vhUBrnDZnVmnnHhHR?si=UUByosVyR_uuvJPiNHzb6g) about me on her Spotify - please read the description and the names of the songs. This playlist is really what made me cry, even more than the message. I don‚Äôt think she remembers that she followed me on Spotify, and I don‚Äôt think she knows I‚Äôve seen this playlist, so these are not sugarcoated opinions - they‚Äôre her real thoughts. The songs are so confusing to me! Some of them have names like ‚Äúi hope your whole life sux,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Call Me Up,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Aint Shit,‚Äù while others are ‚ÄúWhite Flag,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Leave,‚Äù and ‚Äúi miss the old u.‚Äù Most of them have angry and spiteful titles so I‚Äôm assuming she hates me, but she also sent that message about how she loves me??

I really need any advice that I can get in this situation. I'm really emotionally distraught over it, which is why I blocked her in the first place. She's really put me into a predicament. Should I forgive her? Do you think she‚Äôs being genuine and still wants to be friends with me? Thank you so much.",04May2020,1

632,"I don‚Äôt know what to do. My best friend, a very social person, suddenly became more enclosed in themselves. They began gaming, where I think they feel it‚Äôs their safe space. However, due to that, they became more and more engulfed in the virtual reality, their online friends, and are distancing themselves from us, their real life friends (me and their other besties). I don‚Äôt mean ignoring completely, but for someone who always used to call and text 24/7, now they almost never call and while daily, they text only when are taking a short (10-15) minutes break from their game every few hours. As I‚Äôve known this friend felt unhappy for a long time, I am worried as they are saying that they feel very happy currently - because they cannot be in the virtual world constantly, and I believe that now the real world will make them sadder because life has to continue in the real world, after the lockdown ends. I am never, ever going to give up on this friend. But I am confused - they say it‚Äôs nothing personal, the distancing from me, and they still love me, and they are happy. So I want to be happy for them, but I can‚Äôt, not just because I guess I cannot accept the idea that I can‚Äôt make them happy enough to enjoy the real world more than the virtual, but because they are giving up on everything they once enjoyed, such as other hobbies, including studying.
How do I help this friend, do they even need help, or am I the one that needs to accept that this has nothing to do with me, and they still love me, even though they spend less time with me? I feel like if I don‚Äôt do anything, I am reinforcing this behaviour, but if I do say something, they will get annoyed and will distance themselves even more.

I wasn't vaccinated until I turned 20 and started working with kids (and thought it was super irresponsible to do so without protecting myself and them). I never watched TV and tbh I'm fine with that to this day. I wasn't allowed Junk food etc. I grew up between France and India and my parents used to be Hippies. They're way less now but they still have a hippie streak.  
  
Anyway, my mom has always been really into conspiracy theories. I completely understand that, there's something really wrong with the world and we're all trying to make sense of it. I don't trust the government in the least but she's on another level. COVID19 is caused by 5G. Vaccines cause autism (had a fight with her about it because I'm most likely autistic but hadn't veen vaccinated until recently). Chemtrails. Big Pharma. 9/11. She recently started talking to me about David Icke and I kinda lost it. If I remember correctly, he's an absolute pi√®ce of shit that is anti-semetic and just generally awful. I was basically begging her to stop listening to these people. I told her that the people who talk about 5G causing COVID19 are the same that tell you to feed bleach to your autistic kids. Would she listen to them then and have done that to me? I was upset. She was surprised, and said she couldn't imagine the people that are trying to ""help us"" are actually pi√®ces of shit, often alt-right bigots etc. She was genuinely surprised and stumped.  
  
My question is, how can I help her see that these people are completely idiots? Especially David Icke, she's spoken about him a few times and I'd like to properly show her that he's not a good person, or to be trusted. I love my mother and all her choices were done out of love for me. It's easy to laugh at anti-vax people and I agree that it's an idiotic stance, but if they truly believe it, it's not done out of malice. A lot of it is done out of a justified distrust of the government. They generally have a shitty track record.

But the things that's tripping me up on whether I'm bisexual or pansexual or just a lesbain, is whether I'm attracted to women physically like with genitalia. 

With guys I know that for me I find almost nothing attractive about them and its just their genitalia, and really it's only certain ones at that.

At the beginning of April she started taking pills for non medical reasons I don‚Äôt want to get into too deeply. Since then she had enormous pain and is getting more and more depressed. Under no circumstances does she want to lay of these pills, it‚Äôs more important than anything else to her.
Even though it was rough, we could always look forward to meeting again, but today her parents forbid us meeting anytime again with no way of changing their minds. 
I try to calm her down, preventing her from doing anything stupid but I can‚Äôt really do anything. I‚Äôm scared myself, I just need to see her somehow in the near future, I just miss her so much and it hurts knowing I won‚Äôt be able to see her soon and not being able to get private time with her in a long time.

So yesterday i asked my friend if he wanted to play ‚Äúwill in a bit‚Äú an hour passes then john comes on, so i go on and then bam my friend comes on. Fast forward to today. John says wanna play, i say ok just finishing my art. Notice my friend comes online. And joins. Not only that but hes been offline all fucking day doesnt message me or anything. But once john comes he fucking comes on. Then john asks if i want to play a game, and i say (sorry about this language, im not against gays or anything this was a spur of the moment thing/joke) ‚Äúno thats gay‚Äú then he pipes up and goes ‚Äú oh thats against the rules in my discord server‚Äú blah blah fuckkng blah. I leave and feeling dead pissed off to the point of my anger turned to sadness and now i just burst out crying, i just wanted to play with john and do what i planned to do, if he doesnt like me why doesnt he say it to my face, he said on his reddit page that should he cut me off.

646,"So...

In two of my previous relationships it didn't work out romantically, but they proposed that we be friends.. 

In the first relationship, I convinced her to get back together, it blew up worse than the first time and we never spoke again.

In the second relationship, we were friends, but then when we hung out I wanted sex, kisses, fondling, etc... We hooked up, but it ruined the friendship and that didn't work out.

Now, my most recent relationship didn't work out, but we still like talking to each other and being friends. She said we can hang out sometime.

I like being friends with her very much.

I don't want my off the charts libido to undermine that by doing what I did in the first two relationships which is being sexual and wanting more than friendship again.

How can I ensure that I don't repeat the past, control my sexual urges, and keep my dick in my pants?

I'd like to hang out with her and do normal friend stuff. Play video games, etc...

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you",04May2020,1

My wife and I recently received the results of our tax return and it turns out we both owe money which has never happened before. We used a new person who is in the field, however, I do not feel like he did the best he could. We never really had a sit down to go over everything, and then COVID made things extra difficult so he ended up completing them and just letting me know we owed. I did not care the for person in regards to his communication and how he has been throughout the process so I do not want to go back to him

. However since I was dissatisfied I entered my wife's and my information into HR block online and they determined we should be receiving money and would prefer to file this way. I did not do anything shady or sketchy or make up false claims. I simply put int our w2s' our property tax information dependent care etc.

The head director of security was not happy, he ordered the assistant director of security to take the following action which was written as ‚Äúsuspension until further investigation‚Äù I‚Äôve seen something similar happen to two other guards who never came back.

When we met around a year ago now, got obsessive quickly and called and messaged me hundreds of times in a row. I soon realised that he was only doing this because I was one of the only friends he had at the time. A few months later we became very close and have been since. He lives about an hour away from me so I don‚Äôt get to see him much but we message each other all the time.

Because he doesn‚Äôt have many people he can call friends, he gets very defensive of those that he has, regularly standing up for them and getting into fights.

He‚Äôs always messaging me about how he got into a fight or how he almost broke his arm or something like that. One time, I was coming round to see him again and I had to go to the hospital with him after he got punched in the head with brass knuckles a few hours before I showed up. Every time it seemed to escalate. I‚Äôve tried to help him but it keeps happening over and over again. 

At around 12:30AM, I got a call from him, he said he was stabbed after his cousin got jumped and he went to help. I stayed on the line with him as long as I could but after about an hour, it just went dead. I was terrified that something even worse had happened to him, maybe I was just jumping to conclusions.

About an hour ago, he sent me a photo of him at the hospital, reassuring me that he was okay, but I can tell he‚Äôs not.

658,"Hey guys 

For context, I (20F) live in a student living apartment complex in a 3x3 apartment. We all have our own leased bedroom/bathroom and share the kitchen and living room. Since COVID-19 shut down our school, my third roommate has gone home, so now it‚Äôs just me, my roommate (18F), and my roommates girlfriend (18?F). 

Back in August, my apartment complex placed them randomly in here because the room was vacant. At first, I thought only, let‚Äôs call her Polly, one roommate moved in. I met Polly and her parents and exchanged contact info the day she moved in. That was the last day when things were remotely normal. Since then, she has probably responded to my texts 4 times, didn‚Äôt tell me she changed her number which is how we communicate about the bills, has moved in her girlfriend which she told us was her wife (against the lease), and doesn‚Äôt even clean the small amount of common space they use. The bills were even split three ways when my other roommate was here even though there was two people in the room. 

This all brings me to last week. I was in bed and at 2am, they come home, turn on all the lights and start slamming doors and just being generally disruptive. THEN I hear a dog barking. In my opinion, the size of the apartment, let alone the room, is not appropriate for a dog. So I text her, asking what is going on, and she tells me that she‚Äôs sorry for the puppy and that it‚Äôs her service dog for her PTSD and social anxiety...

Now, I don‚Äôt know them. I‚Äôve spoken to them a total of probably 8 times because they stay strictly in their room and it‚Äôs only ever been ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúhow are you?.‚Äù But the way this dog behaves, based on what I hear, this is not a service dog. There is whining, barking, and the first night it was here, it sounded like he was literally running on the walls. A couple days after they had it, I could even smell pee coming from the room and saw a pee pad coming out from under their door (all carpet). I‚Äôve also been home since 5pm yesterday and I haven‚Äôt heard them take it outside once. The barking just got pretty bad so I knocked on the wall which made it stop but I still hear whining. I also don‚Äôt hear them talk to it in any way except to scold it. 

What are my options here? I‚Äôm worried about the dog but don‚Äôt want to accuse someone of animal abuse with no actual evidence. Thank you for any advice!

Tl;Dr: Roommate (18F) &amp; roommates gf (18F) brought home a dog last week. Says it‚Äôs for her PTSD and social anxiety. I haven‚Äôt heard the dog be taken outside since it‚Äôs been here and there is constant barking or whining and I rarely hear them talking to it unless it‚Äôs scolding.

I'm 17F and I recently moved to a new apartment building with my mom. So everything seemed fine, but one day I came across some weird kid just starring at me from his window (I was going for a walk) he just smiled creepily and waved I was a bit taken aback but I said ""fuck it"" and just casually waved back (no smile no nothing). I found out later on that the kid had some kind of mental disability and I guess his guardian/s didn't let him outside very often.

After a few months this kid (who lives on the 4 floor and I live on the second) always seems to be right there when I'm exiting my building at the window or I bump into him on my way down the stairs (cuz we don't have elevators) and he just weirdly says ""Hi"" and stares at me which gives me a really uneasy feeling. I don't want to be rude, it's sad that he has difficulties but like, every time I go out he'll be at the window and sometimes I'll hear a knock on the door or a door unlocking and steps that end near my door. Even screams! I may be just paranoid but I think sometimes he comes down to my floor and just stays there (Idk for sure).

Another thing there was another kid kinda similar but younger probably 10 or 12 who did mostly the same saying hi and starring but he also followed me sometimes. I honestly have no idea why I always find these kinds of people or why they seem to take a liking to me! I feel very freaked out and my mom just says to ignore it!

675,"Hello, r/Advice. I'm writing the following text because I've been holding it back for months, but I've finally reached my limit. Nobody should hold back just because they dont' want the person against you to feel hurt or offended in general. I had to learn this truth the hard way and to be frank, I'm not really proud I came to this conclusion so late. Oh, well. Better late than never as they say.

Anyway my issue here is with my mother. For the past couple of months she has been really annoying me. I've always had this sort of bittersweet relationship with her ever since my teenage years. She is always complaining how lazy, stupid and apathetic I am. She always blames me for everything wrong I did even when it's clearly not my fault, sometimes she would even get mad for even the smallest of things just because. And whenever she is clearly wrong abouth something, she never admits its her fault. Not to mention that when I point out how much of a hypocrite she is in some situations, she goes full 180 degrees and acts as if she is the true victim in our arguments. My mother also seems to suffer from some sort of an inferiority complex in regards to my dad and his mother. My dad, while also having his own flaws, is much more reasonable and less prone to jump to some conclusions about my lifestyle and my grandma is a sweetheart, who only wishes the best for our family. I think the reason for her behaviour is because she is spending most of the time at work and gets irritated and as a result she lashes out at us, me and my little brother especially, because it relives her from the daily stress. That's just my opinion, though.

So, yeah there you have it. I'm almost finished with my first year in university so when the time comes I plan to move out in an apartment in nearby town. I don't know if its a good idea, but honestly it seems like the most logical choice for now. Some feedback would be most appreciated. Cheers.",04May2020,1

So he had the audacity to walk 2 inches close to my face and expected me to be okay with it. I told him like 3 times I needed personal space, and he didn‚Äôt listen so I pushed him away.

He claimed ‚Äòself-defense‚Äô and punched me hard. I was pretty mad at his BS excuse so I punched him back. He ran around the house ranting and raving. He threatened to kick me out of ‚Äòhis house‚Äô (he‚Äôs just a tenant like me, but did bring me into the house) in ‚Äòtwo weeks‚Äô because I ‚Äòbring the worst out of him‚Äô.

I told him I wasn‚Äôt responsible for anyone‚Äôs behavior and his aggressive behavior was pathetic, and I wasn‚Äôt intimidated by him. He kept following me around and such.

He also threatened to ‚Äòdo everything to remove me‚Äô.

Obviously my brother is an asshole but we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic. Also I don‚Äôt really have that much money and I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I think it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous somebody can use the act of turning off a light and some words to attempt to intimidate someone. 

He also locked me out of the house and I told him I was entitled to have entry.

679,"I have only one sibling, an older sister, and we've never got along with each other. When we were little I was afraid of her because she often yelled at me for annoying her. When we got older I wasn't afraid anymore but instead started to hate her - during her teenage years she was really lazy and entitled. Even though we shared the same room we barely ever talked to each other. As a result we don't even know each other enough to have an opinion; after she left for university I don't how much she has changed so I don't judge or think anything of her. I directly asked what she thought of me and she told she didin't know me well enough. *For our entire lives he haven't even got to know each other.*

For almost two months she's been here. Sometimes I badly want to talk to her, to share what I am doing with her, maybe even to vent but I just feel too awkward to start. Few times she asked me if I wanted to play card games and such with her but I don't think she really enjoyed it (to clarify, I don't consider myself good at reading people and I am quick to assume bad). Once she even invited me to go out with some of her friends but I didn't really feel at the right place - I had almost no idea what they were talking about and was just silent.

I've wanted to become friends with other people I know but I never asked them about anything outside of school/projects; it just feels really unnatural to me to approach people like that - especially since I was an actual outsider who met them for work. I even have their contacts but I don't know what to say to them. Because of the lockdown and since I am last year in highschool I am probably never going to see or hear them again unless I contact them. But I am definitely going to see my sister again and I don't want us to be strangers to each other whole life.

How can I start a conversation that's not just small talk?",04May2020,1

682,"A few years ago, my mom found out my dad had tinder on his phone with some pictures of random women.  This was found out on a family trip and it kinda messed up everything (made everything awkward and uncomfortable since we were all in one room).  They had marriage counselling and lots of arguments, but it was settled after my dad promised to never do it again.  My dad then relocated to the middle east to work, as he was offered a very profitable position as a lawyer there.  This obviously put a lot of stress on their relationship, as they've been living together for so long till now.  He's still there at the moment, although my mom and him call nearly every single day at a set time.

A few days ago I got a text from my mom (I don't live with her) asking if I had an app called Bumble installed downloaded on my phone.  She had found out through icloud...but the icloud was registered under some bullshit gmail that I remembered was my dad's spam.  I said no and she started hardcore panicking, asking me for clarification and everything.  I started panicking also because I could've guessed she was alluding to my dad cheating on her again, so I lied and said yes.  I know it was a shitty decision to lie like that...but I wanted to figure out my options and see how I could possibly fix this or at least make it easier on my mom when I have to break it to her...idk.  I told her that I downloaded it as I was lonely over quarantine.  I still feel really shitty about lying to her.

I called my dad a few minutes ago and asked if he had Bumble installed.  He was super clueless about it until I just straight up told him to ""figure it out and be honest.""  He said he would call me back later as he had some work to do.  

I don't want to jump to conclusions...but I think he's cheating on my mom.  If so, I dont know how to break it to my mom...she would be absolutely broken.  I have no idea how to go forward in this situation, I don't want to completely disconnect from my dad either...he is still my dad.

684,"This past weekend I had a pretty turbulent moving-out experience from the apartment I'd been renting for the last six months. The landlord sold the 15 year old apartment two months ago and the new owners wanted to move into it themselves instead of renting it out. Before this weekend, I had a decently positive relationship with the landlord (having a small chat whenever we'd see each other, exchanging small gifts for Christmas, etc.).

I had to vacate the apartment by the end of May 1st and the new owners were moving in May 4th. During the last week of April and up until the 4th, lots of construction was happening in the house since a significant part of the ceiling needed to be replaced due to water damage from above. 

With a quarter of the apartment sanctioned off and workmen coming in and out, I tried to clean the rest of the apartment as best I could. I took apart the fridge/freezer and washed it, scrubbed the oven down, mopped all the floors, and wiped down the bathroom, etc. Late that afternoon, the landlord came to inspect the apartment and didn't make it past the entryway and bathroom. She claimed my cleaning wasn't sufficient since there was dust on top of the electrical outlets and some red buildup in the creases of the shower door. Per her instructions, I took a toothbrush to the shower, dusted the electrical outlets and molding on the floor, wiped down all doorframes and walls with cleaning wipes, and tried to make everything look as presentable as possible for the rest of the evening. 

The next morning she messaged me the apartment was still dirty and it took her 4 hours to finish cleaning it. Underneath the kitchen sink are a set of drawers that I thoroughly cleaned, but she removed all of them and sent me a photo of some brown staining at the bottom of the cabinet structure (possibly caused by a sink leak?). I didn't even think to remove the drawers and clean the insides of the kitchen counter structure so that was definitely on me, but I'm not sure how that one oversight turned into 4 hours and she wouldn't elaborate.

After a lot of back and forth, she eventually agreed to give me my security deposit back, but was very upset. The house I just moved into is rented out by some acquaintances of hers (which I found independently, but used her as a reference) so I'm worried that she'll relay this to my current landlords. 

After reading this over, I guess this write-up was partly to vent, but I would really like some advice on how I should move forward with my current and past landlord? Should I do something proactive or wait to see if my current landlord contacts me?

TL;DR My old landlord thinks I did an insufficient cleaning job on the apartment I moved out of (which I partially disagree with). I'm worried she'll contact my current landlord and cause problems in the future. What do?",04May2020,1

So I live in a town in the UK with my girlfriend (not gonna say the name for reasons later on) and all in all, it can be a fairly decent place.

 However.....we have these neighbours......

They're a couple and the woman is lovely and always says ""hello"" whenever we see her in passing. The bloke can be equally as lovely and does the same....BUT has the worlds worst temper....so much so that he lashes out at the woman and as we live in terraced houses, we hear everything that goes on.

He shouts at her calling her every name in the book, he blames her for things that are his fault, and (although we can't confirm this) possibly beats her as we occasionally hear smacking sounds through the wall, like someone punching a raw steak.
 You may question why we dont think it's the other way around, that she hits him. I cannot stress how bad his temper is and through it all she stays relatively calm, whereas he walks around his house slamming doors and breaking things....so balance of probability really.

We have approach the woman on a couple of occasions, along with their neighbours to the other side and she hasnt left him yet.

""But why dont you phone the police if you suspect domestic abuse is going on?"", I hear you ask. Therein lies our issue.

690,"I think I may have a problem. 

Basically, what the title says. It started when I gave myself bruises up and down my legs so that I wouldn't do anything that I would regret later, primarily in arguments. Later, I concluded that I'd play the suicidal card if anyone found out; they don't need to know about it. 

I haven't had to give myself bruises for a little less than a month now, and I can currently wear shorts. Yay for conflict resolution! Which is great, I guess, but I've found that I prefer to cause pain anyway. Those sorts of stories are for another day, but earlier I had a sudden impulse to have bruises again. Just today. Not very good timing; I happen to have a skirt on right now.  Above my knees. So instead, I whipped my knuckles until they were red. 

I like to think of myself as some sort of morbid bodybuilder. It gives me the oddest feeling, to see cuts and bruises and impurities in my skin. Which is odd, since I'm much more sadistic than masochistic, not to mention the fact that I receive almost no sexual pleasure from hurting myself. It's not so much about the pain, either.

People are all baking so much food making it a big party at work, expecting more money for gifts, decorating the office tons. Sidenote: for the first 5 years I was the only one who went into work early and was expected to set up all these decorations, so ive been annoyed at the situation for years.

695,"Hello Reddit! 

So this may not be kosher but I have a ‚Äúhealth‚Äù related question. I‚Äôm a 20 year old female, about 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh about 120 pounds. 

In late February of this year I was ice skating with a group of friends and fell pretty hard on my left knee and hip on a Thursday. The following day I went to the local hospital because it hurt to stand on the leg and it was very discolored and swollen. 

They took a lot of X-rays and did a visual exam. It was a little numb from the knee down on the left side. The doctors said they didn‚Äôt see any fractures and I just bruised it severely and I‚Äôll be sore and they gave me crutches to use until Tuesday, so only for about 4 days to help keep the weight off it. 

Over that weekend I didn‚Äôt really do anything other than sit a lot or I was in bed. Monday I went to classes and they are only located in one building so I didn‚Äôt bring my crutches because I knew I would be there for two hours and only walking in total for about 20 minutes, into the building, between the two classes, then out the building to my car. 
Tuesday I used my crutches all day because I had a lot of classes in many buildings.

Well it‚Äôs been 2 months or so since it happened and I‚Äôm still feeling pain and numbness in that leg. Now it extends up into my hip. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm sitting or standing or walking, out of no where I feel a stab of pain in my knee right where I fell on it then it will extend up to my hip and it makes it so I don‚Äôt even want to move. I also experience numbness from my hip down and my knee will ‚Äúbuckle‚Äù from time to time making it hard to walk. 

I asked the doctors when this happened if there would be any lasting problems and they said no it‚Äôs just a bruise and it will heal in time. But this doesn‚Äôt feel right. I don‚Äôt want to go to the ER because of the pandemic and my doctors office said they aren‚Äôt taking any patients that aren‚Äôt serve/life threatening.

So I posted my apartment on Facebook and got a message from an apparent 27 year old Caucasian female like myself saying she's moving from Buffalo, NY to Columbus, OH and her work company is willing to pay the rent of May. She asked for my address for the check to be sent to and my naive self sent her my Name, Address and Phone Number. She then asked which Bank I used (not bank account but Bank) and I lied and gave her the wrong bank.

She's sending kind of odd messages but seemed normal at first, maybe just an odd person but nothing too out of the ordinary. Her number is from a New York area code but I know there's tons of ways to make up a phone number these days.

Once I started realizing this is probably not a 27 year old female I started asking questions and doing more research. I had asked for proof of something with her name on it and she came back with ""trust me, I'm a God fearing woman"" etc. Her profile is completely private but noticed the two ""likes"" on her profile were both foreign. 

What could they be trying to do with my address? Maybe hack into my bank account? To be honest my biggest fear is that this is a sex trafficking scam and that they may be on their way here.

705,"So, there‚Äôs got to be a lot of background information here. My mom and I used to be super close. That is, until years ago when I started to get boyfriends and hang out with boys, which inevitably lead to me hooking up with said boys. So, lately my mom has gone off the rails and has started to go through my phone and steal it from me while I‚Äôm asleep. (I still live at home until I can save up enough to move out). 

She has called me a liar multiple times because I didn‚Äôt choose to tell her I was having sex with guys because it‚Äôs not her business. But then she went through my phone and found messages about me hooking up with a guy months ago and now we fight literally every day. I have severe depression and anxiety and I‚Äôm on antidepressants anyway and since all of this has started I‚Äôve tried to take my own life twice because I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. 

I‚Äôve recently met a new guy who I really like hanging out with and we have been for a month and today I handed her my phone to look at because she said she wanted to upgrade so I let her look at my phone because I didn‚Äôt have anything to hide. Well. She went into my Snapchat and started going off on me because she read a message from the guy that said ‚ÄúI wish you were here so I could sleep better‚Äù and then she proceeded to basically say I‚Äôm a whore and she raised me better and she‚Äôs ashamed of the girl I have become. 

I‚Äôve applied to grad school twice, about to be 3 times. I had a GPA of 3.8 in college, graduated with honors, and I‚Äôm still at a job to keep getting experience for grad school. But yet she said I‚Äôm the worst daughter anyone could ever have. It‚Äôs breaking me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs making me not wanna live anymore because it‚Äôs non-stop fighting and screaming about how I‚Äôm choosing guys over her and it‚Äôs just.. I can‚Äôt handle it anymore.",04May2020,1
706,"So, I am using a throwaway account for this, because I know if I use my main, I‚Äôll get terminated.

I am 12 years old and I have two little brothers, one 8 and the other 5. A few years back, when I was 9-10 and my brother was 5-6, he changed. He started by refusing to let me or our younger brother touch his food, which is fairly understandable. Then he started targeting me specifically. I became really depressed and anxious, and spent most of my time playing Roblox. He started refusing to eat food at all if I looked at it. At this point, he was really just targeting me. He called me a Disgusting Rat, and our parents took us both to the therapist. I didn‚Äôt really tell my therapist anything, and just said things like, ‚ÄôOh jeez, I‚Äôm SUPER stressed with blah blah blah‚Äô and such. I was getting more and more depressed, and I began to cut my left arm. I have two large scars on my arms from cutting. I was feeling super suicidal one day, and I was talking to the self harm textline. The lady on there told me to go to the school consular. I went and told her about it, and she told my parents. They acted all supportive that day. They slowly ignored me once again, though, every once and a while, while brushing my hair or something, my mom would look at my scars, move her finger down them, and says something along the lines of ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt cut yourself, because whenever you get older you won‚Äôt be able to wear bikinis‚Äô and saying that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äòpretty‚Äô and they keep going to a bunch of places despite social distancing, they keep encouraging me to ‚Äòget some fresh air.‚Äô They are ridiculing me for playing a lot of video games, and I have been feeling extremely sick the past few days. This morning, they made me go to some school thing for my brother that DID NOT FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES and I was walking by the kitchen, and my 8 year old brother said ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt come in here‚Äô and I blew up in his face, ‚ÄúWHY? WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I LOOK AT YOUR FOOD?‚Äù and my mom came in here and screamed at me, ‚ÄúYOUR BROTHER HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS LIKE, YOU UNGRATEFUL B\*‚Äù and I cried. Later, in the car, my brothers were calling me all sorts of mean things, and I told him to quit it. My mom and dad said ‚ÄòStop having that attitude, young lady.‚Äô And I cried. They are being completely reckless, and they don‚Äôt give a crap about my feelings.

710,"My family has always been a bit conservative while my fiance's family is open-minded. I come from an South asian Islamic background, so does she, but my family is a bit too backward compared to them so dating girls was never a thing in my household. 

I started going out with a girl from work and we started dating soon enough, I broke the news to my family and we got engaged after a while. So the now both the families are involved. The catch is my family never really liked that I spent countless hours at her house (we both live with our parents). At the start I used to lie to them and spend hours and hours at her house. But now since it's lockdown, they know that I'll only go to her house so they're asking me not to. 

According to them they're not comfortable with me spending so much time at their house because I'll make myself available to them too much and eventually lose my value (in any given week I'm usually over at her house for 5-6 hours 3-4 times a week). Plus they're also conservative when it comes to this because they wouldn't be okay if their daughters fiance spent so much time at their house.

Now the thing is, I'm already having issues on my relationship because of this. My fiance feels I don't care for her or I'm not physically present. I've lied again and again to my parents to be with her but she feels I don't really care for her (especially in this lockdown - we also live an hour away). 

Since we recently had this conservative, I decided to talk to my parents and they flat out told me that we're not comfortable even if you're engaged. You can do whatever you want once you're married. My fiance is an extremely emotional and liberal human being, explaining this to her will be quite the feat from both angles.

My school's solution to this was for students to keep their webcams on for the entire meeting, but I'm not sure if this is a proper solution or not due to deepfakes and that sort of stuff. I also remember an issue with Zoom automatically opening ports, I don't know if that is still the case but I want to make sure that I prevent it if it is. I am not sure if switching to a different platform is within the school's reach, and on the other hand Zoom might still be the best option for security.

Recently, an online friend of his who I came into contact with under random circumstances told me to watch carefully over him, because they believed him to possibly commit suicide in the next two or three weeks, on a ""calm"" day. The friend also mentioned him to have Dissociative identity disorder (DID), to which shocked me because they already assumed I would have known. The friend told me that one side personality told them this, and that there was three personalities all together. There were also a few other details that were in the story, but they may not be relevant at this time. This entire situation is extremely unbelievable to me, especially due to the fact that my younger sibling has never exhibited traits of DID to me or any other close family members, but I do realize it is a definite possibility, like most things in life are. I told my younger sister all of this, but I have yet to tell my parents about this entire ordeal. I do not know if it would be more beneficial to completely confront my younger sibling, tell our parents, or leave the entire situation alone.

So a little backstory, my wife (25) and I(21) just moved across the country. I got a really good job opportunity and we wanted to be out of the cold anyway. It was bad for my arthritis and the nerve damage in my back. We moved in with my aunt and get husband, we haven't really talked in years but were still I'm good standing as there wasn't much to tie drama to. My mom and aunt never really got along and basically hate/never talk to each other. Same goes to my mom to my grandparents. She hates them. And my aunt kinda does to but not to the extent. 

So due to COVID-19 I haven't been able to finish everything I need to for my job to start. So we have been stuck here for a bit and cant get into another house. My aunt's work has limited and her husband lost his job. 

But my wife and I have always asked what we need to do or if we can help. But we're always told no or they don't get back to us. We pay for half of the groceries, and offered on rent and utilities, but haven't seen those either. 

A few nights ago my aunt and her husband were fighting at dinner. It was awkward for my wife and I so we just tried too stay quiet and eat. Her husband got upset enough and went to his room for the night. And after we finished eating, my wife and I went outside for a bit. We needed to destress. Then my aunt started throwing and slamming things inside, I'm fairly certain she broke some of the dishes. 

My wife and I called my mom to ask for advice. Because I want sure what to do. We were stressed and the house was tense, just didn't know what to do. My mom just said to keep our heads down and get out when we can. 

Then last night I was told, through text, that I wasn't going anything around the house, etc. But like I said, I've asked but never got a response about it. 

Then I guess my grandmother called my aunt, I'm not sure what was said exactly. But I think it had something to do with my aunt's marriage or something similar. Cause then she called my mom. (I love my mom to death. I wish she couldn't moved here with us like she wanted to. But COVID locked them out there for now.) But she told my mom that apparently my wife and I were sent to spy on her. And that my mom turned me into a redneck POS. And called me an infidel. And that I've hurt her beyond belief. 

But the only thing I said to about my aunt to my mom was the argument because of the level of stress.

A few weeks ago, my partner started acting strangely. I saw it as them being very passionate and ""discovering"" themselves. Fast forward to today, they're in hospital for treatment. They are in denial and insist they are completely sane, despite some troubling &amp; scary delusions. They see these delusions as very real, and the problem is everyone else, not them.

My question for you all, if anyone has experienced this, will they return back to ""normal""? I've had a loved one go through this before, and they always recovered with ECT.  However, I don't know if that'll be the course of action with this case.

We're young, but have been together a long time. We were on track to starting our lives together before this incident happened.

P.S. I do not know the true diagnosis, just speculating based on my own personal experience with psychosis. I also do not use the term ""normal"" in an offensive way.

730,"

My gf (20) has been having a hard time recently and having a lot of bad thoughts. This is where she gets deeply sad and these bad thoughts are ones of ‚ÄúI dont want to be alive anymore.‚Äù She has assured me that she has no plan or urge to act on these thoughts, they are just thoughts, but this is still very serious. She has told me she has depression from early on in our relationship, we‚Äôve been dating for almost a year and a half, but she doesn‚Äôt see anybody nor does she take any medication and I don‚Äôt know if she was diagnosed by a professional or not, but I believe her and again, I take it seriously. The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù or why I‚Äôm here is that I feel like her life is in my hands. 

I dont mind this, I care about her and love her more than anything and I am always here for her to lean on and she knows that, but this is a huge responsibility and big pressure on me. I am usually a happy guy and this just has me really down. I‚Äôm worried sick about her, I don‚Äôt know what to do and what I do doesnt feel like it‚Äôs making a difference at all, it‚Äôs extremely draining, and it‚Äôs hard to be happy when your partner is always sad. When I am happy, its when I‚Äôm away from her and everything that‚Äôs going on. I feel really guilty about that. And it seems like she gets really sad when I don‚Äôt spend time with her, even if it‚Äôs just for two or three hours and she knows I‚Äôm busy. I don‚Äôt want to run away from this or for her, but its becoming a lot for my own mental health. I am her only support system, and it often feels like I‚Äôm the only thing that makes her happy. She has friends, way more friends than I have, she has family that cares for her deeply, but this all falls on me. And that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm her partner. But what if I‚Äôm not enough? What if I‚Äôm not enough and I continue to exhaust myself just for her to feel sad forever? Or for these thoughts to develop more and turn into action? I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like this is all on me to ‚Äúfix‚Äù or make ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (I know that, if this is depression, that‚Äôs not how it works.) I feel like a lot of things are my responsibility to make better/fix for her, even the smaller things or things in her life that I have no control over. I almost feel as though my role in her life is: care-taker, therapist, and then lover. 

I love her so much and we really see a future with each other, but I‚Äôm just 19 and this is a lot for me. I feel like there‚Äôs no room for me to be happy because she‚Äôs so sad all of the time. And I feel like there‚Äôs no room for me to be sad or feel any other way because /she‚Äôs/ sad. I suppose it feels like there‚Äôs no room for me and my feelings. Sometimes she‚Äôll ask how I am but it‚Äôs when she‚Äôs in the middle of crying and upset herself so I feel cornered, like this is the only time I get to talk about my feelings but I feel as though I cant, even though she asked how I am, because she‚Äôs crying and sad and I feel like it‚Äôs not my time to talk about my feelings or things I‚Äôve got going on. Its confusing, hard to explain and put into words so I‚Äôm going to give an example. Three days ago, a very close friend of my family‚Äôs and someone very important to me passed away suddenly. My girlfriend was aware of this and told me she was sorry, we didn‚Äôt talk about anything more. Then yesterday, I made an Instagram post about my friend who passed and I guess this reminded my girlfriend that this happened and was something I was going through. She texted me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling really sad, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù out of the blue so of course I showed concern and tried to help her. Then she texts, ‚Äúi saw your post about your momsffiend and i don‚Äôt want to add anything else on to you right now if that‚Äôs ikay‚Äù (just like that) but that was AFTER the fact that she already let me know she was really upset and made it clear, just by the way she was texting, that she was upset. She does that sometimes, she‚Äôll tell me she‚Äôs upset and make it very clear and then tell me she doesn‚Äôt want to put anything else on me. But how am I supposed to react to that? I cant just sit there and know she‚Äôs upset and just not do anything or try and help, you know? By telling me she‚Äôs upset and making it clear that something is going on, she‚Äôs already putting that on me, even if she doesn‚Äôt tell me what exactly is going on or what she‚Äôs thinking about specifically. This is all really hard for me to explain. And going back to the thing about my family friend who passed, my girlfriend acknowledged that I had something going on and was having a rough time with the passing and she did say she didn‚Äôt want to put anything more on me but she never really offered me any comfort or support, which is okay, and I know she‚Äôs going through a lot so I dont expect that, but instead she just made me feel cornered and I ended up telling her all was okay and that I was feeling just fine and then I spent the rest of the day taking care of her and comforting her and talking things through with her, etc etc. I feel like I‚Äôm on a pedestal. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs told me about these bad thoughts and this deep sadness she‚Äôs experiencing now, this is maybe the 3rd or 4th time in the last few months that this has come up. It hasn‚Äôt been constant over that time, it‚Äôs come and gone. The first time happened was when my aunt had an accident and it was very critical and we were told she likely would pass. It was the day that it had happened, I thought my aunt wasnt going to make it, I was sad and scared and shocked and really needed someone. I got home late from the hospital and instead was met with my girlfriend telling me she‚Äôs having bad thoughts, is really sad and doesn‚Äôt want to be alive. She was aware of what was going on for me that day, but I spent the whole rest of the night comforting her and talking about things with her and crying with/for her and telling her everything‚Äôs going to be just fine and that she‚Äôs loved and got me by her side, etc etc. I know she cant control what she feels and when she feels it, and I dont ever want her to repress her feelings or hide them from me. But recently I have been feeling a bit of resentment? When I think back on the times that she‚Äôs told me about her bad thoughts, I almost feel like things were unfair. I don‚Äôt know. I feel selfish. I feel guilty. I feel exhausted. 

I dont know if I can tell her about any of this, how are you supposed to tell someone about this? Especially when their life is in your hands. I just want to make things better for her, or at least easier, I really do. I‚Äôm here for her, she knows I love her and I give her lots of affection, encouragement, and support on the daily. I would like to think I‚Äôm a very good boyfriend, and she tells me I am, but these feelings and concern for myself is making me feel guilty and selfish. I don‚Äôt know what to do. How do I help her? 

I asked about her support system, she told me she talked to her mom but that didn‚Äôt go anywhere so it seems I‚Äôm still her only support system despite all the friends and family she has. She said she‚Äôs going to look into talking to someone and maybe even getting some medication but so far there has been no steps taken and nothing has changed, but its only been a day or two so I don‚Äôt expect things to be at a different pace. What do I do? How do I continue to take care of her without exhausting myself and feeling like there‚Äôs no room for me to have feelings? I want to be happy, I‚Äôm a very happy guy and I want my energy back. I dont want to worry sick about her and cry myself to sleep and feel like her life is in my hands. But I don‚Äôt know what else to do. What is there to do? Someone please help. Keep in mind we are long distance so I don‚Äôt get to just hold her or make her dinner and run baths for her, I feel helpless because I‚Äôm not there with her physically but I put in so much effort to cheer her up and make her feel better, have virtual dates with her and show her my love. I feel like I cant give anymore than I already do. Please help. Any advice helps, anything at all. I know this is really long and messy, so if someone only wants to reply to a part of it and maybe not the whole thing, that is just fine and really appreciated. Thank you. I hope everyone is staying smart and safe amidst this covid-19 outbreak.",04May2020,1
731,"There‚Äôs this girl (25) that lives right next to me (27). She has lived there with her BF for probably about four years. I know her and her BF have recently celebrated five-years together. She talks to me a lot.

She first came and wanted me to help wash her car when she saw me washing mine. I went over and helped her shine her car. I have even repaired the electric window on her car for her. I got a dog a little over a year ago and she has been talking to me a lot more than she used to. Her &amp; her BF have some dogs so I‚Äôll let my dog go over there, or her dogs come over. Which is fine with me.

She always wants me to go places with her. It‚Äôs usually only a place she‚Äôll take her dogs. Even if mine [dog] can‚Äôt come along for some reason. She‚Äôll literally beg me to go. She always wants me to come and look at some issue with her car. That‚Äôd almost weekly. 

She‚Äôll come over wearing low-cut shirts and short shorts. My dog will jump on her and kind of pull her shirt down and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care. Her breasts are almost hanging out of her shirt. A few months ago she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù sent me a naughty pic of herself on Snapchat. She was wearing a tank top, no bra, panties, but she had a heart icon covering up ‚Äúdown there‚Äù. She had just gotten out of the shower. Before I opened the snap she texted me right afterwards telling me didn‚Äôt mean to send it. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôd she send it to because her BF was home at the time. And it was about 8:30 at night. She kept talking about the ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù pic for months afterwards, too.

Yesterday she came over with a low cut handkerchief-type shirt on and she reached up to stretch on the tree in my backyard and she was exposing her midsection to me and it was another low cut shirt. She didn‚Äôt seem to care. I didn‚Äôt really hide the fact I was looking. She‚Äôll make sexual innuendos with me and will laugh at the ones I make. 

It‚Äôs hard to tell, does she want me to make move on her? She never talks about her BF or anything. I don‚Äôt know, maybe he‚Äôs not paying attention to her anymore. I know they sleep in separate beds. A lot of couples do that. What the heck is going on?? I don‚Äôt really want to pursue anything and ruin their relationship. It‚Äôs constant.

733,"Hey everyone. Hope you all are well. I‚Äôve been getting anxious for things to get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in the world, but I realize that will not happen quickly - if at all. I have worked in the service industry my entire working life (15 years), and I have come to the realization that serving and bartending will never be the same. My ‚Äúcareer‚Äù in bartending has been impacted immensely. The only reason I‚Äôm staying afloat right now in through state unemployment, but it‚Äôs impossible to know when those checks will stop coming. If I get to return to work this year my income will likely be slashed in half or less for the foreseeable future, based on an assumed change of capacity allowed inside restaurants.

I‚Äôm sure there are thousands of people in this group that have been dealing with the same realization.

I‚Äôm asking for advice on a new career path, not in the service industry, that I can take by using my years of experience working in that field. I am currently taking classes part time from a local community college, working towards a degree in computer science. I would like to start a job in that field (I know it‚Äôs very broad) to get a good head start. In a perfect world an entry level job that pays around $35k/year with benefits would be ideal. But, I know that most jobs require at least a Bachelor‚Äôs degree, which obviously I do not have yet.

Does anyone have any feedback or opinions on my predictions of the service industry? I‚Äôm curious what others think. And does anyone have any advice on where/how to look for an entry level job? I haven‚Äôt looked for a new job in almost a decade, and I‚Äôm incredibly out of the loop. Any advice is appreciated.

734,"Hey,

So really I'm looking for someone with a magic wand and crystal ball to look into the future and tell me what to do. 

I've spent the last three years trying to get into medical school, and despite several large bumps along the way I've finally managed to earn a place to study in September 2020. However, these large bumps I've had have exhausted me, and with the current covid situation the exhaustion has been enhanced. I work in a busy A&amp;E department and the thought of starting a demanding medicine course, off the back of the covid crisis, honestly makes me want to bury under my duvet a never come out. 

Alternatively, I could apply for a masters in public health, possibly epidemiology or global health related. I wouldn't have the clinical knowledge I wanted but I would still get to work within healthcare, just in data and statistics opposed to clinical medicine. I could go with either career path, my undergrad is humanities related. 

Ideally hoping theres some medics out there who can tell me to hang in there with the medicine. All you hear is negatives about the workload, and all the doctors at work moaning about their shifts patterns (I take these moans with a pinch of salt because I often don't think they realise that the majority of the nursing staff will easily work 48 hours a week and often our days off are just as rubbish as theres), and the thought of being student broke for the next 5 years is also playing on my mind. I'm in my mid-20s now and although my salary is low its still more money than i've ever had and I don't know if I can give that up!

Advice appreciated, if anyone has any!",04May2020,1

Recently, an online friend of his who I came into contact with under random circumstances told me to watch carefully over him, because they believed that he has been wanting to die in the next two or three weeks, on a ""calm"" day. The friend also mentioned him to have Dissociative identity disorder (DID), to which shocked me because they already assumed I would have known. The friend told me that one side personality told them this, and that there was three personalities all together. There were also a few other details that were in the story, but they may not be relevant at this time. This entire situation is extremely unbelievable to me, especially due to the fact that my younger sibling has never exhibited traits of DID to me or any other close family members, but I do realize it is a definite possibility, like most things in life are. I told my younger sister all of this, but I have yet to tell my parents about this entire ordeal. I do not know if it would be more beneficial to completely confront my younger sibling, tell our parents, or leave the entire situation alone. I only say leave the entire situation alone because there is a possibility this friend is lying or even, as I have been told, reflecting their own problems onto my younger sibling. I do not want to come off as uncaring, but I have to consider all of the possibilities in order to maintain my relationship with my younger sibling, as well as to maintain the relationship between my younger sibling and his friend.

So if I want to play I feel like I need his ok because he wants to watch me. He says ""reactions are 50% the fun."" If I tell him I'll hop on,he'll say something like ""my family is watching a movie I can't talk"" (because we do a discord call and I screen share the game to stream) or he'll say ""my family is too loud rn,I can't hear anything you say."" He never wants me to go ahead. He'll always day ""this is a good place to stop."" Why is the person watching saying that? Why not the person who is playing? This also extends to when something pops up and he has to go and do it aka working out or going out to help family and he says ""this is a good place to stop.""

There, however, are moments when I am pretty sad. Usually it's a feeling of regret when I see what others at 22 or below already achieved. For example I watch YouTube videos with body transformations to keep me motivated but sometimes I get sad because they did that process when they were 16 or 17, like 5 years earlier.

I like to think of myself as some sort of morbid bodybuilder. It gives me the oddest feeling, to see cuts and bruises and impurities in my skin.

I'm planning on learning to drive (hopefully this summer if lockdown is over ), but when I took a few lessons a while ago I got so anxious I started having small panic attacks before the lessons.

I'm so scared of everything as soon as I sit in that driver's seat.

- Scared of reversing and hitting someone.
- Scared of pushing wrong button 
- Scared of using wrong gear
- Scared of going too fast and hitting someone
- Scared of missing road signs

*Everything*

Is this is a really irrational fear?

I'm fine when I'm in the passenger seat. But i freeze up as soon as I'm in the driver's seat and driving - even though I'm going so slow!

I'm not even learning with a stranger, but someone I know.

If it makes a difference the car is a manual &amp; is diesal.

I've got just under a year to get this done since my theory will expire then.

Being Harassed NonStop

Hi, I am posting this for legal help for my friend that I‚Äôm trying to direct in the right way to handle things. He is located in Pennsylvania. It is a complicated situation so please bear with me while I try to lay it all out. This is a wild story of immigration, child custody, and harassment and he doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting much help from authorities and I‚Äôm hoping to get some guidance for him here.

My friend is an immigrant from Liberia. He is here legally and has a visa as well as an immigration lawyer. He is a semi-pro football (soccer) player and globally travels to play during season. He was dating a woman at the end of 2018 into the beginning of 2019. As he was set to go to Europe for a big opportunity. tells him she is pregnant. He chooses to do ‚Äúthe right thing‚Äù and stay by her side supporting her and stay for the baby. As her pregnancy progresses she gets crazier and crazier, posting lies on Facebook about him and their relationship. When the baby is born (September 2019), he signed the birth certificate in good faith, however a few days later she said she made a mistake on the certificate and refiled it, supposedly without his name on it. He does his best to take care of the baby financially but decides that he can no longer be with her as she has gotten very intense with how she treats him and tries to manipulate him into marrying her and staying with her. 

Despite this he continues to support the baby providing money and necessities as needed and sees the baby often. One of the times he has the baby at his house she calls the authorities and said he kidnapped the baby. The cops come and he shows them all the messages and phone calls where they agree it is his time with his daughter and asking what time she wanted to pick the baby up. They (obviously) realize this is not kidnapping and no charges are filed and say he can keep the baby without incident. He decides he doesn‚Äôt want any additional issues and turns the baby over to her. 

After this incident he is no longer comfortable having the baby for fear of false charges. He tells her that he would like a DNA test and to establish paternity and support/visitation through the courts. At this point she starts threatening him that she is calling immigration if he does not get back together with her and that she will ruin his life and make his life miserable and get him deported. It continues to escalate from there as he doesn‚Äôt want to get back together with her. She then tells him she is engaged to another man and sends tons of pictures of them together and the other man with the baby etc... all the whole threatening to ruin his life. The next escalation is that in the past 6 days she has called him thousands of times at all hours of the day and night. There is no rest. When she gets bored calling him she then starts calling his family members whom she has contact information for. She has gone on his Facebook, his league facebook, and all of his friends facebooks posting that she wants to get him deported and all of his immigration information on there and that he won‚Äôt take care of his child. In order to try and get some relief he has reached out to the cops multiple times who advised him to go to the courthouse for a PFA. He went down there and of course it was denied because she isn‚Äôt threatening physical harm. She has made massive amounts of social media posts harassing him and his family as well as thousands of phone calls and texts.

She will not let him check on the baby but is demanding he send things for the baby and/or send her money and/or get back together with her so they can go back to their normal lives. He called her mother to ask if she can check on the baby and the mother said she went over to her house recently (I‚Äôm
not sure how recently) and they are living in filth and she thinks that her daughter is on drugs. She tried to take the baby but her daughter snatched the child and kicked her out of the house. 

So far my ideas are that he needs to file with the courts for a mandated paternity test and if the child is his request to be put on support and an official custody agreement. How does he do this in the state of Pennsylvania? 

I also think he needs to call CPS and ask for them to do a wellness check as it is quite possible the baby is in an unhealthy and dangerous situation.

Is his immigration potentially at risk if she does try and report him for some sort of immigration violation? 

Lastly, what can he legally do about the harassment? I‚Äôm not sure criminally if there is anything she can be charged with but this is beyond any point of normal communication. When he blocks her number she just calls and texts from generated or blocked numbers. 

Any advice or direction so I can help him would be appreciated. He does not have reddit but I‚Äôve seen other people be helped by this forum so I am hoping I can get some good input to pass along. 

Thank you in advance.",04May2020,1

My parents are abusive. They argued all the time when I was younger and my dad pretty much abandoned me after that. He has a rubbish life to be fair but he never even asked if I needed anything throughout my life.

I moved in with a relative who is even more abusive. I got bullied at HS and transferred several times and it didn‚Äôt get better. I started hating people for how horrible they could be.

I knew that my depression was getting worse by the second and I told my relative to get me help for it since I‚Äôm not old enough to get help for myself and she ignored it. Then one day I was crying and she told me to cry till I die.",04May2020,1
763,"I am stuck in a seriously tough situation.

My boyfriend, Erik, and I have been dating for 3.5 years. We started dating in high school, and since then, we have been through a lot together. I have almost died, our families are very close to each other, we've been each other's emotional and mental support, and I'm also his first girlfriend. I genuinely was in love with him for the longest time. But I realized something the last year or so. We have always been dependent on each other for happiness. I am only ever happy or a person when I am with him. That is why we clung to each other's attention and space so intensely. I thought it was because we were in love, but it was genuinely unhealthy for us. Now, with the virus, we are apart. And our happiness has been nonexistent without each other. And while it should still be okay because we can communicate, it almost feels like nothing is left. I don't know how to fix it.

And unfortunately, I don't feel the urge to fix it. I do love him and I care for him, but there is something deep inside of me that doesn't want this relationship anymore. And I became so guilty and ashamed of that, because I know that Erik loves me with everything he has, and that I especially am his only source of happiness.

To add more, I also recently started growing feelings for my best friend, Josh, who lives in another state. We never had these feelings when we first became friends, and I thought I only had feelings for him because he filled the gap that Erik had left. But genuinely, I have never felt happier in my entire life than when I am with him. Even my family has noticed that I have been the happiest I have been in my entire life. I thought for years that Erik would be my forever, but I have never felt this intense emotion for him like I have for Josh.

The guilt and shame has eaten at me, but I have already made my decision. While I do love Erik, our relationship has been built on a dependency for each other, and we've never been willing to make a compromise or follow through. We have always tried to change each other, instead of accepting who we are. He will always hold a place in my heart; just not in my future.

I decided to try to break up with Erik yesterday. Before I could call him to come meet me at my house to talk (6 feet apart, obviously), my mom noticed something was going on. I began crying (because I felt terrible, when I knew I was about to break Erik's heart) and began telling her I planned to break up with Erik. Before I could even explain why, she began yelling at me and cutting me off. She said that I was being irrational, stupid, and that I was experiencing manic depression. She sat me down and told me she wouldn't allow me to break up with Erik, that I'm just sad because I can't see him because of the quarantine, and that my life was unraveling and I was going manic. She also made it a little bit about her, but that's expected - she can tend to be a little self absorbed sometimes.

She said I have to stay with Erik. And I don't want to. It's already difficult enough to break up with someone who still means so much to you, even when you don't feel the same for them anymore. But now my mother won't let me break up with him. And it's not simple to go around her and do it anyway. I fear that she would try to make me go to a mental hospital, strip me of everything I own, or even worse - make me stay with Erik so I don't lose everything around me.

I'm 20 years old. I have the ability to leave, get a job, get a loan and get my degree, and try to find a place to live. But I don't want to go homeless just to avoid my mother's grip. I want to go to school here at home, travel to see Josh (who returns the feelings, also), and one day move in with him and begin my life. My future has never seemed more enticing and hopeful, even with Erik, until I felt these things for Josh. I want to try to be a better person, to work hard, to be happy because of Josh.

But I don't know if I'm losing it. I don't know if I really am replacing Josh for Erik because of the situation. I don't know if my mom is right or not. I know that in my heart, I am happiest I have ever been with Josh. I know that I will be breaking Erik's heart. But I don't want to continue a relationship built on lies, which I know would fall apart one day, when he could've been healing and moving on.

I don't want to live in my house anymore, but my mom is paying for my tuition, phone, car, etc. She has a lot of control over the things in my life, and if I leave, I lose everything I own. And while I would do it in a heartbeat for Josh, I just don't want to do it that way. 

How can I get myself out of this situation? How can I explain to my mother how I feel, without putting myself at risk for being kicked out or sent to get mental help because she thinks I'm going crazy? I just don't know what to do. I don't know if everything I have been feeling are true, or are really all in my head.",04May2020,1

766,"I have a friend who talks a lot about his body. And the fact that he‚Äôs lost a lot of weight. And we all like to celebrate that, but not too much because he often makes comments about ‚Äúnot eating for three days‚Äù or disordered eating. In casual conversations he will bring up comments about his body. For example after he eats a big meal, he will show us his belly to show how full or bloated he is. As much as I want this to be a normal interaction, I can‚Äôt help but internalize and think that he is just trying to show me how skinny he is still. Like in comparison to me. Which I know is probably not the case. To elaborate, he has a tendency to compare bodies sometimes. He will show us arm muscles and we will compare. Things like waist sizes &amp; torso length have been brought up. I try to not participate too much in these conversations because they make me really uncomfortable. I‚Äôm easily the heaviest person between them &amp; while I don‚Äôt have too many insecurities surrounding my body anymore, it‚Äôs difficult to avoid those thoughts in these situations. There was one time in particular where I had just come over &amp; was not feeling good about myself that day.

I can‚Äôt help but think like this because I see how he sees himself. He must think I‚Äôm incredibly chubby. Which I know I‚Äôm not. 
 I think he might have a little bit of an obsession with being small and thin. With how often he brings it up &amp; his eating habits I think he has a problem.

767,"Hello, I am looking for advice with how to set boundaries with a domineering friend without hitting their feelings or putting strain on the friendship. My lady friend's (let's call her Julia) roommate(let's call her Stacy) is constantly ""moming"" everyone in the friend group, and while in certain aspects or situations this is welcome and wholesome, other times she can be very overbearing and domineering, especially when we are at their house.          

For example Julia and i enjoying cooking together very much, and while there are times we have group dinners and cook all together with other friends, there are times, like today julia and I had something particular in mind and wanted to enjoying cooking brunch together but Stacy finds it necessary to involve herself and not just let us do our own thing. We would have been fine sharing with her or even waiting till she made her food but we really wanted to just enjoy cooking together one on one. We live in separate cities and the opportunities to do something like that are not often. Often we have found when we try to disagree with Stacy her feelings will be hurt. But right now I have my feelings hurt because I was really looking forward to cooking with my boo one on one but I'm sitting here in the living room alone while they are cooking. Sharing attention from Julia with other frie isn't the problem.          

What's especially frustrating for me is that Stacy always wants us to do this things her way and  takes charge when no one needs her to. Julia and I are both skilled cooks and she even went to culinary school. I don't judge other people for how they like to do things but I find Stacy's cooking skills to be very lacking I some ways ( she doesn't keep her knives sharp and cuts things in huge chunks, for one). Like I said I don't care how she wants to cook for herself but I take a lot of pride in my cooking skills and want to make something my way when I cook. Furthermore Julia and I enjoy cooking together as a way to bond and know each other better.

Anyway I enjoy being friends with her and don't want to push her away but we worry that when we try to stand up for ourselves she will feel pushed away. Julia has expressed to me there are other situations where she feels the same when I'm not around. Any advice for us?",04May2020,1

 It started when I gave myself bruises up and down my legs so that I wouldn't do anything that I would regret later, primarily in arguments. Later, I concluded that I'd play the suicidal card if anyone found out; they don't need to know about it.

I haven't had to give myself bruises for a little less than a month now, and I can currently wear shorts. Yay for conflict resolution! Which is great, I guess, but I've found that I prefer to cause pain anyway. Those sorts of stories are for another day, but earlier I had a sudden impulse to have bruises again. Just today. Not very good timing; I happen to have a skirt on right now. Above my knees. So instead, I whipped my knuckles until they were red.

I like to think of myself as some sort of morbid bodybuilder. It gives me the oddest feeling, to see cuts and bruises and impurities in my skin. Which is odd, since I'm much more sadistic than masochistic, not to mention the fact that I receive almost no sexual pleasure from hurting myself. It's not so much about the pain, either.

773,"Hi there don't know if this belongs here correct me if not.
I'm trying to make this as short as possible:

I was in a relationship with a 2/3 years older guy when I was 14 and it lasted like 4-5 months. Needless to say I was very immature and kind of stupid back then and couldn't see someone was messing with me as it happened.

So he broke up with me when I knew I'd move to a different country because of my parents jobs and I was sad, but I got over it.
He texted me once I had moved trying to get back with me, regretting breaking up with me and so on. I was 15 by then and thought I loved the guy (because what else would a teenager think in a situation like that). I told a good friend of mine about the situation and also told her I didn't know how to respond to some of his messages.
Just a little backtrack: he asked very personal questions (eg Have you lost your virginity? Would you want to try cunnilingus(or however you write that)) and tries to know everything about me and when I wouldn't want to answer a question he asked so many times until I gave in and either lied or gave him the truth because I felt pressured to do so.

So she gave me the advice to ghost him. At first I didn't want to because that's just not the person I am. But after a few more of those weird questions and him saying he wants to visit me, mind you in  a different country (800km away), I decided to actually ghost him. And I blocked him on some platforms, including Whatsapp.

After sometime, he stopped texting and I thought it was over, but then I got a text from a guy who said he was his friend. He told me my ex had died in a motorcycle ""accident"" and after a message I sent asking if he was serious, the ""friend"" texted again, saying my ex told him that he was so sad about me ghosting him that he killed himself with the motorcycle and that it's my fault.
So that's the point when I had a feeling of it being true and started searching for police records of his district in the city I lived in before and actually found one motorcycle accident that fit the description. I was really down. Honestly, I thought a person had killed himself because of me ghosting him.

After a few months however, he posted something on his FB time-line. Well fuck that guy. Who does that? To a 15 year old.  It messed with my psyche and my mental health.
So I was pissed and tried not to think about that ever again. And he texted at some point after that saying his friends coerced him to do it... What a lame excuse.

So I didn't hear from him in a good 2 years since then, until 2 weeks ago. He texted me on FB messenger and asked how I was. Tbh I thought ok let's act like the adult you are and listen to what he wants. He didn't want anything specifically. So I texted with him a little more and after he asked me multiple times to give him my phones nr I did (I know that's stupid). And so now we're texting on Whatsapp.
He told me all about how his soon to be baby mama left because he replaced his own nr with that of her ex and started texting her. He asked me for advice on the subject and I obviously said wtf tell her, communication is everything. And he did and then she left. So he was all like, yeah she was shitty to begin with, I want a woman I can count on, someone that I can love, blah, blah blah.
So after she left he got drunk and told me he made the biggest mistake of his life leaving me.
Again, I was 14, I had braces, I was not a good kisser/girlfriend or anything like that, so honestly I didn't think I could leave such a mark on him. (I'm guessing he did this to others of his ex girlfriends too tho so idk)

I gave him a piece of my mind and told him wtf. He stopped writing for 1-2 days afterwards and I didn't think he'd write anymore. So I was surprised when he sent more good morning texts and all that after some time. Then he videocalled me. He asked me before if I would pick up if he called me and I said no. I would not. Fuck that.
So when he videocalled me I just sent one of those srsly? emojis. And the. He started texting like you could've picked up.
I said: ""yeah I could've, but I didn't""

To which he replied: ""okay, you seem a little aggressive right now""

I said: ""not aggressive I did say I didn't want to be on a phone call with you""

Him: ""ok but I only called for 1 sec and then I hung up""

Knew he was lying because I saw how long he let it ring. But I said no more to be done with the convo.
So a day or 2 later he asked if I've already gotten a mask. (he know I live in a city that required everyone to wear masks inside grocery stores, etc.) I told him no, because there are none available but I was using a scarf atm. So then he's like oh yeah I can send you one if you want to.
Immediately I knew he was just looking to get my adress so I said I didn't need one because a scarf is fine as well.

Now, I now realize that he's been playing games with me again and I want to mess with him for a change.
Nothing bad like he did, just sth small that'll maybe even teach him a lesson.

A couple of weeks ago I had a falling out (my fault) with the girl who was my primary love interest and it basically ended with her telling me she never even saw me as  a friend and me agreeing not to speak to her anymore unless it was school related since we were in the same group. Fast forward around 2 weeks and we haven't spoken a word life or school related to each other when she suddenly starts striking up conversation almost every lesson. Of course this reignited my feelings for her and once I got comfortable I also started to strike up conversation with her again and she seemed more than happy to talk to me. This continued for about a month until groups changed and now we are in separate groups. After this neither she has tried to say a word to me nor have I tried to say anything to her and now since my feelings are having a hard time dying down again since I don't know if she will, like before, start trying to strike up conversations with me again, I'm just wondering if I should try to strike up conversation outside of class or just let it be since it might've just been her not wanting to be bored during class and I was the only one in the group she remotely knew.

to summarize, Me and girl had a fight where we agreed not to talk anymore, she starts talking to me again only during lessons, We no longer have lessons together and I don't know if I should start talking with her outside of lessons again since it might make her mad and thus, I need your take on the situation.",04May2020,1
776,"   A little background before I begin: I've been homeschooled all my life. None of that online shit, either; out in the boonies where I'm located, Internet connection isn't reliable enough for online schooling. Most people say I'm pretty intelligent, because my vocabulary is big and I'm mature for my age. My mom taught me up until 9th grade, and since then, I've been teaching myself, studying on my own, and grading my own tests. She thinks I'm a real baby Einstein for that.

   Therein lies the problem.

    I started cheating big time in my 9th grade Algebra I. I didn't understand a lot of it, I didn't want to put in the hours to make myself understand it, and I was afraid to ask my mom for help because of a horrible experience I'd had with 7th grade prealgebra. So I started fudging my test scores and ignoring a few incorrect answers, all the while swearing to myself that I'd ""do better next year"". I never did any better. 

   Now, in 2020, I'm still bullshitting almost all my grades except English. Math is a little better these days. History is easy enough that I don't have to mess with it much. Chemistry and Spanish are my mortal enemies, and I sincerely don't think there's been a test in either of them this year that I didn't mess with. 

   Swear to God, it's not that I'm not learning. It's possible that my bad memories of middle school drove me to develop an irrational fear of being an idiot. Or maybe I'm better at learning things in theory than in practice. I could rattle off chemistry facts and terms at you all damn day, but if you ask me to solve a thermodynamics equation I'd probably break down and cry. 

   That's not what matters, though. I know I'm smart enough to make honest A's. I took the ACT last fall, and my score was in the top 4% of examinees nationwide. Obviously, I didn't cheat on that test. If I had, I wouldn't be writing this post, I'd be hacking into the Pentagon and selling nuclear launch codes on the dark web. (fbi if you're reading this it was a joke bro)

   The problem is, I feel horrible about lying to my mother. My mom seriously thinks I'm the smartest kid alive, and it hurts me to know that I've betrayed her trust AND lied to her face about it. On the other hand, confessing my myriad acts of academic jackassery to her would probably be unwise.

   I've seen two schools of thought on cheating: it's either that the school system has done you a disservice, or that you've done yourself a disservice by not learning anything. My dilemma is applicable to neither of those scenarios. So, kind readers, how in the hell can I make up for my actions? Thanks in advance.",04May2020,1
777,"Hello Reddit, let me give you some background before I ask your advice. I work at a call center, and my job is to train people how to do the job that we do here. I teach classes of about 15-20 people at a time, doing about a 2 hour presentation with them where I am in front speaking the whole time.

I‚Äôve been doing this for about 6 months now. I was very nervous when I started out, but nothing out of the ordinary for a first time public speaker. I slowly got more confident and less nervous, until I felt like I really belonged up there.

Fast forward to the last two weeks. I have suddenly developed a horrible anxiety and I throw up (not just feeling like I want to, no I physically throw up) every time I even think about talking in front of a class. Nothing happened between now and then, all the classes I‚Äôve taught have gone fine. But suddenly I get that feeling every single time now, I spend about an hour puking before going to do my presentation, and I feel nausea and my throat has a huge lump in it the entire time.

My beautiful, confident presentations have turned into me sitting in the back of the room trying to explain content to everyone while barely holding myself together. I don‚Äôt even have to train anyone today, yet I was throwing up because I got sick just practicing in the empty training room. What the fuck would cause something like this? Mentally, I have zero fear of talking in front of these people. But I get physically sick just from the thought of it.

I can‚Äôt identify what is causing this or how to fix it. I need help. It‚Äôs affecting my ability to do my job and also the quality of the training that our workers are getting. I looked up all kinds of public speaking tips over the past two weeks, I‚Äôve tried breathing exorcises and ‚Äúpower posing‚Äù and anything else that was suggested and it‚Äôs all made no difference.

781,"First, thank you for reading this! Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated! Sorry this is so long, just wanted to give some background. 

(This is a throwaway account just to keep it as anonymous as possible as it's not just about me.)

So my sibling, 'X', has various mental healthy issues including dependency on weed (can't get through the day without having smoked), anxiety, depression, anger management, panic attacks and huge insecurity - and so they've been relying on myself, their partner and our parents for support (financially and to make them feel better) for the last few months to help keep them busy and entertained (in an attempt to lessen how much they smoke or delay the time of day they smoke, as a way of trying to get out of it). 

We love X dearly and want to help, however it can be very difficult - X is very, very irritable before they've smoked weed for the day, often getting upset with small things (ends up swearing at people for things equivalent to putting a mug on the wrong counter), goes into a 'panic mode' and can end up breaking things and even getting violent. We all have to say yes to whatever they want to do, whenever, and have our phones on and answer soon (even when at work/in meetings etc) otherwise X can get upset and feel like we don't care about them and things spiral; on a 'good' day they'll just swear/be very hurtful with their words. When they calm down (usually after having smoked weed), they apologise for being unreasonable and hurtful and breaking things etc and say they're trying to get out of it (the weed). Also, often, they don't remember what's happened. 

I've tried talking to X when they're calm and telling them that whilst I love them dearly and am doing my best to support them, as are our parents and X's partner, I really think they should seek professional help/therapy as this has gone on for a while and evidently what we're doing to try and help hasn't improved things. Sometimes they've agreed to get help, but the next time they get upset they say they don't need or want help and won't get any, so they haven't. 

We're all too scared (both in terms of not wanting X to be worried/stressed but also in terms of how they'll react) to talk to X completely honestly and tell them that we can't afford to keep fixing things they break, and we're getting tired of being sworn at and pushed about and worried always about whether the phone will ring and what the next crisis will be. Resultantly, we're all just trying to keep X happy as possible, reduce arguments but also getting worse and worse with our own mental health while not having a solution (other than hoping X just gets better with their own plan which is just trying to not smoke for as many hours in the day as possible). 

Counsellors our parents have spoken to say that X needs professional help, and that if we're worried about ourselves/property we need to call the police or get them committed - however these are the last things we want to do for fear of getting this on their record and this influencing future jobs and such. 

I'm trying to get advice on what I can do or say to get X to voluntarily seek professional help, to be able to feel better about themselves, help control their anger and help them reduce how much they smoke (X themselves says they want to stop the weed), any advice would be very welcome and thank you so much for reading this, hope you're all well. 

TL;DR - have family member that can be abusive but so far refuses professional help to get better - is there something I can do to convince them?",04May2020,1
782,"This is my first time posting in Reddit, sorry if I mess up anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 15 year old girl who is currently having a hard time getting out of the hole I dug myself into. When I was younger I was a star child, top marks, and living a great life. Now I can't seem to be motivated to do anything. I got low grades and am now very overweight. I don't know what happened to me or why I did this to myself. Whatever the reason is, I want to get myself back on my feet. My family are starting to worry and my friends, classmates and teachers are too.

That being said, I know I have a problem and this problem is ruining my life before i could even start living in it. I want to change but I can't seem to be able to stick into anything I tried. I tried to exercise everyday, dedicate a specific hour to just study, play a sport with my friends, avoid procrastination but no matter what I do I would always bounce back to my bad habits.

What am I doing wrong? How should I implement these new habits and not lose the motivation and bounce back to old habits?",04May2020,1

789,"So I(m23) have an older half brother that grew up with other relatives that kept us apart with no intention of allowing us to have contact because they hated our side of the family. (So do we) So I've never actually met him face to face. When I was in my teens, we had contact for the first time via text messaging. (My sister had sluethed his phone number somehow with the internet) 

When we first started texting eachother, we hit off pretty well. We played the same video games and had a lot of similar interests, things were going pretty well. Then some messed up stuff started happening. He revealed to us that he had multiple personalities and would have sudden emotional outbursts. He then tried to start sexting my sister, (his half-sister) and that was when we basically stopped contact. Since then, we heard from other family members that he got on meth, got a girl pregnant and made her have an abortion. Got in trouble with the law for carrying a bowie knife and had to pay a bunch of fines, and then he tried to sext our frickin' MOM! 

It's been about 3 years since he last contacted our mom, and 6-7 years at least since me or my sister had contact with him. He apparently joined the army somehow and has had a relatively stable life for a while and he made a new Facebook and message requested me with a long apology about the ""disgusting"" things he's done and said he would like to reconnect. I asked my mom what I should do and she thought it was weird that he was apologizing to me of all people when it's her and our sister that he sexted and ruined the relationship for. He hasn't actually ""done"" anything to me, I just cut all contact with him out of defense and respect for my mom and sis. 

What do yall think I should do?  Should I resume having nothing to do with him? Should I try and talk with him?",04May2020,1
790,"I am a 22-year-old female and I just felt the need to tell this story to you all. I no longer feel heartbroken and is just a memory now. When I was in eighth grade I met one of my best friends. Our friendship lasted for about seven years. He and I met in eighth grade. In high school, our friendship grew bigger. He had a few girlfriends and since we were close friends he would tell me about them. I would sometimes help him serenade girls since we were both in the guitar and singing class. In 10th grade of high school, I began to develop feelings for him but he didn't know. To me, it was perfect because at the time he was single, at least I thought. It turned out he was interested in a girl and well I had to bottle up my feelings and never reveal them to him. I noticed that I had feelings for him because I would get jealous when I saw him talking to girls which is something that he would do when our friendship started and I would not mind. Anyways he got a girlfriend in tenth grade and he was with her for a long time.

Fast forward to Sophmore year of college. He had gotten in a fight with his GF which he was dating for a few years. When I found out I was sad for him because it was a really long relationship. After that, we began to hang out by ourselves. He told me he was still friends with her because he was afraid that she would harm herself. One day we decided to hang out at his house. Everything was normal until we started making out. Now, I know it may seem bad because I just was not thinking and I thought to myself I have wanted this since forever. He was single and I was single and I thought why not. It was so beautiful at least I thought. We talked and agreed that we wanted to get to know each other as more than friends BUT he wanted to keep it a secret. One because of his ex-girlfriend and second because one of his friends who was also my friend had a crush on me since eight grade. At the time I agreed and did not know how to react. When he dropped me off at my house I kept thinking why am I going to be kept a secret.

A few days later I found out that he was still talking to his ex as friends and he was going to go to a concert with her and many others because it was something that was already planned. Of course, who was I to tell him to talk to or not talk to but it bothered me. So I kept extending our date and kept making up excuses on how I couldn't go. He would message me to ask me to hang out but I just didn't know it did not feel the same.

I feel like I was the main cause of our friendship breaking up. After that, we never spoke again. A few months passed and I browsed through his Facebook and I saw that he was back with his ex-girlfriend. A few months later they had a baby. I do blame myself because If I would have never let that kiss happen perhaps our friendship would still be happening. It just really broke my heart and 7 years of friendship thrown away is sad. He is one of the few guys I actually developed feelings for. This October It will be 2 years since we stopped talking.",04May2020,1

793," So I am posting today out of Michigan, I have been employed for 3 years almost, and it just happens to be during a pandemic that I'm just getting tired of where I'm working. Not the profession, but the people I work with are toxic, its a family-owned company, and I'm the only NON-family member there. I've only stayed so long because they pay great, but the family I work for is not at all my type of people. The office is not professional, and they get angry with the smallest things. Imagine working for a company run by one family, and they can do whatever they want (even unfairness like extra 3 hour lunches), also they are super rude and fake to you. Also to top it off, they are not American( which I have no issue with at all, trust me) but they're also leaving me out talking in there native language. It sounds like I got myself into this situation. Not many places are hiring at the moment, so I don't know what to do. I want to get fired purposely to file for unemployment until the state opens back up, but I don't know how to even go about that, I've never been in this situation. I wouldn't even be considering something like that if I didn't think I couldn't get a job for a while, its scary out here right now. I'm sure also people are going think I'm shady for thinking like this, but I can't sleep at night, I wake up every morning hating my life going to this job, and I just stress every moment I'm there because of how weird they make you feel. I don't want to quit and just not be eligible for unemployment, what I'm in this situation for a long time?

Of the 4 group members (myself included), we all contributed equally to the first half. The second half was written nearly 100% by myself and one other group members, besides a general outline for the paper that we all worked on together.

I contacted the other members a few times while we were writing, the first time they said they would help and never even opened the google doc, the second time they opened the doc but didn't contribute very much even when asked, they mainly edited what the other member and I had already written. I can give them up to 10 points to intellectual contribution and another 10 on workload contribution. I'm giving them all 10/10 on intellectual, then giving the good member 10/10 on the workload.

803,"So a little back story, I'm an artist. And I sometimes draw gore. Y'know, classic DeviantArt edgy gore. And I've been drawing it since I was maybe 7? I grew up watching gory furry speedpaints on YouTube so that's definitely an influence. Anyway, something I might draw is a younger lady with missing eyes putting up peace signs. I think that's really tame. I don't draw super realistic gore and half the time there's no actual blood. Anyway, my dad (late 40's) gets into a weird conspiracy theory phase every now and again. This time it's about how everyone is a Satanist and a pedophile and we're all being brainwashed. Of course, he's super woke so it doesn't work on him. But I've given in, I'm a full blown SATANIST! I mean, he saw a Masa Works Design song (if you know, you know) and he called it death porn! I think he's crazy. My mother on the other hand is just...I don't know but what she says hurts A LITTLE BIT MORE. Today she said ""Please stop it, be a normal kid"" (no I'm not 9) and I honestly didn't think that people said that outside of movies. She saw my Instagram and she said she wants me to stop drawing ""that"" ...I guess it's understandable, but being told to stop drawing ANYTHING really sucks. They also joked about me imagining that I ""chop them into bits"" when I'm angry. It wasn't a joke I could also laugh at. For the record, I DON'T fantasize about that. I don't have violent tendencies, I don't murder small animals. I just like to draw gore. Another thing that might add to the Satanist claims is that I draw demons. Now, my parents are both ATHEIST, so am I (well maybe I'll go for agnostic idk). When I say I draw demons I don't mean I draw what I see in my dreams or something like that, I mean that I make characters that are demons. They're not evil, it's just their species. They've never said anything about it, but I think they have the wrong idea. Basically, I'm asking whether I should stop drawing ""that stuff"" or try to ignore it. Or even something else.

TL;DR: I draw gore and now my parents think that I'm... disturbed I suppose?

I couldn't sleep and yesterday, I could barely eat (and I love to eat lol). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I thought I'd gotten over it, ya know? I've improved a lot since high school. I can look people in the eye and kind of hold a conversation now. I'm better at calming myself down and saying ""they're not talking about you/thinking bad thoughts."" But still, every time I go into work, I'm having trouble taking the stick out of my ass and relating to people. It's like there's a wall between me and them, and I keep thinking about my facial expressions and posture and wondering if they think something is wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

 I want so badly to do good at this job that I fixate and basically try to do everything. When there's nothing left to do, I feel very anxious, thinking that my co-workers are judging me for sitting down, so I neurotically run around with a broom even though the floor is swept, etc. I have trouble saying ""hi"" to my coworkers, as well, and I just sort of freeze up. If they say it first, I can parrot it back and ask how their day is going, but I find when they try to have a conversation, my answers are guarded and geared towards ending it quickly. Then, I feel like they think I'm kind of a dick.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was nailing this work thing at first. I've been kind of a hermit the last few years, so I just went into it like ""I'm just gonna keep moving and try to be confident."" It worked for a few months, but - just like when I took classes at culinary school - I'm slowly spiraling into thinking everyone feels I'm weird and neurotic. I just throw myself into work and try to ignore the social part. I can see a pattern in my life of jumping into something social like work or school, then after about 3-4 months I slowly start to have a breakdown and quit, to go back to my hermitage. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom might be exacerbating the issue, as well, as she seems to be doing worse cognitively and has her own anxiety issues. She thinks that the city is going to take our house through 'eminent domain' and is constantly stressing about home improvements to make it ""so nice it would be a crime to take it"". It's a bit run down and old, but definitely not to the point it could be condemned. She just sits on her computer all day long, hates herself for getting nothing done (she's handicapped) and is constantly on me everyday about the next house repair I need to do even though I just did one. I feel overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done and it's paralyzing me, so I only get a fraction of what she wants done, and then feel guilty/worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also, I had to take care of someone in the last years of their life, and basically did the job of the hospice nurses, since he was more comfortable with me. That was about a year ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel anxious almost all the time for various reasons and it's making my cycle towards quitting my job. I'm better than I used to be, so I had hopes that I could handle anxiety on my own, but now I'm starting to see a pattern in my life that makes me wonder if I do need to be medicated.... However medication scares the hell out of me because I've taken care of old people and have seen all the side-effects and how drs prescribe one thing to cover up another in a vicious cycle that damages your body. It scares me, too, how hard it is to get off something once you get on, and I'm worried I'll change my brain chemistry irrevocably or damage my liver/kidneys.",04May2020,1

Over the course of the day, she was really grumpy and my dad told us that she had an attitude with him that morning. My mom and dad have had a lot of stress because we've taken in family members who are sick. My grandma (dad's mom) is staying here because she has dementia and can't live alone. Basically, my cousin is here to visit because she was raised by her/my grandma. My dad and I, along with grandma and my cousin went on a walk. My cousin stormed off in the middle of the walk even though nothing happened, and grandma went after her. When we met my cousin back at the house, my dad asked, ""What was all that pouting about? If you do that again, we won't take you on a walk anymore"" My cousin's like, ""Fine. Whatever!"" So I (19F) yelled at my cousin and said, ""Lose the attitude with my dad!

Later we brought in an air mattress and sheets for my cousin and my dad said, 'We brought in this bed for you because we are considerate and were thinking of you"".

Throughout the day, I noticed my grandma would follow my cousin around and they'd be talking privately. None of us knew what they were talking about, but it felt so secretive.

Christmas day was also weird. Before dinner, my cousin and grandma were talking on the couch and we called them in for dinner, but I guess they didn't hear us. It felt like they were having another secret meeting, so we just started dinner without them. When they went into the kitchen, they saw we were already eating and I could tell my grandma was boiling under the surface. After dinner, I overheard my grandma telling my dad that all of the stuff in our new house is hers. Some of the furniture is hers, but we brought it so she'd have stuff that is familiar to her. My other grandma's furniture is being moved in as well. I heard my grandma say, ""You guys are using my stuff!"" So I said calmly, ""And vice versa. We're all sharing."" Then my grandma interrupted and yelled at me saying to ""SHUT UP!!!"" I was like ""Shut up?? THIS is my home!"" My mom hurried in and removed me from the room. Then everyone basically started arguing. My cousin started crying. My grandma started to follow my cousin and said, ""I forgive all of you guys."" Then my mom yelled and said, ""What is there to forgive??? I've tried to extend grace."" Then I yelled at my grandma and said, ""Grandma PLEASE listen to me I've been visiting you all my life with my family and you never tried to know who I am. I work 2 jobs and I work my ass off. You don't care about my dad or anyone but someone else! (I was referring to my cousin and I noticed my cousin was standing there) My grandma's like ""Your dad is my son."" My Mom to my grandma: ""LET HER FINISH!""

Me: ""I know but you never cared about him.""

My Mom: ""Christmas is my favorite holiday and I tried my best to make it good! I fixed this dinner!""

Grandma: ""Well I didn't like it!""

My Mom: ""Oh sorry I forgot to remove all the greens!""

Then my mom and I chuckled.

My cousin: ""I appreciate what you do...""

My Mom: ""Oh haha! Sure you appreciate it!""

My grandma and cousin start whispering again and my dad comes in to remove my other grandma. He says ""Come on. Let's go let them whisper some more.""",04May2020,1
812,"Ok so, yes I am aware this is maybe a dumb question. But my parents are kind of freaking me out about it so I figured I‚Äôd just ask anyway to get some reassurance. 

About five weeks ago I had sex with my boyfriend (used a condom and he pulled out) we had done some other stuff without a condom but it was never full blown unprotected sex nor did he cum. I got my period a week later, a normal 5 days averagely heavy period (tho I will admit mine are usually slightly heavier). 

Anyway everything was great until three days ago when my period was supposed to start and then didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm worried, my mom thinks I‚Äôm pregnant even tho I had a period already and it‚Äôs kind of gotten under my skin a little. I took a pregnancy test yesterday afternoon and it came back negative but my period still isn‚Äôt here. 

Like I said I know I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not and with quarantine and the stress that‚Äôs going around lately it makes sense it‚Äôs be a little late but some reassurance would still be nice. Or atleast an honest opinion.",04May2020,1
814,"I'm a black woman, but haven't dated a black guy in years. So there is guy that works next to where I live. I tend to see me him a lot pulling up to work and I think a few times he saw me, but we never spoke because we dont know each other.

Anyways I thought he was kind of cute, but I never approach men I don't know.

Anyways to make a long story short my aunt was around one day and she was giving me a hard time and she started yelling and causing a scene outside before she left.

And of course this handesome guy happened to be outside and was looking at me hard when it was over, but I was embarrassed and shy by the whole thing and assumed he thought I was crazy.

Anyways after that day there was a few times I saw him staring at me a lot way more than before, but again I didnt know what he was thinking about me.

Anyways today when I walked past his workplace I heard a hello through the door but it was a black screen door and I always hear people talking through there so I didnt pay it much attention. But walking past his workplace again later on the way back to my house he happen to leave his work place at the same time and he saw me and he said something like ""Hey I was trying to say hi to you, but you didnt say anything"" and looked down and shrugged his shoulders like he was disappointed.

And then I said ""I thought I heard something"" and then I asked him his name and he asked me mine and jokingly said he wont forget my name and I said something like ""Dont forget my name"" lol

And then we parted to go our separate ways.
Now is this guy just trying to be friendly to me after he saw my aunt yell at me or is he interested in me?

If he was wouldnt he just ask for number instead of just leaving? Wouldnt he have come outside instead of saying hi behind the black screen door? Maybe he just caught me looking at him and was trying to be friendly?

Add: Well I saw him today and he just hi and kept walking to his job and that was it...i guess hes not interested üòî

815,"So I‚Äôm a 30 year old male who currently living in central Indiana, USA. I currently entered into the house I‚Äôm residing at as a roommate with one other individual.That individual owns the property an the agreement we originally had was I would stay there and pay 250$ a month an also do some general repairs and upkeep with the house seeing as he was getting to be little older in age an was needing some help in that regards so I agreed. This was originally for 6 months just verbally agreed to because we actually are friends from before this whole situation.Approx 2 months into the living situation the homeowner got arrested and will be serving approx 1 year of jail time. So as that situation unfolded he called me from the jail and I then notified his family as well as fixed some of his affairs and accounts he left not taken care of. The homeowners daughter shows up to the residence after about 2 weeks of him being in jail an proceeds to tell me that she has taken the power of attorney an that an account has been made for the house and if I wanted to continue to stay here I needed to start paying 500 every month.At that point I didn‚Äôt have anything in writing an was fearful of an overnight eviction so I quickly paid an received the receipt. Now here is where I need advice. I paid a 2nd months rent payment to her as well,an never received the paper receipt in the mail or a digital one an didn‚Äôt really think much of it.Now here I paid the 3rd months payment and I asked if it went through and she replied ‚ÄúYes.

817,"Tl;dr at the bottom

So just a few moments ago i was having dinner with my mom and her boyfriend. My mom discovered a long forgotten jar of chilis in vinegar. He for some reason took one out and bit into it. Needless to say he instantly spit it out and ran to the bathroom to wash his mouth. My mother burst out laughing and i was chuckling too. I personally saw this as an opportunity to get closer to him, since our relationship is kind of cold and we haven‚Äòt really talked much. I thought that ‚Äûoh he made a silly mistake, we can now all laugh about it and get closer‚Äú. 

After he came back and sat down to eat with us my mom asked him if he wanted to put some pepper on his food (she simply asked, not to make fun of him or anything). I took the opportunity to crack a joke and said ‚Äûcareful, it‚Äòs spicy‚Äú. My mom and I chuckled but he burst out with something like ‚ÄûI want respect in this house! It is something that is expected when talking to others!‚Äú 
Afterwards there was silence for about 5 minutes. You could cut the tension with a knife. Eventually, he broke the silence by basically repeating himself. I afterwards just said i was full and went back to my room. I just felt really awkward staying there and just wanted to get out. 

Now i‚Äòm kind of conflicted and don‚Äòt know what to do... Did I drive it too far with my joke? I overheard my mother talking with him, and she said that neither of us disrespected him and that we were just laughing about the situation. Should I keep my guard up? Or should I just forget and move on? I want my mother to be happy, but also after this i don‚Äòt really know what to think of him anymore...

818,"I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a kid, and I‚Äôve taken medication for it since I was 5/6. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs always been a part of me, but I‚Äôm used to it and I‚Äôve learned how to cope. But a couple of years ago, around the time I turned 20, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder and BPD. It made so much sense to me, because up until that point I was exhibiting so many symptoms that were new and scary to me. (For instance, I always get depressed during the summer time, but this year it was to the point that I was getting suicidal‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed, I was continually crying, comfort spending, sleeping a lot/not at all, etc. for seemingly no reason at all) I was already on antidepressants at that point too, and I hadn‚Äôt been suicidal for quite a few years.

And for those that know what BP I + II are like I would of course go into highs and lows of being super busy/productive for awhile to suicidal all over again. So like I said, getting this diagnosis was a relief. 

Fast forward to 3 years later, I‚Äôm in a way better place, I have the right medications, I actually feel normal. 

But.

I‚Äôm looking back at that time in my life and I‚Äôm second guessing myself and my diagnosis. 

During the time that I got diagnosed, I had also been kicked out of my house due to my parents abusive behavior, I got married in that time of a clusterfuck of mental stuff, I was unemployed, $600 in cc debt, all that stuff. 

And now I‚Äôm questioning myself, wondering if I really am bipolar or if that was just a bad time in my life. What if my improved mental health is just because of my circumstance and not medication/recovery? 

I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm not really bipolar and I‚Äôm just building it up in my head to be something that it‚Äôs not. It sounds silly the more I type this out but I can‚Äòt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm somehow just overreacting and trying to fit my symptoms into this diagnosis that I‚Äôm convincing myself that I have.

822,"I have a small almost 2 year old, not neutered shih poo (toy poodle/shih tzu) who let me be clear is not an aggressive dog! But I am worried he is becoming one because we have noticed recently he is becoming more aggressive to other cats and male dogs.

He isn't a rescue, we have had him since he was 8 weeks old but he has always been quite anxious (it took us months to get him to walk outside) but his confidence has gotten better now. There are loads of dogs in our area so we tried to keep him well socialised but there are also a lot of agresisve dogs too so maybe he has had a bad experience and now is on the defence? 

We also have a cat (she chose us so we didn't have her as a kitten) who absolutely hates dogs. They don't get along but they aren't violent or anything, more he chases her because he wants to play and she just wants him to eff off. He seems to have gotten very excited when seeing cats now and whenever he sees one tries to peg it to them (never let him off his lead out and about). I am worried though that if a cat is close and he sees it first what he might do.

Also the obvious part being he isn't neutered. I really don't want him to be either but if I have to I will, I would just rather try any training possible first. Have other people had issues when their dog has reached about 2? It would make sense if he was more boisterous due to hormones since he is a mature dog now really, but is it more like a teen or more permanent? I would wonder if it was trying to fight for a lady dog but he has shown aggression to male dogs without any females around so I don't think that's it.



Long story short, am I being selfish to be reluctant to neuter him, any tips of training this sort of issue and any tips to train a cat and a dog to get along better?",04May2020,1
823,"I‚Äôm writing this here because I just had a brilliant idea in the name of final resolution/ doing this out of love to help someone you love realise they have a mental illness that desperately needs addressing otherwise it‚Äôll ruin their lives. Basically my father is a hoarder. I feel like just this what you might think is a mere bump in the road of life had really fucked me up and has changed the way I navigate life. I had a smashing idea if I do say so myself to hold a secret well overdue intervention for my dad and his Hoarding. It‚Äôs everywhere, things we don‚Äôt need, never been used, doesn‚Äôt even know he has YET there‚Äôs an emotional attachment to every single item he has bought into this family home and my mother is barely hanging onto their marriage yet is too afraid to leave. Truly 4 of the worse addictions to have in life is Gambling, drug abuse, alcohol abuse &amp; hoarding. 

So back to that intervention I was talking about and have thought long at hard about hence being up at 4:51am writing this. My parents were due to go to Hawaii this August for around 10 days (organised by my mother as a very obvious last bit of hope holiday for the sake of their marriage) and I got the bright idea that maybe in order for things to be so desperately done I would sacrifice a couple $K  to get my childhood house cleaned out and rid of any traces of hoarding by my father. Keep in mind I am 19F and shouldn‚Äôt have to do this but I really do believe this could help kickstart some thoughts in his brain to realise he has an issue. I‚Äôm blessed enough to have a job that pays phenomenally well for my age (sorta entertainment industry I guess) and gets paid on a very irregular basis but can get paid 0-20k (Highest check ive got paid so far in my Career) depending of what jobs I do and how much money accumulates inbetween each pay and when the client pays. 

God that was a fkn confusing mouth full but glad we got that part over with. ANYWAYS what I wanted to do in these 10 days was to get rid of everything except for what he absolutely essentially needs, keep 3 things that he would really want but aside that basically fuck off the rest of unnecessary shit. If even go to the liberty of being nice and organising his shit. I‚Äôve really thought this out, I wouldn‚Äôt tell a soul that I‚Äôm doing this, there will be no one at my parents house for 10 days, I A 19 YEAR OLD WOULD SPEND MY HARD FUCKING EARNED MONEY TO HELP FIX A PROBLEM THAT SHOULDN‚ÄôT BE MINE BUT AM DOING IT OUT OF LOVE and would write a long letter to my father explaining everything that I‚Äôve felt for as long as I could remember, how I truly did this out of love for him and wanting him to realise there‚Äôs deep rooted issues at hand, and that if he never wants to speak to me again for the rest of our lives that‚Äôs fine but know I truly care about him and did this for him and not me. I‚Äôd leave the note on the table and let both of my parents know if they ever wanted to contact me when I‚Äôm back home ( I travel a lot for work and live overseas on and off ) I will only strictly meet them away from childhood house and there is to be no talk of anything to do with the house as I do not want to be dragged back into that dark hole. 

UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO COVID-19 I am unable to do this right now as life has come to a screeching halt and my parents as well as the rest of the world are unable to partake in international travel hence their holiday that would have been sent to be by heaven has got royally fucked up.

I am so sorry for this whole short story I‚Äôve just wrote but if you‚Äôve made it this far you‚Äôre a trooper and thank you so much, I need to fucking vent and let this shit out, the fact that it rattles me to my core thinking about the damage his hoarding has caused this family can make me breakdown but fuck breakdowns. I‚Äôm strong and I‚Äôve turned a new leaf in life, I am my own person, I‚Äôm going to get shit done my way and I am not going to let people control the way I think and live.

okay so here it goes. My mother has been close with her friend since they met in school and have always been by each other‚Äôs side since then. Ever since I was a born she always been there for me and my brothers. Always supporting us and helping us out generally

I felt like she knew I was getting one as she kept her leg over me and started rubbing her feet on me and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. There were times where I felt like this is wrong and I would feel uncomfortable and go sit in the other chair or go to my room.

A joke here and there about how I only ever eat junky food, I've always laughed it off and most of the time it never bothered me, but sometimes it would. As I've gotten older and been put in situations to try new foods, I've grown a bit and I have branched out to newer areas. However, when trying those new foods I've been in the company of my girlfriend who is very supportive of me trying new foods and she never judges me for being a picky eater or if I don't like the food that i'm trying. Not that everybody DOES judge me... However, I always get this fear of people seeing me try a new food and them judging me for being a picky eater, or judging me for not liking a certain food. I eat at a mess hall on a military base, We do not get to choose what we eat, what we eat is chosen for us. When you get your food you're sitting around hundreds of people. And when it's something I particularly don't like, or something I've never tried, I'll do my best to give it a shot. But I always have this fear of others seeing me and judging me for the way I'm reacting to the food, or that I'll skip out on the food being served for that meal. I know that a lot of it is in my head, as my girlfriend has helped me understand that nobody really cares what others are eating, or that if someone DOES judge me for being a picky eater, that's more telling of who they are rather than myself. Does anybody have any advice, or tricks to help me get over this fear, or to help me find ways to branch out to more foods being more comfortable with trying new things.

831,"We've never had any real issues with our neighbors until this quarantine, as they've been at home. They've been the loud, sometimes obnoxious neighbors - uncontrolled dogs, screaming kiddos, loud adults - but we've experienced those everywhere, and if we're inside our house, it's not an issue.

Our neighbors and I both have fences, and our back yards and built up against each other (if that makes sense?). So, we're close enough to notice certain things - but not \*that\* close. Since quarantine, they have bought a temporary above-ground pool and set it up close to their fence/near our property lines. Not an issue. A few weeks ago, they decided to build a platform to jump into the pool - not an issue. Over the past few weeks, the kiddos AND adults have been up on the platform lingering, even whenever they're not swimming - that's where our issue comes in. It's a little bit unnerving because the platform is as high as our fence (6 ft - the maximum that we're able to have), and we've heard them talking and stating that they can see things in our backyard/our patio/parts of our house. I don't particularly like the lack of privacy this has created.

As the weather is getting much nicer, we're spending much more time outside. We have a screened-in patio, where we have installed curtains recently to help with the privacy a little bit more. I don't want to have to keep those curtains closed all of the time, however.

Other ideas we've thought of were putting a creepy halloween decoration in one of the windows in the back of our house that they can see when they look over (lol, this would just be for my own enjoyment, mainly), perhaps planting a few more privacy trees along the fence line, maybe a trellis with climbing plants? Not really looking to speak with them about it; we are still choosing to self-isolate as we both work in essential businesses (telecommunications and healthcare).

Also, my parents, who live in another country, are going to buy clothes and other small things, but I am not sure they will be able to fly here because of the pandemic. In the worst case senario I can buy a lot of second hand stuff online.

Now, a friend of ours offered to sell us her baby's old stuff for much cheaper, otherwise she wants to sell them online for a little more. I believe it's too soon to be shopping for baby. I don't know what I'll receive as gifts, if anything. But if I do make a baby shower and my parents are able to come here, then I'l also have a lot of stuff at hand. 

Should I buy the baby clothes from my friend or wait a little? 

Thanks in advance.",04May2020,1

tl;dr version:

Yesterday I made an offer on a house, which was accepted. I'm not sure it was the right decision.. The house is about an hour away from the city where I work. I'm not sure I want to move out of the city, and I've thought about backing out of the offer. My partner really likes the new place and wants to move. She'll be disappointed if I decide to back out.

long version:

We're currently living in one of the major cities in my state. The main reason that we moved into this area is for my career prospects - I am a software developer so there are lots of opportunities for work in the city, and virtually no options for working in software back home. ""Back home"" is about an hour away from the city where I work, and is a more rural area.

Over the last few weeks, my partner and I have been kicking around the idea of moving closer to home in order to be closer to our families. We had talked about this idea in years past, but I was always pretty resistant to the idea, because it would have meant commuting an hour to work every day. However, in the midst of the pandemic, I've been working remotely, and have been enjoying the lack of a commute. The idea of moving closer to family has been made more realistic by my remote working situation, and has also been made more appealing given our isolation. We miss our families, and we want our kids to get to spend more time around their grandparents.

Yesterday we drove into the area to check out a house for sale. There are a lot of great features about the property - it's a big lot, with several outbuildings. The outbuildings are in good shape structurally and as we were walking through them I was thinking of how cool it could be to have those buildings, and what they could be turned into. One building in particular seems like it could be a really cool ""man-cave"" / office for me (but it would need significant money put into it for that to be a reality). The house on the lot is nothing crazy but is a nice ranch style house which has enough bedrooms and room for our family. It's bigger than our current apartment, and it's a nice place. The lot itself has tons of trees and is just a generally nice country lot. The location is really great - it's right down the street from the elementary school, a bike trail which connects a few of the cities in the area, and it's also really close to the local library. It's probably the best chance I have at getting a place that feels like it's ""out in the country"" while still being walking/biking distance from downtown (not of the big city, but of the small city we'd be moving into). My commute would be about an hour long if I had to drive to work (we're hoping I'll be able to move to some sort of arrangement where I come into the office only twice a week or similar). We'd live about 20 minutes from our families.

Long story short, we got pre-approved for a mortgage and made an offer, which was accepted. It all happened really quickly.

Today, I've just been filled with anxiety about this whole thing. I feel like we rushed into this huge decision, getting a mortgage and making an offer in a single day without even having seen any other houses. I'm not sure we'll have the money to put into making the outbuildings nice. I'm worried that living outside the city and trying to work at least partially remote is going to hurt my career in the long run. I'm worried that I may end up having to drive 2.5 hours every day if I can't make remote working work with my current job. And I'm just not sure I want to give up living in the city. I *like* living in the city. I like being close to all the parks and bars and restaurants and retail. There's a lot of cool stuff in my city and I'm not sure I want to leave it all behind.

But my partner doesn't feel the same way. She feels like moving closer to home would be nothing but a good thing. I feel like she doesn't enjoy living in the city the same way I do because she's been a stay at home mom for the 5 years that we've lived here. For me, the city feels like this place filled with opportunities. She feels isolated from her family. At the same time I feel like she's underestimating the value of the great park system our city has, all the cool stuff nearby to take the kids to, the conveniences of the city, and the opportunities that our kids have in the city that they wouldn't have elsewhere.

Meanwhile, she's right about some things - we could never afford a place like this one if we were looking in the city. This place was about 150k, and I don't think we could find anything we'd consider in the city for less than 230k. And a place for 230 might be doable, but we wouldn't have a large lot or a particularly amazing location.

So now I'm stuck in this conflicted state, and have basically been agonizing over this all day. I'm not sure if I want to leave the city behind. I'm also not sure if doing so is the best thing for my family. I could still get out of buying this house - I'd probably lose my earnest money, but at least I wouldn't be taking out a mortgage on a place I'm not sure I want to live in. But my partner will be seriously disappointed at best. I think she's really got her heart set on moving out to the country and setting up a little homestead. At worst, I'm worried that if I pull out of this deal I could plant resentment that could undermine our relationship. But I'm also worried that if I move out of the city and hate it, then *I'll* be the one resenting her.

I wish we'd never gone and seen the place honestly. I feel like I let myself get swept up in this process and now I'm on the hook for buying this property. I feel like I'm going to be unhappy no matter what I decide - if I move to the new place, I'll feel disconnected from the city, and I'm not sure if I can make myself happy there. If I pull out of the deal, my partner will be disappointed and will continue to feel stuck. I don't know what to do or how to resolve this situation in a way that makes everyone happy.

There are a lot of things to like about the place. Maybe if everything worked out with work I could build a really happy life there.  Maybe I'm being selfish, and I should just go try living there for my partner's sake - I know the kids would be happy there. They're 3 and 5 so they're not going to miss the city in the same way I would. And maybe I'm not really  giving anything up in the city - an hour drive really isn't that far. I could still drive into the city for concerts or beers with friends or whatever. But living in the city is a lot different from living an hour away. And even though we could theoretically sell the house and move back to the city if things didn't work out, I feel like it will be really difficult to move again if we settle at this new place.

I feel like I've made a huge mistake and I don't know how to unravel this situation. More than anything else I just feel bummed - I feel like I should be so excited to be purchasing my first home, but all I'm feeling is sadness and anxiety.

Here are the basic options I have:

&amp;#x200B;

* Back out of the deal, and stay in the city. I'd lose a few hundred dollars probably, but I could continue renting my current home, which is a nice enough place, even if it's a little small. I'd be close to the city and the job market, but I think this option would be a major disappointment for my partner, and a source of trouble in the relationship.
* Buy the house and move. I'd be closer to my family and only an hour away from the city, and I'd live in a pretty nice house on a large lot with lots of trees that my kids could run around on. We would have a ""country"" kind of lot but not be far from civilization. We'd be right down the street from the local elementary school in a well regarded school district. If I can find the time and money, I think I could turn that property into something really special.  


I'm totally conflicted here and could really use some outside opinions on the situation. I'm at a loss as to what the right thing to do is. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",04May2020,1
837,"Hey guys, so my current bed that I sleep on is a queen bed but the base was made poorly / uneven and the mattress is way too old (I'm afraid to say how old) and has sunken.

I have found a used bed set, retailing for about $2000 AUD for only $600, it's the koala queen bed with the koala base + pillow + any other bedding. I found this deal on FB Marketplace and am soon to inspect it. It is pretty far though (I live about 2 hours public transport away, I don't drive, but it'll take about 45 minutes drive time to haul it back with movers).

The replacement reason seems easy enough, I'm replacing a bad bed for a used but better one. But - I'm planning to move from my parents home in Sydney to Melbourne at the beginning of next year, but could move as early as November. The base I can move easily with me but the mattress not so much but not fussed to leave it behind or sell it. If I decide to sell it all, I would most likely break even or turn a profit.

There is also a similar listing that's $400 that includes a used mattress but a lesser valued bed base that is closer to my location.

839,"I have attended two different universities in two different countries to study Mechanical Engineering and both times I dropped out in the first year, I didn't even reach the exams because in university A I hated the city and in university B, in which I stayed longer, I actually realised I hated the degree. 

My parents also run a relatively successful business in which I am really interested and would like to take over it whenever it's time. I work 2019-2020 on it and I really liked it but I recognized that the business could be ran from a remote location. During this year I also started a degree in Law via the online university of my country and have passed all the exams and have loved studying it.

I have been looking for some time whether to go to a good university in my country, which I am sure I like the city, and now that I know I like the degree for sure I am 99% certain I won't quit the degree.

842,"Hello everyone I‚Äôm 20 years old (female if that matters). Idk who else to talk to. My friend has her own life and I feel like I‚Äôm burdening her with my venting sometimes so I decided maybe to post here i might get good advice :) or just venting will make me feel better 

So I‚Äôve been struggling financially, mentally, and physically lately. I still live with my mom and she lets me live in her house with my (kinda ex) boyfriend for low cost rent. ($200 a month max) which is super cheap and highly grateful for that. Problem is she wants me out by my 21st birthday which is in June. I can understand because I‚Äôm getting older and maybe she just wants her alone time and not to feel bothered or anything by me and my bf. She and him don‚Äôt talk at all btw, he has made me go through a lot in the past and she doesn‚Äôt rlly like him. I can explain all he‚Äôs done but it would be too long of a post and everyone would tell me to leave him (which I want to but can‚Äôt...or so I feel like I can‚Äôt). Back to the point is, I had a job recently but they laid me off with no warning, my supervisor didn‚Äôt even call me or text me, I just came in and my big boss told me that they don‚Äôt need me for a bit. I begged for it and told them I needed it because I am financing a car from this dealership for $300 a month and my insurance is $300 a month. There‚Äôs no way in hell I can pay that with no job duhh. But they told me it‚Äôs only temporary. I‚Äôve been jobless since February now and I‚Äôve texted them with not even a text back at all. The job didn‚Äôt pay so well but it helped me survive. Both my bf and I worked there and both got laid off so we are both jobless. We‚Äôve had at least 30 job interviews with no call back after and that‚Äôs the farthest it‚Äôs gone. My problem is I don‚Äôt know what to do. My bf just smokes weed even though my mom doesn‚Äôt like it when he does I‚Äôm the house but he continues and I end up getting yelled at, having to cover for him. I have to remind him to apply for jobs. Right now we aren‚Äôt talking because he was acting like a child and I walked away from him, so he decided to get mad at me for it and just not talk to me for the past 3 days. So I‚Äôm basically confused and scared about wtf to do because honestly I don‚Äôt feel like I can go to him for support anymore, I feel like I have no one. My family cut me off because my brother pushed me down the stairs and he said that he did it out of defense because I was about to punch him?? Which I wasn‚Äôt I was just arguing with him and grabbed my hair and pushed me down from the top of the stairs and just said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get b!tch‚Äù and I told my bf and so my bf beat him up and my brother moved out afterwards.Therefore I look bad to them because my bf beat him up and to them I chose my bf over family. I was crying and begging my bf not to beat him up but he still did. I‚Äôm sorry this story is confusing and I keep going off track. So my family basically isn‚Äôt in my life. They never really were either way they always made me feel like a weird person and treated me less than my brother. My mom was really the only family I HAD left but now I feel like she hates me. She barely speaks to me and if I try to speak to her she ignores me or says something and walks away. She used to yell at me everyday if I didn‚Äôt clean the house enough. Which I understand because I‚Äôm jobless so I should at least keep the house clean which I do now. But lately just feels like she wants a reason to scream at me. The most recent argument we had was because she opened mail for me from this unemployment benefits things which she knew I was going to apply for. She wants to know how much money I‚Äôm getting so she can get paid her rent. Which i understand but still. anyways, I told her in a joking way ‚Äúmooom why would you open it? It could‚Äôve been important or something embarrassing‚Äù she immediately said ‚Äúwow so delicate‚Äù and I said ‚Äúno no it just could‚Äôve been something private‚Äù she then threw it at me and said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even have a place to live or a job‚Äù randomly. Then said ‚ÄúI wish your brother came back‚Äù I started crying and just fell asleep. 
then she proceeded to text me out of the blue the same day at night saying 

‚ÄúI hope you move out by June I can‚Äôt stand you anymore, I‚Äôm such a nice person and people like you don‚Äôt appreciate that. I‚Äôm never going to be with a guy like yours. I have my own preference of men which is white men who have money. You are so obsessed with him and jealous.You have no job and I do so much for you. I pay your phone bill and I put my name in your insurance so it could be cheaper. I want you to take me out of the insurance before you move and get your own phone too‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt know what to say because I‚Äôm confused idk where she was getting these things from and why she was saying the most random things. I mean I‚Äôm used to it kind of because she says weird things to me a lot but it always hurts the same way it did the first time she said some weird offensive shit. I just told her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be out by June‚Äù she said ‚ÄúNo hard feelings I just think it‚Äôs best for you‚Äù. 
That was maybe 2 weeks ago. Even before that argument she was always mad at me, talking crap about me to my brother on the phone. But I just feel like I have no one or nothing really to live for anymore. I have no job, a payment that‚Äôs going to put in debt this month, might get my car repossessed, my cat has to go to the vet because she has like a lump and I have to use this free exam coupon but idk if they‚Äôre going to charge me for extra stuff and I‚Äôm scared because I have NO MONEY. my kinda bf isn‚Äôt talking to me. I just want my mom to tell me it‚Äôll be okay. She has never been affectionate that much but even when she just tells me advice it helps me so much. 


This became longer than it should‚Äôve but if anyone could give me advice on if I should just keep applying or anything. Even just motivation to keep going would a lot of good for me. Thank you!",04May2020,1
843,"So my story is that my brother and this girl have been dating for about 8 years give or take. They broke up about 3 years ago because he wanted an open relationship with her.

Completely moved off campus during winter break and accepted I would have to pay for room and board through spring. Tried continuing class through the spring and was failing trying to balance school and work. Dropped out mid spring of 2016. Picked up a small refund check(I overpaid) May/June of 2016.

We agreed to continue our relationship to see where it would go, but half way through the summer she grew more and more distant.

Eventually she just stopped responding to me.  

I took the hint and accepted that it was over. Now it's 2020 and she will still occasionally appear in my dreams.

854,"I first met her (let's call her Joana) at school 3 years ago when we first started 8th grade(we are in the same class by the way) and at first I didn't feel anything towards her. But as time went on we became close friends, started spending more time with each other in school, hugging every time we meet, going out together. She started sharing personal stuff with me and even kissed my cheek a couple of times. Going back to those moments makes me think that she had something for me then, but, of course, I was stupid enough to do nothing about it.

It continued that way until I realised I have strong feelings towards her in the beginning of the summer holiday after 9th grade. For one reason or another we ended up not being able to see each other for the whole duration of it even though we both wanted to. During that time the I was constantly thinking of finally meeting and making a step forward to forming a relationship with her.

So the holiday was almost over and we decided to meet the day before school strated. After hugging me for a minute straight and explaining how much she had missed me she said that she had found a boyfriend. I pretended to be happy for her, but it hurt like hell. Of course, her bf happened to be the classic jerk with shaved head and a grand total of two brain cells who treated her like shit all the time. I fucking hated that guy. Their relationship lasted till a month before the end of the school year when he told her he didn't love her anymore and broke up with her. I made everything in my power to make her feel better and it felt like we had never been that close to each other before. But then school ended and I didn't get to see her for about a month after because we had to go on family holidays and stuff. 

One evening she called me and said that she had gotten back together with that guy and explained how happy she was about it. As you can probably tell, that hit me hard into the feelings once again. I decided that I don't want to be a pussy anymore since it doesn't even matter at that point and texted her the next day. I told her what I felt towards her and that I knew she doesn't feel the same way about me. She said that she didn't want me to feel bad and that she wanted us to remain friends. And so we did.

That didn't make me feel much better and I felt really fucking bad for the next two ot three months but then I met another girl and thinking that an eventual relationship would help me forget the shit I was going through, I started dating her and we got together pretty soon after. I was hoping that with time I would develop feelings for her but that never happened. On top of that Joana broke up with her bf very soon after i got into that relationship and I knew for a fact that she and the girl I was dating didn't like each other at all. I broke up with that girl about two months after we became a couple. During that time Joana acted like she was very close to me and that made me think she had finally started seeing me as more than just a friend. But as soon as I ended my relationship, her behaviour went back to normal. 

I soon realized that it was all just false hope and decided that the only way to move on with my life is to just stop any communication with her. I called her and told her just that, she started crying and said that she understood and admired my decision, that she loved me(as a friend) and that she will always be there for me. That happened 3 weeks before the quarantine shit popped up and we haven't talked since. 

Sadly, not being able to communicate with her is even more painful than being just friends with her. And now that I'm locked indoors I can't help but think about her all the time and I'm not sure if I made the right decision. I'm very emotional and I just can't find a way out of this mess. I know that I have to move on and forget about her but I really really love her and have never before been more frustrated in my life. I'm tired of sleepless nights spent crying and thinking about things that I could have done differently.

What should I do?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Could really use some advice on this one.",04May2020,1

861,"Last September I started a college course straight out of school. I chose a course that doesn't have the best career opportunities, but it was what I was interested in and what I really wanted to do. My parents were happy to pay for it so long as I worked hard, even if they aren't going to be getting the same return on investment when compared with my older brothers education as he is a hardworking engineering student. I did ok my first semester. I did pretty well in all my modules, bar one that I failed. I can repeat it in August for a fee that I'll be paying myself. My parents and I argued alot after this. There is this expectation that because my course isn't something like engineering or medicine, I should find it fun and shouldn't have any trouble passing, even though I find some of my classes quite difficult. I struggled in my first semester because I wasn't he most responsible person. In school, I used to just coast my way through the year and then study hard for the final and 'pull it off in the end' so to speak. That doesn't work in college so I got a bit of a shock. I found it hard to push myself to get up early for my classes and to stay late doing assignments and studying. I happened to be living with students had all been in college for a little longer than I had so from them I kind of learned what it takes to succeed in college. This semester I had began to work harder and was starting to do better, but when the campus closed and the country went into lockdown everything fell apart. I struggled to do my online college work from home. None of my lecturers/tutors did online classes, they just emailed us the lecture slides and assignments, telling us to email them if we had any questions. My university won't be implementing a non-dentriment policy, they won't even tell us if they are going to grade/assess us any differently than any other year, despite the global pandemic and the quality of education they deliver suffering. I'm a socially awkward person, and I've found it difficult to keep in contact with my friends without meeting them regularly in person which sucks because talking with them about college and promising eachother that we would study and go to class together was the main thing that was helping me improve. I'm almost certain that I'm going to fail at least one, if not two, modules this semester. I'll have the option to repeat them all in August, but I know that parents will see this as me not working hard enough and that I don't appreciate he money they are spending on me. They have a tendency to helicopter over me and be on my case about college work enough as it is and I just know they are going to drive me crazy all summer, expecting me to spend every spare minute I have studying and constantly threatening to stop paying for college if I fail the repeat exams. I feel like this wouldn't have happened if the campus hadn't closed, but at he same time it was always still possible for me to pass everything no matter how difficult I found it so I'm not sure if I'm being too hard on myself. 

If you managed to read this whole thing without falling asleep, bless you. I know the way I wrote my little story is really messy but this has been tearing me up inside for weeks and I don't know who to talk to. So if any of you could offer any little bit of advice or thoughts I'd really appreciate it.",04May2020,1
862,"Hi there,

Currently, I'm a 23-year-old student in his second year of a mathematics program looking for something else.  I've always struggled with school.  Not the material or subjects, but the environment.  I attended community college for two years and since then I've attended two other schools where I couldn't find my footing.  I am almost done with my first spring semester where I am currently enrolled.  The virus sure messed up my momentum, as it did with everyone else, but I'm can't help to think about what will happen to me if I stick with this program. 

I really love math, and I enjoy teaching/tutoring, but I don't know if I like it enough to go to *grad school*.  I'm frustrated with how long I've been in school with nothing to really show for it.  All this education and I couldn't land a job with this stuff even if I tried.  Not to mention all this money I feel I'm wasting, along with accumulating debt.

I was thinking about leaving my program behind to look for a new career path, particularly in either mechanical or shop work.  I have no idea where to start though.  If I could support myself and work with my hands without working in a kitchen, that would be awesome.  

Any advice is welcome.",04May2020,1
863,"Ever since I was young, I've been told by everyone that college would be one of the greatest experiences of my life, and I always looked forward to it but I started my first semester of college last September and I was sadly disappointed. I have made a some friends, but apart from a couple of them, I don't really feel like I fit in with the friend group. They are nice, don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't feel right and I don't know why. I also got into a very small degree where the majority are female (there are 40 people in my class and there are only 2 guys), and meeting guys was one of the things that I was also really looking forward to, but that hasn't really happened. Honestly, the only thing I'm 100 percent happy with is my degree, I love what I'm studying and I don't struggle at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I want to live the college experience, especially because during the majority of high school I was involved in two very toxic and controlling relationships, where I felt trapped, so when I got out my senior year, I got involved with a new group of friends, my life changed completely and I became a little bit of a party girl. I thought that that lifestyle was going to continue when I started college, but most of my high school friends left to study abroad, and apart from the fact that I don't fit in with my new college friends, they also never wanted to go out for drinks or party (I've gone out with them a total of 3 times ever since I started college). I know I should have done more, maybe get involved in more activities or something and meet new people, but when I started college and realized things weren't as I expected, I kinda shut down and would always be very sad, especially since I saw so many of my friends living the life I wanted to live (I have since started seeing a therapist and it has helped). My question here is, has this happened to any of you? I want to take matters into my own hands and although right now I know I can't do anything about this because of the current situation, I want to start next semester with a plan to fix this and get my life where I want it to be. Any recommendations on what type of activities I could get involved with to make new friends and meet guys? 
I also wanna mention that in my country most people live with their parents during college (i do too), and here we don't have sororities or frats so that's off the table.",04May2020,1

874,"When I was a young teenager, I developed some sort of eating disorder. I was never officially diagnosed and my behaviour doesn¬¥t really fit common expectations people have, so I won¬¥t call it anorexia. (This is also the reason I post this here and not in some more specific subreddit about officially diagnosed EDs- don¬¥t want to forcefully invade a safe space for people that are really struggeling.)

It started when I was 14. Meals with my family meant stress, potential fights and also being watched constantly, so I started avoiding them. My family is also pretty dysfunctional, so on evenings where everybody just kept to themselves after a fight, it was easy going to bed hungry.

And I liked what the hunger did to me. It felt like an accomplishment to endure hunger. I still loved food, especially junk food, but by skipping meals and never really catching up on them losing weight was easy. I always felt too boyish, too square, too plump, too ugly and also struggled with a very depressive outlook on life, so I felt the skinny, unhealthy body type was perfect to ""display"" my overall emotions (hard to explain- Instagram pages glorifying EDs and Selfharming definitely played a role).

When I look back, I see an already very lean teenage girl (47 kg at 164 cm) trying to starve herself to fit her own unhealthy standard. I went down to 42 kg. 

It was hard to let go of this behaviour, but eventually I managed to, without therapy, without people noticing that my figure was due to a very unhealthy behaviour. I came to the conclusion that I enjoyed food too much and that I would finally allow my body to develop. When I was 16, I finally developed some ""curves"", reached the milestone of 50 kg on my 18th birthday and a few weeks later, felt like I finally had the body of a grown woman (although still slim).

I mostly overcame the ED (that¬¥s a story for another day), but I feel that letting go of that significant emaciated figure was hard. I now weigh 61 kg, which means +10 kg in just a year. It is a rather drastic weigth gain for me, but I love it. I finally feel like a ""sexy"", desirable woman with a satisfying bra size (to put it politely), some curves as well as some chubby parts and rolls and stretch marks, and I am okay with that.

The thing is: I was thin all my life, extremly skinny for some time, and still rather slim after that. And now I am just.. eh? My grandmother would obviously say that I look starved and that I need to eat more of her cake (classic grandma move), but aside from that, I don¬¥t really know how to put my body type in words. If I call myself chubby while I am still very skinny, everyone is alarmed. When I once called my ""food baby"" normal, I got pitying comments such as ""Yeah, you sure think you¬¥re not just fat. Talk yourself into it."". I suspect my body is average, but I can¬¥t really come to terms with that. Maybe it is because I gained to much weight in a short time, I don¬¥t know. It seems like such an insignificant problem, but it is on my mind everytime I look into a mirror. ""Yeah, hot. But in what kind of way?""

Thanks for reading all of it. If there¬¥s somebody who had a similar experience, I really hope you maybe share it here. I¬¥m also open for questions if I left some things unclear or expressed myself incorrectly since English is not my native language.",04May2020,1

so through my entire life i've been going through tough times cuz of my brother, back in the day when i was a kid he used to criticize me a lot and talk shit about me all the time, it made me self-conscious and insecure, it kinda ruined me and my personality. A few years later and my personality is a lot better than years before BUT my brother still talks shit about me and it kinda triggers me everytime he talks about me and it's i dunno like it caused me a trauma or smth. Anyways my family is weird we grew up without a dad cuz he married another woman and when he used to live with us he always hit us and wasn't really a good father, my mom is still here and she's amazing but back in the day she didn't know what to do with us and didn't know that my brother's words were affecting me and my personality a lot, and she blames herself cuz i'm feeling like this but she shouldn't cuz this is my war and my problem.  
Now the problem, dad has been here the past few weeks and he has been stressing us all out and my brother yesterday was talking shit about me and i lost it and i called him out on everything that he said back in the years and now, i've always stayed shut and never spoke back to him cuz i was afraid of hurting his feelings but yesterday i wasn't thinking straight so i kinda exploded, i yelled at him and kept saying that he's shit and he loves bringing people back cuz that's how he gets his confidence, by bringing the people around him down and that he's self insecure and that's why he keeps bringing people down, he wants to be stronger than the people around him, i also said that he's trash and he's jealous of me and that's why he has been trying to bring me down his entire life and that he hates the fact that now i grew up and won't stay shut, and i said that after this day i will now stay silent about anything and i'm gonna call out everyone on their mistakes and criticize them (i won't cuz i will feel like shit after) anyways now what i wanna know is what should i do? i don't regret what i said or whatever but i feel bad that i said what i said, maybe i do regret it? i just don't want him to overthink everything i said cuz i didn't mean half of what i said. now he's acting like the victim and he's telling mom that that's how he is with everyone (he isn't he just focuses on me and only me, cuz he knows he can't say shit about my other brothers) and he says that i'm wrong and that he's done nth wrong and that he's done a lot of good stuff like giving me his laptop WHEN DAD BOUGHT HIM A GAMING PC, he didn't need it anyways and he's given it to me cuz dad didn't have the money to buy us a pc after mine and my brother's broke down. I'm lost and confused, i dunno what i want and i'm still finding my own self, i don't know what i am?. I'm gonna turn 19 this sep and he's gonna turn 23 in june so we're 4 yrs apart. And he's refusing to listen to what i have to say about what i said yesterday, a part of me is telling me that throughout these whole years i've been fighting my war and yesterday i created his war, a war for him to fight, i lowkey think that i can't do anything right now and that this is his war to fight and that no one can help him but himself, he refused to listen to me so is it now out of my hand and it's in his? is this his war? or should i try to make him listen to me? as i'm writing this post now he's speaking with mom about what i said yesterday and acting like he has done nth wrong through the years and that it was only to make me stronger but that's a lie, cuz it made me hate myself and always try to change for the better BECAUSE OF THEM. what do you guys think i should do now?... sorry to keep it long and thanks in advance.",04May2020,1

879,"Hey, I've been thinking recently very deeply about where I want to go in life. The moment I turned 20 (last month) I immediately thought, ""Oh shit. I'm an adult now and I NEED to get my shit together.""

I dumped my boyfriend who I believed didn't add value into my life, I lost ""friends"" (who obviously weren't real friends), and became closer with my best friend who always encourages me to move in the right direction. 

The past couple months I've been quitting binge drinking (only drink socially now- had a large alcohol problem). 

I'm almost saved up for my own car, and my mom and I are helping me budget to get my own apartment with my own money (I live alone but partially dependant financially on mom).

One thing that is confusing me: I don't think I want to be married. If I do, it'll be 20 years from now. I want my own child, however and I want one in my early/mid twenties after I get fully financially independent and my own place. 

I'm tired of dating. I have many lovely guy friends but dating ALWAYS distracts me and I losing focus on my life and goals. I think I'm realizing it's personally not my thing and I don't want to put effort, time, and money on somebody other than myself and my own blood family.

For some reason I also have very little interest in sex (unless I'm committed to somebody) and seriously considering celibacy. 

Is there anybody here going through something similar? Or has been? What did you do to get over it? Are you happy with the choices you made?

According to a friend of mine I ""Claim, I've changed but all I've learned is how to not get in trouble!"" but I am learning! It's just hard when I keep finding myself in different situations than the previous ones so the same lessons I've learned can't be applied! 

And it doesn't help that I tend to sprint rather than walk in conversations so I'll say something really stupid at the wrong time. And then when I apologize the same thing always happens

""You're not sorry! If you were you'd modify your behavior!""

But I AM sorry!!! I made a mistake! A slip of the tongue!! Why does no one ever believe me!?

I hate this!!! I wanna change and be better!! I don't wanna be toxic!!! I don't want to be a terrible stubborn judgmental person!! But no matter what happens I keep ending up in the same situations!!!

It doesn't help that one of my friends keeps on dragging me into arguments when I clearly don't want too!

I played the opening mission probably about 6 times. Cause I couldn't decide between Zer0 or Axton. I decided to play zero, but then I skipped the baddass opening cutscene since I had seen it about 5 times. Then it began to bother me that I hadn't seen the cutscene with this version of the character, and for some reason it really began to bother me that I didn't watch the opening cutscene, I think it might of been because I wasnt doing it the way everyone else was, watching the cutscene then playing the game. It bothered me enough to start a new game and watch the cutscene. Another example would be while playing dragons age inquisition, I restarted that game around 14 times because everytime I noticed something about my character I didnt like, I restarted and re customized him. This doesnt apply to everything, when things arent perfect it doesnt bother me. It's only when things I really want to enjoy.

The first time I helped her out was about a year and a half ago. she was breaking up with him and she came over to my house. She knocked on the door and she was a mess. Covered in bruises and crying her eyes out. She asked me if she could stay while she called the cops. Apparently when she tried breaking up with him, He freaked out and started throwing shit and hitting her. So she locked herself in the bathroom and climbed out of the window.

She came to me because I‚Äôm a big scary foreigner with tons of tattoos. If you don‚Äôt know, Japanese people can be pretty judgmental about that stuff. So they all think I‚Äôm a violent psychopath. **I‚Äôm really a sweetheart though** this was also the first time we interacted beyond me introducing myself when I first moved in. Anyway I let her stay while she called the cops because I‚Äôm not a fucking monster. 

So he comes over to try and bring her back or something. But he Changed his mind really quick when I answered the door. **Being ostracized in Japan has its advantages on occasion**

I didn‚Äôt want to fight the guy so I just tell him to get lost and not come back. So he leaves and the cops come and arrest his ass. I feel bad for the girl so I get her in contact with some local battered women‚Äôs organization and check up on her every now and then to make sure she‚Äôs doing alright. 

So problem solved right? The bad guy is gone, she‚Äôs getting the help she needs, happy ending right? NOPE.

Three months later she has bailed the idiot out and is back together with the dude. I was pretty upset when I found out but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. That was apparently the wrong move because the same situation happens. They get into a fight, he beats the shit out of her, she comes running over and the dude gets hauled away again. 

At this point I have it figured out that this guy fucked with her head pretty bad. So I decide I need to be more involved with her recovery. In order for her to break whatever mindfuckery this guy did to her.

So I start going with her to meetings and having dinner with her to try and make her feel better. I even set her up with some girls from my work so she can have some friends and start to build a support network. I introduced her to a psychiatrist specializing in domestic abuse so she can work through this issue with professional help. 

She seemed like she was getting her life together so I start to let her do her own thing little by little. After about 8 months everything is pretty much back to normal. Until I discover that she has bailed shithead out of jail again and he is back to his shitheaddery ways.

At this point the logical side of my brain is telling me that this girl is beyond saving.

I do believe that some people are simply to fucked up in the head to be helped. I have tried to help this girl out twice. I have given her all of the resources she needs to succeed and break the hold this guy has on her. But she just keeps going back to this guy even though she knows he is a piece of shit.

However my empathetic side says I just haven‚Äôt tried hard enough. 

My question is basically. Should I give this chick one more chance? Or is she beyond saving.",04May2020,1
884,"I am always over thinking, general speaking I am usually 3-5 steps ahead in my head of where I actually am. I'm not sure if I am mentally scarred or something, and I am not trolling either. I believe it is the cause of why I do not sleep even though I have been diagnosed with sleep insomnia. I've tried clearing my head via physical activities like working out, outdoors stuff, even reading.  

Also, I do smoke pot to help not be as analytical, only indica. It helps tremendously, I do view it as a crutch sometimes.

Male 23, doing lots of sports. I sit a lot because of studying and working during the day. Maybe that helps.

2-3 weeks ago I had this weird pressure-pain on the right side of my lower back. Came out of nowhere. I assumes it was from sitting around too much. Didn‚Äòt bother me much, so I kept working out at home.

One day I wake up and I have this pain in the right side of the glutes, whenever I sit down or stand up after sitting down. Also when I reach for sth high or bend down. The pain is only on the right side and shoots down to my hamstrings. The pain goes away after 4-5 seconds and never returns unless I do one of the described activities.

If I needed to describe the pain...it‚Äòs a mix of a pressure feeling and as if my muscles would tighten up hard, followed by a sting. Similar to a cramp actually.

887,"I'm probably going to regret posting this later when I come to my senses. 

It started when I gave myself bruises up and down my legs so that I wouldn't do anything that I would regret later, primarily in arguments. Later, I concluded that I'd play the suicidal card if anyone found out; they don't need to know about it.

I haven't had to give myself bruises for a little less than a month now, and I can currently wear shorts. Yay for conflict resolution! Which is great, I guess, but I've found that I prefer to cause pain anyway. Those sorts of stories are for another day, but earlier I had a sudden impulse to have bruises again. Just today. Not very good timing; I happen to have a skirt on right now. Above my knees. So instead, I whipped my knuckles until they were red.

I like to think of myself as some sort of morbid bodybuilder. It gives me the oddest feeling, to see cuts and bruises and impurities in my skin. Which is odd, since I'm much more sadistic than masochistic, not to mention the fact that I receive almost no sexual pleasure from hurting myself. It's not so much about the pain, either. I just really like to see it.

I know I have a problem, but I'm not so sure if I even want to solve it. Advice?

Anyway, my best friend dated this guy a year or two ago, I was always really attracted to him but - of course, girl code. So, even after they broke up we never spoke or anything at all. Fast forward to a couple days ago, he added me on my new Snapchat since my best friend posted a selfie of me and @ me. Last night / in the AM today, he slid up on my post asking if anyone wanted to come over / hang out. 

I didn‚Äôt tell my friend and we went out and chilled in his car. We talked, smoked weed a little, drove to the beach and just around the place. Little playful touches  went from one place to another and we ended up having sex in his car.

890,"Tldr; I'm feeling pretty low, a little heartbroken and would like suggestions on how to cheer myself up/distract myself

The venting version:
Earlier this year, I had a pretty mopey couple of months. I thought I was doing well regaining my energy back but it's recently taken another dip. I'm sure I'll get past it again but it's pretty rough going. Being in lockdown is probably not helping.

Honestly, it hasn't been a bad life for me at all and I try hard to look at all the great things I have in my life. But there was one thing I was searching for which I feel I will never get. 

I'm a hopeless romantic and have been searching for a really deep connection with someone for a really long time. It was basically my main aim since I was a child. I had many crushes, made friends and spent a lot of time with many, but I could never reach that connection I wanted. I figured maybe I was being too unrealistic so I dropped that idea.

Once I did, I ended up slowly (and unintentionally) falling in love with someone who helped me grow so much as a person. He taught me how to love myself but without relying on him. But our lives were going in very different directions and so I didn't hold onto any hope that anything could happen and tried to maintain distance. Regardless, I only fell deeper and deeper, and I am struggling with the possibility that I might never have such a connection with anyone again.

He is not perfect. Neither am I. There are many things which make me think maybe we wouldn't have worked anyway. But for all his flaws, he really was wonderful and I grew to love him a lot and that only stings me more. It took me so long to finally find ONE person to share such a connection with... realistically, how long will it be to find another?

He really was special. I'm so happy my life allowed me to meet him and yet so heartbroken I can't stay. It's still hard but it's better than it was 2 years ago when it first hit me that I can't stay.

We're still friends but I try to maintain enough distance so I can heal. Then I worry he'll forget about me altogether eventually. But then I wonder why do I even worry about that. We had a good run, it can be kept as a nice memory. 

I have so many thoughts and it's driving me insane. 

End of vent. Please give me ideas on how to cheer myself up and distract myself for a little bit.",04May2020,1

However, my ex‚Äôs (can barely even call it that) parent owns the place. I would work directly with the parent. I never met the parents when I was with their son. It was a strange relationship where we were never exclusive but I wanted to be. He made it seem like we would officially be together eventually but would never follow through. It got messy because I hve a past with sexual assault so I was hesitant to do anything sexual but that was all he was looking for in the relationship. It got sort of manipulative and ultimately finally got what he wanted when I was intoxicated. I was very afraid of anything sexual during that time and he would be kinda pushy. It was very confusing and hurtful. Ultimately he didn‚Äôt want to be with me because I had ‚Äúa lot of problems‚Äù.

893,"I am a 25 female and i have been with my boyfriend for 10 years. We met in school at age 15 and we are the same age. For as long as I have known my boyfriend Jeff, he has always really wanted kids. And at first I was all for it.

For some context: Jeff has 2 sisters and is a middle child. He has had quite a ruff childhood and lost his mother at a young age and lost contact with his father for most of his childhood. He was raised partly by extended family then moved in to foster care at age 13 with one other younger sibling.

I am an only child raised by my amazing single mother. I have had no contact with my father in many years so my mother raised me by herself (very well I might add).

When we got together we many bounded over this shared pain not having ever being raised in a ""complete"" household. Jeff really helped me over come much of my resentment and fear towards boys/men, but I have had mild depression and abandonment issues all my life and I am doing much better now because of him, but I did push him away a lot in the beginning because of those issues. Now we are older and preparing to move in together we have had several arguments over kids. For years, I have said the same thing that I would like to establish my career, get married, travel and build some savings and then have child. But he is now getting far more persistent and the topic is starting to annoy me to the point I am not sure I even want them.

I have only recently in the last year got a full-time job and started to save some cash to move in with him. My feelings towards kids have always been a little negative, they are messy and loud and don't leave you alone for a solid 16-18 years and they are SO expensive. I have had to work so hard since graduation to support myself working for an events, for really shitty money and hours, because I did not want to mooch off of my Mom.

Having a child at any point during this time would have ruined me emotionally and financially. We talked about having kids often and I started to realise after each discussion I felt more and more a scared of getting pregnant and would probably have an abortion if it happened (I am on birth control). Jeff really picked up on my disinterest in these conversations and I found myself saying the same thing over and over again, once we have more money, are married and settled in careers then we can talk about babies probably nearer age 30.

As we are moving in together I fear this may only get worse, as his friends have started to have kids and his patience is starting to run out. I have tried to explain my feelings that we aren't ready and have even mentioned marriage first as this is more important to me, than kids, and enjoy being with Jeff as a couple and travel as non of our friends even bothered to get engaged before having kids and non have taken this step. I really never wanted to have kids without marriage but ,now I am perfectly happy to have a marriage and no kids. I saw my mother do it on her own and don't want that responsibility. I am not sure how to proceed with Jeff as the news may mean that we cant be together and I really don't want to be with someone else.. Please anyone has any thoughts please let me know.",04May2020,1

I'm an Asian guy and my parents(non supportive only want to see A+) have lots of expectation from me. I used to be good in academics but that was the only thing i could do and everything else was banned for me since early childhood.

I was 14 when i bought a mobile phone with my own savings(since parents said they wont buy me one as it will cause academic distractions). Since then I've become addicted to games and just cant do anything without my phone which is a huge problem but i cant help .

I am passionate about anything therefore no motivation to study. Neither am i good in studies nor anything else. Yes a total failure. I still somehow manage to get B+ by last minute preparations and my grades have been deteriorating since i got my phone. Neither can i leave that phone nor can i use it too much but thats not all.

In school i used to be a popular guy but last year my school got changed and in the new school i just act like a nobody. I had managed to get myself a girlfriend who cheated on me with her ex just after 6 months of relationship. I find no reason to study or to live on in general.

even now all my parents are concerned about is my academics and upcoming SAT and other exams which they are expecting me to score well in but i cant find any reason to sit and study. I just lock myself in the room and play games all day long and realising that I'll be homeless soon.

It sounds bad, but I questioned it, when I asked what I'd done I'd be met with smiley gifs and memes. 
Our friendship was strange. They were always better then me and made everything a competition, they rarely apologised for anything, and i always felt like i had to prove myself to them that i can be better, funnier to be good enough etc.
On discord, I viewed my confusion and frustration and I think I made the situation worse. They're like the leader of the friendgroup.
I question if he was toxic and I think he was at times. I'm not sure what to do.
Leave this friendgroup and be left with myself and be possibly lonely, or stay in the friendgroup, knowing someone hates me, and where people can't seem to manage keeping NSFW in NSFW chats.

Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian, we both love seafood, this should have been totally okay.

Somehow, for some reason, when I came home from work to grab myself something for lunch and he showed me the paper bag with a live lobster in it in the fridge something about my feelings just totally changed. This is so fucked up. There's a living animal in a bag in my fridge. Fucking defenseless, claws banded shut, can't move... I think they like the dark and cold but this is just so fucking messed up to me all of a sudden. We're going to kill him in less than 24 hours. What the fuck.

I've always had issues with the meat industry and try not to eat too much meat and buy from the most ethical sources but oh my fucking god for some reason the idea of actually doing the killing is messing with me. Or my roommate doing it. I don't know why. I don't know what to do.

My roommate apologized for not asking me first but I told him it's not his fault and I'm shocked by my feelings too. We have about 23 hours max from now to decide what to do with the lobster. The grocery store won't take him back. I really don't think we can deal with a pet lobster right now. Our neighbors might want him but idk if that would even really make me feel better and my roommate doesn't really want to be down like 40 bucks. We can't release him.

904,"My sister and I (18F) are 9.5 apart (I'm older). I remember begging my mom to give me a little sister, and I was so excited when she was born. There weren't any problems when we were both younger, because obviously she hadn't learned to walk/talk yet and I was still in the novelty phase of having a baby sister to take care of. But as she and I both started getting older we would get into a lot more conflicts. I quickly learned that our personalities are entirely different. She's much more high-strung and particular about things going a specific way and would cry if something wouldn't go the way she expected it to. It was hard to play with her because she wanted things to go a specific way, and I would want to deviate from it. We also have incredibly different communication styles, which makes it hard to get along. I began to have a really hard time coming to compromises with her, especially since she would want to follow me around everywhere and copy everything I wanted to do when I just wanted to be left alone. My mom also favors my little sister and always takes her side because my mom is also the younger sibling and got pushed around by her older sister (my aunt), so whenever something happens where my sister wants to do something with me, she would typically get her way. 

I can't say anything to my mom about it because, as an Asian parent, she doesn't take what I say into consideration, and also since she was the younger child she babies my sister. I feel incredibly frustrated because I don't feel like my voice is ever heard, and I can't talk about it to anyone. Conversations about my sister and I not getting along typically end with ""she's your sister, you need to be nice to her"" without any actual tips on what we can do to have a healthier relationship. When I went off to college I did not miss being with my sister at all (this is also because I was so ready to get out of my parents' house and I did not feel homesick for my family once while I was away because I felt incredibly smothered by my overbearing family). I love her, but it's a detached sort of familial love. Because we are nearly a decade apart in age, we have nothing in common. She is going through the elementary school phase where she talks back and makes necessary remarks about things, or uses overly dramatic expressions she learned from books or movies to annoy me. When I am at home I really want alone time but I am interrupted from studying/reading/watching movies by my sister, who wants to play with me all the time. I feel incredibly guilty because she seems to love me much more than I love her back. I don't want to have a negative relationship with her, but there are times where all I want is to be alone and I can't stand her. When I do spend time with her I try to remind myself to be patient, but I have a really hard time being patient with her because she is 9 and has so many things she doesn't understand, and I don't have the patience to explain everything to her. She can also be disrespectful and childishly arrogant - when I talk to her she'll make flippant remarks or act like she isn't listening to me. She might have learned that from me, so I don't think it's something that will change until I do. I don't know what to do. I want to have a healthy relationship with her but at the moment I feel like I'm waiting until she's older, like in her teens, because I feel like she will be more independent and less clingy and we will have more things in common to talk about.  


When I am angry I sometimes lose my temper and I think she is afraid of setting me off. She is afraid of confronting me about things because I can be quite brusque towards her, and don't have the patience to have a rational conversation (definitely learned that from our mom - she never lets either of us have a say in anything because she always needs to be right). I also feel incredibly guilty for being a bad sister to her, because I was the one who wanted a little sister in the first place.

Now that I am in quarantine with my family and I won't be going back to college until the fall I really feel I should improve my relationship with my sister, but I don't know where to start, especially with a lack of support in my parents to act as mediators in our relationship. I feel like my mom has unresolved inner conflicts about her relationship with her sister and all of her desires for her sister to get along with her have been pushed onto me, but because her conflicts hadn't been solved, she doesn't know how to parent siblings either. When I try to play with my sister some activities, like being active and outside, work well, but board games and card games do not. I feel like I have unresolved only child syndrome issues as well. I feel unnecessarily competitive towards her in certain games, and I also feel like she is very prideful and would have an inflated ego if she got her way all the time. I have a hard time letting her have her way because it irritates me when she looks so pleased with herself and struts - literally struts - around the house.

Though the problem I keep running into is constant fights where they justify being rude, I've also been physically abused growing up, have gotten punched in the face recently by them for trying to defend my personal property so it doesn't get damaged, along with constantly being told that my opinion doesn't matter or that I'm lying about pain/physical limitations.

I deal with severe arthritis in both feet that limit me to the point that even a 4 hour day at a retail job absolutely kills me, along with severe double curve scoliosis that has made one lung smaller than normal. With the scoliosis, carrying heavy things is a huge no no for me.

I keep having people tell me that packing up one of my bicycles and leaving is the worst idea ever. I just don't see an alternative since I've never seen any other viable option due to not having a full time job to afford getting my own place.

Since lockdown began, our family dress code around the house has been somewhat relaxed. We generally walk around in sleepwear now and, sure, it‚Äôs great to be cosy and stuff but I feel like my brother has become a bit TOO cosy.

913,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*This is a long messy post with adult content and some graphic writing etc and maybe some triggers in here for people too\*\*\*

I'm a gay male in my early 30's and...I actually feel like I am on the edge of some sort of breakdown and feel all over the place so this post will hopefully make some sense but I just need to get this out....

Two nights ago I ended up going to shop to get food, a guy outside asked me if I wanted some coke, to buy it, I was a little tipsy and he offered me a bit there to see if I liked it and then said it was only around the corner to get the bag. Turned out he was homeless and we went back to his tent where there was some other homeless people and they tried sorting out the coke etc and one point offered me to buy crack cocaine....but still no sign of either. So me and the guy did a couple more lines from bag he had there. 

The guy - call him 'Ted' - Ted showed me articles about him online....that basically read that he was arrested for being quite aggressive etc, had been in army and suffered bipolar, schizophrenia and some other issues. He was straight - but very high on coke and whiskey etc. He wanted me to suck him off which I did - but then started to freak a little when he proceeded to enter the top of the whiskey bottle up my anus. I told him I better head off and he just kept sayin ""make me cum ya prick then ya can go"" and so I kept trying etc but was quite freaked at this point and then was scared if he came that he would freak out completely. 

Anyways, he did not cum thankfully - and all in all - the whole sexual side of things prob only went on for 15 minutes..... 

Then he said we had to walk up to this house somewhere to get the crack....he had 90e of mine and so I tried to go with him but then just decided to leave it....to just get away and head home. Which I did. He took my number but never heard anything. I saw him around town today when I went in...but did not speak with him or him me....not sure if he noticed me....but I made sure to try avoid him

Anyways...this happened on a background of this:

I've gotten addicted to a thing called ""Faggot Exposure"" and I am really freaked out. Over the lat 2 years I have gotten more and more deeper into this whole thing. Basically it involves me sending humiliating pics and vids of myself to men on kik (Alpha male for fag groups etc) and then they expose the pics with other men, groups on kik, online, twitter etc. Over the last 2 years I have send probably thousands of pics and vids, humiliating full faced etc etc...and it has worn me down and I think ive started to believe I am a worthless faggot etc.....how the fuck else would I have allowed this to happen??? 

And so there's that....and then just quickly;

I have basically been seeing a guy for 1 year, long story short, I fell for him, and am only realising now, how hard I have fallen for him. He doesn't love me - but knew I loved him, before I did even. And was happy to sleep with me and stuff and we became very entangled. He is 10 years older and pretty  narcissistic (admits it himself) and dark. and used me pretty much, he had his heart broken before me and did not want a relationship with anyone...but he was happy to use me.... ""cause I knew you were a sure thing"".... and he saw me falling for him and it got pretty toxic. I was a willing fool. And now he pulled away when the pandemic lockdown kicked in. He is happy to be friends...but omg my heart is broken and I feel so completely stupid  that he played me from start to finish. I wanted to walk away so many times but I couldn't. It had to be him that stopped it. And he said he did cause he saw how toxic it was and how unfair it was on me.

And the fucked up thing is all I want is for him help me and support me - I told him about it yesterday and today he texts to see how I am etc....but then I dont know what to say and he just called it ""how you feeling about your adventure?"" and a couple of meditations to do...he wont be there for me....and I get it....and its not his duty or responsibility...but I just feel so fuciing alone right now 

And then just.....

Im surrounded by narcisstic people and ...mostly codependent relations with older women who have addictions issues and want me to be there adopted son....genuinely lol....jesus christ

In the last few months I started experiencing ED issues too...on top of the viruses and cysts, I even got shingles at one point....I just feel so fucking not confident or sexy etc and worn down.....

Also I do have addiction issues and have been sexually abused etc when was 14....come from a broken home bla bla bla....been in treatment, counselling etc etc.....

I had a couple years sober at 23, went back out.got sober for another couple years...and started drinking again 7 months ago.....and nothing to mad or major happened until two nights ago....and I dont know what to think or do or say or how to react....

&amp;#x200B;

Three or so years ago I ended up ruining my life by getting kicked off an island after a 3 week bender with a guy who i thought i loved and he loved me. Everyone warned me about him etc and he was also violent and even though was straight....we were in love but didnt have sex....but arghhh....i dont know. I was kicked off the island after we broke into houses for more booze. it was horrifric and traumatising...it was like a witch hunt. I was arrrested and in court and put on probation for 3 years. He went to prison for a year.

I had to move and leave obviously and change my life and getting sober again....and i just have felt so lost and depressed since. I dont know who i am and this last three years been working in a call centre after completing art college and hating it, struggling to make any fucing art...feeling like my soul will never come back.... living in depressing shit holes....no real friendships I can rely on....dont live near family etc...

&amp;#x200B;

A few months back tho I did move to cool place with two others....but it has been chaotic to say the least and cant even explain really...but yea.....its not a shithole least...and they are trying to get to know me and know whats going on with me....cause they can tell something is up....but I just put a fucking smile on all the time and keep people out....i never really let anyone in......especially over last few years

And with the pandemic and lockdown etc....and feeling like i am....everything just is all fucked up and weird and unknown 

I feel so fucking broken

And the only reason I wrote everything out is because all of it is whirling through my mind. My whole stupid fucked up life....I was abused, dropped out of school bla ba....and here I am 17/18 years later sucking off a homeless guy with a whiskey bottle up my ass high on coke as he calls me a prick thinking he could flip out and beat me up if dont make he cum.....or he does cum???? 

How am I to face myself and move forward from here? and not just in terms of the homeless guy thing....that on its own I could deal with.....but on top of everything else it really feels like the straw that is breaking the camels back.....its tipping me over the edge.....I actually feel like I am on a slow descent into madness....and I don;t know how to just simply fucking get my shit together.....there is no will, drive, passion, soul or lust for life to actually fucking drive me......I actually feel fucking broken and wasted and just so fucking  lifeless and numb and dead inside....jesus fucking christ......

If anyone has made it this far.....you poor soul lol....am sorry.....

If anyone has anything to say....please......thank you x",04May2020,1
914,"  I ask myself that constantly, and I need help, tools, guidance, reflection - something. 

Warning: This post requires a bit of reading. If you read it though, please post your relevant thoughts below. I really need your help and it truly means something to me if you give can try and give me your opinion. 

I hope that people will not read this and interpret it as a sob story. I have gotten enough pity from others throughout my life and it is not what I am looking for - I don't like pity. I will tell you about my background, more so that you might be able to better form a correct opinion about me and a more fitting suggestion for me by getting an understanding of who I am and what I come from. I *will*, therefore, describe things that to some may seem irrelevant, but my objective is to give you a deeper understanding of the life I come from and my character so that your advice may reveal something of relevance to the character that I am - and about my future. If not that, then it's a little story. 

I was removed from my home and placed in a foster family when I was 3 years old. My mother and her - at the time - boyfriend were heroin-addicts and I am still to some extent affected by abuse from that time and I remember it vividly (getting severely beat, witnessing the abuse of my mother, getting forced into ice-cold water, walking the streets alone and being home alone, etc.). I also remember when they (authorities) came to physically remove me. I guess that is pretty much what it feels like to be forcefully kidnapped. I was in that foster family for around 2 years and moved back with my - at the time - now clean and single mother. She had different boyfriends throughout some years as well as a lot of relapses. Overall, the years after my first foster family was really chaotic and uncomfortable and pretty much all (except maybe one) of the men in my life were pretty much all abusive and kind of twisted (My biological father is a murderer, two of my - later - stepdads also did time for homicide and double homicide - to give you an idea). I did not really attend school and when I did, I could not concentrate or I was mentally absent. School teachers were usually at my throat for not concentrating and the good old ""you won't amount to nothing"" was something I heard quite often. Sometimes I would live with my - at the time - current stepdad while my mom was gone for one reason or another for periods of days and up to months, and at other times, I would visit my mom at a treatment facility or live with her alone. We moved a lot (At the time of writing this I've had around 40 addresses) and I've attended probably way over 10 different schools. Drugs - needless to say - was a regular thing that ""we"" had to get, which I saw being used often, and I remember when I was around 7-8 years old I experienced my first room-high from heroin (was in a car full of heroin-smoke). This lifestyle went on for years, and long story short, when I was about 10-11 years old, after my mom's biggest and most lengthy relapse, my mom and my stepdad at the time got a divorce and I moved with my mom. She was clean and sober for a short while but it did not last long. At this point in time, my mom had quickly, once again, basically turned into a prostituted drug addict and single mom. The police came and smashed our door in because ""we"" hid a wanted dude for some weeks in our apartment. Everything was a mess and there were literally used syringes and streaks of blood everywhere in the apartment, no food, and the apartment looked like a dumpster. I have a sister and at this time she was about 2 years old and she lived with her dad - one of my earlier stepdads but my mom had her one weekend every month. One time when we had her over my mom went to the ""store"". She didn't come back for days. After a day or so, my sister kept screaming and I couldn't comfort her. There was no food, I had no money and this was before everyone could afford cell phones and it was in the middle of the night. I was around 11 years old, walking the streets of my city at 3 am with my screaming 2-year-old sister, trying to find a cab to get her to safety. I found one. I couldn't pay him for the ride, but we drove to a relative of mine where I left my sister (in good hands). My mom would eventually come back. One time when I came home to the apartment the door was open and I found her on the floor unrecognizable getting beat, and with all her fingers broken. I remember begging my mom to buy me a 70$ skateboard (which wouldn't even get you a quality skateboard). I got a 20$ skateboard and later learned that she had spent around 6000$ on cocaine in a single transaction around the same time - I am still pissed off about that to this day. One day I was downtown with my mom and we were heading home. She told me she had to go pay back some money she owed and that I could just take the bus home and so I did. She never came back home. The first couple of days it was that kind of familiar experience. But days turned into weeks and after some weeks the electricity supply was turned off. Then the water supply was turned off. One time (fortunately while I wasn't home) the apartment was broken into and everything worth anything (like my cd's or ps1) was stolen and madrassas/pillows were cut open, every piece of furniture was turned upside down and it was left in more of a mess than it was before. Today there are not many phone booths or coin-payment-devices like it, but well into my adulthood, I would still automatically check for coins in such devices because that was what I did to survive. I also collected empty bottles (stores pay you a very, very small amount of money empty bottles where I am from) and I stole food. Mostly I ate cup noodles, because they were really cheap, although I couldn't get any water for them (I ate them dry). Needless to say, I did not attend school at all during this period. I spend most of my time looking for my mom and I first began looking in areas where I knew drug dealers were located but to no avail. I quickly hereafter started looking for her (corpse) near riverbanks and in the harbor area (which were close to where our apartment was) - every day. After a good while, social authorities became aware of my situation because a relative who had met me contacted them. Some weeks later I was placed in my second foster family. My - at the time - new foster parents were religious fundamentalists, and I was not a fan of their ruleset. In fact, I, more or less consciously, declared war on any kind of authority (adults, teachers, bigger kids, etc.). I began late-year in 5th grade, and I was one of those kids who went to smoke some ""secret"" place during the breaks. I started cutting myself every evening and I ""stitched"" myself back up with sewing thread and needles that I stole from my foster parents. This just gave some odd relief. One of my classmates had a dad who grew his own marijuana. We stole that and smoked that too. I remember hanging out with people well into their 20's and smoking on their bong. I would drink beers (even though I kind of hated it) after school while we were skateboarding and sometimes I would get punished by my religious foster parents. They once drove me to the ""beer bench"" of the city where local alcoholics would hang out and then would tell me to get out, and then drive off. If I didn't clean up my room properly they would dump bags full of trash all over my room floor and smack the door behind them. If I held the cutlery wrong they would pick on me. I hated them so much and refused to abide by their ""laws"". If they forbade smoking, I would go in front of the house and start chainsmoking and if they confiscated my ""satanic music"" I would find some other way to protest. I did *not* want to be there and I fled a few times, but I would always end up back at their place with a reprimand about how I was the bad company for even the ""worldly children"". A social worker occasionally came to see to me, but at the time, my foster parents were just verbally superior to me and even though I remember explicitly saying ""I do not want to be here"" it was not heard by the social authorities. I guess I was sort of what you would consider disturbed - cutting my self, smoking, etc. - but I started to act slightly more crazy than I actually was, which was actually kind of hard. But it was a sort of ""fake it 'till you make it""-thing with a more or less conscious effort to get away from there. I met a new friend on a skate spot one time and he was placed in some institution. I was fascinated by how free he was to do pretty much anything he wanted without much consequence and I quickly understood, based on stories, that the kids from that institution were pretty messed up. My foster parents eventually made some inquiries to the social authorities about my behavior and the authorities ended up sending me in an analysis at a psychologist's practice. I still had some childish naivety and was afraid that the psychologist could tell if I lied, so I told her stuff out of context like ""I see silhouettes of people and blood on the floor every night when it gets dark"" and corny stuff like that - which was technically true because I did cut myself every night and there was a big piece of artwork hanging next to my room-door, which had human figures in it. Shortly after, I was declared psychotic by that psychologist (I later have seen the paperwork) and was placed in the third foster family (I am around 13 years old here) - just to be clear, I was *not* psychotic. These guys (new foster parents) were probably the only good thing that ever happened to me during my upbringing, and they may be the reason (spoiler alert) why this story won't end as tragic as it could have or that I am even here to tell it and ask you guys for advice. Everything was still kind of shit, except my relation to my foster parents - they were kind of passive and somehow, some way, I never even had an argument with them, even though I was smoking 20 cigarettes a day, I was (secretly) smoking marijuana, I was drinking every weekend pretty much, I was getting in fights (mostly getting beat up for picking unwinnable fights) at school and I was still cutting myself. But somehow, I remember the time as sort of good. Here I had also re-established contact with my biological father, and he did not want me to be in a foster family - instead, he wanted me to live with him. He was a pretty high-status gang-figure and, as mentioned, which would come into play later. At the time around being placed in my second foster family, I literally considered my mom as dead, but time would show that she was not. When I had been placed in my third family she went into recovery and became clean. So at around 14 years of age, I moved back home with her. She kept clean, actually, but it was too late for our relationship to be fixed and I basically hated her. She was also still pretty messed up even though she was clean. Her boyfriends were pieces of shits that I could not stand and I always had to defend her - one of the situations standing out to me, is when I ""had to"" defend her with a kitchen knife from one of her bad-shit-crazy, double-homicide-sociopath, scum-of-the earth-boyfriends. I started doing harder drugs more frequently and I was also getting involved in fights more frequently. I almost didn't attend school and I failed (surprise) almost every exam by the end of elementary school. I started coming more and more at my father's home. After elementary school, around 15-16 years old, I started dealing drugs and was responsible for some small street-operation controlled by higher status figures (like my dad). It was me being sort of educated, I guess. Having a really, really, hard time dealing with authorities and hierarchies (at least if I'm not up there), I eventually left that operation. Also, I was kind of being a scum myself, but I just could not stand these people. I would get beat up out in town and they would promise to ""avenge me"" but never really did and at the same time, they demanded unreasonable loyalty. A couple of these guys I knew from this period got stabbed (one dead on the spot) and many of my close relatives on my fathers' side are still involved. I tried to get a regular job at a sandwich bar. ""Normal"" social conduct confused me (still somewhat to this day), stressed me out, and I hated the labor. I felt, and still feel really insecure and uncomfortable around ""ordinary people"" whatever that means. This is me at 18 years old attempting to maintain a job, a girlfriend, and a future in alignment with societal expectations (but still with a substance and steroid problem). I dreaded these minimum-wage jobs so much and I could not really keep one for more than a few months at a time. I tried starting on some IT-related education. Mainly because it didn't really require anything to apply. I failed because I simply had no discipline to keep up and I wasn't really interested in it to be fair. I did apply for it like 3 times though. I dropped out within weeks all 3 times. I felt like I was bad at everything except destruction and downfall. Often, I was on some sort of welfare or attempted to keep a job for a while. My substance abuse got worse over the next few years and most of the time I did some drug every day, except short periods where I would half-heartedly attempt to set myself straight without the willingness to go all the way (""I'll stop smoking in the weekdays"", ""I will only drink alcohol with friends"", ""I will only sell it"", ""once a month"", ""No hallucinogens"", ""only steroids and training"" etc. etc.). Usually, these attempts were also fueled by a desire to meet some expectations from a present girlfriend, but that was just never sufficient to keep me out of the woods. It got worse and worse and in my early twenties, I was pretty messed up, paranoid, with pretty severe PTSD, non-existent self-esteem, or self-belief. I basically decided, that there was no reason to stick around for long and that I was going to go out with a ""bang"". When you make such a decision, you remove all limits and most responsibility that you can think of. It is to embrace nihilism. If nothing matters, then you might as well go for whatever you want to go for and risk ending up in jail, do as many drugs as you want because death is pretty much what you expect, or even hope for, anyway. Risk being stabbed, risk ending in a situation where you have to stab someone or similar (My roommate and ""friend"" at the time actually ended up being stabbed 8 times in a parking lot - we did cocaine and hung out with some girls together the day after he got stitched back up). When I was 23 years old, I woke up on the floor of my one-room flat. I woke up on the floor because I literally had no bed and the place looked like a dumpster, just like how it looked like when I was at home as a child. My friend (the survivor from the stabbing) was also there and I could suddenly see him from this completely new perspective - like a drug addict - and a few seconds later I realized I was just like him. There were syringes on the floor (from steroid use), trash everywhere, everything had been used as an ashtray, a familiar, dirty and grim atmosphere - movie-material. I had a complete psychological meltdown over the realization that I had ended up just like my mom, and more importantly that I had treated myself how she had treated me, and even more importantly, that I was going to pass this on if I ever had a kid (and my serotonin and dopamine-levels were probably also slightly off-balance). That feeling was unbearable to me, and as soon as my friend had left the place, I picked up a knife and slit my wrist. Some minutes later my friend was back because he had forgotten something. He rushed me to the hospital. Apparently, my cuts were not very ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù. I was committed to a psychiatric facility the same night. (Side note: my mentioned ""friend"" was no cool guy, and he did not rush me to the hospital because he was a decent empathic person or a good friend. He was a completely deranged psychopath (literally), who was afraid to lose company fucked up enough to hang out with him). During my time at the psychiatric facility, I was faced with the reality that I could not stand being me but, apparently, could not even kill me either. So, I decided that it would end there - that my social heritage would change there, starting with myself. After my stay at the psychiatric facility, I basically turned my back on everything and everyone I had ever known (with a very few exceptions) and I had a shopping bag with some extra pieces of clothes in it - that is it. I remember the last time I did drugs. I was disgusted by the high I got and was just waiting for it to wear off. I started attending 12-step meetings and quickly began their program. I was occupying the couches of my friends/relatives for the first few months. I got a night shift job, which I totally hated, and which wasn't too compatible with my PTSD, and I was just waiting for everything to start falling apart. I started going through a therapeutic process and face the mountain of shit behind me and attempted - whole-heartedly - to change to the best of my ability. I was just waiting for my relapse, to fall for some provocation on the street, to get fired or go to jail (I had a pending case but was not convicted yet). Days turned into weeks, which turned into months, which turned into my first year clean and sober, without being in a fight, without being in the criminal environment, and with a job (that I admittedly hated). I still felt very, very confused, and unfulfilled. Was this job the ""reward"" of all my effort? Was this it? I felt so misplaced and alienated from normal social conduct and I had this feeling of being a little boy around ""normal"" people. I have a sort of social anxiety today because I feel so insecure around others. Suddenly, a girl I was seeing around the time found out she was pregnant and it was mine. Long story short, we moved in together during her pregnancy. My (ONLY REAL) friend from way back, had gotten back in touch with me because he had noticed that I had started to take my life in a more sustainable direction. He encouraged me to start going for an education. Having failed all the way through elementary school and not having any prospects of completing high school, I thought it was a pretty silly idea - but after a while, a lot of encouragement, and too long with my shitty night-shift job, I just realized that a job like that would never ever make me happy to get up in the morning and that I could never experience being proud of myself with the kinds of jobs you can expect to get as an unskilled worker. I decided to take courses for almost 4 years, starting with 8th-grade courses. At this point, I had also sought out everyone I had wronged throughout the years and offered to make it up to them although some did not want to meet up. I even apologized to my mom for the times I had wronged her. Something needed to happen, so I began in school (25 years old). I set myself a kind of unrealistic goal because unrelatable Hollywood culture had at least taught me stuff like ""aim for the stars"" etc. Whatever. I was going to aim for the education requiring the highest average grade point at the most prestigious university in the country - mainly because I was told my entire childhood that I would not amount to anything - if not explicitly - then implicitly through the lack of effort or belief in me. The idea of proving them wrong made me smile a little bit because it would be so poetically just. I had trouble with discipline, doing homework, and I was absent from classes around 40% of the time. I received a lot of ""warning, you will get kicked out""-letters for it, and before an exam, I would totally panic-study 30 hours before the exam and basically try to compensate for a whole year's lack of effort. The first exam I attended, which was my worst nightmare (mathematics) got me a grade 12 (equivalent of A+). I was kind of shocked, to be honest, but assured my self that I was lucky and that the 8th grade-level was the reason. First-year passed and I literally completed the elementary school-level, exclusively with A+ grades. Whatever just elementary school. I don't know, I found some of the courses slightly challenging. The high-school level of courses began, and it was basically the same story over again. 40% absence in all courses, didn't really study sufficiently, didn't do any proper homework, and panicked two days before exams. I was certain, that I was going to fail most of the tests. I completed the year with only A+'s and A's. Fast forward to my last and (I think) 23rd exam after 4 years. I finished high school with an average point grade of A (or specifically 11,7). That same year, the highest required average grade among all educations across all universities in the entire country was 11,7 (1: psychology 11,7 and 2: medicine, 11,5 and 3: insurance-maths 11,2). Soon, I will arrive at the point of all this, and at my question.   
 Today, just short of 6 years with my ‚Äúnew‚Äù life and after performing only on sheer willpower, I am now at a point, where I must choose a step in a direction - one that is in alignment with who I am and what I like. This is where I need your help. How do you find out, what you like? How do you make a decision?   
 In my short new life, I have found out that I find significant therapeutic value in painting and that it is one of the only non-destructive things I have ever experienced enjoying (although I can also enjoy video games but doubt I‚Äôll make a career out of it). I know that I am interested in being creative/innovative - but painting portraits and educations within the arts are, so lousy paid. You might say that money isn‚Äôt everything. I know that, but it is something, especially when you come from a place where you had to look for spare coins in phone booths in order to get something to eat. It is something if you want to make a symbolic statement. It is something if you want to have a good time, pay off all your debt, and give your children a childhood you could only have dreamt of. Therefore, painting, unless extremely lucky to rise to Van Gogh-status, is not the path that can support my vision. But money is only a part of it. It \[occupation\] must be something that I can wake up and welcome - at least half of the time. I originally intended to apply for psychology, but I am more interested in the human being as a creature and the big questions related to this than I am in the divorce histories of people sitting across from me in a chair. My fear is that psychology will be too theoretically boring and.. too ‚Äúbasic‚Äù and passive in its methods (for example in a clinical situation). I just cba reading day in day out about things like Pavlov‚Äôs dogs and then ending up in a chair across from someone several years later nodding as a service at a slightly high fee, at everything they say for an hour so that I can take their money and make them feel like someone care, when in fact nobody DOES anything. Catch my drift? I don‚Äôt know, maybe it‚Äôs completely different.   
 The only thing that I am aware of that I find truly, truly interesting and sophisticated within psychology is depth-psychology, which is like 5% of the entire education.   
 With medicine, I am afraid that it is too technical about things that do not interest me.   
 The thing is. I don‚Äôt really know what interests me. I have no idea who I am deep down, really. I know what I am no more, but what I am replaced by - not so much. I know that I have an analytical mind, that mathematics scared me and still do but that I am decent at it. But it makes me feel stupid, a feeling familiar to me, that I do not like experiencing. It worsens my social anxiety because I‚Äôm afraid to say something stupid or to momentarily blackout intellectually (which often happens when I am dealing with maths). However, I find stuff like mathematical psychology or trying to describe consciousness through math, or modeling broker-decisions to predict share prices in the stock market interesting enough to spontaneously catch myself thinking about solutions to crack it - as well as similar and other things. I tried computer science and that was awful for me. No spark whatsoever. No idea why - I simply can not identify the root cause of a feel-good or feel-bad experience. It is like some sort of, probably quite literally, dissociative state. Now it is soon time for me to decide and I have been in this existential crisis for a couple of years now, and I can almost not stand it anymore. I need direction, I need peace of mind, I need to be able to orient myself towards a goal, I need meaning, I need a reason. I need it to make sense that I am even here.   
 

What should a person like me do?   
 How do you live life with a sense of meaning and how do you experience being satisfied with yourself - you specifically?  
 Should you give an intuitive suggestion for me in regard to my career moving forward what would it be?  
 If you have something on your mind like ‚Äúhe should try this or that‚Äù please do tell me about it.  
 What do you think I could be decent at now that you know a lot of things about me and what I come from?  
 Do you know anything of relevance in regard to the study of medicine and psychology that I might want to know?

928,"Hey everyone, lately I‚Äôve been struggling with planning out my future and I‚Äôm turning to Reddit for some advice. I‚Äôm currently 17 (almost 18) and in my last year of high school. My dream goal is to become an airline pilot. I‚Äôve been an Air Cadet (youth organization in Canada with a military aviation focus) for the past 5 years and last summer received my glider pilot license. This year I received a private pilot scholarship but it was cancelled due to COVID-19. For years I‚Äôve always told me parents that I wanted to join the Air Force as a pilot after high school and they‚Äôve been quite proud of my decision.

Lately though I‚Äôve begun looking into pilot training at a civilian college/university and after months of research I‚Äôve made the decision that I‚Äôd like to do training this way instead. I have a lot of concerns about joining the military but I won‚Äôt go into them too much. I‚Äôve weighed out the pros and cons of each and I‚Äôve ultimately decided what I want to do.  

The only issue is my parents. My mom takes the time to help me look at other options besides the Air Force (while still swaying me in that direction) but my dad practically insists that I join. He‚Äôs not once even asked about another option, it‚Äôs been military or bust. He says that the decision is up to me but it sure doesn‚Äôt feel that way considering the last time I had a discussion about it he got so fed up at me and my mom for ‚Äúhaving a conversation over nothing‚Äù that he walked out on us and was gone for an hour or so. I felt and still feel like a failure if I don‚Äôt join. I feel like I‚Äôm obligated to join to please my parents but it‚Äôs not what I want to do. 

They insist that it‚Äôs the opportunity of a lifetime to graduate with no debt and an almost guaranteed ticket into the big airlines after my time is up, however after spending 5 years in a semi-military environment at cadets I‚Äôve decided that the forces aren‚Äôt really for me. I‚Äôve gotten a lot out of the program and I wouldn‚Äôt trade my experience for the world but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd want to do in the future. 

I‚Äôve heard military members say not to join for the money, only join if it‚Äôs something you really want because you‚Äôll be sacrificing your personal, family, and social life in exchange for free tuition. Well, I really don‚Äôt want to do it. I want to fly but not this way. I was so upset after the incident with my dad that I basically made up that I suddenly wanted to join up again so he‚Äôd be proud of me. My family is deeply conservative and my dad is a police officer which doesn‚Äôt make this much better. (He once had dreams of joining the army he told me)

My main question is, how can I talk to my parents so they understand and not feel like I‚Äôm going against their will? I feel stuck in this position where it‚Äôs either let down my parents or let down myself. I‚Äôve had a lot of friends from the cadet program have the exact same debate over military vs civilian flight training and they all chose civilian. One of my friends who wanted to join the military for years decided last minute it wasn‚Äôt for him and now is happily enrolled in a program at Seneca college. 

Any advice on how to talk to my parents so they understand is much appreciated.

Ive known this girl for years. Weve been very close friends for a long time, and always talked a lot. I always helped her through everything but she made me feel like absolute shit. She made me hate myself, and at that time i was already very fucking sad and suicidal (im okay and safe now, its been years since that time). She constantly made me feel like a burden and like i meant nothing but we were such close friends i wouldnt let myself believe that she was in the wrong. She would ignore me for very long amounts of time but would get angry if i didnt want to speak to her anymore(for obvious reasons). I felt like i had to make her happy no matter what.

She would ignore me and make me feel stupid but without saying it directly. I thought it was okay because of the ""i love you"" she would send me every now and then. She made my friends hate me, and her friends hate me. Its like that tiny bit of reassurence she would give me after making me look stupid to other people made it okay to me. 

She literally made me feel so sad all the time, and confused. She made me believe everything she said to me, which were NOT good things. Everything shes done i was convinced was okay. I put up with this for so long and i even stopped myself from hurting myself or feeling that way at all without her. It was so clear that she wasnt good for me and i didnt need her but i didnt look at them. I didnt want to believe what she was doing to me. 

After putting up with it for so long, i finally decided that i was strong enough to tell her that i fucking hate her. That i want her to leave me alone and to stay out of my life. But she left. Shes completely stopped talking to me. Shes talking to all of my friends, and still active on social media and checking mine but she wont talk to me. Not for about a month.

Im very happy that shes gone. I dont have to feel the same way she made me feel. Its lockdown so i wont see her for a while. But im still sad. I never got the chance to tell her how i feel. After years of bringing myself to finally tell her to fuck off, i cant. I literally want her to message me just so i can say something. I feel like screaming at her. Its been a month after shes left but i feel like she got away with it all so i cant just forget it.

Im scared that if she does message me then im just going to fall right back into that trap and shell make me feel bad again. Everytime ive decided that shes not good for me shes changed my mind and made me feel like im the problem, and then it would happen all carry on for like a year. I cant do that again.

I also see it with every social circle I'm in, that the people around me find minuscule things funny and entertaining, while I literally sit there not feeling anything. I guess my humore is more crass and edgy and their casual conversation topics don't hit it for me either. My best friends are highly extroverted, highly expressive, spontaneous people. Everyone else kind of bores me and my friendship with them dies easily. I'm not addicted to substances. I also sleep like shit.

937," Two months ago I began working independently as a nanny for a family in a wealthy neighborhood. Im a white female.

They are a married couple with two toddlers, and they're both Princeton graduates.

I have never felt such a social disconnect with people in my entire life.

A month or so ago she was sun burnt and I mentioned that I burn really badly too, then she starts saying ""Isn't it crazy how the people with the most sensitive, pastiest skin are the ones that somehow came into power"" I didn't think too much of it - just that it was odd.

Fast forward to yesterday - We were talking about COVID-19 again, and she starts transitioning the conversation by going ""The thing is, history has 6 sides to every story and there just *is no* right or wrong. People want to say something is either good or bad, and that's just not how it is. ***Slavery for example!*** *Slavery in history is very one sided*. *Sure slavery was bad for black people, but for white people it was great and it made a lot of sense at the time!* ***That doesn't mean slaveowners were bad people, that's just how things happened at the time.""***

If you're losing your mind - don't worry, it gets worse.

She then proceeds to connect slavery and PETA. Yes - People for the Ethical Treatment of **Animals.**

Her:""There are people right now, like PETA, saying that eating animals is immoral while most people think its okay- its the same thing""

This was when I couldnt help but to interject with ""WOAH Thats a pretty far leap to make!"" and she just doubled down on her BS.

She goes on to say ""There are people that think *animals* should be treated with the same rights as humans \*rolls eyes\*""

I ended the conversation pretty abruptly -luckily it was time for me to leave anyway.

After this conversation I am seeing that its not just a difference in opinion-its a difference in values. I am 100% sure there is no gray area when it comes to slavery, and her reasoning for making a connection between COVID-19, SLAVERY, and PETA, was that ***everything*** **has a gray area and there is no good or bad.**

Holy shit, right?!

I am not comfortable with helping to raise her kids with such opposite values. I could probably continue being their nanny, drop the subject and never hear about it again. However, she also seems to pull the topic out of thin air. I feel that not speaking up is just as bad as agreeing with her. If anything, now I feel that I **have** to say something because she is spewing this venom around her kids, who are being taught to do whatever it takes to be on top, including enslaving human beings for profit.

There is no human resources - I work for these two people in their home. I feel pretty trapped. I cant afford to lose this job with how uncertain the economy is right now, but feel that is also a selfish way to think when it comes to the greater good of the world.

When we started talking and when we went out on a date and started getting closer it was like I was in the best period of my life, I was on cloud 9 and I couldn't believe I was talking to her.

But gaming takes a lot of time and i wont be able to keep this hobby in the future and i accept this.
The problem is that right now, i haven't found yet with what i want to replace gaming with !

I know this takes time but trying to resolve both problems at the same time is tough.

I know i should be resolving one at a time but i feel like they both can't wait since they are so present in my everyday life.

I plan on seeing a therapist soon.

What was your experience like when you first stepped in the professional world and how did you cope with the stress, anxiety and life issues ?",04May2020,1
949,I (18 F) have a rocky relationship with my parents. My dad is mentally degrading and my mom is scared of him and will sometimes go along with him. I have a pretty decent job and calculated that I can afford to live on my own and have some insurance. I have to get out of that house. But here‚Äôs the catch. I ask for my bank account info and I asked if I can start paying for my own car insurance. They won‚Äôt let me have access to anything. They won‚Äôt let me have the responsibility of paying for my own things. They even put a tracker on my phone which I deleted and took myself off as a way of standing up for myself. My friend and I were talking as well and decided we both could split rent for an apartment. I need advice on how I can tell my parents that I‚Äôm moving out. I‚Äôm done with their bullshit.,04May2020,1
950,"Through most of my teenage years I was really depressed. Nothing specific made me sad, I was just miserable. When I was 16, I met a girl who really made me happy. We kind of dated for a few months and I felt completely fine, and right after my 17th birthday, things ended. I was depressed again for a while but eventually got over it. I got a good job, finally had a best friend, and had a plan for college. Everything seemed to be coming together. Now, right after my 18th birthday, I started feeling miserable. I thought it was just a one day thing from lack of sleep, but it‚Äôs getting worse. I‚Äôm miserable, I can‚Äôt sleep at night because I just feel like I‚Äôm in so much pain. I don‚Äôt like my life, I don‚Äôt want to be here. I wish I was just erased from everybody‚Äôs life. I thinks it started one night when the girl I was dating last year kind of came back into my life. I just keep waking up feeling empty and like I don‚Äôt serve a purpose. I‚Äôm not getting supported on my plan with college, there‚Äôs tension with every conversation I have with my parents, I miss that girl a lot, and I just feel flat out empty. I don‚Äôt even know what kind of advice I‚Äôm looking for. I guess I just wanted to rant to somebody. I‚Äôm tired of everything. I can‚Äôt get her out of my head. I wish things ended differently. We hate each other, and she was the only one who truly made an impact on my mental health. I don‚Äôt wanna feel this way anymore",04May2020,1

He tells me that it's because he wants to increase his followers but why her ? He knows what I have been through, why still follow her ?

I get that he is allowed to do whatever the heck he wants so I'm kinda conflicted right now. Should I tell him how I feel about this ?",04May2020,1

954,"I got a Associate degree in web design in 2006, got a job as a web design at a library in 2007 and I loved it. The place used older website coding which I had to learn. Since then they haven't really changed there coding. Having some down time I start helping with some makerspace (3d print, robots, etc.) stuff and I like making things for other to use in the library system. Come late 2019 they are planning on opening a makerspace so they change my job position, my new position takes nearly all the web stuff away from me, and adding doing public programing (i.e.. teaching people). I have no desire to teach people, hate being up in front of people I am very much a introvert, it terrify me to do public speaking. I have tried looking for a new web design job but nearly every one I find is using coding and technology I have never been expose too. Everything I really know is 20 years old at this point. I have been honest with my boss since before they changed my job that this wasn't something I wanted, but that didn't matter. I have told them I will do the job, but my boss is telling me if I am not 1000% behind this I should find another job. I am frustrated, I feel sick every time someone talk to me about doing some public program, and I feel like my boss wants to just leave if I am not happy. I feel like I am stuck being so far out of the loop with what current web design jobs need. If any one has any advise on what I should do I would appreciate.

TLDR: Job position was changed from a web design job to more of a teaching job that I never really wanted, I feel like I am too far behind in the current tech to get another web design job, since my current job used old tech. Not sure what to do.",04May2020,1

959,"English is not my first language

This guy and me met about 3 years back and had very good time together, he was very friendly maybe a lot, but I did not know he was under opiate effects.

He promised me the world in exchange to my friendship because he was high to the full, he made me do things for him in name of his sickness, he is also a chronic patient, he have lied me a lot and always promise me to send me money for the inconvenience.

Recently I have stopped to contact him, over a year, he keeps trying to reach me every 3 or 4 weeks, I reply ofc but is annoying me the fact he only does it when he gets his opiates.

I'm not more interested in his friendship, I have being ignoring him for the last year, but he keeps reaching, I feel an asshole because I ghost him.

My question is: do I keep ignoring him or I just tell him how I feel, the reality of his selfish addicted destructive behaviour destroying my will to keep being his friend.

Thank you",04May2020,1
960,"I (M20) have begun texting a long time crush of mine (4 years), and we started texting again because we are both moving out at the same time in the same building. I can't help but get my head spinning, and I am at a loss. She is a busy one and we only exhange 1-2 snaps pr. day. I had always wanted to confess to her but never had the guts when we went to the same classes (it would be too awkward), and after my long distance relationship with someone else didn't work out for the other part, I have a lot of excess emotions, which is storming in my head, and I am wondering if it would be a good time to try my luck? I feel like I have nothing to lose but a few heart skips a day when the reply comes.

962,"I'm a high school kid with anxiety (need to seriously cut down on the caffeine). One thing I notice about myself is that I tend to view things worse than they actually are. I realize this difference when I'm alone with my thoughts, and then when I talk to people, they give me a better, more realistic perspective. For example, a couple of months ago someone took a meme pic of me, which spread through a lot of people. I was embarrassed initially, before laughing it off and then forgetting about it. Others laughed at it for a day before forgetting about it too. It wasn't until the start of lockdown when I started to dwell on it. I was paranoid that I got bullied, but I asked around what the deal behind that meme pic was, and they all said the same thing: There was no meaning behind it, just a meme and a funny joke that died out. I have AP exams next week, and I'm batshit scared that I'm gonna fail them. However, logically speaking I can always take the later exam date (which would be a month from now), and I can utilise that month (which is a lot of time) to fully prepare and nail the tests. A few weeks ago, I felt like shit because I felt that I was the only one who slacked off, but when I asked around on Reddit I found out that everyone else, more or less, became lazy. I'm not crazy, but I feel that my brain makes stuff up and somehow convinces me that is the truth, instead of thinking logically. Advice?",04May2020,1

964," 

So I lost my job about a month and a half ago now &amp; I'm still struggling really bad to get over it.

This  was a job I put a ton of effort into because I was really enjoying it  &amp; since it's been gone I've really lost the motivation to do  anything &amp; I'm not sure how to pick myself back up now.

This  job was lost after helping to increase sales by 70% - my assumption is  that it was lost on the basis that I  was promised a bonus when I hit  certain targets &amp; after hitting them the company owner told me she  didn't want to pay it because it was too confusing to work out, so I  believe I was dropped to avoid having to pay any bonuses and it's really  depressing.

For the next month I  was getting a lack of communication &amp; having meetings avoided until  eventually I was let go out of nowhere - this was blamed on the corona  virus &amp; wanting to save on costs for the future.

Now the business never stopped running throughout the virus &amp; if anything they are probably doing better now than before.

I  was told the door was still open etc &amp; they would be in touch in a  few weeks, but never heard anything for like 7 weeks &amp; then I called  them out on getting rid of me to avoid paying the bonus &amp; the  response I got was that  it's my own interpretation of the situation and  she doesn't have to explain herself. (this is just a massive red flag  to me)

I was told just a few  months ago that they saw me as a great asset to the business so really  nothing adds up other than wanting to avoid paying the bonus.

How  do I move on from this? It's on my mind way too much &amp; it's pretty  clear the job is gone and I shouldn't want to work for somebody like  this.

I want to start my own business now but I simply can't find the motivation because this has really crushed me.

How  do I motivate myself to get started on the new business? I'm currently  just unemployed and I'm going to end up letting things get out of  control if I don't get out of this constant depressive state.

TLDR:

I  believe I was fired from a job to avoid paying a bonus to me that I  deserve &amp; now I'm really unmotivated &amp; feeling really down. I  need a way to motivate myself to start my own business before I let  things get out of control",04May2020,1
965,"Alright So I actually manage a small business where I meet a lot of people every day, but customers aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreally people‚Äù y‚Äôknow? I‚Äôm super nice and friendly with them but eventually I always get the feeling that they‚Äôre only here for their sandwich (duh).
Let me elaborate: There‚Äôs this woman who‚Äôs a regular, now I also know her son and his babysitter, I‚Äôm always nice to these people, and so one time she came in my store and I asked her how her day was going cause they always have these meaningless stories that I don‚Äôt mind hearing, cause I honestly care about my customers, well anyway I asked her how she was and she didn‚Äôt even say hi she just asked if we got soy milk or something?
Writing this makes me feel really stupid cause like what did I expect her to do, come in and ask me about my life?? 
But me asking her how she‚Äôs doing, and her answering by asking about soy milk and leaving without even saying alright thanks bye when I said we don‚Äôt... I dunno man it just made me feel really worthless, like I don‚Äôt REALLY care about this woman or how she sees or treats me, but she‚Äôs a regular who always tells me about her day, and realizing that to her, in all actuality, I am but a sandwich guy who doesn‚Äôt have a real personality, that really ruined my day.
That was a year ago.
I try to be more professional-friendly with customers now, opposed to casually-friendly, realizing that these people aren‚Äôt really my friends.
So as I said I meet a lot of people but my interaction with them is making them a sandwich and listening to what they have to say if they feel like sharing, but we‚Äôre not really friends obviously.
I had 2 female friends in university about seven or eight years ago and one time they surprised me at my work with balloons for my birthday and I get tears in my eyes every time I think about that day, cause like EVERYONE there saw them coming in singing my name, like that‚Äôs honestly one of the only times in my life I remember someone doing something nice for me that actually takes effort.
Now regarding relationships, my sister once told me about how she used to get really good coffee at this place until the guy making it tried hitting on her and she didn‚Äôt want to go there after that.
So I wouldn‚Äôt dare trying to hit on someone at work.
Besides work I go to the gym but there aren‚Äôt that many women there and so I don‚Äôt want to bother them cause there‚Äôs already tons of men surrounding them there.
I tried dating apps but those made me feel  bad about myself cause I don‚Äôt really have cool photos that I can use in these apps, and even when I match it always feels like I carry 100% of the conversation until I get ghosted.
I wanna believe I look alright, I‚Äôd rate myself a 7, in my mind at least.
I‚Äôm pretty short (1.70cm) but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm super conscious about it. Also some old Russian lady once told me that a man only needs to be slightly more attractive than an ape, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a looks problem, or maybe it is! I don‚Äôt know!
I tried to force myself to talk to a woman who works at a bakery I sometime frequent, I don‚Äôt even think she looks that great, I just liked the way she smiles, but every time I tried actually talking with her she‚Äôll look away and find something else that needs to be done right now, like subtlety letting me know she‚Äôs busy, even if the place is empty.
At that point there is nothing in this world that would convince me to keep talking with her, cause I‚Äôll only think about how I‚Äôm making things awkward by trying to talk with her when she already knows I‚Äôm about to try and hit on her (even though I never actually do lol).
*
I‚Äôm not shy or too much of an introvert but I just kinda never get people to care about me, I didn‚Äôt even notice how bad my friendship-situation was before the quarantine, it‚Äôs been almost two months now and I‚Äôm so lonely, I‚Äôve spoken with like two people who aren‚Äôt my sister through out the entire quarantine, and both conversations were pretty brief and ended with them kind of zoning out of the conversation.
I guess I‚Äôm not interesting??? I have no idea.
Anyway yeah so TL;DR: asking for advice about where or how to meet new friends in your 30‚Äôs, and how to find a romantic partner.
Thanks to anyone who took the time reading.",04May2020,1
966,"I should start with saying I suspect I have some sort of bipolar disorder and when the person I'm gonna talk about and I met, I was in an amazing place mentally. Now, not so much. 

I started talking to a guy online a few month ago, and I absolutely adore him. I have never connected to anyone faster than him, and he has expressed the same to me. I truly only want what's best for him and only want him to be happy.

When we started talking, I was in a very good mood and I felt like I could bring some of that to him too. I could be my best self and help him when he was down and cheer him up. I am now back in a very bad place and I don't feel like I can do that and be that person for him anymore. I really, really want to, but I always bring others down with me when I decline, which is why I tend to completely isolate myself when it happens. I hate myself and I feel like that's what I bring upon him now instead, and I can't live with that.

Nobody should have to deal with me when I become like this, except me. I become bitchy, toxic and I take it out on others, even if I try not to. I'm a total mess, and not the cute kind. It's bad. I don't want to do that to him. That's the last thing I want. He deserves way better. 

Since we only know eachother online and live very far apart, I feel like the right thing to do would be to cut him off now before he gets hurt by me.  I'm planning on sending him a very long explanation to why and I would make it very, very clear that he did nothing wrong, because he really didn't. And then I would block him.

This wouldn't be an attempt to get validation from him, if I were to go through with this I would go all in and I wouldn't talk to him ever again. I feel like this is the right thing to do, but I would appreciate some outside opinions.",04May2020,1

I knew at heart weed compared to other drugs wasn‚Äôt as bad even though it affects people‚Äôs minds who are younger (which is one of the reasons I‚Äôm trying to stop). I actually stole Xanax from my mom for a few months before getting caught and I don‚Äôt have an excuse but it was really wrong and I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm not doing it anymore. I‚Äôve even stopped drinking entirely lately because I hated how it made me feel.

I also know B has been doing acid too and is an excessive drinker, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs been doing other drugs too. Also, M and B have tried cocaine and I‚Äôm really concerned because I have a aunt who died from cancer caused to a cocaine addiction when she was our age. M has a friend who does cocaine often, and I‚Äôve even seen this friend come to school tweaked out once or twice. Honestly, I‚Äôm so mad and disappointed in them.

977,"I‚Äôve posted my story on reddit so many times. But I can‚Äôt figure out how to move on.

I‚Äôm 18 years old, and I grew up through some really messed up situations. Throughout my whole life, my dad has been emotionally abusive. He‚Äôs had so many affairs with my mom growing up, and has threatened to leave numerous times. 

My parents were extremely rough on me growing up also. They practically forced me to work from the age of eleven, doing labor type work etc.

I also grew up homeschooled and basically socially isolated.

They‚Äôve also done sexual things in front of me one time when I was young. Which I don‚Äôt know if that is considered sexual abuse, but I know it had to have messed me up. 

On top of this, my mom did some weird things to me also. She sexually touched me a few times when I was young. 

And she used to make me do things that were just strange, like put on her bra, messaging her etc. however she used to say she was on heavy medication that caused her to do weird things. She is sick with some health conditions so...

At the time these things happened, I didn‚Äôt know what was normal. So I didn‚Äôt realize until recently how much of toxicity I went through.

I know these things messed me up mentally, and as a result, I had incest and voyeurism type fantasies throughout my teenage years. And I eventually acted on them as well. 

I used to peek at my mom in the shower, go through her underwear drawers, and I ended up groping her one time. I also used to spy on my parents have sex too.

At the time I groped her, when I was 15, she had kind of changed, and she reacted badly. And told me how wrong it was. 

On top of this, she says she doesn‚Äôt remember doing the things that I know she did to me when I was younger. I don‚Äôt know if she is denying it, or if she actually doesn‚Äôt remember because of the medication she was on. But I know these things happened. 

Anyways, I don‚Äôt really have these problems anymore. I stopped at around 17 years old, (I‚Äôm 18 almost 19 now). And I think I can safely say I‚Äôm a different person than I was a year ago. This is because now I just don‚Äôt feel the urge to do those things anymore. And now I realize how wrong it was. And I feel really guilty for it.

Of course, I still have issues, I am not okay. But I think I‚Äôve managed to completely stop the voyeurism and incest problems. I still have fantasies, not of my mom, but I still have the voyeurism and incest fetishes. However, I feel like I can trust myself not to act on them anymore.

And I feel good about that. But I don‚Äôt know how to move on from the things they did to me, and the things I did. 

I really hate my parents for it, because I feel like they are the reason I became so messed up in the head. 

Furthermore, I want to distance myself from my parents. This is because I‚Äôm not comfortable around them, and I just really hate them. I don‚Äôt think I can forgive them for the things they did to me. 

And I‚Äôm not justifying anything I did, I still hate myself for the things that I did. I just feel like they are the reasons why I did these things in the first place.

I just want to move on with my life, but I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm now worried about my parents telling others and/or reporting it to the police in the future.

The reason I‚Äôm worried about this is because they have two sides. When I start to cut ties, they‚Äôre obviously going to lose it. And I feel like they‚Äôll do it out of spite.

If that happens, then I feel like it‚Äôs over for me. Everyone will hate me, and I‚Äôd might as well kill myself. 

And I feel like, just because I‚Äôm a guy, and because of how manipulative they are, no one would believe me about the things they did to me. 

So in all, I don‚Äôt know how to move on and forgive myself for the things I did, and move on from the past. And I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do in the future. 

What if my parents do tell others and/or report me to the police for what I did. I can always tell others and report them for what they did to me. But who would ever believe me? 

I feel like I‚Äôm just reaching a dead end. And I don‚Äôt know what to do. All I want is to live a normal life and move on. But I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt experience that. 

I‚Äôm trying to follow my passions, and see where they take me. I want to start a music career. Or go to cosmetology school. But I‚Äôm constantly thinking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point in all of this, when I‚Äôm just reaching a dead-end in my life.‚Äù

I really don‚Äôt know what to do, and I can‚Äôt afford any mental help as of right now. And there‚Äôs no free help that I know of where I live.  

Sorry for this super long post. I just need to vent, and I feel like it‚Äôs best for me to do it anonymously.",04May2020,1

979,"Hello everyone just wanted to post this here in hopes of getting help of some sort. Long story short I'm 18 and in a relationship with a wonderful 24 year old girl. The problem that I have is that my family does not support our relationship at all. And I understand them and that our age difference is well...weird... especially because I'm a guy and I guess that it's somewhat of a norm that in relationship the guy is older if there's an age difference to begin with. Both my friends,her friends and her family are ok with the two of us being a thing. Every time I asked my mother (which is the one that's most agressive about us braking up and stuff like that) to explain to me why does she doesn't want to see the two of us together she just says stuff like:"" it's bad"" ,and the either proceed to yell at me telling me how I'll end up on the streets or keeps on yelling about how I'm abusing her by being in that relationship. I understand that my girlfriend haves her own stuff she need to worry about like a job and rent and stuff and that I should focus on school and not worry about those stuff yet (and I completely agree with that) but I....Uhh...I don't worry about that xD im completely focused on getting into a collage since I'm done with high school in like 25 days(or well at least I think I'm focused). Anyways bottom line is that I really like her a lot( I don't really want to say I love her since I'm only 18 and I'm not sure if I know what love is) , and I don't want to break up with her since I have a really big problem with anxiety and depression and she really‚Äã helps me a lot and I just...fuck..I just really like her and Im happy with her.

983,"My older brother (23) has been dating his GF (21) for 4 years now. Overall, she's a sweet girl that he has a lot in common in. However, I do not think the relationship is healthy for him. For one, she doesn't motivate him. As some background, my brother dropped out of college his last year before graduating and works at a place where he gets taken advantage of. His GF never went to school and works a low-end job. While he's constantly encouraging her to go to school for what she's passionate about, she has never encouraged him to finish school. For his job, he has to wake up around 5-6 (sometimes earlier) and won't finish until late in the evening. However, the GF still insists on having him drive to her house an hour away after work which makes him not able to come home until 1-2 in the morning. ( this happens at least 3-4 times in a workweek). While he's at her house, he cleans after her, cooks for her, the whole 9 yards. When she needs something built or repaired, he does it. Sadly she suffers from depression and anxiety, so he's constantly consoling her about that. When he's with his friends, she has to be there too or she'll get upset. But she does none of this for him. My brother suffers from anxiety, and yet she never takes the time to worry about his problems. She doesn't help him with anything he needs to be done and barely visits in at his home, even though she only works part-time.  She doesn't even help with her own stuff that she needs done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now apparenty the GF's mom is pressuring my brother to propose. My brother is a sweet and selfless guy that doesn't really know how to say no. He also doesn't like leaving his comfort zone. I'm worried that my brother is too comfortable in the relationship to break up and will propose because he's being pressured to and think's it'll make the GF happy. But if he marries her, I'm afraid he's going to spend the rest of his life taking care of her and basically being her nanny/therapist without getting anything in return. My brother deserves way better than that and I would hate to watch that happen. He definitely has flaws of his own, but he needs someone as selfless and motivating as he is.

&amp;#x200B;

But like I said, she is sweet to him and will do little things like buy him small snacks and stuff. And I'd feel so judgy for basically telling him because my brother's GF is depressed he should break up with her. How do I bring up my concerns to him in a way that doesn't make me seem like I'm attacking his GF and to encourage him to leave his comfort zone?",04May2020,1

985,"As expressed in the title, all my friends have started doing harder drugs. We all started off with weed as teenagers do, one also doing cigarettes on the side. For the sake of the explanation I‚Äôll call my friends M, B, and F. B was the one who got us on weed and at the time that seems normal for broken kids. I knew at heart weed compared to other drugs wasn‚Äôt as bad even though it affects people‚Äôs minds who are younger (which is one of the reasons I‚Äôm trying to stop). I actually stole Xanax from my mom for a few months before getting caught and I don‚Äôt have an excuse but it was really wrong and I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm not doing it anymore. I‚Äôve even stopped drinking entirely lately because I hated how it made me feel. 

Recently, F has been going through their moms medicine cabinet and taking pills that shouldn‚Äôt be mixed in with weed or alcohol and has SEVERE affects on the liver. M has been cautious about F taking pills yet has ordered shrooms (which their mom found and threw away) and recently ordered acid which they took a few days ago with F. I also know B has been doing acid too and is an excessive drinker, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs been doing other drugs too. Also, M and B have tried cocaine and I‚Äôm really concerned because I have a aunt who died from cancer caused to a cocaine addiction when she was our age. M has a friend who does cocaine often, and I‚Äôve even seen this friend come to school tweaked out once or twice. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm so mad and disappointed in them. I don‚Äôt know weather or not I should talk to them, but I know they‚Äôll get upset and defensive, especially M who will claim ‚Äúits our choice.‚Äù It is their choice... but I know it‚Äôs not the right one. I‚Äôm trying to stop smoking weed because I‚Äôm incredibly unmotivated which interferes with my writing, something I‚Äôve been trying and struggling to work with. I don‚Äôt have many other friends but then, and the others I did have were at school. I feel so lonely because of what they‚Äôve been doing and because I can‚Äôt get much social interaction anymore. What‚Äôs worse is my boyfriend is in the class of 2020, and has been struggling with schoolwork and different college things, therefore stressing me out. I don‚Äôt know what to do or what to say or who I should say it to. Even if I did say something, both M and F are suicidal and I‚Äôve had an incident with M that left me kinda traumatized and extremely apprehensive to calling out my friends bad actions. 

My normal life has been totally shifted and it‚Äôs been making me incredibly depressed. I miss seeing my school friends and my boyfriend ... and I know the quarantine is affecting my friends even more. Everything is changing and I‚Äôm so scared, I don‚Äôt know what to do.",04May2020,1

She has never let me spend a birthday or Christmas empty handed and I am very grateful for that and I make sure that if I don‚Äôt particularly like what she gets me I‚Äôll save it for my going-to-bed clothes so it still gets worn or I‚Äôll wear the jewelry for a week or two until I absolutely can‚Äôt take it anymore.

I do my best to use what she gets me but still, sometimes she gets me things that have been sitting in my closet collecting dust for years.

987,"So, this is my first ever Reddit post, but I really need som advice here.  


About a year ago, I broke up with my ex. We'd been together for around two and a half years, and lived together for over half of it. The first year was amazing, but after a while I kinda fell out of love with her. I broke things off, and she was devastated. I felt horrible, but it felt right at the time. We keep in touch every now and then, and we even met up a couple of months ago as we were in the same city, just to talk.   


Now to the problem. I met a girl at the start of the year, and I thought I was falling in love with her and that I was completely over my ex. However, I've recently realised I still love my ex, and I really miss her. All I want is for us to get back together. I don't really regret the break-up, cause I don't think things would have worked out, as I wasn't sure of what i wanted. I really want to get my ex back and we might, coincidentally, be moving to the same city this fall. I've never felt as safe and loved as I did with my ex, and now I can't imagine my future without her.   


What should I do about this? I know I have to break it off with the girl I'm with now, but she has her finals right now, and I don't want this to ruin everything. I don't know how my ex feels about me now, but I know she doesn't hate me. Should I tell her how I feel when I break it off with the girl I'm dating now?",04May2020,1

989,"So basically, I met this new guy from my new job, (let's give him the name, Derek). We got hired around the same time. So ever since we both started our new job, we eventually got to know each other and started to hang out a lot. But ever since we would hang out, he started giving me A LOT OF MIXED SIGNALS. 

He told me that he was straight and showed me a pic of his girlfriend (let's give her the name, Rachel). I took his word for it, but us hanging out suggested otherwise. One time was when after work, we decided to go get lunch at a restaurant, and he offered to pay. I just thought he was being a nice guy so I didn't think much of it (also he always wants to pay for my food whenever we get something to eat). But after lunch, we decided what else to do, and I suggested going to the city to watch fireworks. And he said ""Oh I have plans with Rachel tonight, but it's fine, I'll just call her and tell her to hang out tomorrow instead."" But I insisted for him to not change plans with his gf if he already had plans, but he said ""No, but I genuinely want to hang out with you more. Our vibe is too real. I hang out with my girlfriend everyday. If we go to the city, I just want it to be us two and not her."" So that gave me a signal that he's flirting HARDCORE. So he called his gf and asked to cancel plans and of course she got mad at him. So I said, ""you know what, let's not hang out tonight because I don't want your girlfriend getting mad at you."" So I dropped him back home and when he was leaving my car, he said, ""Don't worry bro, one day, we'll have a full day to ourselves."" That gave me another mixed signal.

Another time was when I brought him to a party to meet my friends, and I have this gay friend who told me, ""Oh your friend, Derek is cute."" So I told Derek about what my gay friend said, and Derek replied, ""If he thought I was cute, he probably thought that you're cute as well."" And I said, ""What? No way."" But Derek replied, ""No bro do you realize how good looking you are? Anybody would be lucky to be with you."" That night, we also took a mirror selfie with buttoned up shirts and he said, ""leave it unbuttoned, you look better like that."" I was changing out of that buttoned shirt to put on my regular t shirt but I couldn't find it, but Derek had it, and said, ""I like it better off.""

Also, Derek left on a trip to Texas for a week, and we have each other on snapchat. Almost EVERY SNAPCHAT he would comment on it. And this one time, i posted a selfie video, and he commented with 2 emojis with heart eyes on it. At first I thought he was just being a bro, but then he added, ""damn, you're so fine."" And when he was in Texas, he would send me videos saying ""wish you were here."" He would even send snaps saying, ""damn, i miss you so much."" Or even a roller coaster video saying, ""I wish I was gripping your hand.""

There were also many instances where he would invite me and Rachel to hang out, and he would make me sit in the passenger's seat in the car, and make Rachel sit in the back. I would offer to sit in the back, but he would tell me to stay in the front. Also too, when the three of us would hang out, Derek would always talk to me instead of her. I felt kinda bad. He even invited me to DINNER AT HIS HOUSE, TWICE, BY MYSELF. The first time he called me and I said yes. I met his family and everything. He would tell me that his younger brothers and his mother miss me and ask for me everyday. But the second time, he asked me in front of Rachel and didn't even invite her. I politely declined that offer. Even so, he would text me everyday asking to hang out. He even would text me if he could come over MY HOUSE to hang out or sleep over.

But he would also send me ""freaky"" posts from instagram and send them to me over dm. There was this one time where he sent me a freaky video, and the caption of that video said, ""send to bae."" And I may be a guy, but I don't like looking at that shit on instagram like wtf.

The one down side about him is that he isn't a loyal bf to Rachel. There were times where he would check out girls when he's working, driving, or even hanging out with me. He would comment about how ""this girl's ass is so fine"" or how he could ""do naughty things with that girl."" He kinda treats women like toys in a way, which is a little irritating. He would sometimes say, ""damn I would leave rachel for that girl."" He would also show me snap videos of him having sex with a girl, or just nude videos of girls.

A few days ago, Derek and Rachel broke up. And the next day, we decided to hang out again. We were wondering what to do, and then he said, ""let's go get food, drive to a parking lot, and watch Disney+ in my car."" I said ok. And as we were watching Disney+ he said ""yeah, me and rachel used to do this."" But during that day when he was driving and I was in the passenger's seat, HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY LEG. I looked at his hand, looked at him, and he looked at me, and took his hand off. He said, ""oh sorry, it's just a habit of me doing that to rachel."" I said, ""no it's ok."" In my mind I'm thinking, ""OK, DOES HE MISS HIS EX? or IS HE TRYING TO DO STUFF TO ME AND USE RACHEL AS AN EXCUSE?"" 

And not gonna lie, I'm a little bi-curious now. I've been a straight dude ever since until I met Derek. At first I would tell myself that it's wrong for myself to feel this way with A GUY, but now but Derek makes me feel secure, and I've never felt this way with a guy, which is a new experience for me. The same type of vibe I would get with a girl I would like is the same type of vibe I would get with Derek. So I low-key tried shooting my shot with him by playing the ""what if"" game with him. So while we were playing that game, we said different scenarios. But when it was my turn again, I asked, ""what if I told you I had a crush on you?"" And he said, ""Well, I wouldn't care, but I would stop hanging out with you."" So that kind of hurt lol. But two outcomes came to my mind when he said that; either he is actually being serious, OR he's in denial and got hella defensive because he's secretly closeted too.  

My circle friends told me that I should sit down and have a talk with him about how he makes me feel and stuff, because they think that it's confusing about all the words and actions he's done to me, but I don't want to risk losing a friendship with him or with him getting mad if I ask him. Some of my friends say that he really is into me, other friends would say that he's just being a guy. But what do you guys think?

Does he secretly have a crush on me and should I go for it? Or avoid it?",04May2020,1

\[i'm 14. i'm ugly. i'm horny. i'm depressed. i'm introverted. i'm funny. i'm sad. i'm alone. i'm smart. i'm brown. i'm skinny. i'm bilingual. i'm short. i'm quiet. i'm a loser. i'm annoying. i'm indifferent. i'm vague. i'm unconfident. i'm regretful. i'm melancholy. i'm greedy. i'm sorry. 

there's so much wrong with me and so much right. i can't fathom how much of a loser i am, but i know that others see me as a quiet but smart kid who's seriously depressed. i also know people see me as that one kid who never speaks a word but in reality, i do want to talk. i just have this thing called social anxiety. i'm funny. i realize that once i crack a few jokes. but that's not what i want. i desire more than just a few laughs. i want a friend. not a friend who acts like an acquaintance. a true friend that i can put 100% of my trust into. all i want in this world is just a relationship with someone i truly care about. whether that be a male or female. 

hormones. i'm horny. my sexual desire is practically infinite. everyday i have to watch some sort of porn, right? it's not entertainment to me, nor is it pleasure or lust. it's just to satisfy me. i don't know how to describe this feeling. because before the lockdown i've never fully paid attention to what i truly want. my sexual desire - my desire to have sex - is realistic. my mind says no. my body says yes. each time i'm satisfied, i cry. not because it's wrong. but because i'm not happy doing it.

social media. whenever i see girls on there, my mind goes batshit crazy. it's a feeling of loss and a feeling of desire. i can never be beside them, nor can i meet them. i want to have them, but to me whos so degraded, so depressed, so suicidal, so ugly and so weak. i am not their ideal and i will never be. 

\---------

i'll cry. no, i've never cried physically. outside i'm emotionless, my eyes devoid of any emotion. my face shows no smile. i'm apathetic. just... nothing. what am i? why can't i cry? ah. that's right. i'm human. human's aren't perfect. neither am i. yet.. why are all these people around me so perfect? why are they so happy, so strong, so beautiful, so white, so pure, so innocent, so smart and so amazing. why is it me whos the exact opposite? why am i so dark.

focus on myself. it's time to love. work out. read. learn. forget. remember. accept. create. cry. your genetics are not your fault. don't blame your parents. don't blame you. just accept it. it's time to love yourself before you love others. you're 14, ugly, brown, skinny and short. you're dicks small and you're egos small. you don't talk to anyone. so accept those facts and move on.

it's night time.

in these nights, either you're:

\- thinking about everything;

it's a peaceful dark place.

do you ever just reach a point in your sadness, where you feel at peace? like nothing can hurt you more than you‚Äôve already felt, it can‚Äôt get worse, so it has to get better. right?

it sucks when at the end of the day you wanna share everything that happened or you felt, but you have no one to talk to.     
what's the point of having everything you ever wanted if you don't have anyone to come home to and share your laughs and tears, your hardwork, your everything? \]

1001,"So I am a computer science major at this UC university. This is my last year, and because of some circumstances, I only need have to take this 1 cryptography class in order to finally graduate. But this is the most unfair class ever.

We basically have 2 homework total, a midterm, and a final to determine our grade. Now this homework are %20 each and each exam is %30 each. 

We are in the middle of the quarter now. So far we only did first homework and midterm. First homework wasn't released until a week ago, and the midterm happened literally 3 days after the first homework. For most of the quarter, we didn't have any freaking training with this material to prepare us. Now the midterm itself was closed book, and didn't cover anything from the homework. 

How can I resolve this situation?

Is there anyone that I can talk to in the University about this situation?

Is there anyway that I can convince the TAs or the teacher to go easy on us? ( My father is sick, and I really need to graduate soon so I can finally find a job. As a matter of fact, I should have been graduated a year ago)",04May2020,1

Nothing has happened as far as I'm aware to make her feel like this.

I was so confident I got the job, especially because the partners were telling me I‚Äôve got it. During my review, they said I could not get the job and instead I need to keep working until this virus is over so they can assess me in the office. 

I informed the manager that whether I work in the office or remotely it should not matter as long as the job is done? My manager said I‚Äôm doing great and my performance is great but they‚Äôre concerned as to whether I can act formerly in the office. Thus, they want me to continue working UNPAID like I have done so for a month.

1004,"Basically, I grew up in a household where my parents would fight almost everyday. They'd fight at night and I would always listen to them. I knew confronting them wouldn't help stop their fight as I tried numerous times. I also have a brother 7 years younger than me. When I was around 15 years old my parents divorced, and my brother and I moved with my mother to another city. To be honest I was pretty relived. 

Growing up, whenever I had a good day with my dad (even while they weren't divorced) my mom wouldn't really like it. She would constantly bad mouth my dad and try to convince me that he wasn't the man he was. That he was always with other women, and that he was a disgusting person. I remember as a kid one day, my dad an I spent a day at the waterpark, and upon arrival at home a fight between them broke up. My mom put me to bed, and told me that I shall never see my dad again and that he was a traitor. I cried and was scared. Over the years, I grew immune to those statements about my dad. I knew my dad was a good person, he taught me how to ride a bike, helped me with homework, and basically was always there for me. My mom downplayed those acts by my father and always claimed that it was her that convinced my dad to do those things. It was her that asked my dad to take care of me, and if it weren't for her, my dad would've never spent time with me. 

It got especially toxic whenever I defended my dad. My mom would insult me, and call me a ""traitor, just like your father"". After the divorce, I asked my mom if I could move in with my dad, and her reaction was... well best put, literally hell broke loose. It was devastating. Long story short, I continued to live with my ma. 

Little side note. My dad and mom both now have a girl/boyfriend. 

Anyways, fast forward to today, I flew back home from college because of the global lockdown. I originally intended to stay in my university town, but my mom guilt tripped me to fly back home, and so I did. After all, my brother was there as well. I didn't mind that much, I could spend some time with my little bro. 

Currently, I fight with my mom every 2 days on average. Maybe more. Today was my snapping point. It's my little bothers birthday. My mom came home with her boyfriend and claimed she had a really bad day. First red flag. So we were sitting eating dinner and my brother told a story about her boyfriend. It isn't a big deal, but my ma's boyfriend started to attack my little bro, that it is a sensitive topic and that he should've never brought it up blah blah. My brother apologized, but then my mom continued and called him stupid to introduce such a topic. In my own opinion it really wasn't such a big deal so I intervened and asked everyone to calm down. Then my mom snapped at me for trying to teach her how to parent, and a whole fight broke loose, on my little brother birthday. I was very furious. I should've kept quite perhaps but I just found it very unfair. My mother's boyfriend stood up and said ""my hands are shaking I should probably leave"",  he got really pissed. 

My mom is very irrational, we'll fight about topic A, but then she'll jump to topic Z and then somehow connect it back with my dad and how his current girlfriend ruined their relationship and so on. It's very messy and irrational arguments. 

After the fight my mom walked into my room, and for some reason asked on who's side I am, my moms or my dads. I said I love both of you. Then she asked but you have to chose a side. I side none. Then she said you can't ever meet your dad's girlfriend. I didn't comment. She said if I ever see my dad's girlfriend she would never see me again. I directly asked, ""is this conditional love you're giving me?"" she said ""you can't see your dad's girlfriend"" without even acknowledging my question. I didn't answer, I mean I love my dad. If I'm sleeping under the same roof with my mom's current girlfriend currently, why the f\*\*k can't I see my dad's girlfriend? My dad doesn't deserve that. So my mom proceeded to shut the door, probably talked shit about me to my brother, and didn't talk to me for the rest of the day.

I'm really done with her irrational bullshit. I can't even call my dad in peace without her sticking her nose into what I talked with my dad about. She'll insult me for talking with my dad. I really don't know what to do. I tried explaining to her, but it's like talking to a wall. If you've read till here, I appreciate it a lot. I could really use some advice. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: My mom in my eyes is very toxic and constantly fights with me irrationally over blown up topics. She doesn't like it when I talk to my dad. My mom and I have toxic arguments a lot, and whenever I try to express my feeling they are ignored.",04May2020,1
1006,"Why I'm breaking up with her:

I met her about 2¬Ω years ago and we had started out as friends. Last year, she asked me out to our school's spring dance(right before I was going to ask her ask her out) and we've considered ourselves to be dating ever since. The problem is that we haven't been doing any bf/gf type things aside from hanging around together at dances and I think it's better if we just go back to being friends. 

Now to what I need advice on.


How do I break up with her?

Option 1: text
I would prefer to do it by text, since I could get my thoughts out, but it's very informal and, from what I've heard, it's the worst way to break up with somebody.

Option 2: call
I could call her, but if I do, I'm positive that I'm going to chicken out and I would say a lot less than I want to. 

Option 3: wait for quarantine to end and do it in person
This was my original plan anyway, but I had just found out that my school will be closed for the remainder of the year, so as far as I know, I won't be seeing her in person until next year and I don't even know if we'll have any classes together(she's really smart, I'm not. We only have one class in common at the moment and I'm really struggling in it).

So I know that a lot of these details might give me away to people that know me, but honestly I dont care and just want to get as much background in as possible.

So I'm a 19F and I live in Illinois. I know marijuana's legal here, but of course I'm not old enough and I have a job that drug tests. 
I dont want to come off as just a teenager looking for a way to get drugs from my doctor, so that's why I question if I should ask or not. This is a new doctor for me, as I have only gone to him about 3 times. But the reason I'd want to ask for one is important and might be valid.
(Some tmi info but I've come to terms with it at this point and I dont care who knows)
So for over a year now, I've had what seems to be a chronic UTI. I've been to different doctors, a urologist, and physical therapy for this whole year that I've had the problem. They say it might be IC, but they honestly dont know. It seems like no one can give me answers to what is wrong. The physical therapy hasnt been helping, theres been points where I've gone to the hospital because the pain is so bad I cant stand up, its prevented me from getting jobs I want, prevented me from doing the jobs I've had, and made things difficult with my bf because if we do anything, I'm in so much pain that I sit there crying. I've been taking ibuprofen like its tic tacs, and that also isnt great for my body. I asked my urologist for pain killers just so i can function like a person again, but he said no since my pain is chronic and he doesnt want me addicted. 
Along with that problem, my whole life I've had horrible stomach issues as well. My body just doesnt work right in that area, and as a baby my stomach was always in constant pain and my mom said she had to sit there rocking me for hours, otherwise I'd cry. I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and all they found was inflammation. This problem has always been there.
And along with those wonderful things, I have pretty terrible depression/anxiety. (Anxiety might be why I'm questioning myself so hard in this post, lol) and I've heard marijuana can do wonders in those areas. I've tried many different medications over the years, and they havent done much except make me gain weight. Some have been worsened the depression. 

So with all that info, I feel like I could qualify for one, but again, I dont want to come off as just a kid that wants drugs. Is it worth asking about?

1013,"(This is my first post on Reddit, so I apologize if it may be a bit messy.)

Throughout all of my life I've been getting blood withdrawn medically due to a multitude of diseases. This was fine until about 2 years ago.

Before that, I was always scared of getting it withdrawn (I'm a teenager and I have a very bad relationship with that sorta thing), but up until that point it wasn't such a big deal. Now, after I went to do this so many times, my body has created some sort of mechanism that activates whenever I think about needles, or my arm, or blood etc. 

The exact spot that is always stabbed when I withdraw blood starts to randomly hurt *really* badly, as if the withdrawn is actually happening. In fact, it really feels like it's real; I can feel that weird blood pressure even though there's nothing actually going on. I can't move my arm, even though it is perfectly fine. I also sometimes start crying for no reason and get flashback to... well, times where blood withdrawal was done very poorly. I cannot even handle the topic of conversation as this weird reflex starts acting up again. In fact, it started while I was typing this and it's still going on, I'm starting to sweat now and my hands are getting shaky.

I don't really know what to do. I also have other traumas and, when they come back, they're awful as well; but I've never heard of somebody having trauma over this? Is this a problem? Should I talk it out with my psychiatrist?",04May2020,1

I'm currently just furloughed and will return to my position when this is over. I want to go back to school and finish my degree but it would require me leaving my current position and taking on a part time job. Money would be extremely tight, whereas right now I'm very comfortable financially. If I left my current job I'd take a part time job as a bartender at my friend's bar, which is scary because that's not my area of expertise. Also, I don't want to have any issues arise between my friend and I because of intermixing work and personal relationships. 

I would barely be able to make ends meet in this situation but it's something I've wanted to accomplish for a long time. There is no room for growth in my current job but I have complete job security. 

I had tried to take classes while working in my current position and I was unable to balance the two, mostly due to the fact that I work 50/60 hours a week.

Most days I feel numb and when I experience some sort of happiness I start to doubt why I‚Äôm even happy, or if what‚Äôs making me happy is even worth it. Like basically it‚Äôs super funny being mentally ill and having no one know or seem to notice. Is the loud music not enought to notice? How about the constant talk of death or self harm? Nothing will make people see what‚Äôs up ever and it‚Äôs funny. Like I could look the most dead inside sitting down staring holes into my computer and no one would ask hey OP, you okay? Wait don‚Äôt answer that with yeah. Because I know that‚Äôs bullshit. I have litteraly done nothing while in class, yet no one notices. Like I could fail all of my classes rn because I don‚Äôt have any energy to do anything. My back kills me and I have to work constantly. At home all I want to do is sleep. I barely watch anything. Hmm I feel like I have more fucking fake friends then real friends at this point. I‚Äôm always on the verge of collapse.

It's crazy how many people dont actually care about you. Like i can stare at the table for 30 minutes with my headphones on and no one would say to me what's wrong? No one notices anything. Yesterday (3/12/20) I had red lines on my skin for the entire day. Going up and down my arms lines and lines and lines of red. And no one noticed a thing. I find it hard to care about anything anymore. Because I feel like I'm not needed in the friend group that I try and integrate myself into. But I realised as soon as I left and went to talk to leah and Dan I felt better. I joked, I laughed. It was so different. And that feeling of having a panic attack or mental breakdown whatever it is. Went away. It's sad because I dont know how much longer I can keep it going. I have no one and no one actually cares. That's what's rooted deeply into my mind. No one is here to get those thoughts out and to extinguish them.

It's sick how many times I‚Äôve wanted to drown in blood. And I mean like I‚Äôve wanted to see red crimson run down my arms into a nice warm bath. Won‚Äôt that be comforting? Ha, they wouldn‚Äôt think so. I think that many of us don‚Äôt see that point of going on in life just to eventually die. I mean yeah there‚Äôs a lot of things to see in the world.

It's funny, in order to have strong will one must know how to control themselves. So today I got cut at work and my thumb kept bleeding as I was wiping away the blood with an alcohol swab. Blood would fill the small wound over and over again. Until I put the band aid on. It's funny I know when I feel a break down coming on. It's so difficult to stop myself from freaking out. Over and over and over and over again all I think about is what it would feel like to have blood dripping down my arms. To feel the pain of it. To loose conciousness from it.

1024,"I apologize in advance for the length of my post!

I applied for a new job before the pandemic started, and after a number of interviews, I finally received the news that I was the final candidate.

I was really excited at first, but now I'm starting to second guess myself.

I've been in my current company for almost seven years, and my current job for almost two, and it's been relatively boring. I'm not feeling challenged, the job itself is not that interesting, I was often complaining to my wife that I wanted a new job, so those are the main reasons why I was looking for a new job.

The position for which I'm the final candidate is more interesting, more engaging, and seems pretty well suited for me. Factoring in all the benefits, it would be a very (very) slight raise over what I'm currently making. The benefits in the new company are not bad, but they aren't as good as the ones in my current company.

The two main things I'm worried about are:
 
1. I started with my current company almost seven years ago, and had multiple positions, slowly progressing to a job that I thought I'd love. However, it turned out that it gave me anxiety, so I stayed for a year and a half in that position before leaving for a different company. I only stayed in that new company for four months because I absolutely hated it. I was bored out of my mind, I felt lost (because I had left a company and people I was familiar with), and overall I felt miserable there. I was lucky enough to be recruited for another job in my previous company, where I've now been for almost two years. Now I'm afraid of experiencing the same feelings of being lost and feeling horrible in a different company...

2. I feel like I'm not sure I want a different job anymore, and that I would enjoy this particular one. I did a lot of research, talked about it with my therapist at lengths, so I was pretty convinced that the type of job I applied for were what I was interested in and what I would enjoy. But now that it's right in front of me, I feel paralyzed and my brain can't figure out if I was right before, and if I'll actually enjoy the new job. 

I've been working from home for almost two months now because of the pandemic, and although my work is still pretty boring, being home at least mitigates that issue, because I can do other things during my time, which I can't do if I'm at the office. But obviously, we will (hopefully soon) be able/have to go back to the office, so I imagine the boredom and feelings about my current job will return.

I'm just confused and feel like I don't know what I want anymore...

1029,"I realized half way through that this may be somewhat of a vent but I do genuinely need advice. Thank you for your time if you do end up reading any of this. I know that so many more people have it worse than me. I do know I am so fortunate to be where I am. I don't want this to sound like a sob story or that I want attention. Please help me. 

My parents do a lot for me in the sense that they are taking care of some of my college tuition, car payment (they own the car and don't want me to pay for it), and assisting with my boyfriend and I's rent (we moved into an apartment in the same complex as my parents because it is safer than the one we were going to move into that was less expensive, we are now able to pay for the full amount of rent but they still insist on giving me money for ""groceries""). I have always appreciated it and always let them know how much they've helped me be successful, but with all their help comes their controlling tendencies. 

This mostly started when I started dating when I was younger as I think that's when I first started having to make decisions on my own autonomy and things like morality. They always pretty much made my choices for me, and once I had to start making my own I tended to do what others wanted me to do as that is what I had always done for my parents. This became a problem when boys wanted what they wanted from me (you know). I had a s*xually abusive relationship and my life began to be completely different from there. I don't think they ever comforted me, only scolded. Finances being a big part of my life now are just the new aggravation of theirs.

Some things they do are; If I go against them in any way (examples later) they don't treat me like an adult and ""take away"" (saying bring them to them or they threaten to call the police) the things they have given me to use, such as my car and an instrument I need professionally to make money as well as for my schooling. I have also stayed on my family's phone plan and because of this they are paying my phone bill because it would be more expensive if I went off and got a line of my own. Because of this, when they get upset with me and ""take away"" my things they also turn off my phone data and make me bring it to them. If I so much as say anything that sounds like me standing up for myself, my life will be stopped in its tracks. I was immature and unable to realize that this is how it would be when my life started to kick into gear and they gave these things to me. 

When I was younger they would look at all my phone messages and punish me if I said something that they didn't like. This went until I was probably 20 years old (I'm 22 now). They have stopped doing this mostly because I don't live with them anymore. 

This has affected my professional life and they have ""taken away"" everything twice (once having to drive over 2 hours to get them from me), and since have said they will not do it again but I have a gut feeling I cannot trust that. If any time I cross them minutely they hinder my ability to do what I have commited to and there is nothing I can do about it. I've had to have my boyfriend come home from a social event (they had cut off my phone so I had to message him on facebook because I couldn't call him, my mom said ""guess you'll have to have your boyfriend drive you to work, if you can reach him"") to drive me to work because they made me bring them everything, so I was then without a phone and without a means of real transportation to get to where I would make money and hopefuly not lose my job for not showing up. I then got my own phone and was bullied into submission of my being wrong, told I was ""going against the family"" and guilted into getting rid of my own phone when the things they had given me were dangled back in front of me. Now that I think about it, that phone was the first real freedom I had. When I mentioned emotional abuse in our argument they lost it and guilted me for it. 

My mother berates me for talking to my boyfriend about our arguments implying I have no right to talk to him about the issues I'm having with them. This has happened my whole life since I first tried to start my own life and allow myself to talk to my friends or boyfriend about any problem I would have. Since before I went to college I was scolded or punished for talking to anybody in my life about what my parents were saying to me or how they were punishing me. They have never done anything physical or anything illegal to me, but I still struggle with how to talk to them about any problem I would have with what they would be saying to me or doing. 

Our most recent issue is that my boyfriend needs a new car because his isn't worth the money we will have to put into it to get it working. My parents are trying to control which new (used) car he gets and gets the loan for by trying to show me which ones he should look at online. (I do appreciate their guidance do not get me wrong, I have never been car shopping myself). He wants to take over the loan of his mother's car which he has figured would be the same price per month as any of the cars that my parents are showing me. My mother is telling me if he makes bad financial decisions they will not approve of him asking to marry me eventually. He has never made a bad financial decision, but their opinion I believe is that if either I or he go against their advice we will be in trouble financially. They don't know how much money we have because I don't want to tell them. 

When I was in high school my mom would come into my room at 5am and wake me up to yell at me about whatever she was upset with me about. 

I'm getting crippling anxiety typing this because god forbid my mother finds this post and assumed this is me. If they found out if I was trying to go to a therapist (I'm not) they would be furious. I can't say anything to them about how I feel even if it was like ""Please don't say that to me, it makes me feel bad."" I feel trapped.

Just now while I've been typing, she texted me ""Last time you were disrespectful you didn‚Äôt fair so well, so I‚Äôd watch it if I were you"" 

This anxiety is affecting my life more than I could ever explain. I can't speak up to them about how they treat me because my life will be over. 

TL:DR, My parents hold my life and freedom over my head and if I go against them it's all over.",04May2020,1

I'm turning 18 years old THIS MONTH. I'm not sure what I want to do with my future.

So in my country you can do those WORK DIPLOMAS that take 3-4 years and you go 3-4 days to work and 1-2 days to school. But it turns out I'm one of the 10% who got into HIGH SCHOOL.

Know I'm repeating 4. year because I FAILED a semester(actually 2., I can explain more detailed if you ask) and I still have 2 more years to go. This is shitty because some people might think I don't really want to do high school.

I have no idea if I want to STUDY. Like doing the BATCHELOR, you just get frustrating, bad paid jobs (I think so, maybe I'm wrong). So I would have to go on with the MASTER. But if I don't keep doing school I would have to do an APPRENTICESHIP if I want a good-paid job. Going to work just with high school degree would be stupid (or wouldn't it?).

**And that's basically my problem.** I think that high school degree and batchelor are only worth something if you want to keep studying. If I quit at one of those stages, I would have to get a useful diploma (like an apprenticeship), but I COULD DO THAT JUST AS WELL NOW and finish in 3, 4 years. And with those diplomas you can still study something related with your job (for example a mason with diploma can study architecture). I also feel like I'm in high school because my PARENTS told me so. They would respect it though if I start something else now. (most probably finishing HS though, but what then?)",04May2020,1

Mentally, it's even worst. Everything makes me cry, I don't want to do anything, accomplishing anything seems like an impossible task. I tried Alysena 21 last year but it magnificently failed. All the symptoms were just worst. 

I'm just wondering if a 28 days pill would be optimal. I want kids in the future (not now obviously) and I'm wondering if it would make it harder for me to get pregnant if I chose to stop having periods.

1035,"I (20M) find myself in a very tough position today. I go to college and I have no problems there and am almost left alone by my parents most of the time. I find that whenever I come home I lack independence and freedom. I live at school most of the year and make decisions for myself then, so I don't understand why my parents force a curfew or make me ask to go see friends or my girlfriend when we have no plans on that particular day and it doesn't effect them in any way. I have found myself wanting to just make the move to my apartment at school permanently and only come home for holidays. However, a big catch comes with that. I am heavily dependent on my father to support me financially. He pays my rent, college, and gives me a small chunk of change to pay for groceries every month. I know I am very lucky and privileged, but I am at the breaking point where I think I would rather go into debt and move out than feel as if I am being controlled even though I am 20 years old. I understand that with corona virus going around I affect their health and so do my decisions, so I kind of understand their frustrations and cautiousness right now and I'll let them control me until the order is lifted in my state, but I have a feeling they will still be putting a curfew on me and making me ask them (instead of telling) where I am going. I willingly give them updates about what I am doing, and I never do anything sketchy, and they also have me on find my friends and can see my location at all times. I also get very good grades and have never had any events in my life that would make my parents not trust me.

1040,"I‚Äôm 15f, my dad is 35. He‚Äôs always been problematic, mentally he‚Äôs a 13 year old. No matter where we‚Äôve gone rumors would follow us and he‚Äôd quickly develop a reputation (we‚Äôve lived in 6 states all around the country). He was really young when I was born, my mother left the picture when I was a day old, it was always just the two of us. 

I remember after going to bed as a little kid I‚Äôd hear the front door open and a woman‚Äôs voice. Sometimes it was the same woman for a few months, sometimes different ones every night. They‚Äôd often get up to what I now realize was sex or at least some sort of sexual act (I‚Äôll get to this later). Sometimes there‚Äôd be yelling, I‚Äôve heard him be called a freak multiple times before the women stormed out. This didn‚Äôt go on for long, I think I was 6 or 7 the last time I heard a one-off random woman‚Äôs voice in our house. He‚Äôs had several girlfriends too, they don‚Äôt last long and when they do it‚Äôs very on again off again. He‚Äôs currently got a girlfriend, they‚Äôve broken up once in the last year of being together, and I‚Äôm hoping that they stay together because she‚Äôs genuinely good, she‚Äôs also the first girlfriend of his that I haven‚Äôt hated.

He is also the biggest oversharer. This is no doubt one of his worst qualities. He‚Äôs an avid twitter user and always has been, and there‚Äôs not a part of his life that he hasn‚Äôt shared on Twitter. This is where a great deal of his reputation is coming from. I‚Äôve never had Twitter, I have never looked at his Twitter and I don‚Äôt want to, but kids at school have seen it and aren‚Äôt shy to tell me all about it. His Twitter is apparently just full of his sexual exploits and his addiction to porn and masturbation. I have been tormented at school because of this daily, it makes me miserable and it makes me hate him. A lot of what people at school tell me is likely true, but there are also a lot of rumors.

My dad and I started going to therapy a few years ago after it all started effecting me too much. I was being bullied worse than I could‚Äôve ever imagined because of him. He‚Äôd just broken up with the mom of a kid I went to school with at the time and revealed a load of crap about their relationship, stuff he had no right to say and the guy at school also had a lot to say too. We‚Äôre still seeing this therapist every week (online at the moment obviously). She recently recommended that it‚Äôd be healthy to put the rumors to rest and tell me exactly what‚Äôs true or not. As bad as it sounds I actually wanted to know, because some of the things I‚Äôve heard make him sound like the most horrible person on the planet. Turns out, he is really that bad.

I don‚Äôt want to get into too much detail, but he is the epitome of a f**k boy. Like, using his good looks and charm and getting as many women as possible (sometimes multiple at the same time), proposing crazy ideas and fantasies, acting them out, making them do weird things, rarely going all the way with a woman because he doesn‚Äôt want to get an STI but still making them do really nasty stuff, calling women names when they reject him, or rejecting women because they won‚Äôt do certain things, making them have sex with his friends while he watched. Again, this hookup thing ended many years ago, but it feels just as bad hearing it now. 

My dad is definitely what you‚Äôd call unstable...he‚Äôll say something, it‚Äôd get a rise out of people and then he‚Äôd so deeply regret it that he‚Äôd be a sobbing mess. It‚Äôs like he has this massive ego but at the same time it‚Äôs equally as fragile. He gets so disappointed in himself, says he‚Äôs done, even deactivates his Twitter, but then he‚Äôs back at it in no time. We‚Äôve had so many fights about how humiliating he is, they‚Äôre not even fights, just me screaming at him and him crying and begging for my forgiveness. 

Basically lately it has been come very apparent to me over the last few years that my own father is the type of guy that I should be avoiding. He is a great dad for the most part. I‚Äôve never been neglected, he‚Äôs always put me first and loved me unconditionally, but there‚Äôs this other side of him, like he‚Äôs living a double life, that‚Äôs this terrible person who‚Äôs arrogant and dangerous that I don‚Äôt even recognize. 

He admits he‚Äôs exploited women and treated them horribly, at this point I definitely think he wants to change. His Twitter has been deactivated for a few months now which is a record. But he must still have this proclivity and that freaks me out. 

I‚Äôm at a crossroads, I feel inclined to leave, but also there may still be a chance that he can get better. I have no doubt he has undiagnosed mental illness, the therapist has alluded to bipolar and mild autism spectrum disorder but he needs to see a psychiatrist which he‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt done yet.

Our therapist said that we need to give up on the idea that we will ever have a normal father-daughter relationship and an open book approach is ideal when it comes to his past so I‚Äôm not accidentally believing lies, but it‚Äôs hard. My dad is *that* guy. I love him, he‚Äôs always been the only person I could rely on. As I mentioned before, it‚Äôs just me and him. He never had a wife, never had any other kids, we‚Äôve always lived away from his parents since I was a baby. He‚Äôs my everything. But I feel like I have to choose between either leaving him or having a relationship knowing the things that I know. It feels impossible. I hate it. Any advice/suggestions?",04May2020,1
1041,"So I‚Äôm a 29 year old woman. My son and I unfortunately live in the same condominium complex as my parents. (They moved here a year ago and when things went to shit like my relationship and my temp job, I decided to move my son and I to Florida, too.) My point is, when I was 14 years old, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. Before I had a big seizure, I had small ones, often. They started out like little twitches, I would often come out of the mini seizure confused and if i were holding something like a glass of water, I would have broken it bc I obviously couldn‚Äôt control it. when this started, my parents accused me of faking it, saying I was just looking for attention, until it progressed into a big seizure and I was finally diagnosed with epilepsy, well, no fucking shit. Great job mom and dad. Fast forward to about 4 years ago and my dad helped me find a job. He got an interview set up for me. The same day I was supposed to attend that interview, that morning I felt very dizzy and disoriented. Turns out my neurologist prescribed me way too high of a dose in one of my medications that I was trying to switch to. When I was laying almost lifeless on the couch I managed to call my parents, again, my dad was irritated, telling me I was ruining his time at the gym and that I was doing everything in my power to not go to the job interview that he had worked hard to set up for me. I ended up being rushed to the hospital and once again, the doctors proved them wrong, that there was in fact something wrong with me. Fast forward to now. I have a son. I‚Äôm a single mom and sometimes get the help I need since my parents are just up a few floors from us. As you all know, we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic. Yesterday and today, I‚Äôve had a sore throat. Yesterday it seemed to be hiring off and on but today, it‚Äôs worse. I asked them to please watch my kid and take over his home schooling for me since it‚Äôs probably in my and their best  interest for me to isolate myself. A few hours go by and my dads frustrated and overwhelmed. He calls me up. I throw on a face mask and go up, I distance myself but talk to them all (son, mom &amp; dad) I explained that i will stand at the door of my parents spare room so that I can make sure my son reads a nice book before bed tonight but that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable laying in bed with him till he falls asleep. My dad then tells me, yet again, I‚Äôm faking my symptoms. I ended up just fucking absolutely losing it on him. I told him that this is almost abusive. As I‚Äôm over here freaking out not knowing whether these symptoms will get worse and wondering if I have the fucking coronavirus. I get yelled at for yelling at them. I literally, hate him. Is this not borderline abuse? Him constantly telling me I‚Äôm faking things ‚Äúfor attention‚Äù he thinks I‚Äôm looking for attention bc a. I called my friend who was visiting last week and asked her if she has been feeling okay since leaving since I‚Äôm feeling sick and b. I called my coworker who I worked with last week to make sure he has been feeling okay, too. Just to get a better sense of what I may have bc if one of the people i was with also didn‚Äôt feel good, then that would make me worry more. But... what do I do about this? I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. There‚Äôs so much more to his bullshit than I‚Äôm saying here but he‚Äôs a fucking prick.

1042,"Currently, I am living on the opposite side on the country as my family as I am in the middle of an internship right now. In the next couple weeks, I will end my current internship and then start a new one at a different company located near to where I am currently living. They have given me two options:

1. Stay where I am and receiving corporate housing meaning I would essentially be living in an apartment for no costs

2. Go home to stay with my family and receive a monthly stipend of ~2k

Now, I can‚Äôt decide between which choice to make as they both are desirable. I would like to remain where I am currently living to avoid taking a very long flight home that involves a layover (My flight leaves at 1am and I eventually land back at home at noon). I also would be in a different time zone difference of approximately 3hr from the company I would be interning at which is a bit undesirable but I would be willing to be flexible to change my work schedule. I am also a bit biased to stay where I am now because I have a lot more freedom in my current living situation and I have friends nearby who work at the same company I‚Äôll be interning at so it will be easy to reach out to them if needed. A con though is that it is not guaranteed that I will be living alone and could potentially end up with a roommate. I also do not know the location of my place in advance either so I don‚Äôt know if I will be located somewhere safe with stores nearby within walking distance if I need to go grocery shopping. That‚Äôs not too bad but it‚Äôs also something to consider.

On the other hand, I am college student with student loans. Staying at home with my family means I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry too much about buying groceries very often or cooking meals as I would have my family to help me. I typically spend $50-$100 on groceries each week currently and so it would be nice to cut down on that. The stipend of an extra $2k every month is very tempting to help pay off loans and just save the extra money. I am not sure how ideal a WFH situation would be back at my home as my internet used to sometimes be a bit sketchy from what I remember and I am not sure how much I can focus on my work without being distracted by family members. Both my parents and siblings are all WFH right now so that is also important to consider as we will all be using the internet and/or having meetings, etc. As I mentioned, there‚Äôs also a time zone difference which isn‚Äôt that big of a deal but important to consider. 

The broke college student in me really wants that extra money but it‚Äôs also super important to me that I set myself up to work successfully and ultimately receive a return offer from the company. Going home sounds nice as I rarely am back at home, but I know I sometimes go a little crazy after being around my entire family for too long. Once I make my decision, the company won‚Äôt let me change my mind. Any advice if your were in my situation would be helpful, thanks a lot!",04May2020,1

1048,"I (25) have an older sister (27) whose diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder since last year. But this could have been going on since she was 13 because I remember her being very volatile.

When she‚Äôs depressed, she‚Äôs crying to the point where we can‚Äôt console, posts statuses that she wants to kill herself on FB or her boyfriend (now ex...I‚Äôll get into that) will tell us she wants to harm herself. When I confront her sometimes about these msgs, she acts perfectly fine or doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it.  It seems like a sick game at this point where she‚Äôs always expressing suicide. 

She‚Äôs been in therapy for many years, medication and she is fully functional &amp; productive. It feels like there is nothing in this world that will help. She‚Äôs never happy. 

Recently, her boyfriend broke up with her because she cheated on him which led her into a spiral. The other day we tried carrying her to the hospital because she was having suicidal thoughts but things didn‚Äôt workout and she came home of which I didn‚Äôt approve of. She‚Äôs going back in today tho but my dad is carrying her.

I‚Äôve been going through this since I was 11 basically and it‚Äôs been hard on me mentally. My parents are expecting me to always figure out what‚Äôs going on with her. 

Sometimes when I hear her crying, I don‚Äôt even bother to check in because I can‚Äôt handle it. I just want to distance myself from her and not have to worry about checking in on her anymore sometimes. I feel like cutting her off.

1053,"So I‚Äôm a 29 year old woman. My son and I unfortunately live in the same condominium complex as my parents. (They moved here a year ago and when things went to shit like my relationship and my temp job, I decided to move my son and I to Florida, too.) My point is, when I was 14 years old, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. Before I had a big seizure, I had small ones, often. They started out like little twitches, I would often come out of the mini seizure confused and if i were holding something like a glass of water, I would have broken it bc I obviously couldn‚Äôt control it. when this started, my parents accused me of faking it, saying I was just looking for attention, until it progressed into a big seizure and I was finally diagnosed with epilepsy, well, no fucking shit. Great job mom and dad.

Fast forward to about 4 years ago and my dad helped me find a job. He got an interview set up for me. The same day I was supposed to attend that interview, that morning I felt very dizzy and disoriented. Turns out my neurologist prescribed me way too high of a dose in one of my medications that I was trying to switch to. When I was laying almost lifeless on the couch I managed to call my parents, again, my dad was irritated, telling me I was ruining his time at the gym and that I was doing everything in my power to not go to the job interview that he had worked hard to set up for me. I ended up being rushed to the hospital and once again, the doctors proved them wrong, that there was in fact something wrong with me.

Fast forward to now. I have a son. I‚Äôm a single mom and sometimes get the help I need since my parents are just up a few floors from us. As you all know, we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic. Yesterday and today, I‚Äôve had a sore throat. Yesterday it seemed to be hiring off and on but today, it‚Äôs worse. I asked them to please watch my kid and take over his home schooling for me since it‚Äôs probably in my and their best  interest for me to isolate myself. A few hours go by and my dads frustrated and overwhelmed. He calls me up. I throw on a face mask and go up, I distance myself but talk to them all (son, mom &amp; dad) I explained that i will stand at the door of my parents spare room so that I can make sure my son reads a nice book before bed tonight but that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable laying in bed with him till he falls asleep. My dad then tells me, yet again, I‚Äôm faking my symptoms. I ended up just fucking absolutely losing it on him. I told him that this is almost abusive. As I‚Äôm over here freaking out not knowing whether these symptoms will get worse and wondering if I have the fucking coronavirus. I get yelled at for yelling at them. I literally, hate him. Is this not borderline abuse? Him constantly telling me I‚Äôm faking things ‚Äúfor attention‚Äù he thinks I‚Äôm looking for attention bc a. I called my friend who was visiting last week and asked her if she has been feeling okay since leaving since I‚Äôm feeling sick and b. I called my coworker who I worked with last week to make sure he has been feeling okay, too. Just to get a better sense of what I may have bc if one of the people i was with also didn‚Äôt feel good, then that would make me worry more.

But... what do I do about this? I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. There‚Äôs so much more to his bullshit than I‚Äôm saying here but he‚Äôs a fucking prick. Just need to vent and mostly need advice on what to do and how to handle this.",04May2020,1
1054,"I (35F) have been in this lockdown for a while now, I deleted dating apps since I figure everyone would be just wasting my time and actually it was very relieving for a while. I enjoyed doing my stuff and the feeling of constantly looking at pictures and having small talk was so stressful..it was great until sometime. Now my work is consuming a lot and tbh it's not doing very well. I am extremely unproductive and just basically frustrated. I do try to run and walk in the evenings and past few days I have been meditating (really helpful). But I am inherently just irritated that I have no one to go to to forget my miserable life.

Having someone of the opposite sex is honestly helpful when you don't have to think about work and they flirt a bit, be romantic and it's such a huge detox time.

Also, when I'm having a conversation I feel like I go too on depth in person and over text... it shows over text because sometimes my messages can get fairly long.

Now to where I need your advice: I only bought the motorcycle to drive to work, I am still in school, and so I can have the personal freedom of driving anywhere, which I appreaciate. But a car has been very appealing to me, because.... a car....... it has a roof, you dont need no Security clothing (how is this called in Englisch?) and you can take more friends with you and any other benefit a car has you can Imagine. 
But should I sell my motorcycle to buy a car as soon as I am old enough? Because I will clearly buy an other motorcycle when I have a stable Job with enough money to buy a fine one. But I could get anywhere with a car even when the weather is Bad. But i kinda think my parents will look down to me, because I could not hold my motorcycle for more than 2 years.

1067,"I'm 18M and I'm going to be living with my family for the next 3-4 years of my college life. Things have been very tense lately in my household ever since this quarantine situation started. My father and mother have been getting into progressively more intense arguments and I fear that this may lead to a divorce. I love both of my parents very much and can't imagine being split away from one of them while I'm still living with them but it seems as though the current circumstances may lead to me having to choose between the two.

It wasn't like this when I was younger, but now a days my parents can't even face each other without it getting tense. They've had arguments in the past but they always end up resolving it after a day or two. After one of the recent arguments, they've stopped talking to each other entirely and have been cold to each other. Both of them appear to be fed up with the situation.

My father is a very smart great guy but he is cold when it comes to romance with my mother which makes me wonder how they even got married in the first place. He also gets easily frustrated and angry especially when talking with my mother. He is very independent in a way that hinders my mother's attempts at trying to make him happy. He's the kind of person that when asked what they want as a present, they would believe anything you buy for them is a waste of money. He is also a bit prideful, he has difficulty admitting to when he has made a mistake and will get angry if you confront him about it. When he's angry, he uses a tone of voice that irritates my mom when she's trying to be nice. In fact, he doesn't know how to calmly resolve an argument without raising his voice and getting angry. He always wants the best for me and my sister but he has very bad anger issues and doesn't believe he does.

My mother, on the other hand, is a kind loving woman but she isn't very smart and is delusional. After an argument, when I came to comfort her, she told me that she thought that my father was manipulating me and my sister to ""be more like a monster"" like my father. She doesn't know how to properly socialize and has difficulty understanding conversations causing problematic misunderstandings. At heart, she always is trying to help and is constantly trying to make us happy but she has difficulty understanding when no means no. When she offers my father something, she continues to ask even after he tells her he doesn't want it which irritates my father quickly. She has a tendency to say things she shouldn't that causes people to get mad at her. She want's to be more romantic with my father but he shows zero interest in romance anymore. She's a great mom but she essentially has the social-intelligence of a child and she's stuck in the past.

Me and my sister have tried talking to both of them but our efforts have bared no fruit. I am beginning to get fed up with both of them. My father is too prideful to change and can't calmly resolve arguments. While, on the other hand, my mother is stuck in the past and just doesn't understand what my father really wants. There have not been any violent encounters yet but I believe that is because me and my sister intervene when arguments get too heated. I'm getting sick of it and it tears me apart to imagine my life without the two of them to the point where I can no longer focus on my own life.

I don't know what to do anymore. It's only a matter of time before another fight breaks out and they finally get a divorce which might just be for the best.",04May2020,1
1068,"There is this man I‚Äôve lightly known for about 10 years. Made me uncomfortable when I met him and has made me uncomfortable since.
He would message me regularly and sometimes I would engage in *friendly* conversation until it got uncomfortable. I tried to make it clear I wasn‚Äôt interested in pursuing anything beyond that. As far as I was concerned we were barely on each-other‚Äôs periphery. We were not close and we didn‚Äôt know each-other well either.

When I moved away from where I met him and entered into a serious relationship, he mostly left me alone.
However, I moved back about a year and a half ago. He sent me messages asking if I had come back and persistently tried to get me to go to his house. Also guilt tripped me for not seeing him on his birthday. The messages would come intensely and in waves. I tried to respond as little as possible and was discouraging.

He also began physically stalking me. We bumped into each-other whilst I was with a colleague during my lunch break. I politely said hello and did not give him the opportunity to start a conversation as we were trying to get somewhere.

(We had physically spoken at a social before and the conversation was pleasant and interesting enough but I had not expected him to be there at all.)

I went outside again the next day on my own and I caught him aimlessly loitering in exactly the same spot.

I caught him doing this a few times but sometimes he was quicker at seeing me than the opposite. He tried to convince me to abandon my colleague at one point and when that didn‚Äôt work invited himself to come with us. I made a comment about only having minutes and got the fuck away.
I started asking my colleague if we could change routes and the moment I mentioned why she understood. We changed routes and I still managed to see him aimlessly wandering around where he‚Äôd seen us before. Literally not going anywhere. Just waiting. The messages still continued to pour in and had become more intensive so I just tried to ignore them and figured he would just decide that I wasn‚Äôt using the app. We bumped into him again and he made a weird and veiled threat about bashing my head in.

When I stopped going out during the day, I saw him on my morning walk to work once or twice, loitering again. He has told me he doesn‚Äôt even live anywhere near where I kept seeing him.

The messages continued but since lockdown they have been coming through like crazy. I‚Äôve really tried to avoid using this app and haven‚Äôt responded to a single message. I can‚Äôt even open the message to identify everything he has been saying *at* me because if I open it he will know. I saw one message two days ago asking if I was into vampirism now (no idea where he has got this impression from) and I did catch a message today in my notification bar in which he told me he loved me and sent a bunch of hearts and now I‚Äôm just concerned.

I think he is suffering with some kind of erotomania and given his veiled threat and I am concerned he is eventually going to harm me.

I can‚Äôt continue ignoring him because this feels like it is getting slowly worse. I am becoming more and more nervous of outright rejecting him due to the potential of rapidly worsening or violent behaviour and I don‚Äôt feel like I can go to the police. I don‚Äôt particularly want to ruin the man‚Äôs life and I‚Äôm entirely sure how they could help without him feeling as though he has been wronged.

I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with creepy behaviour but I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I have not encouraged it in the slightest and if anything I‚Äôve tried to discourage it without risk.

Can anyone offer any advice on how to safely calm this down or stop it?

TLDR: I‚Äôve been getting stalked physically and  through social media by a man who has threatened me and today he sent a message saying he loves me. This has made me concerned about how I can deal with this without the risk of possibly being attacked.",04May2020,1
