0,"So this guy and I are pretty close. He is like a brother to me but we aren’t related by blood (just to clarify). We joke around, laugh, and hang out often. Like I said he always referred to me as being like a sister, but more recently he’s been acting different. Like he’s been reaching for my hand and holding it. He even kissed it a couple of times, the second time he he kissed my hand he held his lips on my hand for a while. Another night a group of friends including him and I had a sleepover movie night. We stayed up until everyone fell asleep and just talked. He held my hand until he fell asleep. I then laid on his back. He woke up just to kiss me on the forehead and rub my back. After that night he never said anything and I didn’t just for the sake of it. Yesterday when we hung out, we were talking about what our goals in life were and the idea of what we wanted our future partner to be like came up. Well let’s just say his physical description didn’t even minorly resemble my appearance. I asked him if he thought any guy would find me attractive, not in a needy kind of way, but more so hoping that he would say that he thought I was pretty. But he then went on to say that he couldn’t see me like that because I’m like a sister to him. A bit discouraged I laid on the floor. He laid down to give me a hug and then we just laid their for a bit. Then he put his leg on top of my stomach and began to put his finger on my lips. I was really nervous but I decided to break myself and moved his fingers to trace my lips. I could legit see his heart beat pounding through his neck. He kept getting closer. Then stuttered “I lo. I lo” and just closed his eyes. He tried to lean in for a kiss but tbh I was nervous so I pulled back. Then he kept pushing up his crotch area on my side multiple times, obviously he had a boner. I told him to stop. He stayed hugging me until I got up. Pleas lmk what you think.",04Aug2020,1
1,"My dad always cares about politics and everyday he turns on the tv and puts on whichever channel that talks about politics the most.

I understand that there’s nothing wrong with that since everyone has something they like but everyday my dad threatens to live on the street while I’m still in school every day he tells me that I will learn a lesson the hard way if I dont support his favorite presidential candidate. He calls the supporters of other presidential candidates r******* and stupid. 

He claims that he doesn’t care about politics and I’m done with it. I asked my friends this and they said that my dad is acting immature and should stop. I am so surprised that i even have to ask my friends and post on here. 

If you have any suggestions on how to make my dad stop this nonsense it would be greatly appreciated

6,"Obligatory first time posting and on mobile. Title says it all really but I went out for drinks with 3 of my friends on my birthday (all 19f). Friend K was meant to give the other 2 a lift home and was designated driver. 

  When we got to the bar I got sent a lot of free drinks since it was my birthday and so we drank more than anticipated however friend K decided to drink just as much too. In total she had 2 sourz shots, 1 or 2 tequila rose shots, a glass of sparkling wine, a jaegar bomb a  fire bomb and most of a glass of gin and lemonade. (she ordered the gin and lemonade of her own accord, it was enough to keep her barely under the limit and then ordered shots as well).

  Since the others had gone for dinner and I had only joined for drinks, I had organised a lift home from my dad. As friend K drank more I became more and more concerned for my other friends and could tell they were uncomfortable with the situation. Eventually I told them I could sort a lift instead of going home with K who was certainly over the limit and they gratefully accepted. 

  Over the course of the evening we tried several times to persuade her to come home with my dad too (we were observing COVID guidelines in our country and as a result of consumer uncertainty all parking was free) saying I would even drive her back in the morning when we were all sober to collect her car. She was adamant she was fine to drive. We told her it was dangerous and she wasnt good to drive and practically begged her to come home with the rest of us but she refused. We even got a mutual friend who was also there to come over and comment on how she seemed super drunk and mention she shouldn't drive (trying to get an outside perspective), they even drank some of the alcohol to stop her from getting anymore drunk (it wasnt an issue they weren't overstepping we were all really grateful for it and if shed have drank anymore she would have been stumbling around). 

Basically the advice I'm looking for here is how should I go about this if it happens again? We got my dad to drive to her home to check she got home okay  (she was so drunk she showed him cat videos whilst he politely told her drink driving is not worth the risk and how dangerous it was). Also how do I address this with her once we are both sober without pushing her away so that she actually listens? My dad suggested we take her keys but we were worried if we tried she might get angry and defensive which could put her more at risk of an accident since it would have been hard to get the keys successfully and then take her home. 

Really sorry for the long post and please let me know if I'm posting in the wrong sub. I really appreciate any advice on the situation (it was my first time dealing with this so I was panicking quite a bit)",04Aug2020,1
7,"I remember as a kid, getting copied is quite literally the worst thing in the world. You ask for a snack, and then instantly your sibling wants a snack too - it was infuriating. Now that I'm an adult, I haven't really given much thought to 'copying', but I've been told that I copied people and it bothers them, and now it's something I'm worried of doing. 

I do it unintentionally. Someone'll use a word, and later on it'll just be in my head and I'll use it without really remembering they used it first. Or somebody plays a game excessively, and I think to myself, ""They seem to really like it. I should get it, I might enjoy it as well"". I recently dyed my hair the exact same shade of blue as a friend of mine, (I went in to have lighter blue, but was told that said shade would stick longer. I was also original going to get a different color, but was told it would fade into an ugly color.) Now, I've been considering getting a game, because I've seen a friend play it a lot, and it's a popular game that I figure could last me for a while, it honestly seems fun.

I don't want it to come across as though I'm copying. It's subconsciously, things just stick in my head. The opposite of 'Out of sight, out of mind', instead it's 'In sight, stuck in my head'. I really don't want to bug people, I honestly didn't know it was something that bugged people. Should I just hold off on getting the game and stay away from things people I know are doing?",04Aug2020,1

They put their clothes in the wash and take a shower when home but have to use the bathroom when they come back in work clothes. They use it before their shower.

I'm tired of constantly cleaning. I'm so tired and the skin on my hands looks like shit. If I bring it up to them they will be mad because admittedly I can be too much since Corona with cleaning. I'm just so tired and I need to know is it safe to use that bathroom, can I not clean it?",04Aug2020,1
9,"Hello, don't know where to post this to be honest. I'm playing a game with a friend and he's a native speaker and i'm not.

Somehow i get really anxious when i'm in a call with him and i have to speak english? It gets to the point i'm mainly silent and it's like he's talking to himself. I feel so damn bad about it but i can't help myself? I can't bring myself to talk more than a few words when he says something, or i say nothing at all and i don't even know why i do this! I'm so annoyed at myself. Doesn't help that i'm kinda into the guy lol. Whenevee the call ends i'm so mad i didn't talk more. Calling in my language is no problem btw. i'm only anxious when i talk english with friends.

I'm sure it bothers him because he has mentioned stuff like why we even call because we (but actually just me..) don't talk. He didn't say it in a rude way more in a joking way or whatever. I thought maybe i should tell him tomorrow that speaking english makes me anxious so at least he understands i'm not doing it on purpose?

My actual question is, will i improve over time because we only just started calling some weeks ago? The thing is i've known him for a couple years so it's not that i'm not comfortable with him.

What can i do to be less anxious and awkward? Just push myself to keep calling with people? Ugh. Wish i wouldn't be this way.",04Aug2020,1

13,"TLDR: I guess as a way to save y'all from the too wordy explanation below: I don't think I'm confident in my abilities to move out despite the fact that people have told me I should be proud of what I've accomplished and where I am. How do I get over this? What steps do I take? What can I do to actually feel like an adult? Am I actually ready?  


For background, I (F24) I currently work a full time job with access to insurance, 401 K, and other smaller perks if desired, with room and opportunity to grow. It's not great pay in the position I'm in currently, but I try to see it as a stepping stone to get where I want to be. I also don't intend to be there forever, of course. In the mean time, however, I also have been shopping around for a second job, just to make sure I have enough money to cover bills, rent, and other odd circumstances that may arise. I also have a side gig of pet sitting and art commissions, it's not consistent enough to make a living off, but most of that money gets put into savings or split off into gas money or at home rent. I've packed away $15,000 in saving, with another paycheck in the next week I can move another $1,000 over to savings as well.  I have a car, one I bought for myself with my own money, however my parents made me sign it in their name when I got it for insurance reasons. I've been trying to separate myself slowly from my parents in other ways as well, like shopping around for car insurance, convincing them to sign my car over to me, trying to establish credit for myself, moving most of the bills attatched to the family accounts to me, but I feel like I don't ever get either their approval or cooperation. I have siblings, both older and younger who get more support and encouragement in many of their decisions. I feel like despite me trying to make all these steps to be more of an adult, I still get treated like a child.   
I have always felt like I never had enough confidence in a lot of my decisions, so much so that it's hindered me in speaking up and advocating for myself. I missed out on having more friends and opportunities because I let me or my family talk me down. I have an unfinished Associates degree that I have only a few credits left to finish, but with being told ""you've taken too long to finish I don't see a reason to celebrate"" It kinda has turned me off from even trying. I feel like sometimes I'm so easily talked out of things and put down by parents that steps I do make to improve myself are just immediately thwarted. I've been trying to better myself despite all of this; building my confidence, building better boundaries for myself, practicing more self love/tolerance, with even intentions of trying to find a therapist to help me combat these issues (but we all know how this year went ayyy).   
   
Living at home has been...rough, and has taken a toll on my mental health, so much so that when my co-workers can tell when I'm no longer pet sitting or away from the family for an extended period of time. I feel like I'm constantly scrutinized and despite the ""you will always be welcome here"" feels less on the daily an honest and true statement. My mom is usually the one home now, and it's clear she doesn't seem as invested in our relationship as I've tried to be. I feel ignored and talked down to, with a lot of disinterest just in general whenever I try to engage with her and ""be a part of this family"". She doesn't do this to my other sisters. Things aren't always bad, but when they're bad, it feels almost impossible to escape.  


I don't know if really any of this information is any help to weave the situation I'm in. I'm really trying to do better and be more mature, but I don't know if I'm doing enough or if what I've been doing is actually beneficial to my end goal. It's almost at point now where if I don't get over myself and do something about this, I feel like I'm going to be stuck here for the rest of my life with my family holding it over me, and just unable to just feel like a separate person I feel like sometimes I don't have any realistic expectations of what I should be doing and it often deters me from trying some of the time.  I appreciate any advice I can get on this topic, thanks.",04Aug2020,1

Okay, so I embarrassed myself in public due to my anxiety. It’s pretty personal so I won’t talk about it here, but I will talk about the recording. I had a couple of people looking at me, and now that I think back at it one may have had a phone on me. The thing I’m concerned about is if they post the video on YOUTUBE, or some other websites/platforms. 

Just to let you know I’m a teenager. So, I do go in school, and I’d be very embarrassed to see this. A video of me crying on YouTube. I want to pack my bags and move to japan!(Japan is my dream vacation). But I can’t.

Hi  all! A couple weeks ago I sent 280$  to a friend who was supposed to  send me a package (weed), since he knew how to do this sort of stuff and  that I didn't (I've known him for 2 years now). Unfortunatly after a  while of messaging back and fourth the package never arrived and he  ghosted me. Today I tried calling him and he blocked me everywhere.

17,"Pretty much venting out my frustration, I'm sorry for the length of this

Tired of being pathetic. I've (19M) always been in unlucky situations, with unreasonable wishes out of life. 

I'm in love with a girl who I've seen a few times with a common friend. We get along great and have stuff in common. But she has a boyfriend and I'm going back to college in another country in a few weeks.

I feel like I have a peter pan complex, or obsessive way of thinking, or I'm just really immature, I don't know. These examples of unreasonable wishes/desires are the only things that get me excited in life.

A few years ago, I wanted to be an astronaut even tho I suck at math and science, and I knew it was close to impossible, but no other careers seemed interesting at all. In high school, I was in love with several girls (different times), but never did anything because I had no clue on how to proceed, viewed this as a mission.

I'm not interested in what I'm studying right now, but I'm not interested in anything else either.

I don't wanna live like this anymore, no days are exciting at all, barely feel like doing anything, hanging out with friends isn't that fun, a f\*cking failure, I don't feel attached to my family, so I feel like a worthless assh\*le, whatever.

So recently ive just been appearing offline but i hate doing this behind his back. I try to push him to make friends but he refuses.

24,"TL;DR: I accidentally backed into my neighbor’s mailbox while pulling out of my driveway. He wants it completely replaced (~$2,000) but I received a quote to sufficiently fix it for $300. Unsure of how to proceed.

—

So, I’ve had a doozy of a day.

I was in a rush this afternoon and accidentally backed into my neighbor’s mailbox, knocking it over. I 100% accept responsibility for it and admit that I am solely at fault. After realizing what happened, I got out of my car, surveyed the damaged, snapped some pictures, and then went to my neighbor’s front door. I rang the doorbell three times and lingered a bit longer, but no one answered. I would’ve stayed but like I said, I was seeing to an urgent matter, so I taped a note to my neighbor’s door explaining what happened, insisting I’d cover all damages, and left my number to iron out the details. 

Fast forward a few hours and I get a call while I’m still out of the house. I recognized the area code so I pick up, and was met with a guy screaming a slew of obscenities. I understand it’s a nasty surprise to stumble upon, but still, there’s no need for that. During his rant, he name dropped the brand of mailbox it was (as if I was supposed to recognize it) and insisted it would cost at least $2,000 to replace. I thought he was exaggerating, but I obviously didn’t say anything in the moment. Instead, I promised him I’d make it right and that we could speak in person when I returned home. 

I thought he was exaggerating, but I guess not. I looked up the price catalog for the brand of mailboxes he mentioned, and they really are all in the $1,000-$2,000 range because they’re essentially just marble and granite slabs will mailboxes sitting on top of them. 

Before returning home I asked my cousin to meet me there. Partly because he’s a big dude and I thought his mere presence could help keep the situation under control, but also because he’s a contractor. When we get there my neighbor’s sitting on his porch, obviously a few beers deep. I introduce myself and apologize again and he hurls obscenities my way. I ignore it and ask if we can take a lot at the mailbox and he points to it toppled over on the lawn. 

My cousin looked at it and made two important distinctions. One, it wasn’t properly mounted. It looked as if it had been knocked over before by someone other than me, and he had tried to cheaply patch it with some molding putty. The rebar beam inside the pillar was incredibly rusty as well. Meaning if it hadn’t been my car that knocked it over, it could’ve just as well been someone leaning against it a little too much. His second point was that the pillar had been knocked back onto his lawn rather than the street, and as such didn’t look damaged. We thoroughly inspected it and agreed that with a quick scrub and cost of polish, it’d look good as new. All in all, my cousin, who has mounted similar mailboxes, estimated it would cost somewhere around $300 to properly remount it. Still an expense, but definitely one more manage than $2,000.

We suggested this to my neighbor, but he wasn’t having it. He’s insisting I pay $2,000 to full on replace it. I simply told him I wouldn’t be able to afford that much of an expense at the moment, and he insisted I go through insurance (which would drive my premiums up tremendously).

Does anyone have any advice on how I can state my plea? Has anyone been in a similar situation? If I truly have to bite the bullet and replace it for him, it is what it is. But I’m hoping it doesn’t come to that.",04Aug2020,1
25,"Hello reddit, it's my first time posting here and I apologise for rambling. My father's mom has passed away and in my heart I want to console him. I don't know how to approach the situation, I don't know what to say. He has always been in my life physically, but distantly emotionally. There's a couple of happy memories of playing basketball or learning to ride my bike. However, the only really strong emotions that I've witnessed really strongly was a lot of anger. I've never been told that I was loved or cared by him and vice versa. I've never been told he was proud of me. For my teen years and the beginning of my adolescence I've struggled with this as well as handling my emotions.
My father was never really close to her at least not from my point of view. She was always within a reasonable travel time, but we just never visited. There's a bit of family drama there too, but I'm not too sure of the details and don't wish to elaborate. Other than this time the only time my father has cried was when a sibling died. My father also has this thing for the shifting blame over to my mom as a sort of scape goat to help him cope.
Anyways how should I talk to him? I think the best way is letting him mourn and then well idk telling him I care about him a lot and giving him a hug. Don't think it would be well received though.",04Aug2020,1

But it just feels like an interruption to what I'm doing. I'm supposed to be interested in what he says, because any good friend would, but I'm just not.

Weed has the same (if not less) amount of negative effects as alcohol does so it just feels like discrimination.

So turns out John changed, which I’m proud of him for, especially since he has a girlfriend, but I have a feeling something is up. 

Sarah has always gotten touchy with John in the pool, trying to dunk him in the water, splashing him etc. nothin wierd, btw she never does that to me, or barely does. They have also switched clothes for a little bit, (obviously still fully clothed) John wearing a crop top and short shorts,with Sarah wearing a big hoodie. They have also hung out just them a lot recently, and I think Sarah has feelings for John, and I think John feels the same way. I feel jealous, but idk way. 

So first he has a girlfriend, so he shouldn’t make a move unless John was single. Second of all, I don’t think John is a good influence, he curses almost non-stop, he almost only cares about himself, (I think, he acts like it, but I’m on 100% sure). But most of all, which hits me the most, I don’t want them dating. I don’t want Sarah and John to be dating, I’m not sure if I have feelings for Sarah or not, but I don’t want them dating, yes I want Sarah to be happy, but John doesn’t really talk to his girlfriend much. I don’t want Sarah to be treated poorly. I am getting really stressed out (and I am pretty sure jealous; which I haven’t been jealous before) about this

I really need advice on this one. I don’t know what to do, almost for once in my life, I don’t know what to do.",04Aug2020,1

37,"Sorry for the long post, especially that I think my problem is not that of a deal but, I will be very happy if I get some advice here.

So, after after a quiet long school year, I finally finished my exams and I have less than a month of vacation before I return to the uni to take my practical classes which were delayed from last school year due to COVID.

I am afraid to go out alot because people here don't care about safety measures and my two friends don't go out that often.

So, I am stuck at home and to be honest, I have been most of my life, I never had friends to go out with and my parents don't do that as well.

Anyways, in the past, I played games and read books, sometimes, I watched some series and movies but, now I don't want to do anything, or to be more accurate, I want to do things but, don't do anything.

It's common here to pirate stuff but, I know I should pay for the things I consume but, because I no longer do much things, I pirated stuff when I wanted to consume them because I may watch a movie a month so I don't watch to pay for Netflix to watch one movie.

However, I decided I need to chance, watching a movie is not the best way one can spend time doing but, it is way better than my endless result-less ""thinking of what to do but, not doing anything in the end"" sessions.

So, I downloaded some games from GOG which I owned in the past and subscribed to Netflix, and for two days, I have been feeling positive and that I will play games and watch stuff but, at the end of the day, I found I only watched a few YouTube videos, again, watching some informative videos is good but, no one spends his life doing that and I never found any one interested to talk with me about these ""informative"" things.

So, what I am thinking about now is to reset my phone to factory settings (and I do that as a part of me being fed up with my life and wanting to start fresh at least once a week), and reinstall Windows (for the same reason I format my phone, except this happens once a month because I don't use the laptop much, not because I become wiser with laptop).

I know there are way way more real problems out there but, I have been in this loop for 2-3 years now and I am doing nothing with my life, I know these things are not that productive or useful but, at least, they are things that can be done, they I think are better than doing nothing.",04Aug2020,1
38,"Hello reddit, it's my first time posting here and I apologise for rambling. My father's mom has passed away and in my heart I want to console him. I don't know how to approach the situation, I don't know what to say. He has always been in my life physically, but distantly emotionally. There's a couple of happy memories of playing basketball or learning to ride my bike. However, the only really strong emotions that I've witnessed really strongly was a lot of anger and at one point I used to hate him. I've never been told that I was loved or cared by him and vice versa. I've never been told he was proud of me. For my teen years and the beginning of my adolescence I've struggled with this as well as handling my emotions. 
My father was never really close to her at least not from my point of view. She was always within a reasonable travel time, but we just never visited. There's a bit of family drama there too, but I'm not too sure of the details and don't wish to elaborate. Other than this time the only time my father has cried was when a sibling died. My father also has this thing for the shifting blame over to my mom as a sort of scape goat to help him cope and idk if it will happen this time.
Anyways how should I approach talking to him? I think the best way is letting him mourn and then well idk telling him I care about him a lot, I love him and giving him a hug. Don't think it would be well received though and it would be my first time saying that to him. 

Thank you",04Aug2020,1
39,"Hello all,

I live in a nicer apartment complex in a wealthier neighborhood. The units are far enough apart that you don’t really hear a whole lot of the other tenants. However, the unit above me creates massive amounts of noise all day and well into the early hours of the morning. As in past 1 am. I’m used to living in apartments and experiencing the amount of noise that people create. I mean, my first apartment was filled with drug abuse and violence. But what’s happening in the unit above me sounds *awful*. Muffled screams, objects being thrown around, what sounds like bodies falling to the floor and more. Even visitors at my apartment comment on how terrible it sounds upstairs. 

I’m worried for the safety of the occupants. I sent the leasing office an email about the noise and my concern for the well-being of the tenants and I have heard nothing back. The happenings upstairs are getting worse and worse. I know I can call in a wellness check but I don’t really know how to do that. The PD in my area really only show up if it’s an imminent emergency. But I have seen them respond to a noise complaint on the unit next door to me, so maybe they will respond to this. I don’t know what to do and I am genuinely worried about the occupants of the unit above me. What do I do?",04Aug2020,1

43,"After Breaking up with my ex, I've been a trench of loneliness. This Covid quarantine makes it even worst. I remember the times where I can stay in my room, play single player games , make music on my own and stray from social media easily. But after this heartbreak, I've been so used to having someone to talk to for 24/7 and while I'm driving, waking up, sleeping.   


I know I have friends to go to and family. But for some reason, though they tell me that they're there for me and that they love me. For some reason, this loneliness is hitting different. I feel a sense of void in my heart and it hurts when I'm just sitting in my room, trying to enjoy the things I used to before the relationship. I hate the feeling of nights when I'm alone in my room and the thoughts of ""I don't want to wake up tomorrow"" pops into my head. I catch myself looking back at old instagram photos and listening to music I used to like.   


I know I'm only 20 and older people will tell me that life will get better or that you're still young, but for some reason, I feel like I'm wasting my youth and that after losing someone I loved and got super lucky with, the odds of making memories and finding love in the future seems hopeless...  


I HATE this pandemic to the core, I've never felt so lonely in my life. I miss nightly conversations with the one that got away and I hate going through the internet just to find relationship posts. A part of me knows that this is temporary but at the same time, I just want to see the light again....

Idk why but I got upset because I don't feel like it's disabled me... I don't feel like I shouldn't talk about it either. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make anyone upset but I am sad and I don't know why because many ""normal"" people consider it a disability.

49,"Trigger warning, as here comes a textbook first world problem:

About a year ago, I (w) moved in with a (then recent) friend. So far so good. We had friends over, we cooked together, we sat down and talked about our day and feelings etc. To shorten it: we became quite close. 
Two months ago, she came back from interning in Berlin for 3 months. Our dynamic has completely changed since then. 

She dismisses me when we're with friends, i. e not waiting for me and when being asked ""should we wait for OP?"" says no, but talks it down to a joke Afterwards. Most of the time now, she's making fun of me and the things I like /do/whatever (just me, so it seems and there's more, but that's the most recent stuff.) 

Knowing her and how she hates confrontation, I know something is up and she won't say anything. 
I on the other hand have no interest in fixing things with her, because to me, she's no longer friend material. 

Now here's my question. 

Since we've thrown our stuff together into one household and I can't afford moving houses right now: how do I survive the next few months until we both leave the apartment?",04Aug2020,1
50,"I want to start by saying that I know that people have it much worse than me but  it feels like to me that I have lost so much and I’m scared.

I (22F) made a huge decision for myself a few weeks ago and that was to cut off my best friend who has been extremely abusive. She tells me that everyone hates me and constantly turns other people against me and tells me I should hate all of our mutual friends as well so she can be my only friend. I know that my life is better for it but it also means that I no longer have many mutual friends (she makes them all she me) and I’m very lonely especially since it’s impossible to make new friends in the pandemic.

I was laid off from my very first job after college about a month ago. I loved that job very much even though it was so stressful because I wanted really badly to do a good job, I felt really accomplished when I did something good and I was excited about my work. I was lucky enough to find new work as a receptionist and the people I work with are nice but I feel very sad about my career prospects and I feel like I’m going through the motions each day in a dull job.

This past weekend I had a huge fight with my boyfriend, which has been happening recently. He has a very very bad temper and swerved off the road at high speed and I freaked out and jumped out of the car while it was still moving slowly but he had to come pick me up again because I had no other way home and he saw me walking. But close to my house he did the same thing again and went really fast on the neighborhood street blowing stop signs because he was angry so I got out again and walked home. I think he had a right to be angry in the argument but I don’t think I can excuse this as I’m very afraid of him now. I feel guilty that the argument was my fault but I think we have to break up because this has happened about 5 times and I am scared that he will become abusive because of this.

I have been too depressed to have hobbies so now my life feels very empty with no friends and no boyfriend and a sad job. I have 30 minutes of therapy a week but it feels so slow to fix anything and I don’t feel like I learn anything it just helps to vent.

54,"tl;dr It seems to me that my (ex) girlfriend is a toxic person, I need some second opinions.

I (24M) and her (23M) have known each other since December, been together twice (she wanted a break, then wanted to be together again, then wanted a break again one month later). Since then, she's been a different person. Literally, her personality did a full 180. She's everything she wasn't before and nothing that she was, I don't recognize her anymore. I've been thinking of cutting things off for a while now but never had any 'final straw'. I'd like some second opinions though, it seems to me likes she's a toxic person, my mom, therapist and friends said that too but I'm not sure. I just hope that it was a phase and she'll get back to who she used to be, although it's been happening for more than half the time I've known her, for the past 5 months and only getting worse by the day.

Some things started coming to mind lately. Back in February, I caught the flu. I promised her I'd call her when I got home, but it hit me really hard (fever, chills) and asked her if it's okay to postpone. She got upset and made me promise that I'll never leave her hanging again. I ended up calling her anyway because I didn't want to let her down and we spent 2 hours talking about her. I made her a birthday gift, everyone I told said it was really cute and thoughtful, she said it was creepy (and no, it wasn't). She's called me stupid. Said I'm overreacting when talking about some issues I had, numerous times, she never takes me seriously. What really got to me is that my grandma was not doing great. I love my grandma with all of my heart and she knew it. It happened like three times that she wasn't feeling great and I pointed it out. She never listened to me, asked me about it or showed any interest whatsoever in what I was going through, just saying she hopes it'll be better and then moved on to other topics.

I just came back from the hospital. My grandma had a stroke and she's not doing good, I don't think she'll make it... I told her, as well as two other friends, about what was going on. I'm just destroyed right now... One of those friends tried being here for me, the other literally dropped everything she was doing to talk to me and cheer me up and I found that really helpful... She, however, just told me that she'll say goodbye for today after I told her what happened. She said I need time to be with my family and figure it out. She's just making these decisions for me, of course I'll be with my family, but I needed her and I told her that... I was told that she doesn't know how to react anyway and she was busy.

I don't know, I've never asked for anything, never had any expectations, I've always been there for her (whenever she was going through any personal issues, big or small), always loved her, gave her my attention, time, support, everything. Been giving 110% and getting nothing back. I've always brushed over it, saying it's no big deal, but this just doesn't feel right... What do you guys think?",04Aug2020,1

To the point where, I wasn't really speaking to them and when I did, I was a little sassy or didn't say much. After a very emotional fight, my father agreed that I can do what I want as long as :

1. They know where I am
2. I pay for my car, phone, and car insurance. 

Before this fight, I was planning to take steps to do this over the course of a few months, but now I'm a little overwhelmed now that its here.

Keep or Refund.  
Pros: Keep the game and the price increases I got it for the lower release price; Refund the game and then buy it at a cheaper price after early release ends (if that happens).  
Cons: Keep the game and the price drops meaning I paid more for the game; Refund the game and then buy it at a higher price after early release ends (probably highly likely).

Last year was the worst year of my life and, then with this pandemic,  I moved back in her house and I don't know what to do with my life. at the end of 2019, my relationship with my ex was crumbling as I was too afraid to commit to the relationship and having codependency issues with her, and then she cheated on me, I began to have paranoid episodes, I was drowning with the pressure of the uni and mental health issues, and then suddenly in march I abandon everything because of the pandemic I find myself back in my mother's house, without friends, without independence, lost again as if I was 17. I don't know what will happen on the 2nd semester, if my uni will have  face to face classes again, if I will be able to come back. My WORST FEAR is to get a regular job (I mean not on my field, which is portuguese teacher) and live here with her.... I feel like this would be dead-end

If you read untill here really thank you, I needed to share this with someone  
I want to say that I don't have money to go to therapy although I know it would help me. Also, english is not my native language, but I hope you guys can understand the issue here...",04Aug2020,1
65,"So, I’m moving to college in 5 days. I’m mostly excited for it, but my roommate has me a bit worried. I went to high school with him, and while we weren’t friends, I admire his studiousness and intelligence, even if he’s a bit introverted. However, his overwhelming concern over COVID is worrying me.

Now, I’m not saying that we shouldn’t worry about COVID. In fact, I wear my mask out whenever I’m in public, and I wash my hands constantly. I even didn’t go outside for 2 months from March to May. The problem is that I’ve become more extroverted in the last year. That 2 month period of not leaving the house severely damaged my mental health, and since then, I only hung out with my 2 closest friends, and we never went out to restaurants or anything. 

The part that has me worried is that my roommate mentioned that he’s going to wake up at 5:30am so he doesn’t have to worry about interacting with people while he eats, and when I mentioned that I really want to go home (which is 2 miles away from campus) for my 18th birthday on the 14th of August, he said that that really bothers him, and that he’d rather me do a FaceTime with my family.

I want to communicate to him that I really appreciate that he’s taking COVID seriously, and I plan to as well, but I also need to take care of my mental health, which means that I need to be able to visit home if I need to, and hang out with friends once a week (who also go to the college I’m going to). How do I go about doing that?",04Aug2020,1

Her goal, apparently is to ruin my life, and she’s giving out my phone number to random people and is threatening to get more people onto me. What should I do?",04Aug2020,1

68,"Here a somewhat quick explanation of the situations. FYI I am still in contact with my father although it is not regular. I (23f) have never had a stable relationship with my family. My parents are divorced, my mother has had dementia for the last 12 years so she is removed. Yet I am still in contact with my mothers side of the family. Last year I made the decisions to drop out of college and move to the US temporarily. My mental state was in a terrible place and I just studied because it was expected of me. Because of COVID and other factors I decided to extend me being here for an additional year. Its been helping me to have some space from my family and be my own person. 

Granted I had been lacking in contacting them in this time, but I tried to work myself then to be the mender of relationships in my family. About 4 months I announced this to my family. Since then everyone has been nagging ""go back to college, don't be a disappointment, just do this, come back for your grandmothers birthday etc"" I finally decided this was so bad for mental health so I told them to just write letters to me. My older half sister (33f) took this personal, she said it wouldn't even matter to me if she died or lived, which in case made me ignore her. now my sister is calling me non stop (I am not answering) and spamming me with texts like ""you are my best friend, I cant lose you, I don't even know you anymore"" While my grandma suddenly says that my decision to stay is rather sudden, when I told her 4 months ago. Its all so tiring, the more they push me, the more I feel like the roof is collapsing over my head. I never want to go back to my home country, or see them. I need a break from all of this. I have considered blocking them all, from my sister to even my cousins and not look back. But I feel like such an asshole doing this. Its not like I don't care about them, but I cant do this anymore. What should I do, cut all contact,try to talk them again or some other compromise? I am just so tired or this.

TLDR: my family is berating me for not caring about them and I want to cut all ties to them but I don't know if there is another solutions I am not seeing.",04Aug2020,1
69,"We are in a difficult situation. They call it a “once in a century event” which may be true for society as a whole - but it is not true for our own personal lives.

I want you to really embrace what is happening around you, remember what it is like to have to wear a mask, not able to see friends, perhaps economically struggle. Accept what is going around you. This is a challenge that has been bestowed upon us (whether it is someone else’s fault, a government, a country, our partner) it is your responsibility on how you manage it. 

How you manage it emotionally, economically, physiologically, all aspects. This may sound like a lot of pressure - it would be so much easier to blame everyone else for this, for everything that is happening in our lives. 

It is not to say that we are not all connected, and there is outside influence - but at the end of the day YOU control how you respond; Act don’t react. 

Let this feeling, this pain of the current situation serve as a weapon for the future. Let it be a reminder to make better economic decisions, to appreciate, to complain less, to love more and be kind - let this be the turning point in your life.

70,"ive previously made a couple posts on here for advice on my ex before, (long distance) boyfriend. feel free to read those to help understand.

so my LDR boyfriend who i broke up with about a month or two ago, is basically trying to ruin my life and i feel completely helpless, when i first broke up with him, his mom was mad at me for doing so, and wanted 2 sweaters back that he sent me with his own money, keep in mind that it was a gift and ive NEVER asked for anything from him,(money, clothes, etc) he willingly sent them on his own. well since it was his mom who wanted it back and not him, he said i could keep them, so i did. but eventually his mom ends up trying to blackmail me into sending the sweaters back (shes a 40 yr old woman) with my own nudes because she went through his phone and found all of our PRIVATE pics/convos, and was trying to use them against me. his mom also went on facebook to stalk my mom, my ex even admitted it (im underage and so is he, hes 18 in 2 months, though). he sorted it out with his mom and apologized to me, and once again said i could keep the sweaters. i ended up just blocking him on everything after that thinking this would go away. it didnt, hes been stalking what i post on social media and thinks everything i post about/say is about him, and that made him angry i guess? so he decides to message my friends, call me a hoe, a horrible person, a liar, called my friends a ""dirty mexican"" and the n word, (hes white by the way), and went into detail to them about what we did together sexually, (nudes etc). so naturally im pissed off, so i unblock him and call him, basically saying ""why would you even say those things about me"" ""whats wrong with you"", i didnt swear at him, i was trying my best to be mature and he cried the whole time about how hes so sorry for saying all of those things about me. im thinking to myself, ""is this guy bipolar or something??"". anyways, after im done ranting to him about telling him to leave me and my friends alone, we both agreed to just block eachother and move on with our lives, well atleast i thought he would but noooo. a couple days later hes STILL stalking me somehow after ive blocked him everywhere, and he messages me saying im the worst person ever and that he wouldnt care if i died and that he wants his sweaters back, etc. just the worst things ever really.  he told me he wont leave me or my life alone until he gets his sweaters back. but thats just the problem, how do i know he'll really leave me alone if i give the sweaters back? i dont even want them but the shipping where i live would be around 60$+, and hes forcing me to pay for it too. im just so lost and i dont know what to do, ive only ever been kind and mature with him throughout this whole mess, i never tried to expose him, ive never talked bad about him even though he has about me. ive been having really bad thoughts lately, my mental health is like 0, ive been getting no sleep either, i just dont think i'll ever date again. also im so sorry that this has been so long, i just dont want to talk to my friends or bother them with this anymore than i have already, so im coming to reddit. i could really use advice on what to do, anything is helpful, thank you.",04Aug2020,1
71,"I was told that attempts to call the police of another country will just get redirected to my own local police. Also, I am not yet proficient at communicating fully in the language of the country I was trying to reach. Is there a way to alert the police in another country to check on someone possibly in danger? Google searching just led me to the U.S. embassy info (I'm in the U.S.), but I don't know if they would do anything for a non-u.s. citizen over concerns about a vague message online. 

For context, my online boyfriend in Brazil sent me a message at 3am that he felt his life was in danger and if he didn't respond in 24h to expect the worst. The notification noise woke me up instantly and I sent a message asking for more info only one minute after he sent his. I received no response and proceeded to try messaging him every other way (I did not call b/c I was scared if it was a home invader or if he was hiding from some dangerous situation, the noise might alert them to his location). I attempted messaging his family and friends, but no one was awake. He finally responded hours later that he felt a weird pulling sensation in his lungs, started to panic, and eventually passed out.   
I was upset to say the least, but this is the second time in 2 years a scary situation has happened where he would send me a slightly morbid message without much detail and then disappear for hours with me panicking all night and morning (he does have a past history of suicide attempt, which makes it even more concerning).   


I'm hoping for any advice that may help the next time something like this happens. I already asked him, and he does not know what he expects me to do in that situation either. And just to add, I have already begged him to see a doctor about his lungs but he's rather stubborn b/c he's said this has happened since he was little.",04Aug2020,1

81,"Hi, as my first post on here I’m not going to be very fluid with my words but here I go.
I’m going to be a college student in a couple weeks which is honestly very exciting for me, the past few months however leading up to college have proven to be stressful. Finding money for college, loans, required documents, all I had to scrounge for up. It’s been very visible, however, that my parents do not trust me to go to college (Specifically my Dad and my Step-Mom). They are both foreign and pretty much have the same backstory, came from another country worked their way up. They think I’m pretty much useless and have made it clear when I’m not around. I hear them talk about me sometimes when I’m not in the mood to eat dinner. My Dad called me an idiot behind my back, and enables my Step-Mom to talk about me in a bad way as well. They don’t trust me at all, and have made it clear when they talked behind my back about me signing a contract to bring my PC to college. I spend pretty much all day in my room, due to the fact there’s a quarantine and I don’t have much to do. But it had been like that before the quarantine, due to the fact that all my friends are mostly online, but still have some close ones outside of the internet (I’ve  known these people for years btw) I guess what I’m trying to ask is, what do I do?

I really liked her for the first 7 months or so then it just faded away, I guess. No incidents or really big arguments. Just some egoistic problems between us sometimes. Otherwise it was probably all fine. Meanwhile, she really got her emotions building up all this time and is probably at her apex of affection. She's also a really emotional and at times melodramatic person but I really care about her a lot more than anybody my age.

This is where I am at a dilemma. I don't feel as much affection, we don't talk as much we have more arguments then I would like to have with my best friend. I don't feel any attraction towards her besides maybe physical but that's something everyone has at this age and I don't really know if this is just a low point because it's been going on for about 5 months.

84,"Hello, I am a 17 year old guy, from a small town in norway. A lot has happened throughout my life but I'll try to sum it up here: 

I was bullied when i went to school, called fat and ugly all the time. This one time a girl looked at my damaged front-tooth, said ""ew"" and walked away. That really stuck in my head. Our local school then got shut down because of norwegian ""centralization"". After i transferred schools i always had this feeling of not fitting in. In 8th grade it got worse, when i was walking through the halls i looked at the ground in fear of having eye-contact with someone ""above"" me. 

So yeah. 
I eventually got a group of friends though, and now we are very close. We are all ""misfits"" in a way. But together, in this circle, we all have a place. 
This didn't stop my anxiety though.

Even though I now have a girlfriend, work out, i actually have pretty good genes and girls literally hit on me all the time at my first few parties. I have this hate for myself. I sometimes skip meals because i dont want to get fat. Eating chips can trigger an anxiety attack, where i snowball into thinking all sorts og things. When i look into the mirror i either see a deformed fat, kid. Though I'm now borderline underweight.

Its peobably not unusual to be insecure at my age. But in the recent year I did some things to myself I'm not proud of. Not as a cry for help, but rather as ""this is what i deserve"". And this is just how my mind thinks during ""attacks"", as i call them.

The main reason i got help, was because i started manipulating people in order to make myself feel valid. I would guilt trip people, including my girlfriend, to validate me. That is not ok. When my girlfriend told me how I had been acting i hated myself even more, but eventually went to our local health department to get help. Problem was, it sucked. I talked to a male doctor who didn't really understand me, and i wasn't comfortable at all. But i did get diagnozed with moderate depression. As if that changes anything.

In recent months things have been better, i know how to distract myself from my thoughts effectively. But this is definetely not a long lasting solution. My anxiety has led me to say things i don't mean to my gf, and think of things no 17 year old should think. It really makes me feel miserable sometimes, and my confidence suffers a lot because of it. 

Tldr; my past has made me insecure, and i end up harming myself and others because of it.

I pray that I dont have another episode of harming people. Undereating. Skipping classes to punch a wall, crying, just because i think everyone hates me. -ever again

So i was wondering, have any of you experienced something similar? If so, is there a way I can stop hurting those around me? I feel I have caused my girlfriend so much pain.

87,"So this seems like a bit of a petty issue compared with the other ones I’ve seen on here but I need some advice. My bf and I are both 18 and going to university next month and we’ve been dating for about a year now. To commemorate our one year anniversary and also to end our summer off on a high note, we had the idea to go on a road trip together. Our plan was to drive out somewhere nice, explore and hike, stay in a hotel overnight, and head back the next day. He would likely drive and we’re paying for all expenses (food, hotel, gas, etc.) 

His parents are fine with it but mine said no and they won’t give any reason as to why. They haven’t let us have ‘sleepovers’ or anything like that either despite his parents being okay with it. I tried reasoning with them that we’re 18 and we’re responsible adults (technically) who have gone on day trips together. I’m moving out very soon and need to learn to be independent and organize these types of things on my own. I’m going to a university six hours away and he’s staying at home because his classes are all online so this will likely be one of our last chances to do something together as I’m moving out very soon. My parents told me that we can do whatever we want when I move out, but I’m not allowed to have visitors in my residence due to covid regulations and he will still be living at home so when I come back to visit the situation will be the same. So basically, this is our last chance before university starts and we barely see each other to do something fun together that isn’t just hanging out. 

I considered that the issue might be that my parents don’t want to give us a chance to have sex, but my mom gave me a box of condoms a week into dating him and also was the one who suggested I go on birth control so it’s not as though they’re completely oblivious to the fact that we’re sexually active. They know we will do it regardless of whether we are in a hotel or in his bedroom. 

So, my question is, how do I approach this subject without putting my parents on the defensive (and without getting defensive and upset myself) and how do I convince them to let us go?",04Aug2020,1
88,"The reason for telling them would be that I really need closure and to move on, because this one comment has stuck with me for years and it still bothers me. 

Context: It was been approx. 10 years since this incident occurred.  I was a member of a sorority and during recruitment we get paired with a PNM (potential new member) to take them through the house and tell them about our sorority. We have a list of the potential newbies and we strategically placed specific ""sisters"" with specific PNMs that we really wanted, or who had the same major, played the same sport etc. 

During recruitment it was always very stressful and we had chapter meetings everynight before each day of recruitment. The day before one of these events, we talked about which ""sister"" would be paired with which Potential new member. Then it got to me. This is how the comment was phrase: 

Recruitment chair: ""This PNM is a little bit weird, so Alexbeaubalexx you'll get paired with them because you're weird"" 

Because our entire chapter was there, members spoke up and told her that it was a rude thing to say. 

Recruitment chair: (looking at me) ""alexbeaubalex, you get what I mean?""

I actually don't remember what I did or said. I am nice to a fault and I think this drove whatever kept me from speaking up about how it really made me feel. But over the years this comment about me being ""weird"" has HAUNTED me to the point where I think about social interactions over and over and over again agonizing over whether or not I came off as ""weird.""  It has cause me to exit certain social interactions over fears of being ""weird."" There is something inherently wrong with me that this STILL BOTHERS ME SO MUCH! I wish it didn't, and that I could just get over it. 

Here is my dilemma: Should I tell her. Maybe it is because I need closure, or maybe it is because I finally feel brave enough to stand up for myself. Perhaps it is because I really want to know why she said what she did, and why she said it front of so many people. 

Here is what I want to say (Sorry it might be a bit repetitive): 

Years ago when you were recruitment chair, you called me ""weird"" in front of our entire chapter. To put this comment into context, we were discussing who would be paired with which PNM, and you suggested that I take this one PNM. In front of our entire chapter you said ""She is a little weird, so you'll get paired with her because you're weird."" I don't know why you said this, or why you felt the need to say it in front of our chapter. I remember playing it off like I didn't care. I guess even though what you said was so obviously rude, I wanted to be nice in return... but I have to tell you that it has bothered me FOR YEARS. It's comments like this that have fueled my ""imposter syndrome"" to this day. So much so that I obsessively replay social interactions that I have over and over again in my head, wondering if I came off as ""weird."" All of this because of one comment that you made. You probably don't even remember saying it. I need to get this off of my chest. I don't want you to feel bad about saying it, because it was 10 years ago. But 10 years has given me the courage that I didn't have back then to stand up for myself. You shouldn't have said that period, but you really shouldn't have said that in front of so many people. I'm hoping that by finally standing up for myself that I can finally move on. That's all, I really do hope you are well, I'm not looking for an apology, just closure.",04Aug2020,1

This is the worst feeling I've ever felt.

To continue, and where I ask for advice. Our lease ends in December, and she is open to signing for another year so we can assess the situation with Covid-19 while we get our shit ready to depart. She's offered to help me pay off bills during this time, and we vowed to leave each other with a decent savings account before we completely split.

My options: 

Go back to work - but risk myself to contract Covid-19 as a verified ""high-risk"" employee due to some medical conditions, but retain my insurance and a possible social network.

Go back on unemployment. It lasts for only 6 more months, but gives me some time and freedom to do a bit of whatever I want and try to get back on track and think of me and what's next. The bad: even more time spent at home cooped up. I go through bouts of crying at the thought of her and all of the best and worst of our relationship is constantly going through my mind.

Return to live with parents. We live in an expensive city currently,  and I won't be able to pay rent on my own unless I grab a closet studio apartment. I'll get to stay where I love, but potentially still be miserable, although maybe even exciting if Covid-19 would just fuck off. I also don't have a car. By returning to my parents in Florida, I could have a safety net for awhile to establish things. That said, I have a very limited bank account. No car, barely any assets. I'm not sure how I would be able to acquire a car which is incredibly needed in Florida to get around and get jobs.

Anyway, I'm in a complete and total rut. Doing some therapy on the side through Talkspace as well,  in hopes of establishing some sort of plan. Seeking advice here because it is quicker and more immediate and I'd like to ask what the general public thinks.

93,"Okay, so..I met this guy on Tinder and we talked for a good bit last year. So at one point, I guess I did find him attractive. But now, after a year of not speaking, we've started talking again. I genuinely enjoy our conversation. Like, I can't have conversation like this with anyone else. We genuinely just vibe, I never run out of things to say, I laugh. But like..he's not very attractive.

94,"My parents keep trying to make me take bipolar medicine when my therapist herself says I do not need medicine.

I’ve been trying to tell them that I am not psychotic, just going. Through a rough time (their gaslighting, being scammed out of $350, plus losing an additional $800 during lockdown) 

But they’ve been telling me I don’t know myself like they do and my moody behavior “isn’t me”

Now I’m over 18 so normally I could just say I don’t want to take it and that’s it but these people don’t live by social norms.

I found out my dad actually drops pills in my drinks when I’m not looking, while my mom puts it in the meals she cooks me.  

The issue is if I resist their medicine they coerce me and do what they can to force it on me. 
One method was to try and make me sleep outside if I don’t (luckily I had a hidden house key),

Another was to call a psychiatrist and lie to them, and then try and make them talk to me. 


Anddd another was to force me in a mental institution. And guess what. The psychiatrist and the mental institution both said they see no signs of illness and delusion in me.

97,"I'm 24, virgin. I can count the amount of girls I've asked out on one hand. I've been asked out, but never really felt the same, though sometimes I look back and think: ""Maybe I should have given them a shot..."".

The last time I actually liked a girl was back when I was 19. It was a long distance online friend. We were genuinely good friends before feelings ruined it all. I debated even telling her because I feared ruining that friendship.

I didn't do anything illegal, but I was cringe af. I hate to admit, but I became obsessed with her, asking friends ""how I did?"" when talking to her (must have annoyed said friends so much) overthinking every conversation we had. I'd finally be ""over it"" by age 22.

This friend and I would later have a falling out over different things. Now I fear falling back down that rabbit hole for someone else. Even now there's this girl I'm friends with who I'm sure doesn't feel the same as we don't interact enough and yet I seem to be growing feelings for them because they show me affection. I'm once again debating telling them as I've been here before.

98,"I’ve (21f) got a friend (27m) who I’m struggling with. I’m not so sure we should be friends anyways, but that’s a post for a different day. Lately we’ve been stuck in a rough patch where we’re not good for each other, and my solution is basically to apologize and leave things be. It’s pretty much the philosophy of “don’t water dead plants.” So I do my best to smooth things over, try to end the argument/conversation/situation on a neutral note, and then I keep my distance- no texting, no social media, no calls. He rarely starts any time of conversation, so I wait to send a message until I know I’m ready. I know that my mental health has been pretty disastrous lately and self-isolation is a coping mechanism for me (I stop talking to people so that I can heal myself without the pressure of anyone else), so I’ll take breaks from us when we’re too tense, and I’ll take breaks from life (and us) when life is too tense. 

I’m a helper and the “mom” friend, so when we talk I’m always taking care of him. When I take my breaks (anywhere between a few days to a few weeks), he says that I’ve abandoned him and that it’s manipulative of me to just leave without warning (I do tell him I need space before I “disappear”). I’ve tried explaining this process to him multiple times and in different ways to try to get him to understand that he’s not the reason I’m leaving, but that I have to step away so that I can get my mental health in check. If I stay in touch during these low points, I know I’ll say things I don’t mean or that I’ll misinterpret what he says and it’ll be harmful to me. He doesn’t know how to help me through my depressive low points and often makes them worse. I know how to get through them alone, so that’s what I prefer to do. 

How can I explain the reasons I need to take these breaks to him so that he’ll get it? Every time I come back, he’s upset with me for leaving him and says that I’m causing harm to his mental health by doing so. I don’t mean to hurt him, but I have to take care of myself too. I willingly give the overwhelming majority of my time and energy to other people to make sure that they’re okay, safe, and healthy. But I spent way too much time sacrificing my mental well-being in my younger years and I’m paying for it now, which is why it’s one of my top priorities to maintain.  

Is there any way I can explain this to him so that he’ll fully understand and not be so upset with me every time I take a little distance?",04Aug2020,1
99,"I have been in love with the same person for the past 7 years. We met when I was 16 and have always lived across the country. We've had several attempts of being more than friends, but the distance always prevented anything further from happening. Although I've been in more serious, long-term relationships with other people, I have never felt the same about anyone else. We went 3 years without seeing each other but maintained consistent contact with each other during that period of time. We both just graduated from college and I finally got to see him a few weeks ago and it was amazing. We picked up exactly where we left off. While I was there, he would stare at me for long periods of time, say my name at the ends of his sentences, look for opportunities to touch me, etc. Nothing happened between us but it was really lovely.

A week later, I went to visit him again before I had to catch a flight, so we only had a few hours. We made dinner and decided to spend the time we had together in his apartment. He asked if he could kiss me and told me he had been thinking about doing it the first time I came. I let him, even though I was scared of what may happen after. He kept trying to get me to stay longer, but eventually, I left for the airport. As soon as my flight landed, he texted me to make sure I was home safely. We texted for the next week consistently and discussed how we both kept thinking about the kiss. He told me he missed me already and wished he had more time with me. He also kept telling me he needs to come visit soon and hes going to make it happen. Sometimes, I wouldn't answer his texts or take a few days to respond. I did this partially to protect myself because I do not want to seem too interested out of fear of being vulnerable. Normally, he would answer me within a few minutes or an hour at maximum, especially after I saw him. I sent him a text followed by another text a few days later- no answer. It's been two days and I still haven't heard from him. I'm already assuming the worst and questioning what I did wrong. It may seem minuscule but my heart hurts over not getting a response. I already made a promise to myself that I'm not texting him again. What should I do in this situation? I was so excited by the idea of him coming to visit. I don't know where we stand now and I am trying to figure out how to manage my emotions. I normally wouldn't take this to heart, but it's different with him.

A month later I realize that I was messaged by the girl I fancied all along.

105,"       So, this may sound cliche and dumb, but my entire life I've always just wanted to grow up and get married. I'm kind of a hopeless romantic that way. I've dated two people, and both of them (in high school), I put them as my number 1 priority. I put them even before myself. I know that's bad, but I can't help it. I put them in front of even myself. 

         And right now I have a really close friend (not dating) and I'm doing the same thing. Literally worrying about her more than I do myself. But I literally give her the exact OPPOSITE advice of that. When she's stressed I tell her to just worry and focus on yourself. I tell her the ONLY thing that matters is HER happiness. But I literally can not do that myself. 

        It's almost like I need someone in my life that I can focus on them being happy, and not myself. Idk. It's almost like i can't trust my emotions. So I don't express them, like ever. I'll feel happiness...but I'm not. I just am. I'm not sad either...i just am. So I just focus on other people. And I feel like the one for me, the one I'll end up marrying, will hopefully be like that. Who puts me in front of herself (which is bad and nothing you should ever ask of someone) but that's what I do to people, and maybe that's just because I want someone to treat me that way?

106,"

Long story short I used to have a job where I worked at a desk with a coworker, so there were always two people working the desk. My job was like a secretary and receptionist combined. I’ve had many people stare at me when they came to the desk (I look young) but this one time a teen boy came to the desk with his mom and his mom was being helped by my coworker at the desk with me but the son wouldn’t stop staring at me and began looking at my privates. In that moment I normally would have either ignored it or went to the bathroom but for whatever reason I felt compelled and literally jumped out of my seat to behind and under the desk, pretending to fix the computer or pick up something. It’s like something was controlling me, it felt compulsive. I was there for 2 mins until I heard they were wrapping it up.

I told my coworker I got a little nervous. I didn’t expect him to but he reported it to my supervisor and then the director of the organization above my supervisor ended up finding out. My supervisor took me aside and was pretty understanding but reported it to the director and the director had a hard time understanding why I’d react that way and seemed really angry and annoyed and asked me “Is that really a proper way for an adult man like you to react?” Since then I’ve been thinking about why exactly I reacted that way. Do I have a problem or a disorder? I’ve literally never reacted this way to anything in my life nor since and he was just staring, it’s not like it was anything significant.",04Aug2020,1
107,"I started having terrible panic attacks recently and I reallycreally want it to stop. 

The panic attacks started after I found out my father was dying of cancer. I tried to take my brother to go see him and my father refused to see us. He said we could call him but he didn't want to see either one of us at his home which is in another state. This has been hard on me and my brother as well but it's difficult to explain why. He's done a lot of bad things to me my mom and especially my brother. Honestly, i thought for a long time him getting cancer would be great news but it's not and I don't know why I can't be happier about it.

My mom and my brother are both schizophrenic.  My sister and I are not. I'm the oldest son at 43. One way my father dealt with my mom and brothers disability when we were kids was he used to coach me on killing my brother. I hadn't really ever thought about this as an adult. My dad, usually on camping trips, would create these murder set ups where I was supposed to help him kill my brother. One time I was supposed to push him off a cliff. Another time I was supposed to let him wander off in the high desert. There are a whole lot more of those types of memories and they overwhelm me quickly. I was the key actor in my dads murder plots. My dad saw my youth as a get out of jail free card I think. These memories are now flooding back in extremely vivid detail. The coaching was always subtle with lots of the Bible sprinkled in and then on camping trips he would demand that I take my brother into these impossibly dangerous situations and when I returned without the mission accomplished he'd always be obviously disappointed. After i didn't push my brother off the cliff he barely spoke to me the rest of the camping trip. At the end of the camping trip I broke down crying and asked him point blank if he was mad at me for not pushing my brother off the ledge and his response was how dare I accuse him of wanting to hurt my brother. I think that all the pretending that we weren't really talking about what we were talking about helped in the mind fuck of it all. 

These memories seem to be causing the panic attacks but I'm not sure because I'm also really afraid of dying alone. I take care of my mom and my brother who are in poor health, I am not married and have no desire to be however I realize that this likely means an ending all alone and the thought of dying like my dad with stage four pancreatic cancer in the hospital is terrifying to me. Nobody has ever taken care of me i wouldn't allow it anyway but I don't know if that's the epicenter of the panic attacks because each of these thoughts (camping murder set ups/me dying of cancer alone) seems to equally bring on the cold sweats and feeling like I'm having a heart attack. This heart attack cold sweats vomit dying  feeling is now arising unbidden and it's awful.

I'm not going to attach pictures of the tattoo to this post yet because I'm worried it will be recognized and the artist may be under attack, but you may pm me and I will send them to you if you want to see. I may change my mind later if enough people are curious and depending on what course of action I take from here.

I got a tattoo from a reputable artist with a great portfolio about two weeks ago. I paid what is expected for their work- not a cheap tattoo but not an extremely expensive one, though it was on the higher end. The thing is, it didn't come out ""bad"". The linework in one particular area is **awful** though, shaky and scratchy and just so obviously messed up- it's been pointed out to me constantly. Also, I don't know if it was their technique or just my skin, but the color is patchy in most areas. There's a spot where it goes outside the lines. I'm just so heartbroken because I want to love this piece but can't. They said they do free touch ups but I'm nervous to even go back. I know they wouldn't want this on their portfolio, and I don't want to be a Karen, but I want people to know this happened before they decide on them as an artist.

122,"I (23M) work internal IT for an IA (independent appraiser) and have been working there for 2 years. Back in mid March, one of my coworkers (42M) came in looking like he was ready to start swinging, he demanded to work from home through covid as we have the capability and he claimed to not feel safe in the office. His energy rubbed off on the senior tech (33M) who shortly thereafter demanded the same thing. I was the only one who volunteered to come into the office as I tend to thing long term and figured that all our employees would be working from home so there would be no one in the office, thus, I'd be fine. Our boss begrudgingly agreed to let both coworkers work from home. Right before he was supposed to start working from home, 42M claimed to have back problems and went on LOA, leaving just me, 33M, and our boss. Since covid started, 33M has done little to no work. Hes a single guy living in a shared apartment with roommates. He has a very expensive gaming PC, multiple VR headsets, xbox and PS. During work hours he takes a bit to respond when we message him or even work on help desk tickets leaving me to pick up the slack for not only our tech who is STILL on LOA as well as 33M. Our boss knows hes not working and wants to either force him to come into the office to ensure hes working as there is only 3-5 people in a building normally filled by almost 200 precovid, or fire him. There are only two problems. Our HR person said my boss is not allowed to force 33M to come in as he claims anxiety (his actions on the 6 times when he comes in after hours shows otherwise), and our CIO, my boss's boss, says 33M is too valuable and she can't fire him.

I am going to ask for a raise since I've picked up the slack for 2 people and quite frankly deserve it, but should I do it now (next week when my boss gets back from a well deserved week off) while her appreciation for me actually coming in is still fresh in her mind, or wait until covid blows over and basically claim I deserve one for coming in faithfully for these last 4 months (probably 6-8 by the time this is over with)?",04Aug2020,1
123,"About six months ago, a friend had a Skype sex session with someone he met online. Camera, nudity, the usual. During the video call she abruptly ended it and blocked him everywhere. He thought that it’s because she accidentally showed her face (they had a no face policy for privacy).  

But after reading some posts here, he’s getting paranoid that she might have been underage (she told him 20, nothing she ever said or did would make someone think otherwise).

If something bad legally were to happen, would it have happened by now? Is he in the clear? I told him there’s no use getting anxiety over what happened 6 months ago but he’s all paranoid now.

I didn't violate anyone's bodily autonomy. I did not break anything. The crime I committed is more of a crime against what society deems right and wrong. And I'm ashamed of what I did. Ashamed of not having stopped. Ashamed of everything. Ashamed of myself. Not because it's illegal. Not because I'm afraid of getting caught. But because what I did is, generally speaking, something I think people who do this deserve to be punished for. Now, there were certain... Circumstances... That caused me to do what I did, and to not to stop doing it. But it's still something illegal, something wrong...

So me and my gf have been really close for a while now, but just started dating a few months ago. I grew up in a very VERY christian home (im agnostic), so my whole life has been me hearing what my parents say about sex and boundaries, vs what the rest of the world says. Im told its wrong, ill go to hell, etc etc by my parents, but i see other couples doing the opposite and they turn out fine. Married with children, and ive talked to some couples that have been married almost 20 years. 

Note, i am not close to my parents. I dont talk to them about anything ever because when i do its turned around onto me, and usually ends with a religious fight. 

Anyway,

Ive been in relationships before, i am not a virgin, but what i have learned from past mistakes is that i should have a conversation about it. She is very shy, shes never done anything sexual, and ive told her i wasnt comfortable yet with doing anything because i am afraid of losing her by trying too soon. I told her this when we first started dating. We were kissing the other day, and i stopped and pulled away and when asked why i told her we were escalating too fast and wanted to stop before i over stepped my boundaries, which, i have no clue what are. Of course i would want to with her. 

 My problem is, 

My parents and what everyone else says is confusing me so much i dont know what to do, AND im afraid if i have that conversation with her, like ill come off like thats all i want. Which no, its not all i want. I can see us together for a long time, i can see a life with her. Shes perfect, im just so scared of losing her by talking to her.

132,"I’m (21m) a very flawed person.
I can give you a list of what my flaws are...

1. I’m depressed a lot of the time/lazy
2. I’m messy
3. I’m forgetful 
4. Have ADD
5. I struggle with punctuality 
6. I can be moody at times
7. I have low self confidence 
8. I’m shy/not very assertive 
9. Not very “ambitious” (I just want to be happy and at peace and content not take over the world or be a CEO of a 
HUGE company) 

Etc. etc. 

See I can list a lot of my flaws instantly (and probably more if I had the space to) and these really mess with me and I beat myself up about them all the time and feel like no one will ever be my friend for long because they’ll get tired of me and no one will ever love me. 

What worries me is I cannot focus on my positives..when my psychologist asked if I could list some of my positive traits in a piece of paper..I left it blank because I literally could not think of one...

I’ve been told by many people that I have these positive qualities 

1. I’m incredibly kind and compassionate 
2. Easy to talk to and an accepting person 
3. A colorful bright personality when you get to know me
4. Very talented (in some of my hobbies I used to do) 
5. Very smart and introspective 
6. Humble 
7. Loyal to those I care about
8. A hard worker (when I put my mind to it) 
9. Mature and laid back
10. Funny
11. Good looking 

Etc. etc.
I’ve been told these things but I couldn’t write them down because I didn’t believe them...and I still don’t believe really any of them...and even when I try my flaws overpower my positives and I feel awful about myself. I feel like I need to fix all of the flaws in order to be a good person and good enough for love and acceptance from friends family and an S.O. I also feel so much pressure when I compare myself to other people who seem to have it all together and are much better looking, more successful, more popular and richer than I am. See I don’t want to be all those things, I just want to be happy and at peace with myself and life but it’s so hard not to feel and give into the pressure I guess.

141,"(This is literally my first reddit post ever so let me apologize for any errors I make as I'm inexperienced)  


Just giving a little bit of backstory I (16M) have been living with my parents as long as I've lived (lol obviously) I've done basically everything they have ever asked me to do when they asked me to do it.  
This could literally be associated with just about anything, academically, athletically, with things like helping around the house with chores, and helping out with our family dog as well. As I've gotten older however I have had a lot more responsibility in my life as well, that being with maintaining relationships, searching for a job, driver's ed, and obviously sports (which I'm being forced to do by my parents even though I don't neccasarily mind playing sports but that's besides the point)  


Even though I have a lot of newfound responsibility in my life my parents have continously asked more and more of me as I've gotten older, and while there has actually been a mulitude of other reasons and stories as to why I need advice on how to deal with them, it all sort of came to head tonight around ten minutes ago.  


Basically my parents were approached and were asked if I would be interested in joining the IB program as my high school. I am already taking two AP classes this upcoming year, and despite this my parents want me to drop all those AP classes in pursuit of this IB program which basically would mean I would be taking 6 college courses for my junior and also senior year. I have expressed distaste for this program for a very long time but my parents keep insisting that I take it. Earlier today I was forced to attend a virtual meeting with my dad and the vice principal of my high school basically to learn about the program. As I sat there it became more and more prevalent that I was not interested in taking this course as not only would it be way too much work for me to handle, and I wasn't interested in the subject material in the first place.  


After the meeting concluded I told my dad how I felt, and he said that we should wait until my mom got home to discuss in more detail. Fast forward to my mom's arrival and we get into a very heated debate. I basically was just saying how I really did not feel comfortable doing basically a college student's amount of work as a junior (and senior, the program is a two-year deal that you can't get out of once you're in) in high school. They told me I was stubborn and kind of just told me how that this was not a ""valid reason"" and how it only made them want to sign me up for this more. My mom was also adamant that I should write them an essay or speech and do research to show them that IB isn't worth it. That's not the point I was trying to make I just can't physically and emotionally handle the amount of work and stress this course would require. I then eventually got so heated to the point were I actually stood up to them for once and said ""I'm tired of doing everything you tell me to do without you guys considering how I feel."" and I guess they thought what I said was hilarious as they just laughed at me. The conversation ended when my mom said I'm tired of this we will finish talking tomorrow.

I honestly just feel bad I've just wanted to run away for a while now as they are honestly just forever moving up on my shitlist. I don't know what to do or how to handle their controlling personas. I've done everything they've ever wanted me to do and it has gotten to the point were they just keep asking and asking and I'm just done I can't handle it anymore. Any advice on how to handle this is welcome.

144,"Hi guys. I feel so numb and depressed right now and just need someone to talk to. Just feel like ranting. 😕

Background info: I come from a strict middle eastern family who wants me to just focus on my career and not date. My father is especially against me marrying someone who is not Muslim. 
I study abroad in Europe and recently got to come back to stay with my family in the US for a few months. I have had a relationship for over a year and haven’t told them about it... until a few days ago. I told my mom, who always encouraged me now that I’m 26, and almost finished my degree that if I like someone I should go on dates and start thinking about a man. I was so happy to hear about her openness to me and she told me if the time comes where things get serious, she’ll support me and convince my father too aswell. My mom is also bipolar so sometimes her mood is up and down. I wanted to wait till I was home to tell her rather than over the phone.


Fast forward to now, I’m crying in my bed depressed. A few days ago I told my mom about my boyfriend. She hugged me and said she was so happy for me, she was so excited to hear about him and exclaimed that she can’t wait to meet him.

A couple of days later she commented to me that he’s a chef, so he may not give me the privileged life I’ve had growing up. I assured her he plans to go into business and make a restaurant. 

So, last night 🙁 well she came to my room and was listing all the reasons I shouldn’t be with him cos we’re so different. I was trying to resssure her, when my dad came in the room. She told him, and he reacted like a bomb had been dropped on him. Saying he wassondisapponted for me for betraying their trust, my priority should be my education etc. It was a rough night my dad, mom and older bro were shouting at me and telling me I made a poor decision, I am a disgrace and that I will regret it. 
Eventually they calmed down and were very apologetic to me... 

But now I’m in a really tough position.
They asked me to end things with him and to wait until they will allow me to be in a relationship  (and even still they want a say in who I can be with) 

I don’t want that kind of life, tbh I was so happy to study abroad to avoid being controlled like this. But unfortunately because I’m studying medicine which is such a demanding degee, I have no time for a part time job to make any money to support myself. I can’t apply for student loans because I’m from a country that doesn’t have those. So I’m 100% reliant on my parents. And this is like an iron chain that they dangle me around with. 

I have decided I will stay with him because he’s my best friend, the love of my life and i don’t want anyone else. My parents say that’s me being young and immature, naive to the endless possibility of “suitors who will properly suit me” *smh*

I really am not religious. I am not conservative like my parents because I’ve grown up in the west ( in fact Europe which gives you all sort of experiences 🤣) 
So I just do not understand them.

151,"Warning that this is a long post. I (male) have an old friend of mine who recently just crashed back into my memory over the past 24 hours. I think about her frequently as it is, although I haven't seen her for over 8 years now. Due to a mistake we made together she elected to permanently end the friendship. When she did so, she requested I not try to contact her in any way ever again.

Now to be clear, this isn't as dramatic as it likely sounds from the outside. There was no big fight or fallout or anything like that, it was simply a personal decision she made because of our complicated past. However, that has always been something I struggled with. She made that decision, and I wasn't made a part of it. We weren't partners or anything like that so I'm not attempting to imply that she owed it to me to make me a part of the decision, but rather simply that it hurt like hell when I realized just how final her decision was. When she first told me of her plans to scrap me from her life, I honestly didn't believe her. But after that, I always met a closed door. I messaged her once a few months after our last encounter, and she politely made it pretty clear then that she didn't want to see/hear from me again.

However, I have been obsessing over now trying to orchestrate one last face to face meetup. I am not trying to revive something that is already dead. I know we will never be friends again. I accepted that a long time ago. But I simply want to apologize to her, tell her I wish I had been a better friend, remind her of all of her amazing qualities that I so often left unmentioned back then. I guess I'm saying I feel like I never got true closure, and I guess I also want to know that she is happy now and doing well. Part of me is trying to convince myself that if I can right some wrongs, it would justify the communication. She's not on social media or anything like that for me to ""stalk out"" either, but my old phone still has her number and assuming it's still her number, I have been tempted to try to reach out. Is this OK, considering both her request and my intention? Am I being callous in risking re-opening old wounds for her?

Which is true because I saw him at work the day she orginally mentioned. The last time she had to cancel (before her trip) she said ""I promise to make it up to you."" She has yet to ""make it up"" to me and I have tried reaching out a few times to hang out but she never has gotten back to me.

I don't know if she got turned away because when I would leave a voice message I would also send a text incase she doesn't listen to her voice messages. I do this to pretty much everyone so it's not just towards her. I know some people don't listen to them or check them often so I also send a text message.

Honestly I have just given up on trying to reach out to her and I don't know what the reason behind her actions of not getting back are. Her roommate/my friend hasn't told me anything that might of made her stop talking to me, I am at a lose and wished it wasn't like this. She hasn't blocked me since when I called last it ringed for awhile then it went to voice message, normally if someone blocks someone it goes straight to voice message.

I might ask my friend when I see him next but he hasn't told me anything and the last time we spoke he said to reach out to X since I am more likely to get an answer/response but that hasn't been the case. I know it took her a week just to get back to me once and I just don't know what's going on.

I know that I have tried to reach out about three times by calling which goes to voice message and then sending a text right after but I don't know if that is the reason behind her not responding.

Before all of this, we hung out (asked me to go to her birthday), went to my birthday and had a good time. But this was always in a group setting though.

She has even mentioned while in a group she wants a boyfriend (3x) and also put her hand on my shoulder when she ask me a question about if I had a good birthday.",04Aug2020,1
154,"My son is 14 years old. He plays soccer and his coaches are complete idiots and one of them borderline bullies children. He wants to quit, and I am all for it because it is affecting his mental health and he has another sport to keep him fit and healthy. He got 5 minutes of game time in total last year with the same coaches and he missed about one match and two training sessions in total. Since training started back, he has been hopeful for a better year. The first match back, he was subbed the whole game and they put a 12 year old on in front of him. He found out yesterday that the 12 year old will start in the next match. The 12 year old is an alright footballer, but he has a younger age group to play in and really shouldnt be getting priority. In that same training session yesterday, the coach wouldn't let him get a drink when he was dehydrated and humiliated him in front of his friends. His mother loves soccer, and wants him to play. He wants to tell her himself, but he doesnt know how to start that conversation. Am I right for encouraging him to quit? How does he tell her he doesnt want to play anymore?",04Aug2020,1

159,"Sorry this is kind of long, also I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.

My boyfriend has been drinking a lot more than he used to. When we first met, he would drink on occassion (hanging out with friends, special occasions, ect.) I'm much the same, I rarely drink though I have no aversion to it, I've just never really been a big drinker. 

Personally, I think beer is a gross substance, and he used to think so too. Then one summer he went back home from college, and he started hanging out with his co-workers for hours after work. He wanted to make friends with them so he hung around drinking beer with them for hours. This itself was a bit of a sore spot for us and we worked through it, and I was quite happy when fall rolled around and we were back in college so he was away from that job.

He still would drink beer with his school friends, usually when they were hanging out or playing pool or something, and while I didn't like that he was drinking beer it was what it was and it's not my right to tell him what he can or can't drink.
Then summer rolled around again and he's gone back home. He has a different job, though on occasion he goes to visit his old coworkers and drink with them. I don't mind that. But he's been drinking every single day. We video chat every night, and every time we talk he's drinking a beer or two. And sometimes if he's doing something special (having a BBQ or hanging out with people) he'll drink like a half a case of beer. This probably isn't really too too much depending on your standards. But for some background, he used to vape and was seriously addicted to nicotine. He quit that, and then went back to it when all the covid stuff started because he was stressed, but then he quit again just before he went back home. And now he's drinking every single day.

Now, a bit more back story here, he lives with his grandmother and gets a shit ton of crap from her (he's not praying, his hair's too long, he doesn't eat enough, ect.) And lately she's been on him about drinking too much.
Now we were talking and he was telling me she was nagging a lot so I asked him what about, and he said about his drinking, so I said that I kind of agreed with her in that bit and he got kind of upset because now there's another person nagging at him.  I tried to explain that I was just concerned. He replied that he's just drinking to relax and enjoy himself because he has nothing to do. Which I totally don't understand because he works for like 9 hours, but then he goes and hangs out with friends or whatever for hours after that, and when he gets home, he usually watches YouTube or plays video games while we video call. And on the weekends he can play stuff with me or go out and do other stuff he enjoys. I'd kinda get it if he was still on lockdown and had literally nothing to do but sit around, but he has plenty to do. But I didn't want to piss him off or stress him out by continuing to nag him so I was just quiet (and writing this) while he went to go eat.

After he finished eating he went to go to bed. He seemed quiet and off so I asked him if he was okay. He said he was annoyed. So I told him I didn't mean to nag or be annoying, but  that I'm worried it's becoming an addiction. He reiterated that he drinks so he can relax and enjoy himself. And I told him that I think he's basically swapping the nicotine for beer, and that I'm worried it's not a good habit. He said he understood, and was quiet for a few moments and then said he was going to sleep and we hung up.

I'm pretty sure he has more thoughts on it than ""I understand"" but I don't want to bring it up again and seem like I'm nagging him.

I don't know. Am I overreacting and nagging about something that's not a problem just because I don't really like beer? Should I try talking to him again, should I leave it alone?
I don't want to be more stressful to him by nagging at him, but I don't want him to end up being an alcoholic because he relies on beer. Any advice appreciated.",04Aug2020,1

161,"So I'm a male in my late 20's, and two years ago I began working at this upscale grocery store in the Health/Beauty department.. 

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never written up and never had any conflict with management... 

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired... 

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shane, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things... 

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person... 

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup... 

1) didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

2) I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

3) He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

4) After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then, I was fired.

***** The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me... 

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups... 

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to do fire me.

Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset.  I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through.

Does this seem unfair?",04Aug2020,1
162,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a year and I thought she was the love of my life. We got along great and we always talked about our future together and where we wanted to live together. However recently things haven’t been going so well and she is always looking for things to fight about and makes me feel like a shitty boyfriend cause no matter what I do it’s not good enough for her. She always tried to find things to get upset about a finds ways to blame me for everything. She can’t take full responsibility for something without showing me how I did something wrong too. Also recently she has been acting sketchy and wherever she goes she always brings her phone with her and is hesitant to leave it out. Even if she’s going to take a shower or get some water she always takes her phone. This kinda bothered me and I brought it up to her but she continued to do it. Last night she left her phone in the room while going to help her roommate with something and I went through it. I feel guilty for doing so just I had a feeling something was happening. When I went through It and I saw these messages between her and her friend all about this one co worker me and her work with and she is friends with him . She texted her friend that she had a vivid sex dream about this guy and that she’s always thought he was “really cute”. She also texted her friend that on occasion she thinks about how it would feel to have sex with him and that she has thought about it a lot and thinks it would be good. And at the end of these messages my girlfriend said “don’t tell anyone lol”. I confronted her but she just played it off as a joke and that she wasn’t serious and just “going along in the conversation”. However, I feel like my trust for her has been broken and I don’t believe it was just a joke because the messages were serious. She kept denying she was serious and kept saying “it’s not like I actually cheated”. This really upset me and I feel like i can’t trust her and this problem wasn’t the only time something like this has happened.

163,"For the record this usually only pertains to relationships but here goes:


1. My mother was a little more emotionally detached growing up, so hugs weren’t all that common. I don’t blame her, hard working lady- did a wonderful job at being supermom but after 17 years of no real physical affection I called her out on it one day. She agreed and made more of an effort, I ended up growing resentful towards the efforts she made. I felt like I no longer wanted it after having to wait so long.

2. My boyfriend never takes pictures of me. In his defense, he doesn’t take a lot of pictures in general but here is my defense. We have been dating a year and a half, and his gallery is full of my nudes. I have a nice camera so sometimes when we go out I’ll have him model and take great pics of him so he feels all admired and loved. Only twice has he been the photographer- and I hated most of the pictures, he literally gets my worst angles every single time. I know it’s so small but seeing those pictures after makes me feel like he sees me in the worst light, and doesn’t even bother to tell me to move or put my chin up etc. Also the only times he pulls out the camera is when we’re having sex. Anyway I called him out on it a couple months ago &amp; now whenever he tries it just makes me upset. 

Why is it that I’m more upset once people actually start trying? I try not to be, and I usually don’t show it, but inside I wish they just didn’t even try? I know that’s toxic but I’m confessing to try and understand and assess my root feelings",04Aug2020,1
164,"I'm \[20F\]  a college student. Due to COVID-19, I went home after spring break and stayed home for the rest of the semester. I had an apartment in my college town so moving home was abrupt.

My fall semester classes are all online and I want to move back into my apartment in my college town because taking classes at home was difficult for me. All of my classes were pre-recorded so I had no structure and as a result, I basically went on auto-pilot mode for the rest of the semester. 

I don't want that to happen this semester because I only have three semesters left and I feel like I'm being robbed of my college experience. I always study better with another person around and being around other people  I'll be living with three other people-one is another student and another is a teacher so it's not like we'll be throwing parties and going out. We've all been keeping in touch over the summer and we've all been social distancing and wearing masks which we will continue to do. 

As a result of not having anything to do over the summer, my mental health is declining. I’m tired all the time and I don’t want to do anything. This has never been an issue before- I've always been able to my stress and anxiety when I was at college. I don’t want this to impact my grades. I've been having breakdowns which strains my relationship with my parents because they're not great with talking about mental health. If I absolutely had to, I'd just go back to auto-pilot mode again and hammer out a semester at home but I'm afraid of what will happen to my mental health by the time the semester ends. 

My mom is against the idea because she's worried I'll catch covid when I go grocery shopping. Her argument is that it's safe and convenient for me at home because my parents are taking care of everything and the only thing I have to worry about is studying. I should probably mention my parents are Asian and used to getting their own way. Plus they are my psrents and naturally want what's best for me so I understand where they are coming from. 

Classes start in two and a half weeks and I've brought it up a few times but I keep getting shot down. I feel like I'm being selfish by risking my health and moving back to the city but at the same time, my mental health is important to me and I was in a really good place with myself before covid happened.",04Aug2020,1
165,"I'll start this off by saying that I live in southern Cali and I've grown up in a really diverse city and around multi ethnic groups. However that doesnt mean that I am automatically a saint and not racist.

In 7th grade I had no friends or social life, so I ended up hanging out with the scum of the school. At first they were nice to me and I just sat there and didn't really say anything. I felt good because it was one of the first times I was really included. As we got more and more comfortable around one another the more hateful we became. It started as your standard fat shaming and homophobia (we never said anything to anyones face because we were to scared ) but we all fed into each others anger and angst. We made evil remarks about everyone we saw, but it seemed like we were only saying these things because we thought it was ""dark humor"". But I soon realized this wasnt the case, our friend group nicknamed the no n*****s club got braver. One kid, called another student the n word to his face, another brought a knife to school with the intent of stabbing a Asian student he had a disagreement with. Me and another kid woke up and saw what happened to us. We saw how horrible the things we were doing were and we stopped hanging out with them. 

Freshman year of highschool i established my friend group early on and we were generally nice kids, we only really talked about baseball and girls so nothing out of the ordinary. 

Then sophomore year we have started talking shit about people again, but this feels different, but i still know it's wrong. I've tried to stop but it's like a addiction. I dont hate black people. I dont hate muslims. I dont hate asians. I dont hate gays. I dont hate lesbians. I dont hate transgender people. I dont hate Mexicans. I hate myself and I feel like I'm the lowest scum of the earth.

167,"To make it short, my co-worker left on maternity leave and finished none of the tasks that she was supposed to and, since my boss also failed to hire a temp to replace her meanwhile, I got stuck meeting her deadlines that she had a year to work on and that I had to slave away for two months to meet. She's the kind of person to make up excuses in order to weasel away from the blame, and two days ago she sent me a message in which she ""thanked me for my hard work"" and said that ""while her tasks are difficult, they're not impossible to do and they bring great satisfaction when they're done."" That message implies three things:
1. That I slaved away FOR HER.
2. That her work is much more difficult than mine.
3. That since I was able to pull it off regardless of the inhumane labor I was subjected to, there was no harm done.

While she answered her cellphone during working hours and gossiped whenever she got bored of sitting down, I was trying to do my job AND part of what's technically hers to avoid such a scenario, and in the end neither she nor my boss gave a fuck. They dumped it all on me to work a miracle. 

My boss isn't actually a bitch, it's just that her management skills suck, but on the personal side she took my father in for employment in another company that she owns when she heard he was struggling to find a job after quitting his previous one and she's a very caring person, and that's why I stayed and slaved away, I did it for HER. 

However, what they did to me was nastier than the Human Centipede franchise, and since everything was accomplished and my coworker thinks she's off the hook, I feel like now if I stop being angry and upset about it, it will happen again. I don't want her to feel like she's off the hook, I want her to feel as shitty as she made me feel, and I want my boss to be on the edge of her seat and ready to cater to my needs because I'm ready to submit my resignation letter if I see the slightest indication that it might happen again, including (but not limited to) another pregnancy announcement.

My best friend and I have clicked ever since we met 6 years ago. We make each other laugh and we get along extremely well and still do. A few years after we met I came out as a lesbian and shortly after she came out as bi. After this happened I realized I had feelings for her and so, naturally, I told her. She said she had feelings for me too and we began to talk every single day and about everything. I planned on asking her to officially be my girlfriend. I think she sensed this and told me that she wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. I respected this (we were in high school at the time) because I didn’t want to pressure her or lose her as a friend. Fast forward to now (4 years later): We still talk every single day, still see each other, and are probably the closest we’ve ever been. I never really fell out of love with her but I definitely think her romantic feelings for me have disappeared. However sometimes our closeness confuses me. The way she speaks to me confuses me. She’ll often say things like “Our future kids...” “Our future house...” etc. I know it’s technically a joke but it leaves me with hope that we’ll one day get together. I think, in my head, I know we won’t end up as a couple. (She has mentioned to me that she’s bisexual in that she is attracted to women but she doesn’t think she’ll ever date women.) But, I really hope we always stay in each others lives even if its just as friends. Should I eventually explain to her how I feel? Or should I let it go and hope that these feelings eventually go away.

173,"I will try to be concise as possible. 

I was hired, agreeing to pivot my career to work to grow and turn around a struggling company, and grow it into a real leader in our industry. 

In my time at the company, I have built and supported strategy, built plans and tools for our salesforce, and shaped narratives and sales pitch presentations that have allowed us to keep business of $25M+ and grown the business another $50M+, while also pulling us out of the death spiral, going from the #4 brand in our category to the #2. When we have a big customer pitch, I'm always the guy that goes and does 90% of the talking.

I am a high performer, and I have been told as much by my boss and his bosses. 

***

When I was hired, I was told that I would be a member of a team that would ""harness big data"" (ugh). I would take my experience in our industry along with my technical and management skills to be on the team, build it bigger, and to work to grow our sales and refine our bottom line. 

I was told that in one year we would focus on that, but for year one, I would focus on pulling us out of the death spiral. 

After a year, we began focusing on the team, and suddenly, the would-be team leader got an offer elsewhere. Meanwhile, I have demonstrated that I can build the tools, roll them out, and lead/influence others to do the same, and that I would have made a better leader of that team. I communicated as much.

My boss asked me what I need. I laid out a subordinate's job description (in detail - something we could publish as-is) and I laid out my would-be job description. 

This plan continues to be stalled. COVID is one of the reasons, but our industry is having a record year because of COVID, and our company is posting better numbers than ever. We have had more opportunities, and my time to focus on strategy has dried up as I am stuck with entire weeks of day-to-day work, along with those stupid requests from high on for information that an intern or entry level should be pulling.

I already have updated my resume. My linkedin is in top shape, and I have premium LinkedIn turned on. I have been carefully jumping back into my network of colleagues, as I know that word does travel. Regardless, I will jump or use another offer as leverage to get what I want, or to leave for a better opportunity. 

But I don't have that offer yet.

**How do I have the conversation with my boss ""Look - you will be hard pressed to find someone who can do what I do with the strategic knowledge, the industry knowledge, and the company knowledge if I leave - and you'll never find someone that will accept what you pay me now. I was led to believe that there were career development plans for me that have not come to fruition. I have reduced costs, made our data systems more efficient, and I've grown/sustained over $75M worth of business.

174,"About two months ago, I (F19) got out of an abusive relationship (physically and emotionally) that I was in for about a year and a half, after we broke up, I spent a lot of time talking to the small group of friends online that I play games with. I am the only female in the group. About two weeks after the break up, I started jokingly flirting with one of the guys (we will call him J, for convenience). Things progressed pretty quick that night and we ended up ‘sexting’ I guess over Snapchat. J then told me that he’s not ready for a relationship and I assured him that I’m not either and it was just a bit of fun.

 During this time, another friend (let’s call him B) from our group expressed interest and we ended up hooking up. For the next week, me and J were always talking on Snapchat and calling eachother cute and whatnot. I realised I had slight feelings for him and I told him about a day after I realised, but I assured him that I still didn’t want a relationship. We talked that night and he said he didn’t feel the same way and he feels bad for leading me on. I said that it was okay and I didn’t want things to change at all between us. We proceeded to do ~things~ over the phone that night until about 7am. I was then informed that B had feelings for me, which I somewhat reciprocated, but was very confused. 

The next day, a good friend of ours (who is very close to both J and B) messaged me a bit angrily and we had an argument about both of them and how he feels like I’m “cheating on both of them with eachother”. We ended up discussing my feelings and everything that was happening for about three hours. I had said that J doesn’t like me and so I’ll eventually get over my feelings for him and maybe then, things can progress with B. He went and discussed everything with J and then I got a message from him (J) saying that he “can’t deal with it cause he has real life stuff he needs to handle” and then he blocked me. 

After he blocked me, I realised my feelings were a lot stronger than I thought and since then (this happened on the 29th of July), my mental health has been declining rapidly and I haven’t gone a single day without crying. Everything reminds me of him and he has refused to talk to me about anything. He has said through a mutual that he doesn’t plan on ever unblocking me. I’ve since lost most of my friends since I was too sad and I have hardly spoken to any of them about anything. 

I just want to stop thinking about him everytime I hear a song or see something that reminds me of him. How do I do that?

175,"So, this isn't my real account, I've posted here a few times, but I'm wondering something. If you are planning to have sex with someone, are you a jerk for wanting them to get tested first? How would you go about asking them to get tested? My original approach that I'm planning to do is get tested before her she does, and show her, and if she decides to, I'll pay for it for her. Also, would it be possible for someone who lives in another country to get tested in a country they are just visiting?  


The reason why I ask this is because the girl I want to spend my life with it a US Citizen, she wants to come visit me up in Canada, and I was wondering if they would test her here. If not, that's okay. Sorry, it's a bit of a loaded question, but I just want to know, because I tend to be a tiny bit paranoid about this sort of stuff. I want to be safe and not catch anything, but I also don't want to be an asshole about this.",04Aug2020,1

177,"My friend of roughly 5 years started dating a guy around December and for some reason he doesn’t like me. She has described him as incredibly insecure and overprotective of her. Our friend group kind of agreed that this person was shitty and she seemed to want to end things. This was about a month ago. 

Anyway, tonight I wanted to play some cod and I text our group chat about it and no response. Whatever, nobody’s on. Come to find out she’s online. Not only is she online but she’s streaming and she’s playing with him and his friend. I invite her to my game so I can watch it pop up on stream and she ignores it. She dodged my texts earlier too. This kind of set me off and I don’t know how to process it. I probably should, but I need to rant about it. 

For context, I have no romantic interest in her. Me and him have zero history. Her boyfriend went to the same school as me, and although we had a mutual friend through my roommate my sophomore year, that’s about it. I’ve never met him or interacted with him. Neither of us understand why he doesn’t like me, except for the obvious “he’s trying to take my girl.” I had kind of a womanizer phase in college so maybe yes, but if I knew her for 5 years and nothing happened between us... ??

For more context, yes it’s just a video game. But, I tend to get very upset over small things like this. I have my own issues with giving unrequited attention too much emotional weight. To me, ambiguity from my friends leads me to spiral into “they must hate me” rhetoric. That being said, I’m getting older now and I want to start surrounding myself with people who care enough about me to not put me in these situations. She knows this about me. Just like I know to be more sympathetic with things that may upset her, she should with me, right? A simple “hey I’m playing with boyfriendsName right now” would have been enough for me to not care about it. I feel like our 5 year long friendship deserves some more credit than a guy she has spoken nothing but poor things of. 

How do I approach this? Am I blowing it out of proportion? Is she a good friend?",04Aug2020,1

180,"This is going to be a long one but I hope you can help me out.

This all starts awhile back. I was probably 10 or younger (I’m 17 and entering college now) when my parents started sleeping in separate rooms. Never thought much of it, I knew my mom was a snorer so thats what I figured was the reason.

Anywho - here’s a little background. I have 3 siblings, one older and two younger. My mom and dad have always made life seem normal. Never really fought with the exception of a few heated arguments when I was young. Mom makes more money than Dad, so finances have been a rolling issue. My parents were never the lovebird type but I always thought it was at least an average marriage. Or so I thought...

Today I’m driving in the car with my mom to a family function discussing why my older sister is going to therapy (for totally valid reasons involving her mental health). My mom mentions if I ever thought I needed a therapist, to which I jokingly scoffed at because I felt I was never really emotional. Then my mom says something like “well I have been going as well.” At this point the mood got very solemn. I asked her why she went, and she got teary eyed and said “we can talk about it later, just not right now”

So I’m like WHAT THE FUCK is she talking about I never knew my mom needed a therapist. Im thinking Is she Ok? Is my dad cheating on her? Is my sister spiraling out of control?

On the way home tonight I make a point to drive in a separate car with my older sister. I bring up what happened and asked about her seeing a therapist. My older sister than says “Oh, you don’t know?”

Know what? What’s going on?

She goes on to tell me that my mom is adamantly considering a divorce with my father as soon as possible. I was in disbelief honestly, I always made jokes whenever my parents would seem off that they were divorcing, and they would both respond something like “not us, we are in it for the long run.” So I’m fucking shook. My father obviously makes less money than my mother which is putting a strain on our family. (For example, we have never gone on a real vacation) Also, my father grew up in an abusive household that my mother believes is causing him to project his emotions on to her, making her feel guilty. There is no infidelity going on, so I have these questions...

• Do they really need a divorce? Can’t we fix these things without needed to tear apart a family? My youngest sister is 11 and she would have a really difficult time with this.
• Does my dad need a wake up call? He has been manipulative in the past and convinces my mom everything is okay basically by sweetalking her. Do I tell him to get his shit together?
• I really don’t want them to split. I know it isn’t my business, but how to I go about telling them this?

Also both my parents don’t know that my older sister (20) told me any of this. Shes the only one supposed to know.

187,"Apologies if any errors, I'm on mobile.

This is also a bit of a vent, so sorry if I go off topic of explaining. Also sorry if it gets too long. 

There have been a few things that made my father become less of a father to me in these past two years.

I really don't know where to start, so I may accidentally jump around the timeline a bit...

I was raised in a home of a single mother. My parents divorced when I was 1. We are more Christian than most families, but not as hard-core as the others.

My mom taught me to like everyone regardless of race, sexuality, etc. And because of that, in 2019 I came out as pansexual. My mother accepted me.

Although my parents are divorced, I see my father a few times a year, like on Christmas, fathers day, Thanksgiving, etc. So although we dont talk much, we have a nice relationship. At least back then.

My father is slightly racist, and homophobic. He was raised in the hardcore Christian household. He likes to preach about sinning, but he does stuff that makes him unworthy to be able to preach.

Then, in October, I decided to call him and tell him. As of me finially coming out to him, (a month or two later from coming out to my mom) he reacted worse than I thought. I expected some hate to spew out, but I thought he would at least know he was talking to his only child.

I dont remember much what he said, as I cried once he started to spew fire at me. I do remember one specific thing he said to me, which he denies to this day.

""People like you should have your ass beaten, so some sense can be knocked into you.""

I hung up on him after a little more of him ""preaching"" to me.

I had to, as my mom likes to say nowadays, ""tattle"" on my father. She ripped him a new one. He denied everything I told her.

I've learned my father is like a child. And because of that day, he lost so much trust and respect from me.

That call was the worst call of my life (and still is.) 

My mom, wanting me to still have a father in my life, made me go to his Thanksgiving. My father promised to not talk about anything that happened.

He didn't say anything, and I'm glad. But I know so much that he wanted to.

Before all this, we were like two peas in a pod when we were together. I was his little girl, and he was my dearest father. 

I saw him a few more times, Christmas and New Years. Nothing happened. I thought he just accepted the fact that I am what I am, and he can't change it.

I was wrong. To a point at least.

I went to his house on Father's day, as did my grandparents did too. Everything was going great! Everyone was laughing, and I got to see my seemingly dearest father for a few days.

My family, as per tradition, started talking politics in the living room while football played in the backround. I was disinterested in what they were talking about, as I am a teenager. Ya know. But I was sitting on my dad's lap, and was hugging him. We were just simply hugging while he was talking.

Suddenly, above my music I was listening to, I heard my father say something that hurt me down to the bone.

""All those gay people in California should just rot and burn. They shouldn't have rights!""

Or something along those lines. It was so degrading. And he said it WHEN I WAS IN HIS ARMS. He is either trying to prove a point to me, or is so dense that he offended someone, and doesn't know why. 

I got up, saying I had to use the restroom. I called my mom, and told her to come and get me. I was crying. I am glad my dad's house has thick walls.

I told my stepmother that I had some bad cramps. (I actually did, but they were mild/tolerable.) She got me a heating pad, and I told her that I already called my mom, and she was coming to get me.

Laying in that bed for 2 hours, acting as if I was in pain (I know what BAD cramps feel like, so I just used muscle memory to squirm around.) 

My dad came in about 30 minutes of having the heating pad. He asked if I REALLY wanted to go home.

I said, ""I'm sorry, but this pain is just unbearable!""

I wasn't sorry. I was only sorry to lying to my stepmother. She is an angel, and a beautiful woman. She deserves better than my father (a bit more explanation later on.)

When my mom got there, she had a look that could just kill my dad. My dad tried asking, but we drove away mid sentence. That got a chuckle out of me.

So, about my stepmother (who I'll call Angie for now on) I think she needs a better man who her own good. 

She was, before my dad, in a abusive relationship. She happily escaped that man.

Although my dad isn't as bad as that man, I can easily compare the two.

My dad hits any dog he owns. If the dog does something bad? Smack. Eat something they aren't supposed to? Smack.

They're not petty smacks, they're SMACKS. Right on the face. And hitting animals soon leads to hitting other beings. (Please never hit anything, unless self defense, its cruel.)

Every. Single. Time. I come over, my dad and Angie fight. Well, its not even a fight. My dad just yells while Angie just keeps saying, ""I'm sorry!"" Its NOT normal fighting.

Most fights come out of something stupid. The last one was because one of their dogs couldn't get up on their bed, and dad blamed Angie. I was in the other room, so I didn't hear everything said.

But due to my dad's large build (ex- airforce man) I am now scared of him. I am scared that he will hit me, or Angie. Each fight my dad has a face that says, ""I will HURT you."" I don't know if he has actually hit Angie, but he hasn't hit me...yet.



Me and my father have so many more good years than bad years. I want to keep my relationship with him, and not cut contact. But I will if deemed necessary. 

Should I try and keep our relationship? If so, what should I do? I felt like I've done everything in my power to.

My family has made jokes about me doing that for years, and have even confiding to my mom in tears about it because it was brought up so many times. Life goes on and I start to develop anger issues in a way towards games. I break 4 electronics and my family says that’s it we are not paying anymore for your mistakes and I am fine with that. This is another thing that they seem to not let down from time to time. Fast forward and I enjoy the switch, mainly smash bros ultimate.

They are brand new. I get so pissed that I resort to extreme measures to cool myself like using my phone cord as a whip or taking a belt and choke myself until I get dizzy. I have been doing this in reaction to not only things that get me pissed, but to things that get me stressed. My only escape and enjoyment is ruined, I don’t want to do something else, but nothing seems to ever go right. My anger has made me the laughing stock of my family if you will and strains my relationships with them. Doesn’t help that when I get made fun for the problems that I thought I moved from, now understand that they are not complete pieces of shit. They treat me right sometimes. When I get angry I slam my bed or worst hit the controller, but I only play the game to be alone and enjoy that time. It hurts when they tell me to calm down and I say things like go away or provoke them on purpose. I even say that because I am pissed I am going to respond with words you don’t like. I am broken, that is it, I know I am not alone am pathetic at times, but there are too many things that I am afraid and pissed about at the same time I don’t know what to do.

200,"(18F) This is my first post on reddit, so please bear with me. For some backstory, I’ve been in love with this guy for four years. He doesn’t live in the same state as me, we met online in a small group chat and knew each other about two years before we started our relationship. At one point, we both admitted to having feelings for each other and we were together for a couple months. After awhile though he kept saying how bothered he was by the distance and how he wanted me to have normal experiences in a relationship. One day, he broke up with me telling me he never loved me and ghosted me (to the point where he made new socials).

Months went on and we reconnected after I called him out on how he left things. He was very cold towards me and very rude when I’d ask why he did what he did. I was still very much inlove with him and I had told him how I felt still and how talking to him made me sad. He had told me that he didn’t care if I blocked him and that I wasn’t worth stopping. 

A month later, he started dating a girl from his hometown with the same name and facial features as me. I remember seeing pictures of them together and feeling sick to my stomach. After a year of them dating she had left him almost like how he had left me. He reconnected with me again and at the time i was in a relationship myself. The time away from him made the feelings die down but once he was back it all came flooding back. I loved my boyfriend but it was never the same love I had for (let’s call him “Tom”).

Tom and I began talking to each other everyday and having facetime calls. I’d always call him after my boyfriend had done something shitty or if I wanted to hear his voice when I was feeling depressed. I knew I was in a relationship and how wrong it felt, but at the time my relationship was in a really bad place. Anyways after a couple months, “Tom” started to be around less and something in my gut told me something was wrong. I know this is super toxic, but I started looking at his likes and followers. I noticed this girl who had tagged him in a wholesome meme and my heart dropped. I pushed it off though, and at the time I honestly believed “Tom” might of had feelings for me again. I sent him a whole Christmas package with art I had drawn for him because he said he wanted to hang them up in his room. 

Anyways, a month went on and when we’d facetime he’d always suddenly leave and say “sorry getting another call, I’ve got to go, bye” and it didn’t feel right. One night we called again and he brought up the fact that he did have a girlfriend. I don’t even know how to explain the pit in my stomach. We didn’t call after that and he barely texted anymore. We started having constant on and off fights and most of the time he’d tell me not to drop him, and that he wanted me around. But one day he did ghost me again, and I stopped talking as well. This happened recently in March but now we’re talking again. He’s still with the girlfriend. The way he texts sometimes still throws me off, sometimes it’s nice and sweet and makes me rethink that he does still love me but other times he’s distant and doesn’t wanna be bothered with me. 

He’s moving soon to his own apartment and I’m genuinely so scared that his new girlfriend will be moving with him. I know it’s stupid but it hurts a lot and I don’t know if I can keep going on this cycle. I’m not sure what to do at this point and I honestly want to move on with my life so bad. I’m not sure whether to burn the bridge with him completely so I can’t talk to him again or to just simply be honest with him and possibly get my heart broken. 

Any advice would be really appreciated and if you have any questions about anything feel free to ask. It was really hard to put every bit of info into this lol.

But i finished my degree basically just to get the piece of paper. A couple of rewards were waiting on the other side, but now there all ruined

I graduated into nothing. I sat in my apartment by myself for a month a half until someone could get me, graduation cancelled and no celebrations thanks to our shitty response to a pandemic that everyone else has under control. I was supposed to be in england right now as a graduation gift, but that's double canceled by travel bans and the passport office being so slowed down that i haven't gotten my passport 6 months later (not their fault but still.) Then i finally get home and half the fun of being home is having a car i couldn't take to school, so i could go places and see my friends. Going places canceled, again thanks to pandemic. Friends canceled, because I've violently broken up with most of them over shit that's been brewing for years. Now the only people i have to talk to live super far away, so even if there wasn't the threat of death every time you go outside, I'd still have no one to do things with. For over a year now I've been so excited that after years I'll finally be able to celebrate my birthday and halloween (my favorite holiday), both during the semester, at home with my friends, and actually be able to do something fun instead of sitting alone in my apartment throwing a pity party like i have been, and now that definitely won't happen and i don't even have the excuse of a good reason.

I don't know how to feel like everything isn't pointless and stupid. I don't know how to feel like hope isn't a useless emotion that will just let you down. I don't know how to not hope things will be good for once, even though i feel like everything goes to hell every time i look forward to it. I don't want to hurt myself or anything, but man it just feels like everything sucks all the time and it's not worth trying to be happy. It's hard to keep looking forward to things when it just seems to consistently let me down. What can i do to combat this hopelessness and how do i temper my hopes so it doesn't hurt so much when shit hits the fan in the future?",04Aug2020,1
204,"For like 5 years now my mom who’s 52 has been being crazy just about every night. She’s broken things. Screamed at the top of her lungs for no reason. Told me that she hates me or whatever. I don’t really know what to do. It’s getting quite unbearable. I’m 16 and I don’t really have anywhere else to go. I don’t want to go into a foster home. That would suck. I’ve talked to her about being better many times. That doesn’t work. As of right now my plan is to stick it out until I can move out. Tonight she’s been a little extra crazy. She’s broken my door and I have my bed blocking it. She’s screamed about how she’s gonna destroy my drums, guitar, computer, everything I own. All things that IVE earned and payed for with MY money. I can’t call the cops because of reasons I’m not gonna list. I’m now going to copy and paste a thing I sent to my gf and my best friend. 

“And I came home and took out her food and like prepared it on the table. Then she came in and I was walking away with my food and she was like. “What the fuck are you doing” and I was like going to eat. And she was like where’s my food and I pointed at the table and was like “right there” and she said “my bag is fucking empty you piece of shit” and I took the bag and pointed at the food and was like there’s the food and she hit my bag and drink and was like “FUCK YOU” and I was like “YOURE FOOD IS RIGHT THERE DUMB ASS” and walked to my room and started eating cus like some of my fries were on the floor and my drink got busted but I still like have it. So I’m eating and I hear “FUCKING DAMNIT FUCKING DAMNIT FUCKING DAMNIT” and I walked out and was like what’s wrong and she threw her fries at me and was like “NOTHING” so I just walked away and then she started crying and I was like what’s wrong and she said “nothing go eat” so like I went back to eating. Then she opened the door and was like hey Elvis wants to come in and I said no Elvis and took him out and closed my door and she was like “REALLY FUCK YOU” and started pounding on the door and said “I WILL BREAK YOUR DRUMS I WILL SELL YOUR GUITAR I WILL BREAK YOUR COMPUTER I WILL DESTROY ALL OF IT” for like 2 minutes. My door is locked and I’m just eating. And she’s still slamming on my door. Then she walked away and I heard ruckus which I guess is my drums and she yelled “WE HATE YOU. I HATE YOU FUCK YOU YOU MOTHER FUCKER I HATE YOU” and screaming and what not. Then she came back and started slamming on my door again laughing and was like “HIIII ELVIS HAHAHA” then she slammed on my door more and was like “IM SELLING EVERYTHINT YOU OWN I HATE YOU FUCK YOU YOU PIECE OF SHIT. ROXY HATES YOU. ELVIS HATES YOU. I HATE YOU. IM GONNA STAY UP. IM NOT GOING TO SLEEP. IM GONNA STAY UP AND FUCK WITH YOU ALL NIGHT”

205,"22F here - I started working PT at this online company in January, and the boss CONTINUOUSLY said it would be a three-month trial and then a 12-month contract after that. Boss constantly told me ""contract is almost done"", ""speaking with attorney about your contract"", ""getting your employee handbook soon"". Was also promised benefits and a pay raise. Pandemic hits, so I don't start full-time until June, so fine (although my late full-time start was not due to pandemic, I asked to finally set a date in stone after four months had passed because I was hoping I'd lock down a contract). **Boss asked me to take a pay cut during lockdown months (April and May), but when I said that would put me under minimum wage, they said minimum wage laws didn't apply to me because I wasn't a contracted employee, just a ""contractor"".**

NOW, August, two months after I started full-time, I JUST received an ""employee handbook"" and my job description - which is nothing more than a basic bullet list in a Word document (suuuper professional, thank you). I skimmed the handbook and asked where my contract was - **boss said there is no contract because I'm an employee, not a contractor. WTF?!?!?**

I've been wanting to leave this horrid job for a while because of my lack of contract (and now saying it doesn't exist) + never getting promised benefits or a pay raise. I understand it's been a wild year and I should be thankful I have a job, but I'd rather make pennies starting my own company than stay here for minimum wage in a field where I have 4+ years experience and where my co-workers deliberately ignore my criticism and ideas while constantly asking me if a task is done DAYS after I send it off.

I checked my HaNdBoOk and it says that ""although advanced notice is not required, \[company\] requests at least **4 weeks' written notice of resignation**"". FOUR WEEKS is not standard. Considering I was lied to about a contract and not given my handbook until TWO MONTHS after I started working full time, I would not feel guilty about leaving within a week. My work is non-essential and I have another job lined up already - and offering me more than this sham of a company.

Would it be wrong of me to give a week's notice instead? If they didn't give me a contract (or at least a handbook) in a timely manner, I don't feel bad about leaving.

PS: I'm not putting this job down for resume or references, so I don't mind leaving in a less-than-perfect manner (but I don't want to be an a-hole either).",04Aug2020,1
206,"Hi... so my bf is on a beach trip with his brother (much older) &amp; sister (between me &amp; bf in age), and he hasn’t texted me much all day today which is fine because I understand.... you’re on vacation spending time w your family. 

However, I was on my Instagram explore page &amp; saw this girl’s post &amp; ironically found that his sister liked the post. (I don’t think this is coincidence.) I clicked on her page just bc I liked this girls outfit. I found that only my bf &amp; his sister follow this girl..... found that kind of odd as I’m from a small town &amp; they don’t travel together ever... if more people I knew followed this girl, I literally wouldn’t have batted an eye. So I click on the girls followers &amp; following and see that her &amp; bfs sister JUST started following each other. My bf &amp; her have been following each other for awhile. Another ironic thing is that she’s only 3 hrs away from where they are staying (her location is in her bio before y’all think I’m a creep lol). 

Before anyone says “Talk to your bf??????” I’m 99% sure he’s asleep rn as he’s an hour ahead of me.... I just find this so odd..... my mind is racing like have they been planning to hang out on his trip???? How long has he been talking to her?? Etc. My bf &amp; I have been together 2 yrs in December. I don’t want to ask his sister or anything bc I know she will lie for him if something is going on.......

213,"I fell for a guy about a year ago over online. I found myself thinking about him non-stop. Then one day, I finally decided from how unsure I was about how he felt about me and from all the mixed signals, to tell him how I feel. I figured if I tell him how I feel and he doesn’t feel the same well I can just move on and get over him quickly and stop wasting time thinking about him. 
This however wasn’t the case. In fact he completely ignored the fact that I confessed my feelings which made it hard on both of us in the friendship and we went our separate ways. He didn’t flat out tell me “Oh I’m not interested or feel the same, but he didn’t really think much about me having a crush on him. He acted like it was whatever, and gave me a simple compliment on me being attractive.
Well, after we went out separate ways, I now have learned that mixed signals is a signal. And looking back at the whole friendship I realized he didn’t like me... like at all.
 I just feel like such a fool. I feel like I should’ve never told him how I felt, cause now I still can’t get over him! He is all that I think about but at the same time I just keep thinking about the regret of the confession. I literally think about him all the time and I’ve been doing this for months now. I keep having this hope that we will talk again one day. That one day he will like me back. I guess it’s hard for me because I had never experienced rejection. I have borderline personality disorder and whenever I think about this rejection it makes me literally cry. So this is more so why I just want to get over it, I hate feeling sad.

216,"I am 23 and for my whole life I feel as if I've been destroying my own life and every life that I come in contact with. My parents got married because they got pregnant with me, because of this, they were in a toxic physically and emotionally abusive marriage for 20 years until my parents got divorced and my mom left us. Sometimes I think about all she could have been if I was not born. 

My father molested my half sister until she was 18 and moved across the county, however he never touched me, so I feel at fault. I also knew this was going on because I shared a room with her. I never said anything and I felt so guilty. I was molested by my uncle on my moms side who passed away a couple of years ago, when I spoke about it, my moms side of the family was angry and stopped talking to me. I think about how hard it must of been for them. 

Then my father died last year in July, I feel like if i had quit school and tried extra hard to take care of him he would still be alive. I had to drop out of school to help my brothers take care of bills, and I don't know what I did wrong but they left me too. They moved in with their girlfriends families, both girlfriends they had only know for less than two months, so I must have fucked up really bad for them to up and leave me. A couple of weeks after my dads death my best friend got a boyfriend and I felt horrible for asking her for any attention because the boyfriend is more important. 

My boyfriend does not want me to live with him until at least 2 more years or so. We have been together for 8-ish months, and he has yet to say he loves me. I have a high sex drive I feel like that annoys him. I only see him once a week and it seems like sex is scheduled and routine, missionary for 5 minutes and done. He never says it, but I feel like if i was 20-30 lbs (or 13 kilos for my metric friends) I could be on top or we could try more positions. I am making this post because he told me he kind of wanted the night to himself. He says I didn't do anything, but I feel like I did. I try so hard to be perfect and give him space, look pretty, and be emotionally supportive to him but some how I still feel like a bother. 

I have a therapist, but due to covid its only by phone, which I feel like I'm bothering them because there are patients with bigger problems then me. I take Zoloft but I cant afford it at the moment because I am paying my rent alone for the next 3 months. 

I made this post because I was looking into a better job because I currently work in fast food which I feel is pathetic at my age. The jobs that I should be working require more schooling. I am currently in school, and will be done in a year but all my friends are getting better jobs because they live with their parents and can go to school full time without worrying about bills so I feel like i'm the odd one out because I live alone and don't have a good job yet or parents taking care of me.  

Right now I've been reflecting on how I've been destroying the lives of people around me, if my dad didn't die my brothers would still live with me, my friends wouldn't have had to provide me emotional support last year, and I would have been done with school and have a better job/car. I wouldn't have gained weight while grieving and I wouldn't be so fat so my boyfriend would want me around more.

How do I get my life on track? How do I make it right to everyone I have wronged? especially my brothers? and how do I get a better job fast before my school is over so people don't look down on me for working in fast food? Any advice helps I just feel so alone and emotionally drained.",04Aug2020,1

218,"I've been in a serious relationship for over a year now, and the girl I'm dating is amazing, selfless, beautiful, and incredibly intelligent. My issue is that the relationship before my current one was emotionally abusive and ended with me finding out my then GF (now ex) had been cheating on me for the majority of it. My ex had lied and gas-lighted me through the entirety of the year we were together and I haven't really realized the impact it's had on my emotional state and relationship views until recently.

As I said before, my current GF is the best person I've ever met and I mean that wholehearted. Though I keep finding myself having feelings of fear and distrust towards her which is clearly leftover from my previous relationship. It's been incredibly hard for me to deal with because logically I know that I have absolutely no reason to feel these ways, yet I still find myself expecting her to cheat and hide things from me. I need advice on how to handle these feelings, and what I could do to relieve myself of them.

I also suffer from depressive episodes and panic attacks from these same feelings. I have talked to my GF about these feelings and she's been very understanding, but I'm still having immense difficulty dealing with them. I feel like it's incredibly unfair to her to have to deal with these issues when she's had no part in creating them.

220,"Context - I live in a beautiful new apartment. My parents are the landlords and I am head tenant. I had a guy move in around 2 months ago. I basically run the apartment and take care of most of the cleaning including the bathroom. I like it this way, and my flatmate has very little domestic experience 

I’ve noticed the whole time he has been dripping on the edge of the bowl and that it tends the then drip of the floor. By the end of the week it’s all yellowed and stinks. I put up with cleaning this for a while until a couple of weeks ago I decided I need to talk to him about it. 

I approached it in a clinical, matter of fact way. I demsontrated where on the toilet and floor I usually see his mess and asked him to wipe the edge of the bowl with toilet paper if he drips, and that the floor will need to be wiped with a disinfectant wipe if it drips there. He (naturally) was mortified, but was very understanding. Awkward but it went well. 

No problems since then until last night. Noticed that there was a significant spray of urine on the left edge of the bowl rim which continued down to the left side of the floor by the toilet. There was so much I thought it was water at first. I cleaned it up. 

Please help me. I’m not sure how to manage this situation anymore. Does he have a urinary issue? Should I tell him he needs to sit down? HELP!! Feeling frustrated and disgusted.",04Aug2020,1

222,"I'm (28F) not sure how to articulate this problem, other than I feel weird about it. For context, I love my husband, I don't think he's doing anything wrong, and I'm also CF. We've been together 7 years.

Short back story: I grew up in a strict household. I don't have a relationship with my family for various reasons. No outward hate towards them (I don't promote that I don't speak to them, if I run into shared connections I don't say anything negative, etc), and my life is better for having chosen not to ""improve"" our relationship.

Fast forward several traumas (aka most people's 20's amiright), and a lot of work, and I'm in a place where I can come to terms with some of the situations in my past and move forward. One such experience happened at 15.

Short version, I had an abortion. I was in an abusive relationship with a gang-related individual a few years older than me, from roughly 13 to 19. I never really had ""the talk"" with my parents, was pressured into sex etc, and ended up getting pregnant at 15 during a period in which I ran away from home for a few weeks. I didn't know I was pregnant for probably 2 months because you know, 15 year olds are stupid. Like I mentioned, my parents were strict. My bedroom window was boarded up all throughout high school, there was a padlock on the outside of my door, and I wasn't to be left alone. They didn't care about things like my grades, a license, life skills etc. That would be my responsibility to figure out when kicked out at 18, but until then they were really controlling about me having friends, using the phone or internet, and not being able to leave the house unless for school. So when I realized I had missed my period for the second time, I was absolutely fucking terrified lol. 

I've talked about this experience with my husband from beginning to end. That I skipped school to get a ""free pregnancy test"" from a ""clinic"" near my high school, only to be pressured by a covert religious anti-abortion group that my only option was ""figuring it out"" because ""murder isn't an option"" while handing me pictures of what was inside of me. That my mom, the sleuthing butthole that she is, noticed I wasn't throwing away any pads (tampons are slutty) for the second month in a row, and tricked me into taking a pregnancy test by saying ""it was for testing my thyroid"" (I have an autoimmune disorder). That I went to bed crying that night because I didn't know what was going to happen to me, and was woken up at 6 am by my parents without ever being spoken to. That my original thought that they were dropping me off at school early that day because they didn't want to look at me was actually incorrect, and without my knowledge they were instead driving me to a clinic on the otherside of town. That, still without being spoken to, my dad dropped me and my mom at the curb in front of a group of screaming protesters who were waving signs in my face, blocking our path to the door, calling us ""murderers"". That my mom legit sobbed in the waiting room. That I didn't fully comprehend what was happening until they began the process by taking me to get an ultrasound, before being ""counseled"" on if I knew what I was doing and if I had any second thoughts before moving forward (if I said no, I was afraid of what my parents would do to ""us""). That I fell asleep on a cold metal table with no pants on surrounded by super aloof doctors, and woke up 6 hours later in a recliner surrounded by drugged up crying women in other recliners. That I had to be assisted back to the car, through the protesters, because I was unable to walk on my own. That I had to stay home from school for a week, and everyone at school found out. That my boyfriend called me to tell me I was a baby killer, and his entire family hated me. That I thought that was the end of it, but sometime later realized in a grocery store bathroom what an abortion actually is. That my mom, finding me passed out in the bathroom stall covered in blood, was embarrassed by me not ""holding it in longer"", and they were inconvenienced by having to leave their cart to take me home instead. That I wasn't supposed to have sex for six weeks, but was pressured into it again after 3 and it kind of fucked me up. 

Etcetera and so forth.

I've come to terms, in words with my husband, that even though having a kid at 15 is a stupid idea, and I'm not necessarily regretful of not having to raise a child, I'm regretful of the experience. Like, me NOW is childfree. But, there is a version of me in another universe who did want kids (at least that one specifically), because had I had given birth, part of me also would have been okay with the life I'd have now with a 13 year old. I DON'T want kids, and I'm pro-choice, to clarify. I like being selfish and working exclusively on bettering myself. I will never want kids. But part of me mourns the daughter I was going to have, like she was unceremoniously taken from the world and I did nothing to prevent it. 

I've cried about this. I really broke through recently and was like, fuck man, I had a shot at raising a kid once and now I'm 100% child free. I never want to be a mom, but also, I almost was and I never will be again. It's confusing and I don't fully get it emotionally. 

I can tell that this makes my husband SUPER uncomfortable. Not the details, but the emotional weight I seem to carry about the actual potential kid itself. Almost as if he worries I may change my mind one day (I won't), and that I'm only agreeing to be child free for him (I'm not). He's very, very supportive. None of his weirdness is translated into his support of me. But when you're with someone for 7 years, you pick up on the shit they aren't saying. 

Tldr-ish: Why am I feeling mournful for a child I don't want, and how do I talk about it with my equally CF partner in a way that doesn't create distance between us? 

Thanks for reading my fucking novel lol.",04Aug2020,1
223,"So I (24F) have always been far more cautious about things than my little brother (22M).   


I know I can't tell him to do things, and quite frankly, I don't want to. He may be younger than me, but he *is* an adult. However, I can't quite shake my worries over his decision making and how it, usually, seems to be a spur of the moment decision with big consequences.   


I have a story for my reason for not feeling like I can openly speak to him to actually voice my worries and the current situation that has me coming here for advice.   


My Reason:  
Back in December, during a storm, my brother and his wife decided to go out late with their friends. Usually not a problem, and not uncommon for them, but I did mention that they should be careful because it was getting to a temperature where it would freeze and I was worried about them sliding on black ice. My brother, after their night out, came home and disowned me. For three days he didn't talk to me and when he did, it was always through our mother. I won't lie, I was devastated and didn't know what I had done past trying to make sure they would be safe. After back and forth, with our mom as an unfortunate messenger since he wouldn't speak to me, things were patched. But I've always been afraid of voicing my worries or concerns since then.   


My Current Worry:   


With the pandemic going on, things are pretty much a coin flip in the air on if things will be okay or if they'll send all of us crashing. My brother decided that right now would be the best time to move out with his wife. They want to have their own space and move forward with their lives and I understand that. What I worry about is the fact that they're moving out, agreeing to pay rent, when neither one has a job. They're moving into a friend's place, though this friend is someone they've only known for a couple of months. And it scares me because there's a lot of ways that could go badly. I want my brother to succeed and I want him to do well in life, but talking about my worries with this just...felt like it was off the table? I tried speaking to him about it once and he brushed me off so...I'm trying to go with the mentality of ""You have to let them make their own mistakes and learn"". Which is slightly more difficult to do than anticipated.   


So they've just moved to their friend's house (like an hour ago) and I can't seem to push away that worry that something bad might happen. My usual attempts at distracting myself from things aren't working (funny youtube videos, writing, talking with friends, gaming, watching tv) and I'm hoping some of you might be able to help. What can I do to move forward and get past the worry? What can I do to distract myself from possibilities that haven't even happened yet?   


I feel like I'm drowning myself in what if's and I'm not sure how to get past that. I don't want my brother to cut me off because I'm worried about his wellbeing again. I'm not sure when it went from a sibling caring for another to him believing I think he's still a child (I don't. I'm proud of him for everything he's done and I'm proud of the man he is) but I don't want him to take my worrying/anxiety as me believing he's incapable of doing something. So any advice on how to move past that worrying and focus on something else would be great.

Maybe it’s bc I’ve been quarantining with my family for so long and hanging out with pretty much the same people, but I just wonder why people like me. I feel like I’m awkward, I’m kind of weird, I don’t blend in, and the catch here is that a year and some months ago, I was practically friendless and living a very lonely life. I have a friend group now I think which is super crazy to me and it’s something that I’ve only had up until now. And it’s like for the most part people like me and I’ve gotten compliments as well, but Idk why I feel like a loser still.

It’s been over a year and I think the whole COVID thing just kind of retriggered something in me, and my environment and routine was changed drastically and now here I am, just very anxious and with a unstable self esteem.

Gyms have reopened so I’m starting to build my routine there, but no matter how many positive experiences I’ve had before, it’s just like any negative experience trumps that, and I just still feel inadequate.",04Aug2020,1
227,"When I was 11 I moved to live with my father and step mother. As time went on, I got super depressed and I isolated myself in my room for years of my life and barely did anything else. On top of dealing with that loneliness and depression, I now realize I was just building up resent towards my dad for having to move and live with him. Now I’m fine with it because I ended up better off, but I didn’t reach that point until later (like high school age). The issue is that while dealing with all of that, I also had to deal with him constantly yelling and getting mad over every little thing. He constantly treated my older sister like shit and yelled at her and once she was 18, constantly threatened to kick her out. I am very attached to my sister so anyone who comes after her is coming after me, so that resentment started to build. It was years of stuff like that and I grew to a point, once I moved out for college for a year, that I just stopped talking to him unless I came home and had to. Now I live with them again and I barely talk to them. I stay in my room unless I have to go to the kitchen or something. I will never care about having a relationship with my step mother because I’ve dealt with all kinds of crap from her that I don’t need to get into, so I’m not really worried about that. The only reason she’s relevant is because I don’t want her to know anything about me or my life so I don’t want to talk around her or do anything because she just makes stupid comments and stuff, therefore I don’t want to talk around my dad when they are together (most of the time lol). But my main issue is I just get so mad every time they talk to me at home. If we have to spend time together or have a meal it’s whatever I’ll talk a little bit, but any interaction at my house...I just get triggered instantly and they kill alllllll my vibes. I mean I know I don’t like living with them but dayum I get angry instantly. My dad deserves some shit for the things he’s done but I act like an asshole because it’s my default reaction",04Aug2020,1

(I’m 16 now) before I went I asked him what his intentions were and he said he wanted to cuddle and watch movies, I agreed because I trust him. After watching half of a movie we began to make out. He asked me if I wanted to give him oral and I said “no, I don’t know how” he then said “ can you try” and so I started to give him oral. After about a minute I stopped because I didn’t like it. He then asked if I wanted him to give me oral, I said no. We were making out until he asked again. I said no again. So then he asks if it would be too much to ask if I could take my panties off. I took them off. And he began giving me oral, at first I wanted him to stop but I was too shocked to stay stop. I just let it happen because it felt good. We then both fell  asleep, at least that’s how I remember it. I still think about it everyday and get anxious, I just want to know your thoughts.

231,"I’m new to reddit and I honestly have no idea what I’m doing or how to post or even what community to like post to. But I’ve got a problem with my dog regarding me as an owner and I just feel like I need to talk about it.


I got my dog a couple years ago and it was love at first sight. She was extremely young so she has been with me for almost her whole life. I’ve always had a bit of a temper but in these past couple of years it has gotten worse not because of my dog but more because I get less sleep now because of school and am constantly stressed because of school. Im quick to anger and when I do I yell which is something everyone in my family sort of does but I do it with my dog which I know is terrible. I know you don’t have to be physically abusive to be a bad pet owner. I yell at her but then I immediately feel terrible for doing so because I know that she doesn’t understand what I’m saying or why I’m upset so then I immediately start to love on her and baby her which I imagine is even more confusing because I was just angry with her seconds ago. I don’t know if this means I’m like bipolar or something with my dog or what. For several months now she hasn’t wanted to sleep in bed with me like she’s done the whole time I’ve had her. However recently these past couple of weeks she doesn’t even want to sleep in my room with me. And I’m guessing my temper is to blame because I can’t think of any other reason. And I just don’t know what to do now. she and I are best friends. I know she will never forget any of this but I want to quit doing it regardless because I love this dog more than anything else in the world. She means everything to me. She seems to still be ok with me during the day I guess because I do play fetch with her 2-3 times a day though this really only started at the beginning of quarantine. During the day when it’s not just her and I home alone she’ll check on me every now and then if I’m not in the same room as her. If she and I are home alone during the day she pretty much will stick by my side or she will lay within eyesight. 

I know first and foremost that I need to work on my temper but I guess what I’m asking is if any of you guys have suggestions on how I could reinsert myself as a positive figure in her life?",04Aug2020,1
232,"I live in California and I work at a big fast food chain, about the ranks of a Wendy's. The incident started a few weeks ago. 
Because of covid, I was unable to work as I was awaiting test results. My boss kinda accused me of faking it and as if I didn't wanna work (i had proof a member in my household had it), but then told me i can take unpaid time off and it should take 5 days to get my results max. 
Unfortunately I was denied testing several times and when I did find testing, the test took 12 days to come back. 
When the results came back I texted her immediately and called, but she ignored them. I texted the next day asking ""hey did you get my text"" with an immediate reply of ""yes ok"". I texted back if I'd get back on the schedule and such, but she's now ignored me for several days now.
But this is where it gets a little weird. I referred a friend to this job and he's no longer receiving hours as of this week. He said he talked to her and she was upset he was working another job (one with better pay and hours), so she was just ignoring him and she mentioned me in her rant to him. 
She's actively ignoring both of our calls and texts and not giving straight answers anymore. I for one am wondering if I'm fired or not without even being told (or just left to rot on the roster for no unemployment) and he's wondering if he'll even see another shift. I tried going in person and she wasn't even there and I'm not sure what to do.

234,"So a quick backstory, my ex and I were high school sweethearts and were each other’s first everything. I’m a year older in school so I went to college first. We were together for almost 4 years but I ended things going into my senior year of college. Last I knew she had a new boyfriend that I just assumed she was going to marry.

Fast forward to a month or so ago and she messages me out of the blue. She’s no longer with the new guy. It’s been 5 years since we last spoke but we decide to meet up and sparks begin to fly again. We’ve been dating ever since and things have felt great between us. That is until she today when she confided in me that she got an abortion a few years back.

I have no issue with a woman’s right to choose, but given our previous history something just feels so wrong about it to me. I know I shouldn’t care since I had basically accepted she was going to marry that guy anyways, but now that feelings have come back something in me hurts. Is it childish to not want to be with this woman because she’s been pregnant with someone else’s baby, given our previous history? I feel like this is my real hang up. 

I promised her I wouldn’t tell anyone in real life and I’m keeping my word, but that certainly makes it difficult to work out my feelings. So now I have to ask for advice from internet strangers on how to help cope with this. I’m 26 and like I said I know I’m a probably an asshole but I want to figure this out. I don’t want this to be a dealbreaker but I feel like this is the one thing I don’t know if I can accept.",04Aug2020,1

She’s renting an apartment off of her campus and we’re planning on me making my way over and staying for a while at her place. However, her apartment’s lease says guests cannot stay for more than 2 days in a row (or 4 in a month), without written approval from the landlord, with a $1000 fine for breaking the rule.

Do you think the landlord would be sympathetic to letting me stay with her for 17 days? And what if the landlord says no?

We think we can get away with me overstaying my welcome (we won’t be going out much at all because of the pandemic anyways) but I am still a bit worried we’ll be caught in the 17 days we have planned out if I’m breaking rules by staying on the property, particularly a bit paranoid about whether asking for permission and being told “no” would make the stay harder to keep on the DL than if we didn’t ask at all.

243,"So, I work front desk at a hotel.
But I do many other things since we are a boutique hotel. Reconciliations, payouts, cleaning kitchen/mopping floors, organizing food in the back/ setting up breakfast boxes for guest (usually abt 20 on busy days ), I also run towels and extras to guests, try and fix their tv if it isn’t working and so on- that’s besides the point.
I just had been caught up to date with yesterday’s reservations this afternoon on my shift.

We had a guest a guest the other night who got locked out of her room.
For that we have a procedure- since we are a privately owned hotel we have an emergency hotline (the hotel owners phone number) where she would answer the call/text- and then let the guest into their rooms or make extra keys for them.

The lady called and texted at about 4AM and said she did not receive anything back- (the owner herself said she was in a very deep sleep)

So she could not get into her room, she slept until 7:45 AM in our garden on some chairs, she even went to the basement and got herself a comforter because she was cold- and at 7:45 AM that is when another employee came in to start the day. ( not to mention she is 60) 

And she is upset- understandably so.
But at the same time, we do give two extra keys to ensure that there is always an extra key- but I get that accident happen and that it would be nice to be at a hotel with someone at the front desk 24/7. I get both sides.

Anyways, now the owner was to print up a sign that says after our closing time, you are liable for your own stay. So basically if they get locked out of their room they are shit out of luck and can’t really do anything about it.

Then, everything changed and she started to emotionnaly blackmailed him, saying that he was the only thing stopping her from killing herself, having him shave his bird because she didn't like it and then refusing to see him cause without a beard he wasn't the same, making him break almost all his friendships etc..  
So now comes the present, he's questionning his relationship, and he's trying to leave her softly, still being ""in love"".

250,"In need of some advice..

Hello, so about a year ago I ended a friendship with someone who has a very extreme case of BPD. The friendship ended not because of this, but because she was very manipulative and it was very one sided. Now, I really didn’t mind that the care in the relationship was a bit more on one side. It was okay for me and I knew full well it would be that way. But..the whole relationship was her. I was like an extra therapist but I was the therapist that she told the really dark stuff to, that she refused to tell her actual therapist. Like how she wanted to hurt her family or how she had day dreamed of hurting her young nephew. To be honest it was unsettling. After a few incidents (id rather not discuss) I ended the friendship. She didn’t talk to me for awhile but then was having her sibling and family message me saying she was angry and that she was demanding I called her. I said if she wanted to talk she could call me. She didn’t. After some more incidents I ended up blocking her on everything. Phone, FB, Twitter, anything I could find her on. She’s made second accounts, begged mutuals to contact me, and even leaving notes at my home. To say the least I was terrified. To be honest I’m much happier without her in my life. There’s so many friendships I let go to just focus on her and her health. To where my own mental health took a very bad dive. I nearly ended up in the hospital after a panic attack. Thankfully I’m dealing with that and am seeing a therapist regularly to help me. But I’m the happiest I’ve been in 4 years. 


But to get to the point.. 

Today she made an appointment at my mothers office. My mother is a PT and works/ lives over an hour away from where I am. There’s 8+ other places she could go to in my city alone. So..it’s really looking like she’s going to my family now. I’m scared for them. My family is worried. I don’t know what to do. After talking with my family and SO, we’ve all come to the idea that maybe I need to just confront her. Not be mean, not yell, just calmly explain that enough is enough. But after all the things she’s done this past year and the memories of the things she told me not just about her family but of ex friends. I’m pretty scared. 

Please please. If you have ANY advice I need it. I don’t want to hurt her or upset her. That’s the last thing I wanna do. I do still care about her but my own health was at an all time low and I needed to step away and fix it. I just want my family, SO and myself to feel safe.

253,"I am trapped seriously, even way before this pandemic growing up I don't think me and my brother could say we ever have hung out with a friend outside of school before or slept over at someone else's house. Granted we never got the balls to ask and didn't have many friends really but she was the reason why. Extremely emotionally manipulative and overprotective. Despite living in a bad neighborhood and being easily influenced we've never been bad kids we've never sold drugs, got into trouble at school, any fights, or be around the wrong people, typical things young black males like ourselves get caught up in all the time but yet we still have lived this super sheltered ass life and I am sick of it. Because of this I suffer from depression and social anxiety. 

I just graduated and turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, I'm grown and ready to do things on my own. I told my mom I wanted to hang out with my girlfriend for a bit and she gave me an ultimatum if I left I wasn't allowed to come back. Saying that this virus is going around (we live in Florida btw) and because she has diabetes she is high risk and I could catch it and kill her. But that isn't fair we've been trapped inside for the entire lock down for months now besides leaving for work and its taken a toll on our mental health. Plus other friends of mine have went to parties, the beach and came back fine. I want to go see one person and she wont let me do that.

I'm honestly about ready to move out and go stay with my girlfriend who I've met about 6 months ago I trust her with my feelings more than my own mom and can tell her anything and the few times we have met in person have gone great we both want to be with each other and she just got her new place. I have a job the only issue is that I don't have a car yet or my license and my girlfriend won't always be the one to take me. I have nearly $3000 saved up and have seen some used cars under $2,000 I could save up a bit more to get one but then I'd have to buy gas and pay insurance, I also have to pay for textbooks for college soon I have financial aid but it might not cover it all.

What should I do if I leave I risk losing my support system and put myself in danger, but I'd say its worth the risk for freedom. If I stay Im putting a strange on the relationship with my girlfriend and putting my mental health at risk even more and could contemplate suicide. If I stay with my girlfriend whom's a manager at Wendy's I could possibly try and get hired and we can work together but thats not a guarantee with all the people unemployed and Im honestly not the most efficient and fastest worker.

I also was thinking about going to hang out with her in a couple of days and seeing if I would be able to comeback if I cant stay with her I should at least be able to see her its one person and we have both limited our exposure. 

 So do I ride this out for a few more months and hope this pandemic ends soon and jeopardize my relationship and mental health or risk losing my support and mom who despite all she's put us through emotionally I love dearly and would die for.",04Aug2020,1
254," for context i am (16F) and he is (16 almost 17M)

last night we got into an argument about covid and he knows that my sister is only 1 month old and has no immune system. he was basically telling me that he thinks covid is ''just the flu'' and my family is overreacting and he said that i don't know biology so i don't understand how corona is safe for her... for a 1 month baby

and i didn't talk to him today because i was upset by what he did. then i finally called him so we could talk about it and he said he looked it up after we got off call and that i was right BUT it was my fault for him getting mad and yelling at be because ''i didn't tell him that babies don't have immune systems''

number 1- I DID because i remember his exact response was ''well there's only one way to get her one'' suggesting that i take my 1 month old sister out in a pandemic... number 2 when i told him that i did tell him that he said ''you were too tired to remember''

and then he brings up when i was having sleep problems a few weeks back which i still am and he says '' was the suggestion that **I** told you the one that worked'' and i said that giving my guinea pigs extra water before bed helped a little bit. and he was like '' Yeah that's what **I** told you'' extra exaggeration on him saying ''I'' every time. even though i don't even remember him every suggesting that.

and he starts going off about how i do nothing and ''why are you always sad'' IDK MAYBE BECAUSE I HAVE DEPRESSION

and i was really upset by how mean he was being to me so i start crying and he just says ''cry your heart out i don't care''

i don't know what i did to deserve being treated like this. this isn't the first time he's been mean either. he makes jokes about my history with self harm. he calls me lazy all the time and says ''all you do is sit on your butt all day'' he makes fun of me for being behind in school. when i told him that before i met him a was groomed by a guy 4 years older than me for my child porn.. he called me ''s l u t'' for the rest of the day and said that's my nickname from now on. he pressures me to do sexual favors for him and to show him my naked body. and when i do he criticises it. saying that i need to do exercises to look better. i'm not fat i'm very average in weight. and it's still not good enough for him. i don't know what i do to deserve this.

i can't just break up with him though because

1. all of my friends are also his friends and they like him more then me so they would all take his side like some kind of messed up divorce
2. we go to a very very small church together and he would probably tell everyone my personal stuff.
3. he's the only person that even contacts me. he's the only human interaction besides my parents and my sisters that i get.
4. i'm genuinely concerned that he would do something.

There’s a couple people from school who I’ll see in the hallways or who I’ll have classes who I’d really like to get to know. The things is, I have social anxiety and struggle to approach people in real life. Through texting wouldn’t be as hard. There’s one person in particular who comes to mind. Recently, I’ve noticed that I’ve been thinking about him more than I do, well, anyone else from school except for my friends.  

I haven’t said a word to him. He probably doesn’t even know I exist. The closest I’ve ever gotten to him is sitting at the same table at lunch on the first day of school. I didn’t pay too much attention to him then, but now (or at least when I was still in school... thanks coronavirus) he catches my eye in the hallways. I know he’s friends or at least was friends with a close friend of mines sister. I’ve never had a class with him. I think he’s a year above me (I’m going to be a sophomore— he’ll be a junior). I’d like to talk to him but I don’t know how. I was thinking about asking this close friend but it may sound weird. 

I have the feeling that I really, really want to be friends with him or get to know him, but I don’t know if it’s more than that. I’ve never had a crush before and I don’t know if I’m starting to crush or not. I’ve actually worried about it (never having a crush) a lot during these past couple months (thanks quarantine mental health). I think I’m demisexual (must get to know someone and develop a connection with them before feeling romantic/sexual attraction towards them), but it’s probably too early to tell. Anyways, my heart doesn’t flutter or anything, but I feel a comfort wash over me and I start to daydream a bit. It’s hard to see myself dating anyone right now, but I can see myself with him more than I can everyone else. 

I mean, I’ve thought about a future partner and he seems to have a lot of the same qualities. We have (some of) the same views (I know he’s a part of the LGBTQ+ and straight alliance club (which, once again, is rare around here)— no he’s not gay), he’s intelligent, he’s a sweetheart, he’s funny, we have similar music taste, he seems to respect women as human beings and not objects (which is rare for my school), and more. He’s pretty cute too. Honestly he’s shares a lot of the same qualities physically with my future “dream partners”, too. The thing is, one of his most attractive qualities will be my downfall. He adores and respects his girlfriend so, so much. He talks about her all the time (I could tell when we sat at lunch together) and in a very respectful way. Normally I’m annoyed by this but it was so genuine that I couldn’t even get mad. I mean, his girlfriend is pretty cool too. I’d like to get to know her too as we seem pretty similar but, if I’d have to get to know one, I’d like to know him.

I think I’d be okay with just staying friends because he just seems like a fun guy to be around and someone I’d like in my life. Anyways, sorry, I know you didn’t ask for my life story, but maybe someone’s dealing with something similar...?",04Aug2020,1
257,"This happened about a month ago which makes this whole situation even more bothersome for me because I’ve regretted since the day I did it and I didn’t even think I was the type of person to do this. Basically I was a little drunk, we’re both 18 year old guys, and i’ve always been confused with my sexuality. My best friend was sleeping next to me, and I kept rubbing his chest and back and nipple and holding his hand and leaning in to get closer to him for like 30 minutes. At the time I remember being completely entranced by him in a sexual way and I wanted to see if I could get him to reciprocate, but after that night this seemed like an awful idea. I really don’t know if what I was doing was noticed by him because the next morning he just said that I need to not move around so much in my sleep. After that day he always tells me to sleep on the coach when I’m over and I just really don’t know if he was awake for what I was doing or not. I feel like an awful person and I don’t think I should apologize because I don’t think it’s worth running the risk of ruining the friendship if he didn’t notice, and also this may be selfish to say but I don’t want to be known as a groper in my friend group.",04Aug2020,1
258,"I've decided to move interstate in January,

for context: my father was always verbally abusive and he knew how to stay right on the line of not becoming physical.

My Mum is pretty much a narcissist. A couple of months ago I was robbed, and I used it as an excuse to ask them if I could move interstate with my aunty. My mum basically screamed at me about how stupid of an idea that was and how ""family"" should always stick together.

So I lied, I told them that I applied to the University of Queensland and I intend to move up there, I'm 18 so there's nothing they can say. (this was all a lie, I'm still doing one year of HS, and applications aren't even open), I just want to leave.

For context, I will add things that have happened within my household

MY mum forcefully declined permission for me to get antidepressants despite me being on the verge of suicide (am doing really great now and haven't thought about anything similar since), and any medication that has been prescribed, when I had an operation on my leg I was declined the use of pain relief(?) medication and I had to lay in bed for almost 3 weeks with the most horrible pain I've ever felt in my life.

I called the cops on my dad almost 10 times when I was coming into my early teens, each time they spoke to me privately and told me to just hide and stay in my room, there was nothing they could do because my mum ""had to file a restraining order"" and my dad wasn't physical. The last time I called, which made me completely doubt our legal system, they came to me in my locked bedroom and told me to my face that I was ""being a spoilt brat"" before telling me not to waste their time again.  


My mum will constantly tell me not to talk to her, she will be sitting in silence watching TV and I will have something that I am proud of, like my school report card,  she will tell just tell me to leave. I have never been able to speak to either of my parents about anything.

I can't have any sort of adult conversation with these people, it got so bad that I forcefully tried to explain to my parents that I am 18 now and that I need to start seeing some sort of respect. Which only seemed to make them more dismissive of my true feelings.  


My room is falling apart, paint is peeling off, my cupboards will barely open and I've got holes where my doorframe is from how hard my dad pushed the handle into the wall during a screaming fit. for reference, my dad is a construction manager and could easily fix all of these things. Instead, he just ignores them, I have already had to repaint my room once when I was 12, and my father came in, saw how bad of a job I did and just laughed and walked away.

  
What's even worse is that my brother will constantly throw low-level insults at me for absolutely no reason. I've spoken to my mum about it or at least tried to, and her answer is always the same ""he's inherited the same genes as your dad so just leave him alone."" The few times I try to defend myself are met with ""leave him alone stop picking"" despite me just trying to take tension away from the situation. My brother now realizes that he can get away with literally anything and will just stick to doing what he has been doing for the longest time.

Also, my family bought a dog when I was 10 years old, and have never allowed it to come outside, they also occasionally will completely forget about him for days on end, I am literally the only person who goes outside to take care of him and play with him, and I still end up getting yelled at for bringing back fur into the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized how fucked up this all was when my mum's father came back into her life (he was kicked out at her birth by my grandma, from what I know), he speaks to me like an adult, and I can have a conversation with him without fearing that I might say the wrong thing. I also had a few clues when I slept over at my friend's house, it was like they were more my parents than my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had anyone to rant to, no friends, no adults I could trust that would take my word over my parents. So I've had to deal with this all alone. There are always times where I think to myself ""maybe I'm just overreacting, maybe my parents aren't that bad."" I finally snapped when yesterday I read a similar story about this guy in his mid-20's talking about how it affected him mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: am I doing the right thing? should I be leaving? what do I do, I just want to get away from these people.",04Aug2020,1
259,"So a few days ago, I (F21) was visiting my family in my hometown. I had took work off that weekend for the trip and my bosses knew this. My mom (a nurse) developed a sore throat and she has had a chronic cough long before COVID was a thing so she couldn’t tell if anything cough-wise was different. So, she got tested, but she began to feel slightly better after. I informed both bosses and said that though I felt fine for the most part and didn’t notice blaring signs (though I’ve had a light cough) and my mom wasn’t ill, I didn’t want to risk spreading the virus to anyone, even if it’s only a slight chance. They asked me to still work anyways. Context: I work as a retail store employee (includes cashier work, stock, helping customers in general) so I’m in constant contact with people. They said they’d just check my temperature and I’d have to wear a mask at all times, then I’d mostly work doing side jobs and not cashiering. I was like, fine, I need money (they wouldn’t pay my sick leave). But then I called back and said I didn’t feel comfortable doing so. Apparently, my boss had approached my roommate (I learned this from my roommate), who I work with, and asked if she could work for me the one day I was for sure going to miss while waiting for my mom’s results. My boss mentioned to her that my mom was getting tested, and my roommate didn’t know because I hadn’t been home to tell her yet. My boss then asked her, “so you think your roommate can work still then?” And after this is when she called me to say I wasn’t getting sick pay and that I can still come in, because in the hour between calls, she couldn’t find anyone to work for me. It feels like she didn’t believe me, and I have called in maybe 10 times within the last two years of working there, never without good reason. I’m a solid worker, never late. I feel like this was breaking my confidentiality and disrespectful to me. I’m just trying to get through college working at this job, and its already an unsafe work environment (many thieves and aggressive people), and it feels like the straw that broke the camels back. I could approach my other boss about this, but I feel like he wouldn’t actually do anything. I just don’t know what to do.",04Aug2020,1
260,"Hello. Figuring this out has been the bane of my existence for the past week. I am a college student who is trying to figure out if it’s worth it to go back to campus for the fall semester. If I don’t go back, I’ll be stuck at home until February and won’t get any social interaction with people my age. However, if I go back to campus it won’t be the same because of all the mitigations being put in place because of COVID. Also, it might be difficult finding a place to exercise at first. On the other hand, I have a potential relationship waiting for me if I go back to campus. Also, it will be easier for me to find internships if I go back to campus. BUT, if I stay home things will be easier since my parents can cook for me, I’ll have my own room, and won’t have to pay for housing. 

I don’t know what to do. I really want to go back to campus, but I guess I’m kinda scared to leave my nest after being home for so long. Also, my parents have me freaked out about the chances of getting COVID (although the city that my school is in has a low number of cases).",04Aug2020,1
261,"Hello, 

I have no idea what my sexuality is and have no idea how to class myself, and if classing myself is even necessary. 

I consider myself straight. I am interested dominantly of the opposite sex, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't also enjoy playing around with the same sex.

What I have done with the opposite sex: Hold hands, kiss, hug, cuddle, sex.

What I have done with the same sex: Hold hands, kiss, hug, cuddle.

How I felt with the opposite sex: It felt right, like some weird primal thing. Definitely an emotional connection.

How I felt with the same sex: It was extremely fun and exciting, but no emotional connection.

Crushes? Mostly the opposite sex, but very rarely the same sex. The crushes with the opposite sex was much stronger and much better for me than that of the same sex. The same sex was less strong but was there.

I know some people are going to say: You should try dating more to figure out who you like. The thing is: I'm truly too busy to date. I'm going to go to Medschool in a few years and have to study/focus my energy on that. 

My friends think I'm bisexual, but I honestly don't know. If I am, that's great. If I'm not, it really doesn't bother me. What does bother me is not knowing.

All personal stories welcome, I may be able to relate. Plus it's nice to hear other people's stories! :)

Thank you, SC",04Aug2020,1

263,"I (19M) struggle always to find something to do. I have zero motivation in my life. On the occasion I find something interesting I always get bored of it very quickly. As such I don't have any productive or even unproductive hobbies. I stuggle to even motivate myself to eat. It feels as if there isn't really a point but at the same time I hate myself for it. It is ruining relationships in my life. I am easily the most boring person I have ever met. It isnt just emotionally or interpersonally affecting me either... I am 5'10"" and I weigh 115 pounds I look sick. People have told me that it is draining to be around me and that I am actually a burden. Even my girlfriend (though I suspect not for very much longer) has expressed concern due to my lack of willingness to better myself. The issue is that I really genuinely deep down in my heart want to be the best version of myself I don't think I can make the changes to do it. I don't want to burden others anymore by having to deal with me but at the same time I don't want to lose those that I love.

264,"Im going to try not to overshare but also want to give as much context as possible 

Im 21, she's 20. This morning she came up behind me and smacked me as hard as she could on the back of my head, and she started hitting me and managed to scratch me and make me bleed (not a lot, but it still hurts) 

I live with my mom, step dad, and her. She hates all of us, and has been known to be physical in the past, but not this extreme until now. She would hit me and Id have bruises because of her when we were kids, but her getting physical with me hasn't been an issue for a few years

Honestly I should have called the cops when she started attacking me, but it caught me off guard and didn't really know how to process it

The plan tomorrow is she needs to call a counseling number, explain to them what happened (that she attacked me) and her other issues, and I said I would wait until the day after tomorrow if she doesn't call them

But I honestly fear for my families and my own safety. She openly admits that she hates all of us. Me most of all, as she sees me as our abusive bio father 

I don't think the attack was premeditated, but even if it wasn't I think she could and would hurt me or my parents again

If I call them and file a report, it may lead to a restraining order and her living with our abusive bio father. 

My mom doesn't want me to call the cops. She wants that as a last result. But the more time passes the more I fear my sister may be planning to hurt (mostly) me again, or hurt my mom. 

I was lucky she didn't use any objects (blunt or sharp) but I honestly don't think she's mentally stable right now and we may be in possible danger

I don't know what to do. I honestly want to call the police, and am trying to be patient and calm and wait for her to get help. But Im afraid for my mom and me

Any advice to ease my anxiety right now would be great

I don't want to hurt my mom. And with COVID its scary, but I think my sister needs to be committed. For both herself and our safety. But my mom really doesnt want me to call the cops",04Aug2020,1
265,"My parents moved 1000 miles away from me over a year ago. It's been an adjustment, but the distance has honestly been a blessing. I love my mom more than anything, but she is very hard to deal with sometimes and I have sadly made it my life goal to always try to make her happy by doing the right thing and being the perfect daughter. She will always find something to complain about though and although you think I would have learned my lesson by now, I haven't. 

I djgress. Anyways. My dad asked me if I would come visit the weekend before my birthday because my mom officially has an empty nest and she's been really sad about it so I agreed. Telling her this, my mom got extremely upset and spit back ""I gave you life and I don't even get to see you on your birthday?"" My birthday is on the 24th and I said I would visit the 16-22. I spent my birthday at home with my boyfriend last year and this wasn't an issue. For some reason this year it is. I ended up changing the dates to be there the 23-30 and as soon as I did it I got so upset with myself because I let her influence a decision regarding my happiness and my own well-being yet again. This has got to be the last time I do it. I never make decisions for myself because I'm so scared of hurting other people's feelings or upsetting other people and I am very aware of this, but I don't know how to stop. Especially when it comes to my mother. I don't want to cut her off, but I also know that I can't keep living my life scared of upsetting her. How can I change? How can I start feeling like an adult and taking control of my own happiness for once? Also as a side note, this will be the fifth or sixth time I have visited my mom since they moved. She has yet to even offer to visit me and nobody from my family came down to see my big deal senior piece when I graduated college last December. I just feel like it's very much a one-sided relationship.

267,"Yeah edgy title. Great. I know how that looks, but it's how I feel. I'm a 19 male. Most of my life I've dealt with family members being alcoholics, drug addicts, having anger issues. I told myself that that would never be me but here we are.

I've been addicted to fentanyl and vicodin for the past 3 years. I started to abuse them after I had to move in with my grandparents in a country town, leaving everyone I had ever known. I couldn't cope mentally and couldn't make friends (I suffer from medically diagnosed depression and anxiety). I use these drugs to escape life, to not feel anything, and to escape the things I've gone through, notably the mental and physical abuse I received from my brothers dad beginning when I was 8. 

I didn't finish school. I dropped out senior year. I had started spiraling into a even deeper depression that I've been in ever since. I've had numerous suicidal thoughts and actions since moving. Everyone thinks I'm fine, that I'm happy, because that's what I want them to think. They think I'm over my drug addiction. They don't know the truth because I don't want them to. I don't want to burden them. I want to disappear and have no one worry about me. I'm a complete and utter failure. I've hurt so many people with my actions. I'm lazy. I have no future.

269,"Hi all, throwaway bc my friends know my main. I'm heavily involved in a video game fandom on Tumblr and have made a group of friends because of that. I've only been part of the group for a few months now, but I've been a part of many fandoms before and know how dramatic things can get. We have a discord for us with about 25\~ people, and lately we have a new person who I'm not sure if I should trust.

This person always has a crazy story to tell. They constantly chime into conversations with stories about their past like (for example) they were part of the navy, had an ex they shot in the leg in self-defense (said in a joking manner), that they were once going to go to the olympics until they broke their leg, that they have a brother who's a bomb specialist so they know this and that, that they worked for NASA for a bit, etc etc. They also always are telling stories about crazy things happening to them in their day to day, like how a person streaked across a restaurant patio and they kicked them in the d\*ck. Basically, it's a lot of crazy stories like that.

My thoughts on this are that I don't trust this person and I feel uncomfortable around them even though they haven't explicitly done anything to deserve that. For all I know, they could be telling the truth, it's just that I've seen people like this in fandoms I've been a part of in the past. I think most of the other people in our discord are a bit on the younger side and might be too trusting of this person. How should I handle this? I don't want to stir the pot if this person hasn't even done anything wrong, but I want to make sure our group is wary of people like this and the manipulation they can cause. What should I do?

270,"I’m a 20 year old female currently living at home with my parents.

Once he left for college, I shortly stoped talking to him because he sent me a pic and had a hickey on his neck (THE FIRST NIGHT). He tried to Snapchat me a few times at the beginning of his semester but I never answered. I was pretty hurt. Then I saw him at the end of that year unexpectedly at a party. We then started getting in contact with eachother, but only over the phone. We kept in contact when I went to college and even this summer. We finally got together this summer and I don’t know if it was the right choice. He was being so sweet, he made me feel like he liked me. All these old feelings have been resurfaced. I feel like I only got over him in the first place because I forgot what he was like. When I saw him i instantly wanted to see him again and again. This probably sounds insane because we never discussed felings but I have never been so fond over someone, it’s honestly so scary. The thought of him going to school and not being able to see him makes me so upset. The same way I felt years ago. It makes me hope covid sends him home so this could last longer. I don’t really know what to do. Do I stop talking to him because he could obviously really hurt me or should I confess my feelings? I just don’t want to confess my feelings, I fear he won’t even know what to say. And I don’t know what confessing feelings would even do because long distance in college is just not it.

Today I had a surprise meeting with HR reps to talk about apparent ""violations"" I had made, and they are as follow:
""A. Needs to improve communication towards patients.
B. Calling in sick less than 2 hours before shift.""

Here is some of my defense:
A. I've been treating up to 18 patients a day for almost 5 years now and have had minimal complaints or issues, and definitely NO write-ups EVER from this job or any other job. Btw, I've had 3 bosses before this one. All of which I had decent-good terms with.

Besides preparing to get fired and trying to stretch my savings out, I'm trying to figure out what I should do right now about this boss.

277,"My parents live in a really small town with about 2,000 people in it. Everyone knows everyone and there's not a whole lot of new people who move to the town. About 3 years ago, a middle aged couple bought the house across the street from my parent's house. My parents did everything they could to try and make these people feel welcome. One night, they both spent hours outside in a storm, saving a litter of kittens from drowning in the storm drain. 

My mom has also been doing TNR with her own money (she does it privately and doesn't advertise it). In the past 4 years since starting TNR, she has spayed and neutered hundreds of cats, as well as socializing feral kittens and finding them homes. The feral cat population started in the 1980s when a neighbor down the street would feed them without TNR. This was while my mom wasn't even living in this town. 

For the past year, my parent's neighbor has done the following: 

1. Made a Facebook page in the name of the town to post statuses about how my mom is the reason why kittens are being murdered by racoons. 
2. Went to the city to get a new ordinance put in place regarding cat ownership
3. Is now doing regular drive-bys past their house and taking pictures/videos of the cats that use the storm drain next to their house 

At one point she had posted graphic pictures of dead kittens on her Facebook page and accused my mom of doing it. However, I was also raised partially on a farm, and I've seen kittens killed by raccoons (and canines) before. I'm also familiar with racoon behavior. On one of the bodies, there was a visible paw print similar to a canine (smashed). The bodies did not look like something a racoon would do. However, it did look very similar to a dog mauling. I had confronted her on this, with links to articles and pictures to back up my argument.

280,"I have a friend who’s really been struggling with depression right now, I want to help her, but I can’t do much besides simply being her friend, I make it very clear she can talk about her problems if she wants to, and I try not to pressure her into talking if she doesn’t want to, but she doesn’t really open up about it, and she’s starting to push people away. I really want to be there for her, but she’s not even letting me do that despite the fact it’s obviously taking a toll on her to bottle things up all the time. I’m just completely clueless and I just want a few different perspectives on the matter, maybe a approach I haven’t thought of before.",04Aug2020,1
282,"So my high school boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over eight months and everything has been going really well, however, there are a few things that bug me on occasion. One being this girl he’s friends with... close friends with and has been close with her for 4 years, a lot longer than I’ve known him. The two of them text several times every week and they’ve had the same exact schedule in school for the past four years so to say the least they’ve spent a lot of time together. Their closeness has always kinda of bugged me, one time she passed me on his snap best friends list and she continuously makes tik toks about him and her “3 other close friends.” Although this bond and claim that I feel she has over him has always made me feel jealous and insecure I haven’t really mentioned it until this past week. He is also a senior while I’m only a junior so I’ve told him before about how I’m scared to be apart during college and that I don’t wanna home him back during this time. He is one of the sweetest boys out there and always tells me that I could never hold him back because all he wants is the future together that we dream about, moving in together.. getting married.. getting dogs.. having a family etc. Recently whether it be just for how things happen on TV to friends telling my we won’t last forever the reality that we might not have this future that we both want might now happen and I think that really crushed me. In addition, last night at a grad party on their way out his parents stopped to talk at the table that his friend and I were sitting at (we’ve gotten to know each other somewhat since he and I started dating) and they barely acknowledged my presence. They stood there and talked to her about how much the hope he had the same schedule as her again because he said he wouldn’t eat throughout the school day if it wasn’t for her. They then started saying that they would love if the two of them went to the same college that they’re both interested in so that she could take care of him for another four years. They then quickly asked my if they’re be seeing me at the house this week and I said I really hope so. They only turned back to say bye to her and tell her to say bye to her and to tell her parents they said hi. I was ready to leave the party right after that. At home I tried talking to him about it and he reassured me several times that he does and will only love me but it just couldn’t cure my jealousy at the time and I left and went to a friends house before getting on better terms. We barely talked while I wasn’t home but I wanted to end the day on a better note so I called him once I was back. I said some really hard things that I regret telling him that I was starting to realize we might not have that future together, asking if we were gonna keep this exclusive during college because I didn’t want to hold him back and explaining just how upset their closeness makes me. I watched it break him. He barely spoke and looked the saddest I’ve ever seen him. I told him I don’t know if I can do it if they go to college together and I have to compete with her for him for another 4 years. I told him life would be so much easier if they didn’t talk this much, because I have guy friends but we don’t need to talk all week. He said he’d stop talking to her as much even though it would upset him because losing a friend to any degree is upsetting but that losing me would be far worse. I told him not to do this as I don’t want to be the controlling and toxic girlfriend who acts this way. But honestly I would love if they didn’t talk as much but I would feel very guilty if that happened. I ended up blaming the whole thing on a mood swing and didn’t bring it up for the rest of the night and did end the night on better terms even though I was still crushed. Last night I felt the worse I’ve felt in a long time. I woke up this morning and send a message apologizing again and saying I was out of line, but I still feel the exact same way about her. I don’t know what to do, all I do know is that I love this boy so much and never want to lose him. Do I just have to pretend now that their relationship doesn’t bother me? Do I bring it up again? How can I fix this?",04Aug2020,1

286,"After not seeing each other for a few weeks, my best friend and I were planning a perfect night: after work, I’d pick him up and we’d get some snacks, go to my my house, watch a movie, smoke a little, and get in the pool. After we ate and watched a movie, we waited for my parents to fall asleep and smoke in my backyard and get in the pool. Once we were zooted, we started talking about random shit, being generally philosophical, etc. I don’t remember how it came up, I think we were just talking about girls, and all of the sudden he told me that he had made out with my ex-girlfriend a little after the two of us broke up. I couldn’t fully comprehend it because I was high as a kite, but once I came down I started to realize how much that SUCKED. I’ve never really understood why people get mad at their friends for hooking up with their exes, mostly because they’re not dating anymore, but I understand now that it has happened to me. In the morning we hung out for a little while longer until I inevitably brought it up. He apologized profusely and promised it didn’t mean anything and he would never do it again, and that was pretty much that. We hopped in my car and started driving to his house. On the way there however, I kind of started to break down. I don’t really know why, maybe it was because “our song” was playing or because deep down I was really upset, but the tears just kinda started flowing. Once we got to his house, we parked the car and talked for a good thirty minutes. He said he totally understood if I wanted to punch him or stop being friends with him, but I didn’t want either. I’m not a very confrontational guy, and I don’t like conflict, so I just said I wanted to talk. It might sound like he was being fake or insincere, but in the several years we have been friends, I have never seen him cry before today. He genuinely can’t understand why I still want to be friends with him, but in my eyes he’s essentially my brother. I love him like family and I feel wrong about just dropping him. I’m upset and angry and sad and disappointed because I just don’t understand why would he would do this kind of thing. He says he felt horrible before, during, and after it, but it still took him a whole two months before telling me. We hugged it out several times, which I’m glad about, because I think we both needed it. One thing he said, which he says a lot, which I hate, is that he doesn’t deserve me. I couldn’t really tell if he was trying to get me to sympathize with him so he could be the victim, but I think it might have genuinely been how he was feeling. In my eyes, this is one mistake, just a blip on the spectrum of our relationship. He’s never done anything like this before, at least not to my knowledge, so I think it’s forgivable, to a degree. Before he left my car, he said he wouldn’t bother me, but instead let me approach him when I’m ready. I think I need some space from him for a while, because as much as I hate to admit it, this shit hurt. I kinda just need some advice on how to approach the situation and what I should do with him.",04Aug2020,1
288,"My family is full of high achievers, most of these high achievers are abusive and narcissistic, including my biological parents who abused me my whole life, obligated me to get perfect scores to fulfill their classist high achiever standards which made me deeply unhappy and then discarded me when I turned 18 and stopped caring about grades, abandoning me in the slums of a third world country at the same time they moved to Europe.

The other half of my family is poor, insanely poor, they work 80 hours a week for very little money so they can feed their children, and they live in houses made of adobe, but they're gentler, more compassionate, hard working, honest and... they're the kind of people I aspire to be. They inspire me.

But sometimes my high achiever parents calls me and tell me horrible things, they make fun of me for being poor and working all day, they critizice me and call me ""mediocre"" for not finishing a 2 years career I wasn't interested in and for not going to university... 

And it makes me feel horrible and humilliated. The worst part is that they often offer me ""help"" that they know I won't accept because it'll put me in situations where I'll be sexually or physically abused again, and then they blame me for ""being a mediocre son and rejecting opportunities"".

And then they make fun of me for not living in Europe and having careers like them.

I'm slowly cutting contact with them because it also means cutting contact with other relatives that are genuinelly good people besides being kinda classist and condescending sometimes.

I just need some advice on how not to let my parents' comments get under my skin or hurt me too much while I slowly cut contact with all of them.

289,"Back story, I(f22) live in my parents(49 &amp; 50) basement with my boyfriend(m26). 

I’ve been smoking weed 3 x a week since my bf started on night shift because I can’t sleep when he’s not here. So I stand on my bed with my fan and smoke out the bedroom window. No issue just smells smokey for 5 mins until I air freshener it. 

I decided tonight I wanted to smoke out the back so there would be no smell, I go out the back door and turn the light on and go into my garage and smoke inside of the door blowing the smoke up into the air, I peek out to the right side facing window and see if anyone is there and I see a person looking out so I grab my yoga mat and hide my pipe and lighter and my mum is like ‘what are you doing?’ So I said I’m just grabbing my yoga mat I want to stretch, she says ‘are you okay? Is your head getting cloudy?’ (I’ve been depressed suicidal and self harmed most of my teen years) so I just make conversation and go back indoors. I text her and tell her ‘I’m just grabbing the bike from the garage, don’t mind me!’ So I can workout in the living room in the morning but when I come back out she has her phone on the window sill recording with the flash on and she was kinda hiding to the side. I’m not sure if she caught me but why would she be recording me in the first place? To laugh at me bringing out a bike at 1am? 

Anyways, if she asks what it was then I’m willing to tell her I just don’t know the best way to explain it you know? Can I get some advice on that part?

Oh my dad also works for a cannabis company but neither of them smoke it. My mum did drugs when she was younger and self medicated, she knows that I use edibles to relax too but never wanted me to smoke cigarettes. She knows I tried smoking weed in the past once too.

291,"I’m pretty sure I’ll receive criticism for my actions but please, that’s not the point here.

I met this person from Reddit and made an arrangement with him that is GFE. (Girlfriend experience) where you pretend to be his online girlfriend. I did this to help myself out financially and I treated him with enough respect for him to be happy. To be honest, he was creepy to begin with. There were so many red flags that I should of recognize to end it right away but I brushed it off. Red flags includes of him buying 8 pairs of my used underwear and when I came back to text him, I see 10 + messages throughout the day that was sent to me that consisted of recorded videos of him talking to me, voice mails, pictures etc. I actually have a footage of the amounts of texts he would send to me but because his face is revealed, I held back from sharing. His persistency got me stressed out and I couldn’t tolerate it anymore. I ended things with him and told him to leave me alone. Because he wouldn’t take no as an answer, I blocked him everywhere in hopes of him to get over me. 

6 months later,  he still talks about me on his reddit page claiming that I’m his ex. I was never his ex. A creepy example of the things he would say on the internet about me: 

https://imgur.com/a/2UKeomO

Ever since I sold his gifts on depop, he finds out and is furious. He is threatening me and made multiple accounts to follow my friends on my social media. This is really not okay. No matter how much I block, he makes multiple accounts to follow me again. https://imgur.com/a/1CRS6kG

If blocking isn’t doing the job, what am I supposed to do? He won’t leave me alone and he won’t stop talking about me on his reddit history and I’m devastated.

294,"So I don't know how to address this situation at all.  My son is 22 and still lives at home.  Until he hit age 18 we had a great relationship and we talked all the time.  He moved out to go to college when he was 18 and then everything changed.

It was slow at first but somewhere along the way it just died out altogether.  He graduated from college and I helped him get an internship that has turned into a solid job.  He also has a very healthy relationship that has been going on for about a year.  He is doing very well for himself.

However, when he is home he stays in his room with the door shut.  Whenever we knock on the door to tell him dinner is ready, or to ask him to take out the trash (literally his only chore), he is very short and upset with us.  It's almost like he feels like those few moments when we do interact with him are unbearable.

I've just chalked it up to him growing up, if only to give myself a reason not to be upset.  The reason I am writing now is because tonight he ate dinner and didn't say anything the entire time.  I asked him if anything was wrong and he said that he was just tired.  But the problem with that is it's currently 12:30AM and I can hear him laughing and having a great time with his friends.

I long to hear that laugh again when the two of us talk.  It breaks my heart to hear him on the other side of that door having a great time but knowing that I haven't had that kind of connnection with him for years.

How can I handle this situation without pushing him further away.

Thanks.",04Aug2020,1

He was her only family here and now we’re all she’s got but we’re kids so obviously she’s a bit lonely. This is going to sound so dumb but a big source of her stress is my younger brother (13) and younger sister (12) who can’t stop arguing.

297,"I don't know if I am getting bullied, it kind of sounds stupid.
I'm working for a small company and I'm getting along with the people pretty well... Or so I thought.
There is one coworker 20 years oder than me, who seems to not like me.
She is always looking for things I might have done or said wrong. 

One time she yelled at me because she thought that I did something wrong. I didn't. She didn't even apologize.

Another time, she had to bring me documents by car (Boss told her to do so) and I felt bad that she had to drive into town just for me, so I bought chocolates (not cheap ones) I knew she likes because I saw her eating them once. She pulled up with her car, I already waited for her, she got out and her first sentence was ""Gosh, I really wouldn't want to live here, what a horrible place"". I live in a pretty normal place but said something like yeah, cities are not for everyone and smiled. Then I gave her the choclate and was told, that she didn't want to take it because ""Don't you See that I am already fat enough?""... She took them anyways, but I didn't know what to say.

She activley tries to avoid working with me, even though we never worked together. Like ""no sorry, with the other coworker, the car is full so you can't come with me"". But I have a car too... 

She made me feel insecure because I told her I don't like small talk and she asked me out about it until she found another thing she could jump on. I am an introvert and that was so scary, I was glad when my boss came in and interrupted the conversation. 

We had to travel to another City with 3 people, her, another coworker and me. We wanted to have dinner together but it seemed that she convinced the other coworker to just go without me, while I told them we could go after I bought water (at a store 5 minutes away) . They went to another store (while I was away) with the car and decided to grab some food after that. I was waiting for them like an hour and they told me that they had dinner already. 

These are just a few examples. She is mean to me all the time and I dont know why. No one at the company knows about this, because she does it only when no one else is around. 

She is a nice and friendly person to the rest of the people.
My BF told me that she may be racist because of her Facebook timeline and I am the only foreign looking person there. But I don't know and am scared to ask her out directly what her problem is, because we are just 5 people at the company and maybe it will destroy the working environment for the others. Plus, she is nice to them so I don't want them to think bad about her because she doesn't seem to have many friends.

299,"TW: suicide, abuse 


Pretty much what the post says. 

My (F25) cousin (M22) secretly got married about 9 months ago. I’m the only one in the family that knows. He’s cut off contact from everybody else in the family. A lot of that was her influence, obviously, but his relationship with his parents has always been a little complicated. 

Anyways, him and this girl have been together for 4 years. The abuse has been escalating and he’s been reaching out to me for advice and for a shoulder to cry on, I assume. At this point she’s 
-told him if she kills herself, it’s his fault
-told him that if he goes to work tomorrow she won’t make it through the day and her death will be on his hands
-doesn’t work or contribute any sort of funds but takes a ton of money out of their shared account to PayPal random people all the time. 
-tells him she’s going to destroy his stuff if he doesn’t do what she says
-tells him that, without her, he’s going to die alone. 

I’ve itemized all these things (and more) for him and he’s told me very clearly that he doesn’t want to be with her anymore. He’s scared of what she’ll do if he leaves and I’ve tried to tell him that it’s not his fault if she *actually* commits suicide. He’s terrified of being on his own and he even admits that she’s abusive. 

I am so unbelievably worried about him and I’m desperate to get through to him. I’ve offered to help him pay to break his lease and kick her out, I’ve offered my home to him, I’ve told him I would do anything to help. 

Is there something I can do or say that will get through to him? I am genuinely terrified that this girl is going to be the death of him. I’m worried if I tell his parents and they reach out, he’ll feel betrayed and not talk to me and then he would have nobody to talk to, as he’s a bit of a loner and she basically doesn’t allow him to have friends. 

Please, I need advice. I am so stressed out and I can’t imagine how stressed out he must be. I’m not that much older than him and I feel like I’m out of my depth but I want to help.",04Aug2020,1

301,"I am trapped seriously, even way before this pandemic growing up I don't think me and my brother could say we ever have hung out with a friend outside of school before or slept over at someone else's house. Granted we never got the balls to ask and didn't have many friends really but she was the reason why. Extremely emotionally manipulative and overprotective. Despite living in a bad neighborhood and being easily influenced we've never been bad kids we've never sold drugs, got into trouble at school, any fights, or be around the wrong people, typical things young black males like ourselves get caught up in all the time but yet we still have lived this super sheltered ass life and I am sick of it. Because of this I suffer from depression and social anxiety.

I just graduated and turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, I'm grown and ready to do things on my own. I told my mom I wanted to hang out with my girlfriend for a bit and she gave me an ultimatum if I left I wasn't allowed to come back. Saying that this virus is going around (we live in Florida btw) and because she has diabetes she is high risk and I could catch it and kill her. But that isn't fair we've been trapped inside for the entire lock down for months now besides leaving for work and its taken a toll on our mental health. Plus other friends of mine have went to parties, the beach and came back fine. I want to go see one person and she wont let me do that.

I'm honestly about ready to move out and go stay with my girlfriend who I've met about 6 months ago I trust her with my feelings more than my own mom and can tell her anything and the few times we have met in person have gone great we both want to be with each other and she just got her new place. I have a job the only issue is that I don't have a car yet or my license and my girlfriend won't always be the one to take me. I have nearly $3000 saved up and have seen some used cars under $2,000 I could save up a bit more to get one but then I'd have to buy gas and pay insurance, I also have to pay for textbooks for college soon I have financial aid but it might not cover it all.

What should I do if I leave I risk losing my support system and put myself in danger, but I'd say its worth the risk for freedom. If I stay Im putting a strange on the relationship with my girlfriend and putting my mental health at risk even more and could contemplate suicide. If I stay with my girlfriend whom's a manager at Wendy's I could possibly try and get hired and we can work together but thats not a guarantee with all the people unemployed and Im honestly not the most efficient and fastest worker.

I also was thinking about going to hang out with her in a couple of days and seeing if I would be able to comeback if I cant stay with her I should at least be able to see her its one person and we have both limited our exposure.

So do I ride this out for a few more months and hope this pandemic ends soon and jeopardize my relationship and mental health or risk losing my support and mom who despite all she's put us through emotionally I love dearly.",04Aug2020,1

304,"I’ll try to keep this short -- I run a small grass cutting business by myself. $40 a lawn or higher if larger. One day, I was cutting another neighbors yard. A guy comes up and ask for my number to hook up for helping him with landscaping. He calls weeks later and arranges me to cut his grass. 

A day after the call, I get there. Unpack everything out of my call I typically use. I met with him and got to work. Then, I noticed something odd. I keep seeing that multiple family members that lived in the house kept looking outside. And once I get the chance to look up, they look away. Odd, whatever. One-by-one, they came outside, greeted to me, and walked back inside. About 10-15 minutes in, his sister, who happens to be around my age, comes out. 

We chat, get to know each other in a very awkward way. She even knew that I was being quite awkward. To be honest, I’m not the best at talking to women. She tells me that the reason her brother got my number wasn’t only for business inquiries. She was interested in me. And I wasn’t really interested in her. But, I still gave her my number for some odd reason.

Afterwards, I kept cutting with the thought of how awkward it is that her &amp; her family knows that she likes me. And I feel quite uncomfortable being there. Then, I wrapped up. I wanted to tell him then and there on how uncomfortable I felt when he gave me the money. I didn’t. So, I went back home to clean myself up. She text “hey” and I didn’t respond because I didn’t know how to handle the situation of talking to someone I’m not into. 

Days later, she texted that I just gave out my number for fun. I haven’t heard from her ever since. This all took place last week. And I’m afraid that I might lose some business all because of this whole awkward situation. How do I handle this? Or, am I just being very melodramatic?",04Aug2020,1

Anybody looking in from the outside would see that I’m a great guy, I have a 4.0 my 3rd year at a very elite university, I’m average/maybe above average looking and I’m usually regarded as the most down to earth person by my friends. I can’t explain it, I have no reason to think I’m not good enough for her but I do. She’s absolutely gorgeous to me and I guess when I see myself I don’t compare. We haven’t had any problems in the relationship and I don’t know how to talk to her about this and I don’t even know if I want to bring it up. This comment hurt me so much that even though I want to try to act like everything’s fine I just get this idea that sometimes my girlfriend loves me In every way besides my looks. She has repeatedly told me she finds me attractive but i just can’t believe her (and for good reason bc of some instances in the past) And I’ve never felt this way with anyone I was previously dating. I wish I could explain why I’m feeling this way. I just need some advice on what to think or how I should fix what I feel. Thanks",04Aug2020,1
306,"*im new at Reddit, sorry for any mistakes!

I (17F) have been quarantined for over four months with my family, including my mom(51F) my dad (50M) and my little brothers (15 and 11 M). The whole story is a little complicated but I’ll try to simplify it best I can. It’s still a long post

Basically, I was blessed w the opportunity to go to boarding school a couple hours from my home as a 10th grader, so I did my 10th and 11th grade years there-COVID causing much junior year to end in distance learning of course. My 10th grade year we lived about three hours away, but in the summer after that we moved from SuBurbs in New York, where I’d lived my whole life, to a decently sized city in Ontario. This meant I went from seeing family at least three times a month to seeing them only on long holidays, and the need for me to fly back to school.

With COVID having closed the school last spring, everything has been redesigned to be as ‘safe as possible’-surely safer than many other places in the US. They have many different dorm
rooms, space for all, they are mandating frequent testing, hand sanitizing, and mask wearing with threat of disciplinary action if students violate the new rules. They plan to open in person come September, while proving students opportunities to quarantine on campus weeks prior.

Since I live in Canada and COVID has decimated the states, my parents want to enroll me in school here or have me do distance learning for at least half of next year. Not to be bratty, but I don’t see that as having a happy ending for me.

For starters, my family is pretty impossible to live with. My parents are both immature in very different ways and my brothers both have their own personal struggles. I found myself pressured by my parents to take on their problems as my responsibility far more often than I should. I really don’t feel heard in this household very often.

I have a ton of undiagnosed anxiety issues that I’m pretty sure run in my family, I have trouble trusting that people actually like me and that I belong in a group of people. While this was prevalent at school as well, it increased tenfold when all my relationships moved to be via text. I’d finally gotten comfortable in a group of people, but most of them had graduated. The few friendships I have left almost entirely consist of people in my grade or the grade below me at my boarding school. For example, when I set up a fun zoom-party thing for many friends and half of the people who said they would come didn’t, it prompted a downward spiral into a panic attack that came at the end of an otherwise pretty good day, 

Being away has been an up and down experience, and the downs have gotten worse and worse each time. I’ve already lost significantly weight because I can barely bring myself to eat. I’m worried I might turn towards things like self harm or stealing alcohol. I don’t want to do either but I’ve gotten close.

Worst of all, I hate confiding in people. The few solid friendships I have I’m worried would be tainted by me revealing just how badly my anxiety affects me. That’s happened before. Very few people know the extent of my problems and I’m afraid to tell my boyfriend (18M) just how bad it is because he is the type of person who thrives on positivity and can be overwhelmed by negativity and I already tell him too many bad things about what goes on with me, and I don’t want to risk losing him. I love him way too much for that.

I see going back to school as an opportunity to get back to a ‘happier place’, as I’d be surrounded with more familiar opportunities and people who support me. Even if the school closes a week into classes having been there at all could just totally relax me.

This isn’t just a rant, the things I need advice on are as follows: 

What do I tell my parents? It’s safer for me to stay home but I really think my mental health would improve quickly when surrounded by friends, but I can’t tell them why without getting into detail about how horrible I’m feeling and knowing their differing stances on mental health that would cause conflict.

Do I tell a friend or my boyfriend? Being a burden or the burdening feeling I get after telling people about the really heavy problems I have isn’t the same as a light rant, I find myself feeling worse afterwards than better, who do I confide in? I don’t think given my complicated status and issues I’ve had in the past that therapy of any sort is viable right now.

What do I do? Am I being crazy? Is it all in my head? Do I need medication? I understand people have far worse issues to deal with right now than I could ever imagine, and that makes me feel even worse for having such petty problems, but I’ve been having more and more panic attacks and I’m worried about my mental health’s declining.

TL;DR: I want to go back to private boarding school in the United States from Canada, but it’s risky. However, I only see my mental health rapidly declining if I stay here.",04Aug2020,1
307,"So I have a sore throat and am a bit more tired than usual, which makes me feel like I may be sick. I was at my aunt's house last week (forced to go by my parents) and she was coughing, but she played it off as not a big deal. I have a dentist appointment on Wednesday, but the dentist has a huge $100 cancellation fee. I'm worried that if I call to reschedule tomorrow morning that they'll refuse me service AND charge me the $100. What do you guys recommend as the best approach to avoid getting hit by the cancellation fee?

310,"I work at a supermarket as a front end part time check out person. Been here for almost a year now. 
I’m a 22 Yr old woman. 

And there’s a woman in her 40s also working there. I have no idea who she is, what part of the supermarket she works in. She’s not the manager or owner, I know that for sure). I don’t even know this woman’s name. She is definitely not my supervisor.
But every time she passes me while I’m working at a register she picks on me.

Granted, the first time, she told me off, it was for being on my phone. I scrolled through my lock screen of notifications. This was my fault. But what made me uncomfortable is that she YELLED at the top of her lungs to get off my phone in front of customers. She yelled some other stuff I can’t recall but she was so over dramatic about it, that I honest to god thought she was having a laugh about it or being funny. I just smiled and said “oh sorry you got me! Won’t happen again”. 

I have PTSD and get panic attacks that cause vertigo really easily, also, so the fact that she yelled at the top of her lungs at me in a silent store made me jump the fuck out of my skin. 

The next time she yelled at me was when I started to notice it getting weird. I had just served a customer. She caught me standing not doing anything for maybe less than a minute and she started speaking to me like I was a child. All the other girls at registers were on their phones doing nothing. She yelled at me to make myself useful and clean “do something for godsake!”.
Again I just smiled and got to it. But nonetheless this made me really uncomfortable. 

There’s been other instances but today really pissed me off and is making me really want to say something to this woman. 

She came up to me whilst I was serving a customer, and asked if my jeans were ‘blue’.
I looked and my jeans and said “they’re black.” She goes “no they’re not. You need to wear black jeans”.
I said “these are black jeans. They’ve just faded their colour from being over washed” (if anything they’re a little grey now but ultimately they are 100% black jeans). She proceeded to say “that’s it I’m going to get REALLY STRICT on you now. You need to come back with black pants” and continued to blabber some other stuff. 
All this while I’m serving a customer.
Was incredibly embarrassing. Again, the tone of her voice was like she was speaking to a young teenager.

I wonder if she actually thinks I’m a teenager?? I am exactly 5ft and skinny with a baby face. I’m a TINY woman. 

My manager and supervisor haven’t ever complained about my attire and I spend more time around them than this complete stranger woman.

311,"I need help I’m desperate for advice I don’t know how much longer me or my family can go on like this. My mother and father are divorced he isn’t the best dad so she raises us as a single mom.

He was her only family here and now we’re all she’s got but we’re kids so obviously she’s a bit lonely. 

This is going to sound so dumb but a big source of her stress is my younger brother (13) and younger sister (12) who can’t stop arguing. My mom is tired all the time so she doesn’t have the energy to discipline them and they don’t listen to me so we have to sit in between them while they scream at each other.

I can't do things and fix my own problems because I have been always doing housework and people at home are asking me too much tech-related questions. Now it became worse because they are working at home and there are endless problems they encounter on the computer so that I'm always being called to help. They even wake me up in the midnight because they don't know how to send a file. I always taught them how to do something but they keep asking for it again.

314,"Hello Reddit. I need some advice.
A couple years ago (7th grade), some girls at school accused me of bad stuff (only of which a sliver of which was true).
Now since then, I guess you can say I have changed. I’m a very different person, and for the better I think. 
Now I am starting high school in a couple days with former studwnts from my old school and I’d say 3/4 new. I am really worried that what happened then will happen again, and I am very worried about it.
TL;DR: will people be holding something over you from many years ago?",04Aug2020,1
315,"Ok so bit of a long one here, so TL;DR at the end. 

So a couple of days ago I [22F]was moving into my new apartment with my parents help. My new place is upstairs, and it was around 100 degrees F that day. We were looking at all the heavy stuff, couch, dresser, bed, and thinking, “fuck..”. My mom and dad are both around 60 years old and, no offense to my mom, she can’t lift anything very heavy for very long. My Dad is pretty strong, but we already knew that just with really just him and I this was going to be a pain in the ass.

Then this guy[25M], we’ll call him Jack, comes out of his apartment. He’s pretty hot ngl 😅 he’s pretty tall, muscular, nice face. He comes over and offers to help us. My father and him end up moving all the heavy stuff, it was like a blessing(especially when he took his shirt off half way through). And he was so sweet about it! Asks for nothing in return, but my dad offers him some beer which he agrees to. They were sitting down stairs outside, smoking, drinking and talking for about an hour or two. My dad ends up inviting him to dinner that night, he says he can’t that night, but would love to the next(I noted this in my mind cuz asking to go another night makes me feel like he wanted to go).

Anyways dinner was really nice! My dad ordered two bottles of wine(which I thought was a bit much), he was really friendly and there wasn’t any hardly awkward silences. I noticed he was always laughing at my jokes and smiling at me when I would talk.(possibly all in my head😂). I thought dinner went really well until my dad got a text(they exchanged numbers the day before) from him a little later.

He texted my dad, “Honest talk, did you invite me to dinner to thank me? Or to set me up with your daughter?”. I legit don’t know what to make of that AT ALL😂. I can’t stop thinking about how we might have come off that way, I just want to apologize to him if we made him feel uncomfortable or like set up or anything. That was yesterday and I haven’t seen him or talked to him since dinner. Part of me wants to see him just to break the ice(I’ve never talked to him one on one), just to see if he likes me or not, just to find out. Then another part is scared to death to see him, cuz I really have no clue what to say 😂. 

So I guess I’m just looking for some advice, feedback or whatever. I’ve asked my friends, and they all say they think he’s into me, but(and I love my friends) I’m worried they are just being kind. Based on what I’ve described do you think he’s into me? If I see him again what should I say? Should I apologize for possibly making him uncomfortable? Thanks for reading, and thanks for any advice! 

TL;DR- New hot neighbor helped me move in, dad invited him to dinner, we all had a good time, he later texts my dad, “Did you invite me to dinner to thank me or set me up with your daughter?”",04Aug2020,1
316,"So I’m getting married next year, and right now I’m planning the guest list, and my mother came up. Ole Mommy Dearest (BM) was very abusive both physically and emotionally when I was a teenager. It got so bad I moved out to be with my dad (D) and step mom (SM) and youngest sister (Y). For all intents and purposes, SM is my mom. She’s who I call on a bad day, she’s who went dress shopping with me, all that. My relationship with BM is a bit better now. We speak, we hang out I guess once every two or three months. Regardless, it’s not a mother daughter relationship. Her coworkers didn’t even know I existed till my sister (M) went to work with her one day and she brought me up. Now M, is BMs daughter but not my dads. Y is not my mothers daughter, only my dads. They’re my half sisters with each parent. 
So, I’m talking with M about the the guest list, and told her I wasn’t sure about inviting BM to the wedding. M and BM are very close, always have been. M was devastated that I wasn’t inviting our mother, so I told her I would reconsider. 
I have no clue what to do. I’m very close with my sister, I want her to be happy and not feel like she has to keep a secret from our mother, but at the same time I don’t think anything good can come from inviting our mother. Not only would I feel like 2nd best on my own wedding day, but she would criticize every little thing from my tattoos to dress to hair and make up. And on top of this, my step mom absolutely hates my biological mother due to an event that involved her where I almost ended up in a mental hospital on false documents.

317,"I am trapped seriously, even way before this pandemic growing up I don't think me and my brother could say we ever have hung out with a friend outside of school before or slept over at someone else's house. Granted we never got the balls to ask and didn't have many friends really but she was the reason why. Extremely emotionally manipulative and overprotective. Despite living in a bad neighborhood and being easily influenced we've never been bad kids we've never sold drugs, got into trouble at school, any fights, or be around the wrong people, typical things young black males like ourselves get caught up in all the time but yet we still have lived this super sheltered ass life and I am sick of it. Because of this I suffer from depression and social anxiety.

I just graduated and turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, I'm grown and ready to do things on my own. I told my mom I wanted to hang out with my girlfriend for a bit and she gave me an ultimatum if I left I wasn't allowed to come back. Saying that this virus is going around (we live in Florida btw) and because she has diabetes she is high risk and I could catch it and kill her. But that isn't fair we've been trapped inside for the entire lock down for months now besides leaving for work and its taken a toll on our mental health. Plus other friends of mine have went to parties, the beach and came back fine. I want to go see one person and she wont let me do that.

I'm honestly about ready to move out and go stay with my girlfriend who I've met about 6 months ago I trust her with my feelings more than my own mom and can tell her anything and the few times we have met in person have gone great we both want to be with each other and she just got her new place. I have a job the only issue is that I don't have a car yet or my license and my girlfriend wont always be able to take me I risk being late and being fired or going broke using ubers. I have nearly $3000 saved up and have seen some used cars under $2,000 I could save up a bit more to get one but then I'd have to buy gas and pay insurance, I also have to pay for textbooks for college soon I have financial aid but it might not cover it all.

What should I do if I leave I risk losing my support system and put myself in danger, but I'd say its worth the risk for freedom. If I stay Im putting a strain on the relationship with my girlfriend and putting my mental health at risk even more because I feel so stuck. If I stay with my girlfriend whom's a manager at Wendy's I could possibly try and get hired and we can work together but thats not a guarantee with all the people unemployed and Im honestly not the most efficient and fastest worker.

I also was thinking about going to hang out with her in a couple of days and seeing if I would be able to comeback if I cant stay with her I should at least be able to see her its one person and we have both limited our exposure.

So do I ride this out for a few more months and hope this pandemic ends soon and jeopardize my relationship and mental health or risk losing my support and mom who despite all she's put us through emotionally I love dearly.

As a result, my grandma spent a lot of time trying to find a boyfriend, but they were all physically abusive. So my dad have to return from school worried for his mom. Not only that, but his cousins encourage him to do drugs at a young age. So now he has extreme anger issues and it’s absolutely awful when he’s angry. Whenever I made a big mistake that was similar to ones he’s made in the past, he would hit and scream at me. I’m starting 9th grade and this had been going in since second. His arthritis doesn’t help either. It makes him scream and shout swears and occasionally, how he’s gonna kill himself. He hasn’t hit me for about a year now, which is nice, but just yesterday he was getting out of the truck and I went into the house as usual. He came in after a few minutes and goes “Yeah thanks a lot K, really fuckin nice of you to help me out back there.” But what did he want me to do? I’m very thin, so I wouldn’t have been much support anyways. And he also threatens to leave us and never come back like his dad did. Because of everything he’s said and done, I have trust issues, I’m scared to stand up for myself, and I feel uncomfortable around middle aged men. This whole time, I didn’t think it was a big deal until one day, my science teacher was scolding these kids behind me for being to loud and slacking off. I knew it wasn’t directed towards me, but when he raised his voice, I flinched. And due to quarantine, I have too much time in my hands to think. Some days, I feel uncomfortable around him and try to keep conversation short, other days I feel just fine around him. But thinking about it tears me up inside because I still love him. I know he loves me too, to the point where he would give up his life for me, but I can’t live like this anymore. Normally, I would wait until I’m 18 to move out, but my mom says I’m not allowed to move out until I get married because “It’s an Asian thing”. And I can’t call CPS because I’m worried about what will happen to my mom and my little brother. We wouldn’t be able to provide for ourselves if he left. And I could very easily convince my parents to divorce because they don’t love each other, but again, I’m worried about what will happen to us afterwards. Please help me. I’m really tired of this.

I kept my mouth shut as I was hoping he would be able to pull out of it. That never happened as he said it was too late, and I took it for granted that he would not speak to this man again.
Today I noticed my husband way clearly trying to hide his phone screen from me. I decided to check it (something I neve do, but it was just so obvious I had to).

326,"I'm 28 y/o the farthest I remember back to starting to smoke and not quitting was when I was 13, I grew up in a house of smokers so getting access to  them wasn't hard, I'm also obese and asthmatic and probably have a whole slew of mental health issues that have just gone undiagnosed due to my parent's negligence that eventually bled its way into every shape of my life. Currently I live with my gf of 9 months (we've known each alot longer it just finally made sense to be together) and things are about good as they can be for a new couple in isolation together. Recently I've begun getting more worried about my health as has my gf, we agreed that I should quit smoking and today was the first attempt at it that I took seriously, I've attempted in the recent past but there was always the voice in the back of my mind reassuring me that we would just buy more when it got too tough. but today i woke up and was determined to be done. It was a long day, for atleast the last 15 years i doubt ive gone longer than a full day willingly without a cigarette so to day it was a weird experience was an understatement. I noticed i was on edge and little things seems to frustrate me more. I don't know if it was intentional or just my brain picking things out but it just feels like my gf is extra critical of me and just testing my nerves to see if i'm going to snap. finally its 2am here and we get in arguement my sister isnt too far away so instead of going and getting an entire pack for me I have her drop me off a single cigarette so I can smoke it and sleep and try again tomorrow. I know it's not the best strategy and I could give a million excuses but I was weak and that's all there is to it. however this prompted my gf to absolutely freaking out saying that I don't care about anything and that I'm a ""lying piece of shit"" and she is now sleeping in bed with her daughter and messaged me saying I either have to choose her or the cigarettes and obviously I want her and I dont want the cigarettes but I feel so fucking pressured and i just want to smoke. what do i do",04Aug2020,1

328,"Me, 22 White M, is currently living at my home with my 19 White M brother and 60M and 57F white parents. My brother is someone who is very vocal and ""passionate"" about what he feels. I put passionate in quotes due to what I'll elaborate on later. Recently, I overheard my brother and my mother having an argument, which they mostly do. It was about going back to college during quarantine, so I went back to talking and chatting with my friends.  Then I heard him say that ""Black people aren't oppressed."" This took me by surprise and I instantly checked out of my conversation with my friends.  He continued on about how ""systemic racism doesn't exist"" and ""few black people work for what they got, they just riot and get welfare for their broken homes."" I guess the conversation went down into politics due to the pods that the school was implementing. 

I didn't intervene, because I knew that this would just get worse with me arguing as well. So I let him go off into his room and I left mine to take a shower. When I asked my Mom, what the hell went down she said that ""We were just talking politics, and you know how he gets.""  I said he had spouted out some racist stuff and her response was ""He'll get over that thinking, he's young."" I was just, angry throughout the rest of the night. Till now where I'm writing this. 

HE's done this before and both of my parents write it off most of the time. My mother barely remembers all the stuff and arguments they get into due to her being consumed by taking care of my grandmother, her mother, in a nursing home and her just having crap memory due to what I believe is genetic memory loss where she forgets key parts of conversations and events. She can't even remember what my major in college was most of the time. Mt Dad doesn't normally tolerate all this stuff. He a very streetwise firefighter who set us straight growing up. He'd yell at my brother a lot when he'd misbehave or say something wrong or offensive but I feel he lets a lot of his behavior slide because he thinks he's young. 

This goes to my family as well, they make the same excuses while he's the only person wearing a Trump shirt of the fourth of July, and making outrageous comments. I just feel that I'm the only one noticing and countering it. 

So, my predicament is not only trying to confront my personal family but also trying not to destroy what I have as well. I don't believe most of my family is racist but, they are just surrounded by the language, they're just complicit in the rhetoric. 

So right now I just want some advice from anyone in my situation, POC, anyone really who'll know how to help me walk this tightrope.",04Aug2020,1

331,"I have a 9 year-old nephew who my partner and I are very close to.
We live about an hour and a half away from him. We typically see him or have him stay with us for the weekend every other month or so, plus holidays.
He was raised in a “normal” home with 3 older siblings until this past year, when his Dad began cheating on his mother and surprisingly moved all their children and himself into his new girlfriends home. It literally happened with no warning over a weekend.
My parents divorced when I was 8 and I know the pain and trauma of quick, unexpected changes in a child’s life. Because of this, we tried very hard to remain a stable, safe place for him.
Then the virus hit. We saw him in January, and planned to have him over in March, which is when the virus really began to hit our area. We have not gotten to see him since January of this year.
He spends half his time with his father and the girlfriend and he spends the other half with his Mom, who he is incredibly close to. 
My Mom has gotten to see him some and has told me of her concern that he seems to have lost the sparkle in his eyes. She said he seems healthy enough, but just that she notices a difference. He is very smart and very sensitive, so I’m sure he’s picking up on the situation at home, but obviously it’s not as if they’re trying to hide it from him. 
He has also told my Mom that he wants to live permanently with his Mom. It’s very clear that while his physical needs may be being met, his emotional needs are not.
So, little guy calls me for the first time ever a week ago and asks if he can come stay with us this next weekend. I honestly forgot about the virus for a second and told him, “of course”. 
After talking to him, my partner then reminds me that his family thinks wearing masks is for “sheep”, no one is social distancing or in lockdown, and continue to work jobs (out of necessity, of course) and socialize.
I am high risk with asthma, partner with pre-diabetes. I have been working from home since March (which is a blessing) and we choose to be very responsible regarding the virus: masks if we have to be near anyone, keeping 6 feet of possible, grocery pickup, staying home, etc.
I have had a bad feeling because of the virus about getting my nephew for the weekend since telling him we would.
Our area’s numbers are really bad right now. 

Im having a hard time choosing to keep with my “yes” I already gave to this sweet child, or canceling out of concern for my and my partner’s health.

334,"Last year was my first year in college and I befriended a girl on my floor. We became inseparable, but things fell apart this year.

Lucy was extremely charismatic and fun to be around, and she really helped me come out of my shell. I wasn’t great at making friends in high school and I lost 80 pounds in college and she played a huge role in helping me develop a healthy social life.

Anyways, tensions stared getting higher with Lucy and she never told me what was going on. I saw her in the dining hall this year and avoided her because I was nervous about seeing her. In retrospect I should have said hi. I reached out to her over text later that week and she said she was done with me for the things I said behind her back, even though I’m not exactly sure what she means. 

I reached out to her and wished her well on her birthday (In November), and she recently followed me on Instagram. Part of me wants to see if I can rekindle my friendship with her, but part of me doesn’t want to reach out again. I’m the last person who’s reached out (although this was months ago), and I want to respect her if she wants space. I don’t want to annoy her I miss her a lot.

336,"I sent a text to my ex best friend

Me and her always fought and we eventually make up and be friendly and cool with eachother for awhile, we kept fighting anyways, it got worse each time. Now it’s to the point where she no longer feels like giving me a chance, it’s been a week since we stopped being friends, we had a talk 2 days later on ft cause I was planning on killing myself for what I did, I felt grieve, that feeling of losing a best friend, sad, depressed, anger, regret. I didn’t explain myself well my thoughts were messed up and I was unstable at the time, there’s more information on my recent post, I’m here to ask if I should open the text she sent me on snap chat? I feel really anxious and honestly I already feel like I know what’s she’s gonna say “I’m not giving you another chance” or some disrespectful stuff like she did to me last time.

I know deep down who she is and I care a lot about this girl I love her and I wanna make her happy I value our friendship deeply, I just wish I can bring the words together to tell her I’m sorry and bring the words together that can hopefully give me a chance to redeem myself and be friends with her again.

Here’s what I sent her: “Hey, I know you don’t wanna hear from me  and you prolly hate me cuz of some of the shit I did while I was depressed. I still can’t believe a dumb argument ended our friendship I felt a lot of pain and regret that day and ofc I was sad. I was only trying to convey stuff that I was trying to work out for myself and didn’t really think it through cause of my issues that were stopping me making it seem like everything I was saying to come out all wrong. I’m sorry for complaining so much, I just wish you could’ve understood me better if I took the time to make myself feel better it wouldn’t be like this and we’d probably still be friends. I know I was never patient, I hate being kept waiting, I used To always keep my little brother waiting, then one day he passed on, so I stayed to my word i would never leave anyone waiting and I would do things as quickly as possible and to rush things sometimes. But ig I didn’t stay to my word when I said I would change for you and make you happy. Even tho it still bothers me and makes me sad sometimes whenever I think about it and after all the shit, I believe in myself and confident enough to rebuild our friendship one day maybe. I’ll learn to love myself again the way I love you, I’ll give you time and I’ll reflect I’ll just leave this here for you if you even read it, I know you hate me deep down and I know I made those mistakes a couple hundred times, so let me redeem myself again cause I just need one more shot at 2nd chances, I’ll give it some more time, I’m sorry 4 bugging u, i miss my friend.”

She opened my text immediately once I sent it, she read it, and then took awhile to respond, I said I wouldn’t bug her after that and I didn’t.

344,"So, this isn’t related to my last post, although similarities do occur. Also, I may seem stupid, but please read the full thing before any assumptions.

So, someone out of this building(public) which we don’t exactly know what they do their put up a board.(homemade)It wasn’t a normal one, though. 

It stated “You with the white dog!Your on camera so clean your dogs crap or pay the fine!!” I do have a white dog which I CLEAN HIS FECES!! Every single time he did his duty I do in fact clean it. And, once I had no bag, so I used a leaf!There is no other dog like mine near my area. 

Also, I want to add I don’t think that this was the police. This mysterious stranger had terrible grammar. And, they used the word “crap”.  And, the thought of cameras targeting me is creeping me out. 

I have been getting into small fights particularly with one neighbor. And, this neighbor doesn’t clean his dog after his duty. (The dog was dark grey)

There is another white dog, with black spots, but the owners don’t walk her. And, this was near my area. I walk my dog nearly everyday. And, I haven’t really seen another white dog around. 

At this point I’m overreacting. A lot of people saw this board. And, even if it wasn’t me, people may assume it’s me. Since they see me walking a white dog frequently. This is publicly shunning, personally. If they thought they saw me not cleaning after my dog they can tell me privately. They don’t need to do this. And, I’ve always cleaned after my dog!

Not to intimidate anyone, but I have a bff. And this bff’s dad is a lawyer. To add one my mom is friends with a cop. 

I don’t know who this person is. But I’d REALLY appreciate if they took this down. And, it may seem like I’m dramatic, but I’m actually afraid, and embarrassed.",04Aug2020,1

I have 3 friends and a sister. Everytime i see any of them i almost alays have a sleepover with them. I see 1 friend every week, if not every other. I see my sister every 1-3 weeks depending on our work/school schedules. (She works, i have highschool) My other friend i see every month or less. My next friend i see every 3ish months. So thats 2 days a week usually taken out to socialize and have fun. When im not with any of them im always playing videogames or painting. My dream is to be a painter and sell art. I play videogames more than anything in my life. I know i do it too much and its completely outweighing what i should be doing which is school work, and art since i plan to do it as a job but i just cant. A lot of times i feel uninspired or just want to relax and have fun. Art is fun but is a lot of work. I mean wtf do i expect but gaming is just so easy to me. Yeah i die a trillion times in apex and cant aim for the life of me but its just more fun and i end up prioritizing games over anything. Im a lazy shit but i dont know how to change.

348,"Hello, I'm a 16-year-old girl and I require some kind of advice at the moment so I decided to make an alt account for Reddit to receive it. I'll just get into the subject at hand.

My group of friends and I were talking on Discord and joking about certain things. Now, keeping in mind that I have left this group chat multiple times due to them causing problems and me not wanting to be apart of that. I recently came back because my close friend who I'll just call ""Sora"" wanted me to help with them being attacked within the group for no reason. She's a very nice girl, so there isn't anything she would do wrong. Now, the 2 people who were attacking her are very toxic and have used her in multiple ways, so of course, I joined back because she asked me to.Now, things didn't get sorted out, but since I was there the attention shifted over to me instead of her.

I planned on leaving the group chat and going on with my own life since I didn't want to talk to them anymore, but I ended up having a little bit of fun, so I stayed for a couple of weeks. So that's that.We started to joke about certain things and my friend, ""Sora"" left as a joke. I added her back into the group chat and said ""Don't go, you're the only reason why I'm here"". That's where things took a turn and everything ended up going South. The rest of the group were very confused about what I meant by that. I was going to say something, but things were becoming heated and I thought I would ruin the situation just by saying anything right there at that moment and time. I dmed my friend Sora about it and she also agreed that I can say something once everything calms down. I gave them a day to calm down and realized  I didn't know what to say. I ended up not saying anything on that day and then day 3 rolls around. The group chat is inactive and dead ever since the whole situation and I was being blamed for it, which to me is fair enough.

I tried to write something that wouldn't tick them off anymore, but I couldn't come up with anything and thought it would seem somewhat ""untruthful"". So, I decided that I would say whatever I need to say in VC and explain the reason why I joined the group was because of Sora, because I wasn't planning on coming back and that I started enjoying myself and decided to stay. But then my friend Sora leaked some screenshots from dms and a group chat they made to trash me basically.

I was angry about it and decided to call the whole thing off. They accused me of using my friend Sora and told her to not talk to me anymore. They didn't really give me a reason how I was possibly using her? It was tough since now she distrusts me and I have to reassure her every day.

I haven't talked in the group chat since then. I muted it and left it be until I kept getting pings by 1 person to come back and talk. I don't really think I should talk since I never really said sorry to them and I feel bad about it. They're amazing people, but they don't really understand certain things they should know.  I planned to keep silent until they kicked me out, but they haven't yet and I don't know what else to do. Apologizing seems like my best option, but I don't know if it's too late for that or not.

I should add that someone in the gc did confront me about the situation and talked to me, but they told me my apology seemed to be even worst then what I said before?? I just feel like a bad friend for causing all of this and don't know if I should leave them to be their own friend group or try to fix things.",04Aug2020,1

352,"To give a bit of background, my bf's dad recently passed away in a devastating trucking accident and it's been extremely hard on him because he and his dad were best friends. And so he took a trip to Maryland and has been gone for about 3 weeks visiting family so he can try to process things. 

So basically, my bf and I were video chatting a few days ago and...well, he started talking to me about how after his dad's passing he realized how short life really is and how much he loves me and knows I'm the one for him and he never wants to be with anyone else...and then...he asked how I felt about getting engaged. He said he wasn't asking me to marry him right then because he wanted me to be surprised and have it be super special (and of course in person). And I was shocked and excited but nervous and...well, I told him that I would want to think on it a bit and he said he completely understands. 

He comes back home tomorrow and I know when I see him he's gonna wanna talk about this again. Or at least...I want to talk about it. But I'm so confused about what to say! I love him so much and I honestly could see us married and living the best lives together forever. But I worry that he's making this decision just because he's feeling rushed and emotional from his dad's passing. Plus, as much as I hate to admit it...there's a lot of people out there, and I worry that maybe he (or even I) could find someone that is truly the person I or he is meant to be with. I don't want to get engaged and take that chance from him or myself when we're so young. See, we're only 18 (about to be 19) and haven't even gone off to our bachelor year of college yet.

So...I just have all these fears and concerns and my heart is saying ""eeee! Omigosh, say yes!"" But my brain is saying ""maybe don't..."" And idk what to do. Plus...we don't even live together yet and that would suck to be engaged and not live together...anyways. That's my rant of dilemma. Any advice or commentary on what to do about this situation would be greatly appreciated.🙂

TL;DR: My bf asked me how I feel about getting engaged soon and I'm not sure what to respond with due to my many fears and worries.

\-The first dream : I was on my couch or in some red house, theres a nuclear explosion outside, knowing im gonna die, i text her ""I love you"" even though we havent known each other for long.  Then shes typing, and before i see her response im dead. 

\-The second dream : I wake up on a school day and shes holding me in my bed, we end up skipping the school day to hold each other for longer. In spite of knowing theres a big test that same day. I fall asleep in the dream world, holding her. Then i wake up. 

Im not sure if she likes me but heres the thing, i like really like her, she motivates me to do so much more, i started working out daily, i wake up early. Literally shes the light of my life right now. 

I dont want to lose her ever... im scared to get in a relationship with her. Cause it will most likely end sadly, i wouldnt mind being just friends, but i wouldnt want to do ""just friend things"" with her.

354,"Title. This guy my boyfriend has mutual -mutual- Facebook friends with messaged him offering 8k if he could smell my boyfriend’s feet for 45 min. He also offered an additional 8k to watch my bf jack off in front of him, to which my boyfriend responded “umm I’ll have to ask my girlfriend about that” and the guy was like wait no nvm just the feet smelling. 

We Facebook stalked the hell out of this guy and he seems like a normal, average gay dude, the account didn’t seem fake at all.  Also the fact that he didn’t like that my bf wanted to ask me about the jacking off makes me think he’s serious too (not a scam) because he was scared of people finding out. 

My boyfriend is considering it. I feel like it’s pretty dangerous and it seems like a lot of money for what he’s asking.

I met X almost a year ago, I was immediately attracted to him. Not JUST in a physical way, but in the way that you feel comfortable talking to them. I was excited when we worked together and started developing actual feelings. About the time I was head over heals, I found out he had a girlfriend. My heart sank and it took a while, but I was able to ween my romantic feelings away from the relationship and just focus it into a real friendship. No problem, right? Kept that for almost a year now.

I just (two months ago) got out of a short relationship with another coworker (Z) (we’re still good friends), and was being egged on to ask out a different coworker (Y) I find him physically attractive and smart, but that’s not all I’m looking for, Y and I just exchanged numbers. ALSO I KNOW I shouldn’t date coworkers because it’s messy. I have no excuse and wouldn’t dare make one. 

Fast forward to last week; X confides to me that he and his girlfriend are breaking up. And it was like the floodgates were open. I’m trying to stuff the romantic shit away but every time I see him now I ACTUALLY can’t help but think about how much he checks off all the boxes I’m looking for. Dreams, everything, the whole shabang. Whenever I go to text Y, I just think about how he’s not X. I really am only interested in X, and I don’t wanna mess it up if there’s even a possibility of it working out by dating a bunch of people at work. (Small workplace) It seems to me, knowing him, that it would send the wrong message about my character, even though I think he knows me really well, I don’t know. 

I wouldn’t dare ask X out anytime soon, I don’t know how long his relationship had been on the rocks, and I don’t know if he’s still recovering or if he’s glad, or what. I checked in with him and he said he’s “doing well all things considered!”. SOONEST, I would ask him out in two or three months because I personally think you need at least that amount of time to move on from a longer term (two year) relationship with his ex. 

I think it’s unfair to Y to try a relationship if all I can look at is X. But I don’t even know if X is interested or would be interested. People who met his (now ex) GF said that I reminded them of her. (I’ve met her, and she was nice! We’re def different people but we had similar mannerisms and looks.) is that a good or bad sign? X has also expressed to me around the time we first met, while talking about how he and his ex met, that it was a miracle that anyone liked him in the first place. He’s expressed similar thoughts in the year I’ve known him. So that makes me worried, if he did find me attractive enough to want to date ever, now or in the future, he wouldn’t think that I could possibly like him back, thus wouldn’t ask me out for the same concerns I have, ruining the friendship. I also don’t want another girl to swoop in and shoot their shot before I have the opportunity to see if we could be a thing. He’s got a timid personality and Isn’t the type to really make a first move unless the person he’s making the move on, makes it clear that they like him/have an interest.

TLDR; I have a major resurgence of feelings for my coworker/good friend (named X here) after finding out he broke up with his girlfriend of just under two years. He’s the definition of what I’m looking for in a relationship, but I don’t know if he’s Interested/would be interested in me. I look similar to X’s ex (as pointed out by others) and have been told my kindness is like hers. I have another coworker that I could date and am attracted to physically, but it’s not anywhere at the level to which I like X. 

Should I wait it out and shoot my shot after he’s had a fair amount of time to move on AND possibly risk the friendship? (Although he seems like he could be chill after it too, I just don’t want to ruin the fun banter and conversation we have) Or should I settle with someone I don’t like as much for now and see where that goes? I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but believe me please when I tell you, this one’s the catch of the day. HANDS DOWN.",04Aug2020,1
356,"I’m a M(18) and I’ve been dating my girlfriend F(16) for 10 months now, but I don’t think I want to be in a relationship with her anymore. She’s the best person I’ve ever met, but I’m going off to college this year and my stepdad and I got into a physical fight that ended my mom and his marriage, and I’m having to deal with a lot of personal stuff. She is really good to me but she has a lot of issues of her own and I don’t feel like I’m able to listen and help her with her own issues because I haven’t dealt with my own. I care about her deeply but her parents are very mentally abusive towards her and I’m worried that if I break up with her that she won’t have anyone to be there for her. I need to deal with things on my own, and I don’t think I can do that and be in a relationship with someone at the same time.

357,"I was on TikTok and a young man (I'm guessing somewhere between 18-22) popped up in my feed. He records himself racing his buddy while weaving extremely dangerously through moderate traffic as he nearly side swipes multiple vehicles, uses the emergency shoulders on both sides of the road to pass, and hitting speeds of over 150MPH on the highways (his speedometer is visible).

The footage is fairly new (only a few hours old) and I haven't made up mind what to do. Quite frankly, I'm not sure what to do.

His license plate and his friend's license plate are visibly on camera with the windows rolled down in one of the videos allowing for a clear shot of their faces. In this clip, they are seen revving their engines and burning their tires just before racing off through a residential road while holding up traffic behind them.

Their behavior is very reckless and I feel that they should be taught a lesson, as this is not excusable. They're very well aware of the dangers they're causing to themselves, their passengers, and every one around them.

However, I'd potentially be fucking up their lives. On the other hand, it takes just one accident from this repetitive behavior for them to fuck up multiple lives.

I live in California. The videos are tagged in New York. And the license plates are New York Plates. 

What do I do? 

I've saved the videos in case they are deleted.",04Aug2020,1
358,"Hi. I have been really scared to open up about this and I've been really struggling with it. 

I just need some advice on what to do if I was sexually assaulted. 

(Backstory) When I was younger, I'd have to guess about 5-6 though i may be incorrect as I've just remembered this, a step-family member of mine came over to my house from very far away. He was/is disabled and cant function normally. I'm not sure what his disability is but I just know it means that he doesnt really understand much. At the time he was (I'm guessing) 26. 

I was sitting on his lap watching TV and I ended up touching his penis through his trousers becuase I wasnt educated on what those parts were. I asked him what it was but assumed it was a sock. Long story short I didnt stop touching it because I was never asked to. I continued to ask questions about why he had socks there. As far as I can remember he got hard and then everything goes blank. I'm scared something further happened and I'm just blocking it out. 

Please I really need help here. I'm thinking about bringing it up with family.",04Aug2020,1
359,"For back story. I been friends with him for a while. I feel I’m pretty center on the whole but because I happen to agree with some issues on the right, I been that “right wing” guy in the group. 

So my friend who has been pretty politically casual has getting more involved with politics motivated by the various unrest going on America lately ( death of George Floyd, the crazy shit Trump been pulling etc). I was actually glad of this because I believe everyone should be informed and vote what they believe in.

The issue is he been getting pretty radical lately and he did  admit it as he feels the system is corrupt and there is no solution but to start from scratch. We have always been  able to discuss different opinion fairly well.

So lately in a lot of our discussing he been using the loaded questions tactic where he dumbs down a complex issue where it’s comes down to you agree with him so he’s right, or you disagree and you are wrong because he frames  the question in a way that it takes away the complexity and the differing factors of the situation that make it so by not agreeing with his view is illogical. 

now has its escalated to where he is attacking my moral character because we don’t see eye to eye, claiming the moral high ground solely on what he believes in.  

I guess my question is I still like to remain friends , I learn not bring up heated topic up around him, but it feels like he bring it up just so there can be a argument. I don’t want to lie how I feel on a issue to avoid drama because as adult we should be able to talk it out even if nobody changes their minds about. 

How do I keep a political conversation with a self describe radical civil? He keeps pushing the topic on to me. (Oh and pointing out the flaws in his arguments just fuel the flames)",04Aug2020,1
360,"Hi everyone, I just want to know what everyone’s experiences has been with infidelity. I [25F] just found out my husband [26M] of 6 years (but we’ve been together for 10) cheated on me over a year ago. He didn’t tell me, an anonymous stranger did. He didn’t want to tell the truth at first, just asked who it was that messaged me. I explained to him that no one else would have known he went on this trip because he’s in the military so I know they’re not lying. 

Anyway he told me he was really drunk and they had sex once. At this point i was hurt but i was willing to give the marriage a chance... but then the anonymous person messaged me again saying I could ask them any questions and so i asked if it was more than once and they said yes....i told them my husband kept saying no, it was just once... The person responded that he was lying, that it was several times. And at this point, he got pretty angry at this person and went off in the car to talk to his best friend about this.

When he came back, he was crying and saying he was going to tell me the truth. He told me it was 5 times and said that he broke it off with her two weeks before leaving the trip because “it wasn’t what he wanted” and he wanted to keep our marriage so he didn’t tell me. He just said that he wanted to come back a better husband, which he did for the better but it wasn’t like super drastic differences. We had a really great past year, probably the best ever. 

I asked him why he did it and he said that there was nothing wrong with our relationship at all (and to my knowledge there wasn’t, we were the happiest) he didn’t expect it at first but after the first time he had sex with her, he wanted to continue to see what it was like to be with another woman. He said he didn’t want to believe every time they had sex that that is really how it was because it wasn’t great...  we have amazinggg sex, always have &amp; we both are always willing to try most things at least once. I’m very fit, take care of myself, am a very beautiful woman, many talents, and have really good self confidence on top of being goal driven and just an all around good person. So I’m just confused because everyone always would tell him how lucky he is because on top of all of that, I’m loyal and just really nice and helpful to people...

So I told him that if there’s nothing wrong with our marriage then he has to look into himself on why he did this and the next day he told me that his confidence has always been low and even though I would compliment him all the time, he didn’t truly believe it because I was “too gorgeous” and he didn’t know why someone like me would be with someone like him. I don’t know why he’s feels this way because I honestly believe he is very attractive, I was attracted to him at first sight but he told me since someone else was giving him attention, he felt wanted and just went for it. He said there was nothing special about her, that there was no emotional connection, that she wasn’t more beautiful or had a better body, that she was a mean person, not a good friend, that she actually stunk but he still doesn’t know why he went for it other than her being easy and her wanting him. 

I’m obviously so hurt by this because we grew up together, lived in each other’s houses as teens, our families love the both of us so much, and we’ve always been looked at as like the “goal couple” or storybook love that everyone wanted. Those who know are very confused why he would do this, they always thought he was a good man and deeply inlove with me but... now I don’t know what’s real anymore and I’m going to stay with family until I can figure out my decision. 

What are your guys thoughts? Do you have any success stories? Is it even worth saving? He’s been supportive in this, such as paying for my plane ticket home (we live overseas), offering to pay for therapy, saying he’ll still take care of me no matter what I decide (I know he will because he’s always been helpful to me even when we broke up before). He said he’ll change and I asked him how and he had a whole list of things but how do I know he really will? At this point I can’t trust anything he says. Communication on my part has always been honest but I know on his end, he tends to lie to make me feel better. I’ve told him several times I’d rather be hurt with the truth than comforted with a lie and I thought he understood that. What do you guys advise is best to do? I feel so confused ):",04Aug2020,1

363,"TLDR; I’m debating whether or not this is reason for a fundraising situation or not.

Her cat was such a blessing. Her names Jasmine, and she bonded with my sister since kittenhood. My sister is autistic and doesn’t bond with others easily, but this little one was her very best friend. She’s heartbroken. Last night I held her in my arms until she cried herself to sleep, and she’s not a touchy person. At first I had promised that I’d get her cat back, but I’d failed. Even though I did everything I could I still feel this immense guilt and all I want to do is take all her pain away. 

I was thinking of buying her a Ragdoll from the same breeder I bought mine from. My sweet Freya is an absolute cuddly angel, I’d love to get my sister a new friend that’s just like her. Only Ragdolls are quite expensive and neither of us could afford one :( we would adopt from a shelter, but I’d like my sister to have the chance to bond with a kitten and grow with her it’s entire life. I’ve also considered that kitten’s personalities (at least in the domestic shorthair breed, which are most common) can be so unique and there’s no telling whether they will be cuddly or attentive, or anything like an emotional support cat at all. 

I was thinking of starting a gofundme to help us get this kitten for her, but I don’t know if that’s just pathetic or cringey or... idk I just feel weird about it. But I’m also rather desperate which is why it crosses my mind.

364,"I am a software programmer (32M). I used to be such a enthusiastic person. While studying programming interested me and I used to write code for hours like playing game. Then after much struggle I started my career. Around age 25 I started earning enough money to run my life. That is when I realized that programming is such a boring,repetitive and meaningless job. Due to financial reasons I cannot change my career either. That is the same time I started watching TV series and regretting the decision now.

Now I live like a machine. My daily routine goes like this: I wake up very late, work in office with zero interest, go back to home and start watching some entertaining but pointless TV series, watch until my eyes become tired and go to sleep.

365,"Some background: My brother and father both passed away one after another within a span of a few years, and after I graduated I worked overseas for a couple of years and only recently returned home to our apartment where my mom currently lives alone. The last time I visited was 3 years ago. 

Due to this pandemic, I quit my overseas job recently and came back home just 2 days ago. I am in absolute shock how much junk has piled up in the house. Before my brother's and father's passing, she already had the tendency to hoard stuff, but I think bereavement has triggered it even more... The house is not in a livable condition at all.. She doesn't do basic cleaning (dust on surface, hair on the floor, tissues everywhere), and eats poorly. She hoards various things like boxes, clothes, newspapers, bottles, also some of my brother's (e.g. bike, toys) and father's belongings (e.g. bags he used to use). Adding on to the list, she has also hoarded stuff from my childhood (e.g. collections of various sorts including erasers, notepads, stickers, etc) that I no longer want or need. The house is also in very bad shape (lights don't turn on, kitchen cabinets falling apart, leakage in walls causing rain water to seep in)...  


I feel extremely overwhelmed right now, especially with guilt, for neglecting her for the past few years because I couldn't deal with living in this house after the passing of 2 close family members. I was close to her before that, but something in me snapped that I could no longer bring myself to communicate properly with her anymore. My heart is breaking... We are in a bad place financially too since I just returned back to my home country and have not started looking for any job. I spent most of the money earned repaying my college debt (completely paid off now!), but do have some savings left. I want to start afresh with my mom, but unsure how to given the current situation. I have started cleaning some stuff out, but I absolutely cannot do this by myself. I have nobody else to call for help (no friends either since I lived abroad for so long), no other relatives... She also seems a bit reluctant to throw away what's obviously junk... though I understand that hoarding might be her way of coping with the grief.. 

I want to get rid of many of the furniture simply laying around taking up space and collecting dust (e.g. piano, tables that my father used), and also I dread to see my mom looking at these things and be reminded of my brother/father. Problem is, it'd cost money for the bulky items to be disposed of... I can't do the moving by myself because I am not strong enough. My head is just spinning and I have lost my appetite... I can't imagine how she have lived for the past couple of years by herself with the house (especially the kitchen) in such a dire state. I want to renovate the kitchen but have not enough money to do so.. (costs at least a few thousand..)...   


How should I deal with this? I have been crying a lot. I am feeling so depressed and the only person I could talk to is my LDR bf, but he's been feeling irritated by my constant whining. I feel so alone dealing with such an overwhelming situation. I know I should probably talk to my mom about getting rid of the things but as I've mentioned, I've drifted apart from her ever since and communicate is sparse. How can I restart? How should I clean? Should I spend money on a bulk disposal company to get rid of the bigger items? I am sorry if I am incoherent... there's just so much going through my mind now.

370,"So, context is, I am a uni student in my last semester. A few months ago I got made redundant at a job which I was planning on going full time with after my studies. For the past few months I have being looking for a job (I really hate being out of work) and recently found one.

However, I'm having second thoughts because the job is already making me feel overwhelmed and I have yet to start working. This is because of a number of factors including but not limited to, really intense scripts I have to learn for the job as well as a lot of very specific skills I wont ever use again, being put down for particularly long hours, and the place of business being super out of my way.

This would be all good, but I am also going through a rough patch with family issues, school picking up, having a chronic illness flair up, and being on medication which is making me far too emotional (Which is relevant because I'm unsure whether i'm being overly dramatic)

And the thing is, In a few months when I finish school, I'll have to look for different full time work anyway, because they aren't able to provide me full time work.

When I write it out it really sounds one sided, if not for the fact that I feel I would be very good at the job, and I'm also worried I would miss out on an experience working there as the environment and people seem really fun. I guess it's a bit of a case of the FOMOs.

When it comes down to it my options are:

A) Take the job, and hope to stay afloat In the hopes that I will have alot of fun while working there and earn money for the next 3-6 months until I find some kind of full time work or 

B) Don't take the job in case it's too much to handle, (I have enough saved up from my past job to do this) and wait until I finish my degree to get a Job because I'll have to quit any part time job I get pretty soon anyway.

Just some backstory:

Last July I was mugged in a back alley near my house, i refused to give up my money as i had just cashed out at my local bank. I was shot in the stomach, and was apparently found later by my neighbour.

When i was out of the hospital i was a different man, a coward, i was scared to leave my house, lost my job, and even though i’m now able to leave my house and feel safe and go to work at my new job, i still feel that i’m a coward, and that my life is a shell of my former one.

My friends have noticed that since then, that i have been different, off, anxiety ridden, but they don’t bring it up because they know that i’ll put it off. (My closest friend told me about what they say)

377,"My bf(27) and I(24) recently moved in w my parents due to corona and to help out around their house. After my grandma on my mom's side passed away, a lot of my relatives told me I should move back so after our lease was up we moved in w my parents who are currently housing my brother J(22) and his gf L(19-20ish). 

My mom would call me and complain about J all the time before corona. Just random things like how he doesnt do chores and when he does he grumbles about how no one appreciates him and treats him like a slave rather than a son, yells a lot and basically throws tantrums when he misinterprets conversations and thinks my mom and sister(moved out now) are talking shit about him in my moms native language that he doesnt understand/practice. 

He actually moved out one time, couldnt survive out there and asked if he and L could move in with them. Mom and dad agreed that J could move back but were unsure about L because she was still young and she had a family of her own. Turns out L's father would rather rent out her old room to tenants to make a profit rather than let her move back in. We don't know the whole story but thats what J &amp; L said and so they welcomed her into their home. 

L doesn't really talk to my parents or even eats dinner with them when mom cooks. They share a greeting when passing eachother in the house but that's about it. Mom says they're always ordering take out and eating out. One incident that really stood out to me was when mom called me and was complaining about how L left a pair of period stained undies in the shared bathroom GROSS. I mean periods are natural and my mother and father especially has no problems with blood and bodily fluids after raising three kids but to blatantly leave it there and not clean up after yourself (she left it there for days because mom thought she just initially forgot about it and would pick it up later)?? Mom confronted J about this and gently reminded him that L is a guest and she is perfectly capable of picking up after herself and that they can't expect mom to clean up everything as they are adults now. He threw a tantrum (very typical of him at this point), making a point that he considers L family more so than me or our sister so mom shouldn't be making a ""big deal"" and just clean up after L as if she was family to her. 

They also don't help buy laundry detergent or anything cleaning supplies that they use. Mom also complains that they hoard used dishes in their room and will bring them all out at one time AND DON'T FREAKIN WASH THEM they just leave it there for either my mom or dad to wash. What kind of grown ass son treats his parents like that?? He's always late on rent, and when he does pay rent apparently he's very passive aggressive and calls my dad a moocher when he asks J for rent.  

I didn't believe it until I moved back. Recently, J and I got in a little argument about raising minimum wage and he got really defensive and started arguing like someone brainwashed by anti socialism/communism propaganda. I don't want to go into detail about the argument but he eventually started yelling and cussing about how I'm lazy and don't have a college degree even though I worked and survived on my own for 5 years meanwhile he tried to move out on his 3k a month job that required an education that put him 32k in debt and still couldn't survive and had to move back home. 

He turned 180 and started yelling at my dad in front of me and my bf about how no one respects him and how he only lives here because my parents asked him to come back to help with rent. He paints my parents in a bad light claiming they're only using him for his money for rent on the house but in reality my mom has the messages from him asking to move back and agreeing to pay rent. He also exclaimed that he doesn't trust or consider anyone family anymore except L. My bf and I also agreed to pay rent because it's only fair and I want to help them since mom doesn't work and dad is on disability due to major health issues. 

 L just lets this happen. She just hides in the room and waits for it to pass over and probably appeases him and enables for this behavior to happen because she doesn't care. 

I think something's really wrong with him mentally, where he twists everything in his head and victimizes himself when he is clearly in the wrong or takes everything way too personal. 

My best friend suggested therapy for him but I'm worried it might be too late or even if someone suggests it, L will just shut it down or dismiss it- causing J to also take offense or feel betrayed. 

Anyway, does anyone else has issues w/ family like this? How do you deal with it? Should I take charge and kick him out even when my mom would never kick him out bc he's her son?

TL/DR- Brother treats parents like shit as if they're mooching off his income to pay his part of rent after   he asked to move back in and brings unwelcome gf, who enables his behavior and acts like a very lazy uninvolved tenant. I want to kick him out but mom will not allow it because he is still her son.",04Aug2020,1

This is my first time ever posting something on reddit. I barely even use the app, but I feel like I'm pretty desperate for help. 
My story begins with me wanting to buy an iPad for school, for online classes starting this August, since my situation isn't good because of the COVID-19 still being a problem in my country. My parents, instead, wanted to buy something out of Huawei, so I went with that and asked them to get the latest(I think), Matepad Pro. They both went out to buy some groceries along with the gadget. Now that I have it, I was confused at first using it, that I can't seem to install Google. I asked a techy friend about it, and he filled me up with the news that Huawei is somewhat banned from using Google. I got so frustrated that I can't log in to the accounts that I need, and classes are starting this August. I've tried a lot of tutorials on YouTube but some of them are just not working for me.

383,"I (20F) was talking to someone (22M) almost everyday for about 5 months and now it's been almost a month since I heard from him and I feel like I'm the one to blame for it.

I met him on a discord server and we both ended up growing an interest for each other and talked almost everyday. It wasn't too uncommon to occasionally not hear anything for maybe a day or a night because he got busy with his college, but he'd always come back and say why and tell me he missed me and stuff like that and would tell me how bad he wished I was there so he didn't have to miss me or how bad he wish he could see me and stuff like that. We live in two different states so online is our only way to contact but that's never bothered me as I'm not really someone who minds the distance as long as the other is willing to be patient. I find it just as enjoyable to talk to him, no matter how far away he is and it just makes me wanna see him even more. I really grew to like him and absolutely adore him even though he may not realize just how much he really means to me. I absolutely adore him with all my heart and I made plans to go see him after I move out of my ex's.

The thing is, I've poured my heart out to him and even though he's admitted he liked me, he never really told me just how much or if he even wanted to be with me. I'm not down to travel across the country to be somebody's glorified fuck buddy, and I wanted to know if I was actually liked as a person or if it was just because they were bored and wanted company and thought they liked me but really didn't. I didn't want to be hurt and I made it very vocal I didn't so I asked if he actually did or if this was all for nothing. Only answer I basically got was just a ""yeah"" and nothing more. Now, he's not someone who's very vocal about his feelings and I get that and even though he's said he really liked me before, I just really wanted to hear it and hear how much I was liked and if he wanted to be with me. I then suddenly don't hear from him for two weeks and I thought it was intentional and when he came back and told me he broke his phone because he was drunk, I got absolutely livid and went off on him because I didn't know what happened to him and I was worried to death and thought I said something wrong. I didn't mean to, I really didn't and I feel god awful for it. I feel like an absolute piece of shit for it and I'm scared to death I might've hurt someone I cared about with all my heart. I just want to do nothing more than wrap him up in a warm blanket, hold him close, and give him his favorite kind of tea and tell him how absolutely sorry I am and that everything is going to be alright. I tried sending multiple messages to tell him how sorry I was and that he means so much to me and that I don't want to lose him. It's been almost a month now, and he hasn't been online and I haven't heard anything.

I tried getting others who I know he talks to to contact him for me, but nothing. No one has heard anything since June and I haven't even heard from him since late June, almost July. He hasn't replied to anyone who's messaged him and I've had other try messaging multiple times to see if maybe he was just mad at me and was ignoring me. He hasn't been online and I'm worried to death about him and I feel like it's all my fault. I feel like I did this to him and I hate myself for it. I'm scared to death something's wrong or that he decided he's done with me and doesn't want to deal with me anymore. I haven't been able to stop crying and I haven't slept very well in over a week and I don't even have the appetite to eat anymore. I feel so stupid for doing this to myself and for feeling this heartbroken over someone I haven't really talked to that long. He's helped me with so much without even realizing he has and he really even helped my depression get a little bit better. He gave me a reason to want to get better and something to look forward to. A reason to want to leave my situation and finally start my life over in a better environment and really push to better myself so I can give him absolutely as much care and love as I possibly can. I've talked to almost everyone I know about this situation and everyone is telling me that I should just forget about it but I don't want to and I can't. I want to wait for him to come back but I'm not sure if he ever will. I feel so heartbroken and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I cared about him so fucking much and I absolutely adored him with all my heart like I can't even describe how much this boy means to me. I can't even tell anymore if he's purposefully ignoring me or what's going on but I can't help but to blame myself for it thinking I did something wrong. I never meant to, I swear to God I didn't and I feel so unbelievably guilty for it. I can feel myself getting depressed again and I just want to complete isolate myself and not talk to anyone for a while. I feel so stupid. I want him to come back so bad.

385,"Throwaway account. Two years ago, I was shamed online for a really stupid reason. I won’t go into details, but it wasn’t really something I did as much as something someone I know did. Accusation was purposefully vague. Accuser admitted the only reason they were doing it is to see the person in question ruined, since they never told the full story publicly. Tried to reason with them to make them understand how they were acting wrong. Got caught in the drama and got the short end of the stick.

After the fact, most of my close friends turned their back on me, since they were more inclined to believe the allegations and gossip than the account I got from the accused themselves, or tried to justify it in some way or another.

I ended up having only a couple of people I could trust around me and having a significant loss of work and contacts. Been dealing with this in therapy for the first year, but I dropped it since my therapist was somewhat involved and I felt they weren’t objective anymore.

After all this time I still have a though time feeling good with myself. I have been in a loving relationship for a year and 3 months now. I got enough income to get by, although not enough to move out of my parents house. Freelancing is though sometimes, especially in this situation. Still, that’s the good part, but there’s plenty of problems.

I’ve lost all interest in pursuing creative endeavors. Feel like there’s no point, because I won’t be able to make a name for myself anymore, although that’s probably VERY inflated because the problem is somewhat localized. Regardless of that, my mind keeps telling me it’s pointless and keeps me in fear.

I used to be a very active member of my community and always had ideas for connecting with people and helping those who were interested in my field. I keep doing that in a small scale, but I don’t feel like it’s enough.

Lastly, if it served any purpose, I would try to apologize for anything. It was past any sort of negotiation from the start, sadly, since that’s my first choice in any misunderstanding, but these two years have proved me that there’s nothing I can do to stop those who want to see me ruined, even though it wasn’t my problem and I’ve stayed far away from anyone involved ever since the incident.

387,"Recently, my boyfriend told his friends that he has a long distance girlfriend (Me) and their reactions weren't what we expected. They weren't accepting of the relationship. They started talking about me a lot. Asking very personal questions like; ""How do you guys have sex?"" ""Do you guys sext?"". Or they either make fun that I'm some old guy pretending to be a girl. At first, I didn't take it too seriously because it's jokes which is completely fine in my book. A few weeks later, the questions wouldn't stop. My boyfriend would get questioned or teased every single day about our relationship. At some point, jokes get old and unfunny. They'd start to stress us a bit. They would invite me to iMessage group chats and ask me for nudes. They would insult me and ask me loads of questions which was really overwhelming. A week later, they'd spam my DM's with really rude stuff. They would harass me with facetimes and once I joined, they'd immediately troll me. 

I had enough at some point and asked them politely to  stop joking around because it was starting to cause me a lot of stress. They didn't take it well and started calling me a ""Bitch"" with a few of these sentenced ""I don't even know why they're together"" ""She doesn't deserve him"". It really hurt since I love my boyfriend very much and we've been together for a while now. 

I can't stop the harassment no matter what. I blocked them and yet they still manage to find me and STILL ask questions.

The fact that I have friends who I find are a lot more attractive than me doesn’t make it any better. I’ve talked to a few of my closest friends about it and they’ve been really sweet but there’s nothing they can say that can make me feel better, if anything, them telling me I’m ‘beautiful’ makes me feel even worse.

390,"So I know how this sounds, but please hear me out, I need some real thoughts with this. This is gonna be a LONG story. All the details are important though, so I'm not putting a TL;DR. This was originally supposed to be a Am I The Asshole Post, but posts involving rape weren't allowed there.

So back in high school, I was a part of a pretty messy friend group. In this friend group, there was the main friend that this post is about, (let's call her Sarah) and the guy she claims abused her (let's call him Scott). At one point in my life, I was quite close with both of them. However, once highschool came around, I started to drift away from everyone in the group, including them.

One day, everyone was hanging out at Sarah's house, and Scott was absent. This wasn't too surprising, as he had gotten sick of being around our group of friends and pretty much only hung out with his girlfriend. Later at night, Sarah sat down with us and told us that there was actually a different reason Scott was not present. She and Scott had done some sexual things together about a week prior.

Now I'm going to try to tell her story as accurately and detailed as I can recall.

So apparently Scott had messaged Sarah one day, and somehow ended up confessing that he had always felt attracted to her throughout their friendship. Not sure how it came up. Then, for the next week-ish, they proceeded to send explicit texts to each other. She told us he said things to her such as ""I've always wanted to fuck you so bad"" and ""I've always thought you were so hot"". Then one day he told her he was home alone, and he wanted her to come over. So she drove over to his house.

Sarah told us that the entire time she drove over to his house, she was hoping he'd call it off. She felt nervous and wrong for helping Scott cheat on his girlfriend of 1-2 years. But then she arrived and went inside. She then says that he grabbed her ass and they started kissing, etc. Then her shirt came off, his pants came off, and she gave him head. Sorry for the graphic detail, I just want this to be thorough so that all the context that I'm aware of is there.

I remember at this point, she made a joke about how fast he finished, and how funny he sounded while doing it. It became an inside joke between her and others in the group for a while. She also jokingly pointed to one of her boobs and said ""THIS has been in his hand"" and laughed. Weird, but people deal with situations in their own ways I suppose.

After Sarah gave Scott head, they were apparently going to have sex, or maybe she just thought they were, I can't quite remember. Either way, it didn't happen. According to her, Scott said something like ""wait wait... I can't do this."" It had something to do with the fact that he felt guilty and now didn't want to go any further than they already had. So he had her get dressed, and then she just kind of left awkwardly while he was just sitting there being sad and guilty.

So naturally, I was pretty shocked. I would've never imagined the two of them doing this. She went on to say that she felt guilty and wished it had never happened. She then went on to say that what he did was rape. She said Scott raped her.

Now with this, I was even more shocked and confused. Her justification for labeling this as rape was that Scott knew that by calling her hot and telling her how badly he wanted to have sex, he was ""feeding into her ego"". I remember those exact words. She said that constituted as sexual coercion, as his text messages were manipulative and took advantage of her ego.

After she said all this, everyone was silent. I remember her asking me how I feel about everything and I said something along the lines of ""gosh I don't know... I'm just trying to process it all. I can't believe he would do that."" She then said something like ""hmm ok... sorry I just thought you would be angrier. Like, I had this image in my head of you like going and fighting him or something. Idk it's probably stupid"". So that came off as weird to me. I'm not a confrontational person at all. I've never fought a person in my life. On top of this, it just seemed weird that she was hoping that by telling me this, I would try to find him and physically assault him. But whatever, I just let it go and shrugged. As all of our friends comforted her and told her she didn't need to feel sorry for what happened, that this was all his fault, that he was an awful person, that she was taken advantage of, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I just didn't feel that the events she had just described to me actually fit the description of rape or sexual abuse. And again, it came off as strange that she seemed to want this story to get some sort of angry and violent reaction out of me.

Now, don't get me wrong, I thought what Scott did was disgusting. Cheating on your girlfriend is awful. Objectifying women and using them for sex when you clearly never wanted any actual relationship with them is awful. He's was douchebag, and just an all around slimy dude. But calling someone a rapist is much different than a douchebag. Like I said, I was confused and shocked, so I just comforted Sarah for a while, and then made up an excuse to go home. The next day, I texted another one of the friends who was present when Sarah told her story. I asked this friend if she felt that the things Sarah said could be considered sexual assault or rape, and the friend said that she wasn't sure. She felt as though they both did things that were wrong. And I agreed. But was it rape? We felt maybe not.

So if the situation would've stopped here, I maybe could've moved past it and continued supporting Sarah. But it didn't. Sarah then proceeded to tell her allegations to as many people as she could at school. She told all of her friends and peers, even those who didn't know her very well. She also told his girlfriend, which obviously resulted in them breaking up eventually. She emailed every teacher that had a class with her and Scott in it, and asked to be seated away from him. I'm not sure if she went as far as telling the teachers about her accusations, but everyone in class definitely knew what was going on. Did I feel bad that almost everyone at school hated Scott? No. Did I think he deserved to be labeled as a rapist and potentially have his whole life ruined? Also no.

So a while later, I told Sarah I couldn't be her friend anymore. It should be noted, that this situation was one of MANY reasons that I wanted to stop being her friend. It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I won't get into the other reasons, as I don't want this post to come off as biased. I told her about all of the reasons I felt that our friendship was not a healthy one, including the fact that I felt she was wrongly labeling what her and Scott did as a rape, which could ruin his life. She said that I was wrong, that what he did was coercion, even if I felt like it wasn't. Since Sarah was sort of the ""leader"" of that group of friends, I pretty much lost all of the friends I had besides my girlfriend at the time. She was just all around popular in school, so it made me a bit sad to know she was probably now telling everyone bad things about me along with Scott. Despite this, I still felt that I made the right choice.

The reason I felt as though this wasn't coercion, is because nothing about what Sarah said sounded like Scott was pressuring her. According to Sarah, Scott didn't threaten her, he didn't guilt her, he didn't use some sort of leverage or power to make her feel as though she couldn't say no. He simply told her that he wanted to have sex with her and that she was hot, attractive, ect., and then she drove to his house and gave him head. And while she said that she was hoping he would call things off before she got to his house, she never actually TOLD him that. She never revoked her consent. And I get that just because someone doesn't say no, doesn't mean they're saying yes. However, if a girl texts you for a week about having sex, then drives to your house, knocks on your door, and starts making out with you and taking her clothes off, that seems about as consensual as it gets. On top of this, Scott didn't even know they were on bad terms until Sarah started telling everyone at school about him. This, again, shows that at no point did she indicate or tell him that she didn't want to do the things that they did. Not before, not after. As a matter of fact, HE was the one who eventually revoked consent and stopped them from going further.

It's also worth mentioning that I did cut Scott out of my life not long after I cut Sarah out of my life. I found out Sarah was not the only girl that Scott cheated on his girlfriend with, which is even more awful. I never heard Scott's side of the story about any of this, but I didn't really need or want to. All I knew is that it's awful to cheat on your girlfriend and objectify women, so there's not really any way that he could've spun it to make himself look like a good guy.

Fast forward to now, and I haven't talked to either of them in a few years. To be honest, I hadn't thought about the whole thing in a long time. And while I'm sure Sarah would say I'm not, I'm a huge believer and advocate for the Me Too movement. Now here's why I decided to post all of this. A couple days ago, my girlfriend posted something on her story about the Me Too movement and how we should believe victims, not silence their voices, etc. In case it isn't obvious, my girlfriend, who also knew Sarah, supported my decision to cut her and Scott out of my life. This means Sarah considers my girlfriend to also have ""betrayed"" her. Sarah then proceeded to tweet about how it really hurts her feelings that certain people claim to support the Me Too movement despite having sided with her abuser in high school. This was clearly aimed at my girlfriend.

Firstly, I think it's important to believe victims. As a matter of fact, I believe every word that came out of Sarah's mouth. Me believing her isn't this issue, it's the fact that I felt she was calling her situation something that it wasn't. Secondly, my gf has gone through sexual abuse herself, so for someone to imply that SHE doesn't care about victims was incredibly hurtful and made her feel awful. I told my gf that she shouldn't feel bad or discouraged, and that Sarah is just trying to hurt her and make her look bad. My gf is the best person I know, and if there is one thing I'm sure of, it's that she takes abuse and oppression of all people extremely seriously.

I used to be concrete in my belief that I made the right decision, and that what Sarah was doing was wrong, but a lot of friends in that group still to this day tell Sarah that she is completely right and that Scott is a rapist and that there is no denying that fact. I feel like I'm going crazy, as I know that Sarah is saying awful things about my gf and I, and it makes me so self conscious and flustered that I start to question everything and wonder if maybe I was wrong and just can't see it. But also, this is not the first time Sarah has managed to make me feel like I can't trust my own thoughts.

So that's why I'm here asking strangers on a website what their thoughts are. All I want in life is to be a good person who cares for others and makes the world a better place for those around me. If my response to Sarah makes me a bad person, then I want to fix it, or at the very least, admit my mistakes and better myself. I feel like I made the right decision, but maybe there is some sort of perspective out there that would disprove my feelings? Thanks in advance for any serious comments/advice.",04Aug2020,1

My family is very toxic, my parents argue all of the time and cheat on each other, my dad never involved me, but my mom allows me to know what she does, and I can’t tell my dad because I feel like I am betraying my mom. She constantly puts my dad down to me. Tells me what a terrible person he is. A few years ago, my mom was drunk, (she drinks a lot) and she was dragging my little brother by the shirt so I freaked out and screamed, “you’re choking him” and tried to grab him. She pushed me on to the couch really hard and kept pushing me and screaming at me. Telling me she wants me out of her house. (I was underaged) I ended up calling the cops because I was scared for me and my brother, my dad got home and told the cops he can handle it. My mom left with her sister (who was also drunk and also hit me), my dad was reassuring me that he wouldn’t allow her to come back. I had a bruise on my chest because of how hard she kept pushing me. The next day I wake up and she was here. My dad lied. Now tonight she was drunk again swimming in the back yard with my dad. (I was in my room playing a video game.) All of a sudden I heard banging on the front door, I throw my headset off and I get dressed when I hear, “Sheriff’s Department!” So I run to tell my dad. He allows my very intoxicated mother to answer the door and talk to them. They asked her to turn down her music and she flipped. She slammed the door in the cops face and went in our backyard screaming a bunch of racist things. Then comes inside looks at me and says, “Wake me up at 6AM.” I replied, “What If I’m asleep.” She looked at me and said, “If you don’t wake me up I’ll kill you, I swear.” So no matter how drunk or the situation she takes her anger out on me. I seriously just don’t know what to do. I don’t have a job, I have really bad anxiety I don’t enjoy being around people. I’m very scared. What do I do?",04Aug2020,1
397,"You're isolated, every person for themselves, you can't communicate in real life, only way to even hear your friend's voice is through electronics, wearing a mask is like you being born with it, people don't give a damn if you're there lying on the ground with a police pinning you down and people on the side with their phones recording everything, people don't give 2 fu*ks if you're their begging for help; why? Because they're scared. 
Scared they might get hurt, scared that their life will be gone if they even try to interfere, they might get killed, scared of the possibility of them being dead, scared of the thought of them being in that place where they are the ones being pinned to the ground. 
Now people are afraid of death but most people like people with depression wants to die, their mind and body wants them to die- suicide but their brain wants to live. See people are afraid of dying but they're also afraid of living, weird right?
But why ARE people depressed? Well for starters, it's either stress, abused, trust-issues, lost of someone dear to you, mentally abused, etc. But the biggest reason of all is because of these six letters, that becomes six words; what is this word exactly? It's called: 
S= Six
C= Cruel 
H= Hours
O= Of
O= Our
L= Life's
Yeah some of you , might be thinking: ""School is the main reason for depression? You're joking."" But I'm not, I bet that the people that are thinking that are adults, believes that school is wonderful place for education, we should be grateful for even being in school, bet some of you kids/teenagers reading this right now is agreeing with me, and some of you aren't; I know for a fact that you have heard this at least once in your lifetime, ""School is for your education, be grateful to be their so you can learn new things"" ""School's fun, you get to make friends, play and much more"" ""When you go to school you'll be smart and make mommy and daddy proud"". That's a load of B.S . Nearly nothing in that is true, why is a little of that true? Well most kids aren't happy in school, some kids aren't even having fun in school, some kids don't even have friends in school, some kids don't even understand what the teachers' saying but most teachers get fed up or straight up ignore them. Bullying, yeah I said it. Bullying/criticism is a very common thing, but it's even more common in school. Kids get verbally and physically abused by other kids, who am I kidding? Even teachers do it as well, your role models; the people who you were suppose to look up to.
High-school; some of you you'll reach a point in life where you go to High-school right? Well let me tell you something, that's where most suicides happens, no let me rephrase that; that's WHY most suicides happen. Because of stress, too much work, little amount of sleep, a big gap for socializing, freedom isn't valid, an increase in more stress because of pressure, I could go on and on but I think you get the idea. Everything you do in school is judge by letters, what are those letters? They're: A, B, C, D, F. And 'F' is worst one, when you get a 'F' you're considered a failure- a dropout, but that really shouldn't be put in kids/teenagers minds, instead of 'failure' what about 'Find-Another-Answer'. Find another answer to the question. Saying all this you're reading right now to teacher won't do much since all of this, isn't old news, they know these stuffs but they choose to ignore it, some of the teachers only wants their payments- money, and some of them are even 2 faced. School is a system that gives you education, not prepare you for life, does/did school teach you how to pay bills? Does /did school teach you how to get a job? Does/did school teach you how to by a house? No, school didn't teach you any of that. But that's not what school was meant for in the first place. 

I wish that I could change this world- make it a better place for humanity, but the truth is; does anyone have faith in humanity? People separate the bad from the good and the good from the bad, but we are all cut from the same cloth. 

We can save humanity, people have already came up with ways to save this world, invented new ways- new things. But the problem is will anyone take this seriously? 
They say they don't have time to save this world, it's already ruined. But that's a lie. They use it as an excuse to not change what they already know, people are not ready for change. What they are used to they want to stick to. But not all of us think the same. You have your own mind, think for yourself don't let others think for you. 

Imagine you living in this world.
Who am I kidding? We already are.

HI there! I'm nothing more than an 11 year old girl whose got nothing better to do than criticize this world and it's people in it. Feel free to send me hate because of this, I mean..If I criticized 7 billion plus people then I can definitely take being criticized, right?",04Aug2020,1
400,"Okay so some background, my boyfriend and me meant two months after I turned 18 and we’ve been dating ever since (it’s been six months) he purposed two months after we started seeing each other and were planning to marry in January, he had drug problems and legal problems in the past (all charges got dropped)  and my parents

402,"I'm trying to figure out if going back to school is worth it. This year I finally became a senior and with all the COVID stuff happening my school is delaying in person school and substituting for online classes. The dilemma is once the delay is over then we have a choice to continue online courses or go in person and still follow social distancing and wear masks. I don't know what to choose. My major issue is my mom and dad are both considered high risk and COVID would most likely kill them and I know for sure I couldn't live with that. Additionally my younger brother is going into 9th grade and online courses don't really work for him. On the other hand I miss my friends and my teachers. The way I dreamt of my senior year was school dances and senior pranks and really embracing my last year as a child, but instead I'll most likely miss out on all of that and instead get a not-so-special quarantine year. Quarantine has been really hard on me. My weekly schedule consists of waking up, eating, and then back to sleep. My life right now lacks anything to look forward to. Yes, school work can suck but at least with school work I get to laugh among friends and make memories that'll last forever. On the flip side I don't wanna expose my parents to COVID. For the entire lockdown we took the virus very serious and all that hard work would be for nothing if I just go to school and expose it to them. So, what do I do? Miss out on my last year or expose my parents?",04Aug2020,1
403,"I've been part of this gaming community for a couple years now. I've spent a lot of time on the game and it's gone through changes over the years. I really looked up to the game devs. Now all of a sudden rumors are flying about two of them being pedos.

 They're vehemently denying it. There is evidence being shown around but it might not be legit. The more people dug the more they found about the unscrupulous behavior of these devs.

 More allegations surfaced. The devs are ignoring any questions and banning anyone that asks. Some people are pulling all support for the game and leaving. Others are staunchly defending the devs.

404,"I think there’s someone breaking into my apartment when I’m not home. Nothing is missing or seems out of place.

I started thinking about small incidents, put them all together:

So, my apartment balcony is on the first floor and it’s facing a busy street. Earlier this year, a lot of people who are living out of their cars started parking on this street. Some of them have been breaking into apartments to find vacant ones they can sleep in. I honestly didn’t think much of it bc we make it clear that there’s someone living here and we haven’t had any issues.

So a couple weeks ago, my mom was tending to her little balcony garden and she complained that she found cigarette butts all over the ground. We both assumed it was the upstairs neighbor flicking it on our porch and brushed it off. 

another occurrence is sometimes when I come home, there’s a strong smell of cigarettes in the bathroom. I just find it so weird, because no one in my apartment smokes. I told myself that maybe it was the next door neighbors smoke seeping through the walls. But when I think about it, I don’t even know if they smoke or not? Considering they’re an elderly couple with a good amount of health issues.

Fast forward to today. I’m at work and my mom calls me sounding worried. She said she found the balcony door unlocked and she didn’t go out there for the past couple days. Then she said that she found cigarette butts right in front of the door. She’s the one that planted the idea in my head that someone is coming in when we’re either sleeping or not home. If this is true, it doesn’t make sense because nothing of value is missing, our food isn’t missing either. 

I guess the advice I’m asking for is, how can I be sure? How can I catch them? Or am I being paranoid?",04Aug2020,1
405,"Thank you in advance. 


Some background; I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years (relevant later). I have a group of friends that I have known ~10 years.

They arent my only friends, as I made friends in college and in the working world yadda yadda but we all kept in touch and somehow stayed pretty close. However, as time has gone on, I started to really only ever hang out with 2 of them one on one, and only see the others when it’s all of us getting together (not super rare as we all live in the same city still). The good times generally outweighed the bad though, so I never really felt the need to do anything drastic. Over the past few years though, I begun to feel like more and more of an outsider in the group. 

I’m all for roasting each other in a friend group, and it was something we did/do commonly. Anyone can get shit on; no one was safe but it was all in good fun. But over the past year or so in particular, all of their jokes at my expense have changed. They aren’t the same open air roasts anymore. Now their jokes about me are made in some esoteric way amongst themselves, in front of me but without outwardly addressing it or including me. Anytime I question it, they either don’t explain or address it, or they write it off with pretty loose logic like it’s some super obscure reference. Despite it being clearly and directly relating to something I just did, said, etc., in a way that’s obviously situationally specific. I’m not confrontational, so I usually just let it go. But lately these jokes are accompanied by an overwhelmingly obvious sense that they’re based off prior private conversations they’ve had about me. It’s as if the jokes have common themes, and that there’s some sort of group consensus or something.

As part of my ongoing struggle with depression and anxiety, I often find myself overthinking like crazy. That being said, although social situations make me incredibly anxious, I have always been weirdly socially observant and surprisingly, a lot of times I’ve actually been correct in the conclusions I draw. 

I lost my job and apartment bc of COVID, and that amongst a few other things this year has really beaten me to a dark place, in terms of my mental health. As a method to finally address both my worry about my deteriorating mental health as well as these inside jokes about me, I opened up to one of the two friends I’m still close with from the group. It was really tough to outwardly address my ongoing struggle with my mental health, and it took a lot for me to open up like that as I’m very closed off with that stuff. But it’s been months since that talk and nothing has changed, we haven’t talked about it since, and it’s basically as if it didn’t even happen. 

I’ve already started to distance myself from them, bc this new shit that’s going on honestly doesn’t make me want to hang out with them, and often times leaves me feel like shit when I do and overthinking like crazy afterwards. 

I can’t keep ignoring these jokes or going along with the paper-thin rationales behind them. Of course I don’t want to cut off any long time friends bc I’m in a state of overthinking and paranoia fed by the particularly challenging climate we’re currently in, but this all has me really questioning our friendships, and makes me feel like total shit about myself. Especially when I’m already really struggling with my mental health. 

Any advice?",04Aug2020,1
407,"Hi, I’ve recently moved out for the first time to a house that seemed ok at first.

First time it was because I forgot to indicate when pulling in for a parallel park, second time it was right at the end of my test and the instructor believed I was driving too close to another vehicle, and just today I failed because I rolled through a stop sign instead of coming to a complete stop. 

I feel really upset because I know I’m a good driver and I’m only making these errors because I’m so nervous around the instructor. I’m way more relaxed and in control when driving with my family. My next test is tomorrow, any advice? I’m really scared I won’t pass again because it just seems like such minor errors that I don’t even really think twice about that are costing me my license.

411,"I was not very tall freshman and sophomore year, but junior year I grew really fast and got very tall. This led to a few kids bullying me for being very skinny, (I was normal before, but the rapid growth combined with me not eating more led to me being very skinny). This made me very angry and mid junior year I got into lifting. 2.5 years later, I am jacked, tall, very confident and happy, yet I have this anger deep down that makes me feel sick and weak when I think about it. If I was to see those guys randomly now I would probably go start something and beat the shit out of them, but chances are I will never see them again. I am genuinely a very nice guy but I just can’t feel content until I “get revenge” per se. I Don’t really want to punch them or anything, I just want to humiliate them and push them around a bit. This feeling is not healthy for me and I just want to forget. If anyone had any advice as to how I can get over this it would be much appreciated.

413,"i moved into this apartment a month ago, and the listing specifically said dogs and/or cats were allowed. she is a very clean person, as am i. however, shes been getting more and more strict with me having a cat as time goes on. she doesnt like him leaving my room because he gets cat hair in the kitchen (every night i wipe everything down before i go to bed to mitigate this). she prefers keeping him locked up in my room when i am at work (perfectly fine), however she even wants this to happen when i am home. ie: my cat has this tiny tiny room to live in and is rarely allowed to leave. i pay rent here (800$ out of 1200$ total for the apartment). she asks me to sweep and mop all common areas(living room, kitchen, dining room, hallway etc.) every week, and she does not alternate. at one point she was so adamant about my cat not leaving my room that she?? said she was going to take money out of my deposit to pay for a screen door for the kitchen. which is absolutely ridiculous???? the only other place i have ever lived was with my abusive mother so i dont have context for what healthy boundaries are and if im being taken advantage of or if im just complaining here. however, she specifically stated it was ok to have a pet and now everything shes doing is telling me otherwise. i pay pet rent, deposit, etc etc etc. i never convinced her to let me have a pet, she willingly agreed off the bat. do i leave and find another place to rent? do i talk to her about this??

He then calls me a slur word for African Americans and I questioned him to try to see if he was just pressing buttons or wanted to be aggressive and he responded with “Yea you asian ——” At this point I started to get mad and things got heated and I told him to watch it. He then said “What are you gonna do? Stab me with your little knife you’re like 20 years old” cause I carry a knife on me and the tab was sticking out of my pocket. At this point I was livid I grabbed my waist band and I replied with “I’ll shoot you I got nothing to lose, how about you?” This was showboating but he couldn’t tell. He then got scared and started to walk away. I approached him and yelled in the store “You wanna throw down? You’re like 35 years old harassing people” He was in the corner by the cashier scared and had nothing to say besides saying “You know yelling is yelling from fear” and I just smiled at him and laughed and said “Yea?” I was ready to throw down but I’m not sure how others would of acted if a situation like this happened.

We both still live with our parents. I was a troubled teen. I scored really well but used to talk to a lot of random boys when I was a teenager. Ever since then, I don't talk to boys that are creepy. I only have a couple of good friends who I talk to on an everyday basis. I'm in med school now and score well on my tests. I have an online friend who I met through a game. We've known each other for some time now. They're in med school in another country. We talk about random stuff and also share our notes. I recently added them on my Whatsapp. My family is against the idea of me having online friends. My brother goes through my phone every once in a while. So I was talking to my friend the other day and he said ""I \*\*\*\* you"". He meant to say I jinx you (it's a joke related to a game we play). So I replied with ""Wait, that sounded wrong"" because I didn't get the reference at first, and we started laughing. He said that in his chat, it only showed 2 asterisks. So I had to send him a screenshot because on my chat, it showed 4 asterisks. I forgot to delete the screenshot. My brother saw it and got mad. He hasn't been talking to me since then. 

I have no idea what to do. I hate when my brother's mad and I've probably made him think that I haven't changed a bit. But I have. I also didn't tell him about my online friend and that's my fault. What can I do to make this situation normal? Thanks!",04Aug2020,1
419,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit but it’s worth a try.

I’m 14(f).

Lately, for several weeks, I haven’t had an appetite. I’ve skipped lunch and dinner because I didn’t want to eat, because it felt like I was full. It’s like this. For other people, your stomach feels empty, and feel hungry. There’s almost this open feeling that makes you want to consume things. But for me, I feel empty but it’s like a closed feeling, if that makes sense. Kind of like the tight feeling in your throat/chest when you’ve eaten too much and don’t want to consume more. I will feel powerless and my body will feel weak but I still won’t feel hungry, and I’ll still have that closed feeling.

I’m not trying to not eat. I actually want to eat, I just can’t.

I’m not sure why this is happening. I’ve been struggling with depression for three years, but I’ve never encountered this kind of thing. Nothing is really stressing me out right now. Another guess is quarantine. Maybe being stuck at home for months is driving me a bit crazy, haha.

421,"Every day I get up and sit at my laptop to begin work at 08:30. I open it up, go through my usual routine. Check emails. Check relevant articles. Check my to-do list. And then I stop.

As soon as I get to the point when I need to do work, it is like I can do no more or go any further. I think it might be because I have completely lost my passion for what I do. Working from home for the past, what, 4 months (?), has definitely hit my productivity but I think the rot started around 6 months earlier when steadily my enjoyment of my work drifted further and further away. I feel that the work environment itself is all that then kept my head above water, having no option but to knuckle down.

When it comes to straightforward quick jobs, I can still do those. However, as soon as I have to turn to long-form projects that require high levels of interest and focus I just don't know what to do. I don't want to do them and I am unable to motivate myself to do otherwise. It wasn't always this way.

I know that this is, frankly, quite pathetic and that I am essentially taking advantage of my workplace's relaxed attitude but eventually I am going to have to up my game or face up to the fact that this sort of work might not be. But then, what sort of work will be? I've already changed career once since I left university, I can't keep jumping around hoping to find a job I can tolerate.

If I could choose, I would seclude myself for a while. Move back to the countryside from where I come, get a dog and focus on my writing (creative writing is my current hobby) doing some low-paid work to pay my rent and basic living costs. But this is a fantasy, to do this would be to move away from my friends, cut off my current lifestyle and take a huge gamble on a talent that I might not have enough of. Perhaps I should test the water, book a few weeks off, stay with my parents and dedicate that time to my writing. Or, maybe, this will pass. Yet, even if it does I will remain in the unenviable position of a job in a field that pays little until you reach the top yet is highly competitive. If I stay on this course I am doomed to remain in a small house or apartment for most of the next decade in a city where rents are extremely high making little progress towards any state of real happiness. This is the sad reality of city life, it locks you in a stasis where your youth is extended much longer than it should be and your work has to become your sole occupation, if I lived where I grew up, on an equivalent (but lower) salary I would already be able to buy a house. Here, that is many years away.

I'm just ranting now. It is very difficult to describe my mood. What do you think Reddit, will it pass? Am I being delusional? Do I really have anything to do other than to 'Keep Buggering On'? If so, my worry is that time after time I will return to this mood where I don't feel like I am doing the right thing with my life.

I don't know, I don't know what answers I expect, just observations I suppose.",04Aug2020,1
422,"Alright so, a bit of context.

I'm m20, in my second year of university, and my twin sister is in her first year of university. 

Due to corona, my sister struggled to focus fully during the semester and as a result, she's struggled a lot with her exams. She's gotten really low grades in everything as of now, although she studied 24 hours every day to the point of not doing anything else at all. This coming Sunday, she has an exam at the same time as me.

This exam will be her second and final session (try) for an exam she already failed (40/100). So, if she doesn't pass this it will be really bad. And unfortunately, even the 40 was with my help, so you can imagine how bad the situation is in this course.

On the other hand, this year has gone really well for me. All of my grades are 87+ and Sunday is meant to be my last exam, which I'm already prepared for.

Thing is, I have the option of not doing my exam and waiting for the second session to do it instead, which will be in exactly a month. It's just that I worked really hard to make sure I finish my exams all on the first try and just not have anything to stress about. So doing this will literally mean not doing an exam I'm 100% ready for to help my twin. She isn't expecting this of me and didn't even mention it as a possibility, but it's obviously the only way for her to actually pass and not fail the course. 

 I just don't know what to do. I don't want to sacrifice my own exam for her, but at the same time, I feel like a bad person for thinking of that possibility. It's just that I've seen how hard she's been studying for the past month and a half, and how every time she still didn't get a decent grade. she's literally doing the maximum and getting the bare minimum.

I'm wanting to buy a TV from this local one man electronics store with basically no reviews or much history of any kind. They were established in late March of this year. Now I've had my fair share of dealing with scammers but the website they have is particularly well made and their inventory is impressive. 

I'm going down to the shop in person before I make any purchasing decisions. I'd like to support a local business especially during these hard times. But just in case, what could I do if I'm sold some piece of junk? What steps should I take to protect myself?",04Aug2020,1
425,"My partner [F20] and I [M24] have been together for a year now. We're also engaged (As of a month ago).

We moved in together a few months ago. A few days ago she discovered I had been watching porn still. And often as well. 1-2 times a week. I've also spent $100 on OnlyFans in the last 12 months. (Used 4-5 times)
When she discovered I had still been watching porn she was furious that I had lied for 12 months. She would always ask me if I was still watching it and I would always say no, because I knew it was wrong, but instead of telling the truth I would lie.
She said ""We're done"" and then came home an hour later saying she was willing to forgive me as long as I was willing to change. Which I am. I love her so much, and I know you'll read this right now thinking ""no you don't if you did what you did"" but I really do. 

The next day she then discovered my Onlyfans activity after I let her comb over my phone &amp; bank records. She claimed that's worse than watching porn, which I can now see yes, it is. Paying to see people's photos and videos. She is so heartbroken that I've lied again &amp; again. Even when she found out and I tried to smooth over some of the details, when I should have just have been forward. She thinks everything I've ever said is a lie. I've always meant the nice things I say about her. 

I can admit, I'm slightly addicted to watching porn and masturbating. I've been doing in since I was 13. Basically everyday until the last year or two when It moved to about once or twice a week. It's habit and routine almost. Sometimes It's not even that I'm horny, I'm just hard and to make it go down I smash one out sometimes. (Sorry for the graphic detail)

I've admitted to her that I have a problem, and I've betrayed her and broken her trust &amp; heart. And I've said sorry. Which isn't enough. I know I need to be so open with her now. And almost start fresh. Day 1. I knew what I was doing was wrong deep down. Yet I still did it. 

After all this she said she's still willing to forgive me, if I can change &amp; get help. Which I'm willing to do. But the guilt of what I've done to her is hurting me so bad. I feel guilty that she wants to stay with me, because I feel like she deserves better. I know I can change for her. I've already changed other habits of mine for her. But I know she has a big heart but at what cost? I'd feel so bad if she stayed with me out of pity and was never truly happy. And yes I want to stay with her. Am I being selfish by not letting her go to find someone that will treat her like a princess? Because I know she won't be able to let me go if that's what needs to happen. I'm very confused and depressed. And so is she. 

She's even saying now she wants to join Onlyfans and sell her body because she wants the money. As soon as we 'Broke up' as well she downloaded Tinder and messaged a guy she used to talk to. She said she was actually going to stay at his the night she found out about the porn watching and probably have sex with him. And I get maybe yes all she wanted was a nice guy, for some good sex, and she was upset and confused. But also I feel like my warning bells are ringing. Because I 100% believed that it was over, that she was going off to do what she said. But deep down does she want it to end? Or is she just being rash?

Anyway my question is, Is it selfish that I still want to be with her, even if it might make her life unhappy? I want to change, and work things out, and hopefully one day she's happy but I'm finding it hard to see if she will ever be again with me.

I appreciate anyones thoughts.",04Aug2020,1

433,"Obligatory sorry for bad formatting i’m on mobile and this is my first time on this sub. 

Some necessary background is that my mom and many of my extended family on my mom’s side has a serious history with addiction especially to alcohol. Recently, maybe 3 years ago (when I was 12) my parents finally told my sibilings and I about my mothers alcoholism after my mom relapsed and she went to rehab. While she is still sober of alcohol I have started to notice some new things. She often leaves the room or disappears for 10 or 15 minutes at a time, many times going outside. When this happens she is always very dismissive. Another strong signal is that her breath and clothes and car have started to wreak of cigarettes. I even saw her smoking once last year but I was too scared to confront her. Frankly I still am. I have also found her lighters in the laundry and seen a pack of cigarettes in her purse on more than one occasion. I have no doubt that she actively smokes. Both her and my dad used to smoke but quite when they had kids. As far as i’m aware my dad or siblings don’t know she smokes. Sorry this was a long build up. I want to confront my mom about her smoking as it’s terrible for her health and she has spent so much of her life fighting addiction I don’t want her to start the rabbit hole all over again especially in these challenging times. I’ve been so scared to talk to her about it and I have no idea in what I would even say or steps I would take after confronting her.

I am a 27(M) and I met a 25(F) from work and we have been ""sort of friends"" (we have feelings for each other) for a while now, to a point where I can say we are besties since we talk about anything and never had any awkward moments between us.

There was a time when she would stop responding to my calls and texts for like 3 weeks and then one day she would call me to apologise for ignoring me. She said she was busy thinking about things and that she was ignoring other people too but that's not true because I am friends with her best friend as well and I have asked her.

After we restarted talking again and when things seems like it's going back to normal she did it again, but this time she ignored me for 2 months and like before out of the blue she called me and apologise. We talked for a long time on the phone and she told me she has started seeing someone after joining a dating website. She told me I am her friend and she wants to keep me in her life but after a few days of texting and calling she is ignoring me yet again. It seems to me now that she's in a relationship there is no place for me.

437,"After Breaking up with my ex, I've been in a trench of loneliness. This Covid quarantine makes it even worst. I remember the times where I can stay in my room, play single player games , make music on my own and stray from social media easily. But after this heartbreak, I've been so used to having someone to talk to for 24/7 and while I'm driving, waking up, sleeping.

I know I have friends to go to and family. But for some reason, though they tell me that they're there for me and that they love me. For some reason, this loneliness is hitting different. I feel a sense of void in my heart and it hurts when I'm just sitting in my room, trying to enjoy the things I used to before the relationship. I hate the feeling of nights when I'm alone in my room and the thoughts of ""I don't want to wake up tomorrow"" pops into my head. I catch myself looking back at old instagram photos and listening to music I used to like.

I know I'm only 20 and older people will tell me that life will get better or that you're still young, but for some reason, I feel like I'm wasting my youth and that after losing someone I loved and got super lucky with, the odds of making memories and finding love in the future seems hopeless...

439,"Hello, i really need some advices so i would be glad if you'd help me, i'm helpless.

I'm a 13 year old girl from a little country in the middle of the Europe named Slovakia and i live here for my whole life. My mother is also a 100% Slovakian. However, my dad is 100% Turkish. 

When it comes to religion, our family is really a mess. My mom was raised by a family which was neither Christian or Atheist and every member is looking on religion differently. My uncle, mom's brother happened to be a Christian after he became an adult, he started to go to the church every week and even get on baptism. My grandma and my mother are neither Christians or Atheists, they don't go to the church, aren't baptised, haven't got any sign of being Christians, but they believe in God and Jesus, just in their way and beliefs. 

My dad was raised by a common Muslim family, every member of the family is a Muslim. When he got to the Slovakia, before i was born to meet my mom, he was such a strong Muslim. He was praying every day 5 times and just... being a strong Muslim. After a while of being in Slovakia, he kind of lost his strong beliefs. Now he's a Muslim, however, there are no mosques or just places to be a Muslim. Also, now he's still praying, but not 5 times of a day. But when it comes to other rules like no pork or no alcohol, he's still very strict about that.

I'm not sure what my parents planned me to be when my mom was pregnant, but i honestly think they didn't get to do a serious discussion which is a big mistake. So all my life they didn't learn me anything about Christianity  or Islam. From when i was born i was identified 'without religion'. My parents gave me a Turkish name, i had a Turkish surname, so living in Slovakia with that is not really easy. People often had prejudices about me before they get to know me and I was just never able to be a normal Slovakian girl any second. When I was in my first few grades, some older boys were always screaming at me by my name and doing fun of me. In school some of teachers have sometimes not really nice things to say as well. Like bruh, telling on every lesson that I have a super hard name or staring at me when talking about how Turkish people killed people or stole children from families here to make soldiers from them in the past is not really helping me to feel good in school. I felt so uncomfortable, expecially when we were learning about 'how cruel Turks were' on history or even learning a poem about 'cruel Turks' on literature.

Lucky for me, i have friends and I am so glad for them. Not too many, but they are enough for me. But I changed the theme too much, let's continue about the religion. 

When I was little, i didn't cared much about religion. It was never a theme or a talk in our home so I never actually get to know what is it about. However, my dad never allowed me to eat pork and he's only doing few excuses till today, which i don't understand since they DIDN'T RAISED ME AS A MUSLIM. That was before i got to school. I met one girl who changed my life, my best friend to this day, more then 7 years now. She is a strong Christian and she's a very amazing person. I learned what Christianity is because almost every kid in our class is Christian and they attend on Religion class. I, as a non religion person attended on Ethics since 1st class. Since there are not many people, few  classes are getting together and i feel uncomfortable as possible there till today since all the kids there are so mean and rude.

I had an issue with not being able to eat pork because in Slovakia there are so many foods with it. I had a lunch at school and they were always putting pork in the food so i was eating just a bit always and being hungry then. So in 3rd grade, my dad allowed me to eat pork but only in school and it's like this till today. Plus he never ever let me to come to the church. The only excuse was when my uncle had a wedding. I WAS IN CHURCH ONE TIME IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

Things were the same till i was maybe 11 years old. Then i started to thing about religion more often and I became to wonder what I will be in the future. Muslim, Christian?... Atheist? No, no, since i was a little kid i believed in God even when my parents never learned me to. It was impossible for me to be an Atheist and it is till today. But... what am I supposed to be? Honestly, i rather to be a Christian. I have nothing against Islam and i never had. But i live in a Christian country, have Christian friends and only religion I know something about so I can relate it's Christianity. 
So when i was about 11 or 12 years, i started to secretly PRAY AS A CHRISTIAN. I never told ANYONE and I was so scared that someone will find out it, expecially my dad. I was praying like a normal Christian since i watched my friends to do that before sleep at trips from school. 

I am praying like this till today and no one knows about that so I'm glad. I am not able to go to church because my dad will never allow me to till I'm just a kid so I can't become a Christian. Now, I'm not wanting to become a Chirstian because i live in Christian country but because i find out that i can relate to this religion the best, it really suits me and I love God and Jesus, for real. But i'm so scared to even think about telling my parents something like this, expecially my dad. I'm so scared that he would hate me after that because he never really liked Christianity and avoided me from it. I often cry at night about this. I just can't live without a full religion till I'm an adult, it's too long for me and I'm suffering since I beg to believe in something. God is helping me to get through really hard situations and I don't want to be that kid without religion anymore.

People, please give me advices. I don't know what to do at all and i'm really helpless and giving up. I though about suidice many times because i have many problems not only this but i still try to remember that God loves me and it's bad to do such a thing like suidice. Please write your opinions on my situation and give me some help. I would be so glad.

This year I began college (high school).
I made some friends they were already a tight knit group of five, but accepted me as one of them. Recently one of the girls has stopped talking to me ...because I did something to her? Another of my friends opened up and told me what they REALLY thought of me and everything they had said about me... it wasn’t pleasant. The next day she attacked me (physicaly) and left me to. I finally confronted them on it, they had the audacity to act innocent. I cried and screamed at them. Than they ask me why I had punched the friend who told me about them ind the head,shoulder, and stomach. I was confused at first but upon figuring it out broke down sobbing.

All of that said, he’s one of the kindest human beings I’ve ever met and he’s an incredibly gifted song writer. We write music together often and it’s been a goal of ours to finish an album since we were 10. His grandpa owns a ranch in the middle of nowhere and I know he can’t help himself so I’d thought I’d bring up the both of us moving out there to get away from everything and work on music for a year or so. I’d go to get away from the toxic and unhealthy lifestyle I’ve developed and to put myself somewhere to heal and work on what I really love in life with one of my closest friends. I think it’d make our friendship what it’d used to and it would let us heal emotionally.

I love her so I’m not leaving her, besides if we’re really keeping it I don’t want this kid to grow up without a father. I was considering committing suicide but for that main reason I can’t. I don’t have a job, I don’t have a license, I haven’t even finished school.

And I guess we are keeping it so I’m more fucked than a chained up dog about to get wiped out by a tsunami. I’m mostly worried about how We’d raise this fucking kid considering I don’t have a job or anything.

But I’m also fucked because my dad and sister would fucking kill me. They literally said they would if I ever got my gf pregnant. I wouldn’t be surprised if my dad beat me again and kicked me out the house. As for her parents her mum supports her but blames me (which is more than fair ngl) and I haven’t met her dad yet and when he finds out god knows what’ll happen to the both of us.

I’m really anxious about getting a job and license too because I have pretty bad social anxiety and depression. I’m just not prepared for a job because my anxiety hits hard when I’m under pressure and makes me make irrational decisions or no decision at all which I know makes me unreliable and is bad for being a good employee.

447,"I am in kind of a tricky situation, and want outside opinions because I am bad at recognizing when I am being mistreated. 
Ever since I got a boyfriend last year, I feel like my best friend can’t stop being mad at me, and now we live together. I’ve talked to her about it before, and she says it’s just her being jealous and that she’s fine, but then whenever my boyfriend comes over, she completely ignores him and won’t even face him, and that’s if she leaves her room when he’s over. As you can imagine, this makes a weird tension for everyone, and comes off as really possessive to me. He has never done anything wrong to her either of course, because they never speak. 
I have also been noticing more things that she does that bother me, because I am becoming less of a doormat and less tolerant of poor treatment. For example, she always talks over me, or tells me to stop talking so that she can say something. Plus, when I’m speaking, it seems like she’s not even listening, just waiting for her turn. Also, she takes everything so personally that I feel like I can’t do anything without her thinking it’s rude or I’m mad at her. For example, I was in my room unpacking boxes (with my door closed to keep my cat inside) and she was like “why are you being so hot and cold with me? I feel like I did something wrong because you’re in your room with your door closed”. Like am I crazy?? Or is this manipulative? Another example is when I tell her about something I did with my boyfriend (because she asks me to), she gets upset and doesn’t talk. Or, even worse, she’ll judge me for it. Like I told her I tried a certain drug (bc I am personally comfortable with that and know my limits) and then she used that against me to invalidate my thoughts later, saying I only think that because of “all the drugs I’m using”. She uses the excuse that she has anxiety and stuff, which is valid because I also have anxiety and stuff, but at a certain point I don’t think that’s a valid excuse anymore. I know it’s impossible to tell just by this short description, but what do you think? Does this sound manipulative, or am I just reading too much into things? I’m thinking of talking to her about it, but I don’t want to be insensitive so I’m not sure what the best thing(s) to say would be. I am horrible at communicating and reading feelings.

I’m just not sure how much longer I can take my parents emotional abuse and it’s getting harder to hide my feelings and pretend everything is fine. 

TLDR: Idk if I should move out and save my sanity OR stay at home &amp; save my money for after covid",04Aug2020,1
450,"Bit of a preface:

I (21m) have been shaving my chest since I started growing hair there around the age of 15. I’ve always hated the look and been uncomfortable with the feeling of it’s growth so I’ve never given it the chance to fully grow out. I also have to shave my arms (not forearm) and back hair because it’s just gross.

It’s a pain having to shave it all the time but I feel it looks better. I have a lean shape and am fairly toned so I like my chest and abs to be visible. The only reason I’ve really considered not shaving is because I have a beard which I always keep trimmed short because long beard hair is just as disgusting as chest hair imo, but I was wondering if the bearded look would be complemented by a bit of chest hair.

Sorry if this is a dumb question I just get really bad body dysphoria sometimes if I let it grow and feel disgusting, but it also feels kinda feminine if I do shave it so I don’t really feel like I win either way. Any thoughts?",04Aug2020,1

She came out as a transman yesterday and that caused her boyfriend to break up with her because he was straight but now she's in a very depressive mood and she told me everything on how she tries to kill herself everyday. She might have borderline personality disorder but right now me and her both agreed that her rough past has caused it and not gender dysphoria.

452,"I’m not sure how I can live like this. I’ve been excessively washing my hands, up to 50 times a day. I’ve been living at home during this whole thing and I just turned 18 a few months ago and I will be going to university for the first time in two weeks. It’s been about 140 days since the pandemic began and I’ve only left my house 5 times, one of which I didn’t even leave the car. Still, each time I got homes I showered immediately.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve also started cleaning my phone multiple times a week (sometimes more than once in a day)... Even though I don’t leave my home. I know it’s irrational. To make it clear, I live with two other people and they are very careful with the pandemic. Still, I have urges to wash my hands even when they are obviously clean.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve discussed this in therapy (I do therapy through video) and I’ve discovered that this is a control / power issue that has to do with deeper, unaddressed problems in my life. My therapist even said that maybe when I go to university I wouldn’t be like this because I would have more control over my life (not stuck living at home). I wonder if the fact that I’ll have roommates will make it difficult, though. I really need privacy and I’ll be sleeping in the same room as someone in two weeks. I’ve been texting my roommates for over a month btw.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, back to the hand washing issue. It’s like my urges to wash my hands have evolved because I want to wash my hands even when I don’t leave my house. Even when I am not afraid of washing my hands because of the virus, I am not afraid in general. It’s not even necessarily a “fear”, more of an urge to wash my hands to satisfy myself or something.

&amp;nbsp;

My therapist says I could have OCD, which is honestly possible I guess. It is like I am compulsively obsessed with this and it’s definitely a disorder. It has affected my quality of life for all of these months. Between everything I do (and I mean everything) I wash my hands because I feel like I have to. If I touch a drawer in the kitchen or the microwave, I wash my hands immediately and then wash again if I touch another thing. The only place in the house I don’t feel the urge to wash my hands is my bedroom.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone have experience with this problem / a similar problem? Can anyone help me with some possible advice? I can’t live like this. Plus, I’m going to university in two weeks.",04Aug2020,1
454,"For the past almost year now, I’ve been living in a run-down camping trailer in my friend’s backyard, I was off and on with college, and struggling a lot financially and to this day I’m still struggling. Yet at the start of this year I met a blessing in my life, and we started dating. 
The catch is is that this person lives in another state, and their living situation won’t allow me to move in with them. Things have been going fantastic in our relationship, we built some really good foundations and haven’t had any serious issues. We’re working through past trauma together and I see myself with this person in the next few years as well. 
My life right now is one that I’m ready to make any big changes I need to to get out of this slump. I’m unemployed, I’ve been looking for a job yet it feels like I’m pulling teeth to find employment in a limited area in the middle of a pandemic. 
So here’s where the advice I need comes in. 
I want to be out of this trailer by October, since I feel I’ve over-stayed my welcome, and my friends have been patient with me after I lost my job due to COVID (and other issues regarding employer harassment but that’s a whole other story.) I can just tell my friends want me out by now. And I really don’t want to go through another winter of living in a camping trailer with poor insulation and no heating.
My overall goal is to move to the town my significant other is living in, where it’s a much larger place with so many new opportunities and affordable housing. I know I will be happy there, especially since I’d be a few minutes away from my partner instead of hours. 
I estimate I would need $3,000 to move in total. This should cover expenses for travel, and a down payment plus first month’s pay on an apartment. And plus some for food until I get my first paycheck on whichever job I apply for. 
What I need advice on is how I can best go about getting this $3,000. I’m not giving up on getting a physical job, I already have a Fiverr open for writing related gigs, and I’m currently waiting on approval for unemployment. 
I’ve already sold a bunch of my video games to pay for my phone bill, I don’t have anything else I could sell. 
I’m just desperate for a change at this point, so any advice on how to quickly get this sort of money would be wonderful. 
Anything anyone has to offer would be wonderful. I’m just kinda lost at the moment. 

TLDR; I’m unemployed, pretty much homeless, and unable to get a job. I want a fresh start in another state. I just need advice on how to make money [$3,000] for this fresh start to improve my life for the better.",04Aug2020,1
455,"My husband (30M) and I (30F) just had a baby about a month ago. He also graduated residency about 2 months ago. 

I wanted to throw a small graduation shindig at our house (I was severely pregnant at this time, but graduating residency is a big deal and I didn’t want him to have no celebration at all). This would include just both our parents and siblings - not only bc I was severely pregnant, but also due to the pandemic, it was best to limit people. Well, my husband and his mom both insisted we invite his aunt, otherwise she would be offended. His aunt is pretty close to them and treats them like a second mother. However, it just wasn’t feasible - I was diabetic in addition to pregnant and didn’t feel comfortable inviting his aunt plus husband and two sons. We ended up canceling the party due to the politics of this. 

Now my in laws want to host a small get together to celebrate our baby being 40 days old (cultural celebration). I thought it was cute and was excited at the idea of a small get together since quarantine has been miserable. Again, my mother in law INSISTED we invite my husband’s aunt. However my husband and I established way before this that our baby wouldn’t meet extended family until he had his first set of vaccines at least, and ESPECIALLY in the pandemic we wouldn’t let the baby see extended family for a while. And we ended up having to cancel this party too. 

I find it really frustrating my husband’s family keeps revolving our entire plans around this one aunt. And she’s very dramatic and takes things personally so everyone is worried of offending her. But it’s not fair to have so many plans canceled because of her. And for the record I’m also very close to my uncles and aunts but acknowledge sometimes we want to have intimate family gatherings of IMMEDIATE family only. 

Is there any solution to this, or am I doomed to forever be tied to her coming to events even when we want just parents and siblings?",04Aug2020,1
456,"Hi there. I am a 20yf and I have this super Karen as a neighbour. She is living in the apartment over us and is getting worse and worse and I can't figure out what to do. 
She has already called the police on my stepdad several times because he speaks most of the time loudly. He works in the main production of VW and in these halls its very loud. He got a hear damage from working there over 30 years now but to her he always abuses me and my mum when he raised his voice. I am lucky she didn't complained about my mum yet but I am her target and I don't know why and what to do. 
She is sending man to our flat because I dress in her eyes like a whore so I must be one. ( I only wear some showy clothes because they are comfy for me with my big chest ). When I wear baggy clothes like a hoodie she spreads rumors that I am pregnant to other neighbour and I feel bad for them too because some nice once already came to us and congratulated me with a present. They were furious when I told them it wasn't true. They came with one of these sets with bottles etc which cost a lot. Since I am still a student they thought it would help me.

 She even takes pictures of our door because we have our shoes outside ( like other neighbours ) and complaines by the landlord. Last week she was standing at our door with a priest to CURSE AWAY MY DEMONS WHO ARE INSIDE OF ME...WTF LADY??? I just opend the door and she started screaming in horror about this to the man. The man looked so weird and scary i was actually in fear and just locked the door as soon as possible. They didn't left 20 min later so I called my brother and his friends because I know for a fact they are scarier than anyone else in my city and the police here is useless. She is also taking pictures and videos of us taking the trash out and she also knows that we just bought a trailer and my parents are now mostly away for days to work on it and it'll take them an hour to come back if there is a problem.
 She takes a selfie stick to see what is going on in our living room ( even when we are not dressed after a shower)and our balcony and she is for me truly scary. She destroyed my bike several times and stole important letters from our mail ( which was already solved with police) and she can't be charged because of a mental disorder. She has a free pass because of that and I am afraid what she will do next. I got myself already pepperspray and a bat from my brother but I still feel scared. I am a harmless person and the only way I wanted to solve this was by talking to her but that didn't work. What can I do? I am sorry for the long text but it felt relieving to let out the steam and frustration...and like I said the police is useless here...

Side note: her and I are already in our own war. Every time my parents are away I have time to make my own stuff and prepare for moving to another city in one year. I hear music which she loudly complained with "" Stop that fucking gay music my kids should not turn out like a freak you are "" ( it was born this way by Lady Gaga) so I picked some special songs extra for her. She has called the police on me because the volume was too loud. It was still ok when the police checked so I can hear it the loud without a problem. She threw a snail on our balcony and it hit a window. So now every day when my parents are away I would hear my special Playlist for her eben if its always the same nasty and not child safe songs ( he daughter us 17y btw and i mean songs that represents all she ever called me). She also complained about the nasty smell when and calls the police because i use "" human meat "" for that...(lady my fav dish is curry and thats what I cook XD)",04Aug2020,1
458,"Hi guys and girls, so this is my situation right now: 27F, about to finally move out of my parents' home (in my country this age is normal, most of my friends still live with their parents), very excited about it, and today in the afternoon I'm supposed to sign the lease of an apartment I really like. 
The problem is, this morning I received a call from another agent telling me my application was approved and that when would I like to move in. I was really not expecting this, since it seemed like a a long shot for me and seemed ""too good to be true"". Like, how was this apartment still available? So I told her I'm interested but I would like to see it in person today at noon to make a decision. 
Both apartments are same rent, equal distance from work and friends/family and equally small (what I'm looking for). 

Some differences:

APARTMENT 1 (the one I am supposed to sign today):

Pros:

-Is an apartment complex so I would feel safer since it's only me.

-Has a pool and small gym. 

-Has many many stores around, a big mall, a cafe right below the building, some bars right around the corner (but not noisy since it's a high building)

-More of an urban area so might be better for someone in their late 20s like me, yet still in the outskirts although I'm not big on partying so it's perfect since I don't need to live in the city centre.

Cons:

-Not a ""nice"" neighborhood, just a normal one full of  relatively young people living in their first home, families and foreigners who are looking for a short term stay because of work (lots of studios and furnished apartments). 

-The area is a mix of Industrial parks and apartments, so not a lot of green.

-Slightly pricier electrical bill, because of electric heating. 

APARTMENT 2 (semi-detached house) :

Pros:

-2 story apartment, slightly bigger feeling and the bedroom would be upstairs 

-2 bathrooms instead of one

-Has a small terrace which is very nice.
 
-Nice residential neighborhood, is part of a small house complex. 

-Very green, far from the city centre. 

Cons:

-half furnished, so less room for customization and decorating it my way

-less shops around, there are some, but still more of a residentia neighborhood

-And the biggest con I see is it sounds fishy that it's still even for rent, I googled the house and another website has it up since 40 days ago. It is really a suspiciously low rent (normally a house like this would be at least 200 euros pricier) and the agency has mostly bad reviews on google. People say its unreliable, that they cancelled their reservation right before signing the contract, to beware of them, etc..

Many people showed up for the open house and seemed interested, I am positive a couple applied for the house. So I don't understand why they would approve me, since my income is not that high and I'm sure most people there, such as a couple in their early 40s, would be more financially stable than myself. The only ""benign"" explanation I see is that prices and pre-requisites are less strict because of the covid crisis. 

I have talked to the agency and they say the contract would be signed online since the owners are out of town. I could sign the contract immediately and start living there next week. 
It sounds amazing, almost too good to be true. Quality-wise, my mother liked this one better, and it is indeed nicer, but of course her needs and preferences at her age are different from mine. 
I'm not sure, I might prefer to live in a normal flat instead of a nicer house in a better neighborhood even if they are the same price rent. And of course, the whole situation gives me a weird feeling.

Please, any feedback is welcome. I was already getting jitters because of the whole moving out decision, now this call today really spiked my anxiety levels 😅 and I need to make a decision ASAP. My gut tells me to go with the first one, but I wouldn't like to regret a great deal if the second house turns out not to be a scam/fishy and just a lucky opportunity instead.",04Aug2020,1
459,"Hello.

I’m a 15 year old boy and I live with my mother and 2 older sisters. They’re all hardcore man-haters.

I constantly have to hear stuff like “sick stupid men”, “only men can be jerks”, “men are evil pigs” etc.

My sisters’ twitter accounts are full of the usual “men are trash” and “kill all men” posts.

They’re passive-aggressive and patronizing towards me ALL THE TIME.

Can’t really respond to them, unless I want to start a shitstorm. If I do respond, I’ll get comments like “oh did I hurt your fragile male ego” and they will just become even more aggressive towards me for a long time. They’re kind of bullies, so it’s not really a good idea to respond to them because they are blinded by hate.

They think that I should not get offended by such stuff and should just agree with it because ‘it’s not directed at me specifically’, meanwhile if someone says “women are whores” or anything similar, and responds “oh when I say women, I don’t mean ALL women”, it is never socially acceptable. 

How do I deal with these people? I have to live with them. I resent them and try to avoid them as much as possible by staying in my room, but that only works so far. Interacting with them is inevitable and I'm starting to get extremely irritated by their passive-aggressiveness and condescending behavior, especially when they are together.

I have to say though, this has made me bitter and, dare I say, kind of a misogynist, ironically. Shameful, I know. I do not want to get involved with any woman in the future because I cannot trust someone who doesn’t trust me. But that’s a whole different problem.",04Aug2020,1

Obviosuly i'm not talking about waiting jobs, cashiers cooks or cleaners (no disrespect to those, i've been doing those jobs too through the year) but i need a job that's interesting and challanging that will not require me to melt my brain and be misearable in a university or coollege classroom",04Aug2020,1
461,"We were best friends for over a year. I met D through a mutual friend and since then I cut off contact with that friend, but me and D remained very close. I felt like we were so comfortable with each other, we always shared everything with one another, if we were having a bad day, etc. It was a very loving and compassionate friendship and we always uplifted each other and weren’t afraid to talk about anything. 

Since quarantine began we went from talking almost every day to talking maybe once a week. Then we met twice more with another mutual friend and a bit later I got really depressed and basically didn’t talk to anyone for a couple of weeks, and when I felt better, D was the first one I wrote to. We are both struggling with anxiety and depression and I wasn’t mad at her or anything that she didn’t text me at the time. 

I asked her if she wants to meet up and she said she needs a break from social life (which didn’t seem odd or upset me, cause it wasn’t the first time she told me that). A week later I asked her again and she declined. I asked her if I did something wrong or said something that upset her but she told me it’s something personal. A week later I asked her yet again. She didn’t reply, but later that day she posted on her Instagram story that she was out with friends. 

So I immediately wrote her “you’re telling me it’s nothing to do with me but you ghost me and go out with other people” to which she didn’t reply. I asked her why doesn’t she reply and she told me she doesn’t know what to say.

So we had a short back and forth conversation and she basically told me she misses me but she’s scared and she doesn’t know why or what to do. I asked her if she wants to talk on the phone/meet up or anything she will feel comfortable with, but she said she doesn’t know. I told her I miss her and I love her and how much she is important to me but she didn’t reply back after that. 

My only guess for why she is afraid is maybe she felt like I was deliberately trying to distance myself from her (which is not true) and she was scared I will do it again and hurt her.

The next day I wrote her again (even thought I don’t know the real reason why she’s afraid) that I’m sorry for disappearing and that I was depressed but couldn’t wait to meet her again after I was going to feel better. And I asked her to please not leave me hanging. 

She didn’t reply, and now I’m here. I tossed in my bed thinking about her till 5AM and couldn’t fall asleep, and I just feel so lost and empty. She was that one friend I thought that no matter what happened, she’s not gonna leave me like that. And even if she was gonna cut off contact, she would do it in a much more respectful way that wouldn’t hurt me this way, especially since she knows my history. 

So she’s my last “real” friend. I lost all my friends this year and I don’t know what to do. Should I write her something else? What should I do?",04Aug2020,1

I mean, I see everyone around me, but I feel that they don't feel things like me, they aren't me and I think they are just... I can't explain it, but I know it's in my mind.

*Throwaway*

2018 I meet this amazing girl. We feel in love, had almost all of my ""first"" with her. We were together for 1,5 years.

I broke up with her because I thought I wanted something else. I was young and naive. The grass is always Greene Ron the other side.

We stayed friends and have kept contact untill she got a new guy, more on that further down.

I've moved to a new city and meet a new girl who is also amazing, but she's nothing compared to what my ex was.

Her and I just connected. I've had many sleepless nights filled with anxiety attacks because I miss her so much.
I've been on the verge of killing myself multiple times because the thought of not having her makes me sick.

I feel like a total shithead thinking all this when I have a wonderful girl already. I treat her the exact same way I did my ex. Loads of love and nothing else, but I feel so bad thinking (and missing) my ex when I have a girlfriend.

My ex has a new guy, which is my old friend. He said he wouldn't make a move on her when I asked him not to but as soon as I moved away from home he did. I think it's a kinda shitty to do, but they are happy together then so be it. I want everyone to be happy so if that's what it takes then alright. Thing is he's 12 years older (32 and 20y/p) so I doubt it'll last either way.

That was a bit of backstory.

My struggle is, should I just cut my losses and live with this misery and just accept that I fucked up and move on. Or should I contact her and tell her how I feel? 

I really can't decide. I'm so broken but I don't want to put any burden on her. She's amazing and I want her back, I really do. But if me contacting her would bring her more pain I'd rather not.

I don't know what to. I really don't. I can't imagine not having her. 

I regret it so much, every night.

The town had to lay off 8 other officers to afford his salary, four of which were given their jobs back through emergency funds. The only reason why he was able to score a salary this large was through changing the contract the night before it was to be signed but after it was already agreed upon.

2 weeks and 1 day ago my husband and I adopted a senior cat. We are very experienced pet owners with three dogs and three other cats. The new cat was scared in his new home but seemed alright. Enjoyed being held and pet, even ate a can of food. Idk, I only had him in my reach for a single night. 

The next morning we can’t find the cat at all and our AC vent is slightly askew. I shrug off the vent as a coincidence. After looking for him all day, he mews from the depths of the vent. He pried our vent cover open and ran inside.  

We have tried food repeatedly to get this cat out. He has eaten a few times since hiding and I assume drank no water. He will only eat off a spoon I hold down the vent, he will not come out or far enough for me to grab him. Obviously I’m worried sick and also incredibly stressed there has been a cat in my vent system for two weeks. We have tried a live animal trap baited with tuna but no luck.

My father is over 60, over 120 kg and a little less than 1,80 m (&gt;265 lb; &lt;6 ft). My mom told me that his foot is swelling up and hurting him. He still works because he has to get more time to retire. But he wakes up, works full time at the computer then do some online courses or works more. He is a workaholic.

I'm living in another country and my sister is living in another city, so is just he and my mother. All of us already told him to walk, do some kind of activity, anything. But he has no interest, don't want to, and gets mad if we insist.

Since the coronavirus, he don't leave the house at all, so his leg condition it's getting worse and I fear that he'll have to be amputated. 

I told my mom to make more healthy food but he gets mad again and eat something else until my mom gives in.

I tried to explain many times his situation and suggested to him to go for a walk in the morning/night to not encounter anyone.

He's been to different doctors, but doesn't changed his lifestyle.

No, he is not going to do grocery shop.

No, he does not do chores.

No, he is not gonna get a hobby. I was surprised when he started watching netflix.

He's not violent, but gets mad easily.

I tried to ""blackmail"" him saying ""Do you want to see your granddaughter growing up?"" and doesn't work.

478,"Over a year ago I was approached by a friend to attend an introductory self development class. It was so hyped up with people, and having my trusted friend and his family, I ended up signing up for the class ($500).

After the class was finished, they advertised a 90 program that would be class on steroids. You know, you'll get everything you want from life type thing. 

After the first month of the program, the instructor told us you cannot continue the program unless you sign up two other people into the introductory class. He said this is to help you gain sales skill and what not. I tried arguing with him and the entire class about what he was doing and that we've already paid $4000. I couldn't get anyone on my side. Eventually, I decided against bringing two friends into this mess and forfeited the remaining two months of the program. 

I stumbled on his Facebook page today and was reminded of it. Truth is, I'm hurt that I lost $4000 and more importantly that he's doing this shit with other people on a daily basis. He brings people in, teaches them bullshit and rinses and repeats.

Question is, is this type of MLM (which he doesn't say it is because the lower level 'coaches' supposedly don't get paid) illegal? Can I sue him to stop his practice?

482,"Hi Everyone,

Asking for this kind of advice online is pretty new to me, but I honestly don't know who else to turn to, or what my options are.

I live in the UK, I'm 24, and currently unemployed(Kinda Self-Employed). At the start of the Pandemic I was working in VR/Game Development, but I was working in a very small company and was under huge pressure to fulfil unrealistic deadlines. It got so bad that my Mental Health worsened dramatically. My Depression returned, and any gaps in my episodes were filled with crippling anxiety. I made the choice to leave.

Sadly for me that Pandemic hit hard after that, and Lockdown was about to take place. It also meant that since I left willingly I wasn't entitled to any furlough pay, so I quickly lost all of my money. Since I lived on my own, one of the worst things for me mentally would be to be stuck without contact for who knew how long. My family encouraged me to move back home so that I wouldn't be alone, and also wouldn't be able to pay another month's rent. So I did, and it really helped to start. But eventually the warmness and novelty of me recently moving back wore off.

My depression eventually came rushing back, so badly, that I now need to be medicated.

To tell you a bit about how I am as a person: I am generally very mellow, I do my best to be kind to everyone, and understand the problems of others. I never want to make anyone feel bad, and just want those around me to be happy and fulfilled. I don't do or say anything that will upset people, since I just don't feel like it's productive. I just try to get on with everyone and maintain the peace. But my family is quite the opposite. When they get neurotic, they become extremely dysfunctional and abusive to those around them. I hoped that my demeanour and attempts to be good natured would keep me out of the line of fire, but sadly that was a misconception.

I am often shouted at, degraded, and mistreated. As my family feels the way to solve social issues is with abuse towards those who have annoyed them or disagree with them.

I do what I can to find fulfilment and harmony in this place. I try planting, working on my own projects, or raising my caterpillars (Which my stepdad is currently trying to get me to let them die, since ""It's bad"". Which is normally the reason for everything).

I try to keep myself busy by working on my own Video game, which I hope to release soon. It's extremely hard work, and absolutely exhausting, but it is also rewarding and keeps me thinking positively. But it has become nigh impossible to stay focused when I'm fearful that at any moment someone is going to barge into my workspace and make me feel horrible about myself.

So I decided that I really want to move out. And just give my family space. But because I haven't released my game yet I have no income streams, and the fact that I don't know how well it will sell is also a huge worry, since I can't assume it will even earn me anything meaningful.

I desperately want my own space, so I can continue to work on my projects and hopefully sustain myself. But I have no money to do that, so I feel completely trapped here. Silently suffering and having sleepless nights while I'm barraged by debilitating invasive thoughts.

One of my big issues is that I struggle to work normal jobs. Since I'm on the Autistic Spectrum, Suffer from ADHD, and Anxiety, I am not a good worker in retail or similar jobs. I just become easily overwhelmed and confused by even simple tasks. But working on creative things is all I feel I can do really well, it feels like it clears my mind and lets me focus intently on something and really become absorbed in it. I've comfortably worked in some larger games studios and got on extremely well. But most of the companies I worked with and am on good terms with simply don't have work for me due to disruption from the pandemic.

Which is why I desperately want to be self employed and just make things that people would love. I'd be happy if I just barely earned enough to sustain a flat. If it meant I could feel safe, and have a place where I can do what keeps me sane.

So I suppose I just really want to know what my options are. I have no idea where to start looking. I just want to distance myself from this household for a while so I can get back onto my feet and hopefully start to heal mentally. Does anyone have any advice for me on where to start looking?",04Aug2020,1

Hi everyone,

I've been studying in college for almost 2 years now and have been extremely focused on 'my self' like many people have suggested to me. My lifestyle is extremely simple to sum up:
1. I study and (so far) achieve mostly A's and some B's. Study takes up a lot of my time and I can only study effectively in isolation (not that I have study friends anyway(

2. I have no friends from college, as soon as the course finishes we part ways...so far this year I've met 0 people.

3. I workout consistently every week and as a result, I've developed quite a fit lean physique. This was a great confidence booster until I realised I have no friends or girlfriend to share my successes with.

4. I live by myself and rent a small unit, so the only other thing I do is work to pay the bills. 

That's it folks. I've literally summed up my life in them few paragraphs. I wanted to try online dating but realised i have 0 photos of myself other than taking selfies, which screams ""i have no friends and never go out"" i think. Interestingly, before college, I had a great social life balance and a strong friend circle with parties etc etc. Soon as i left for college, we all grew apart. So it's not that I don't WANT to be sociable, but I don't have any friends to actually go out and socialise with anymore. Obviously this lack of social life has impacted my sex life directly, and has effectively killed it off. An accumulation of no social life, no sex life, and no one to share my college and fitness successes has increasingly thrown me into a feeling of heavy loneliness, and maybe mild depression (but i have no clue to confirm this as i'm not educated in this area)??

Can anyone share any advice or tips for what may be best for me to do at this point?",04Aug2020,1
488,"Posted this on r/relationship_advice as well; so sorry for the long read! 


My bff and I have a long history. I’ve known him for all my life. We’ve been classmates from the 1st grade till senior year. We are now juniors in different colleges in different cities.


A short timeline of our relationship would be: he was the popular kid in school, he was mean and feared and everybody was trying to be his friend. But he was also smart and funny and we had a lot in common. We were friends, since we would talk and laugh together a lot. He was a nice boy when he wouldn’t be mean. 

But he HATED me. He bullied me for years, would call me fat, ugly, annoying, forever alone, all that Jazz. He’d ridicule me in front of our classmates, he’d laugh when I’d start crying, he made other classmates dislike me as well. In my defense, I wasn’t a bad kid—I was just a fat try-hard nerd, but never mean. 

Those years left me with huge self esteem issues and a crippling fear of conflict, to the point where I suffer from an ED and I’m almost unable to say no out of fear of being ridiculed like back in the day. 

Come Highschool, he changed (his parents divorced and I think that had a big effect on him) and he turned into a silent and funny guy. We got along really well, had (just like back in the day) common interests but nothing more. 

In the 11th grade we became closer, started doing everything together and talked about anything. This dynamic continues to this day. We traveled a lot together and he supported me through a very traumatic breakup. We’d go together everywhere we could: parties, festivals, school reunions. I love him just as much as I love my siblings, and I know that he loves me too. 

Throughout our friendship years he’d sometimes go back to his old ways, as in he’d rain on my parade, mansplain the most basic things to me, brag about his father buying him everything he wants or so; I’d always shut him off and he’d calm down. 

I always felt that he thinks he’s “better” than me because his father gives him a lot of money and because he studies STEM in college while I study journalism (one of the weirdest things was him seeing the LinkedIn app on my phone and asking me what I need it for, because only “people who’ll have real jobs” should use it)

Whenever I’d go through something, I’d tell him, he’d listed, I’d ask him for advice and he’ll give me some one-word bullshit like “sucks” or “fuck yeah”. I told him this bothers me and he really put an effort in communicating our problems better. 

Last month he met a girl and he’s absolutely smitten with her. They spend all their time together, he won’t come home (where I and all his friends are spending our summer break) from his college dorm because he wants to spend time with her and only her (they go to the same college) and barely talks to me. 

I totally understand that he’s excited because of her and I’m honestly happy that he finally found a girlfriend. I can’t help feeling jealous though. As irrational as it sounds, I hate that I’m not the most important girl friend in his life anymore. I know that my way of thinking is wrong and I am actively working on that with my therapist. 

All this time we are spending apart made me reevaluate our 15-year relationship and ask myself: is he genuine? Did he actually change? Or does he use me (I am more of a mom friend, gotta admit)? If it weren’t for his occasional “joke bullying” I’d believe he’s genuine, but I don’t know what to believe. I’m very scared of breaking up our friendship and I couldn’t imagine a life without him in it. 

Do I deserve more, though?",04Aug2020,1
489,"Hi everyone, well I honestly don’t know what to do anymore and that’s why I came here. 

I’m a girl, 22 years old but I always looked more younger and since I was a teenager I studied and worked at the same time. But the problem right now is that my appearance that used to look so young it’s changing away too fast, at least for me since I’m always used to take pictures of myself it’s such a shook see that I’m not looking a teenager anymore and that my appearance, specially my face, it’s looking more mature I feel and people around me tells me that I’m looking like a woman now. 
It’s not a radical change of course but I still can see it and with this there’s also my college which I will start next week. and I’m already used to have responsibilities since I’m saving some money to move from my parents house once my college ends. 

But this appearance thing it’s hitting me so hard, I always loved to look the away I used to be and now everything in my life is changing and I don’t know how to deal with it I’m honestly freaking out about not looking “younger” anymore, the college thing and also the save money thing. 

I’m just not accepting that I have more responsibilities now and that I’m growing up and this is making me so sick at the point I can’t sleep well anymore or even eat and I’m always constantly anxious.

491,"Hello, 

I was trying to keep it short (but I failed, sorry). I know a lot of people are going to roll their eyes reading the headline but this topic goes trough my mind A LOT since the last few months an bothers me deeply and I would really appreciate reddits advice regarding the long term orientation of my hobby. So: 

My gaming equipment is getting a bit to scattered and expensive. I constantly have the desire to upgrade something (every 2 years basically) and with PC gaming you can upgrade **a lot**: Lets get a nice 65"" OLED TV (1,7k €) when I feel like playing on the couch, lets get a 32:9 superultrawide Monitor (1k €) for the desk, lets get that top tier computer component (GPU / 800 €), what about a VR Headset (600€), new mouse, keyboard and so on.

It's all getting a little bit out of hand and I know this is all basically a matter of self control but I can't help myself with my hobby (I'm super strict in other areas). So I thought if I focus on one area and limit the amount of devices I'm able spent money on then I could keep myself under control. Believe it or not but I'm also some kind of a **minimalist** and I hate too many stuff and too many devices. So I could save a bit money AND feel more comfortable if I'm abandoning either the desk or TV area. Additionally, as I'm getting older I'm getting more and more annoyed because of that ""**nerd image**"" the interior of my house evokes. 

So I came up with 3 ideas how to proceed, I could either: 

* **1. Go all in on a nice TV and buy a console, get completely rid of my desk setup and buy a cheap ultrabook for basic tasks** 

Pro: No need for monitor, keyboard, mice, VR headset, new hardware

Pro: Cheapest method (1,7k TV + 400 Console + 500 Ultrabook = \~2,6k total) 

Pro: Looks more clean, less nerdy

Pro: Netflix experience benefits from this

Neutral: Worse graphics and no keyboard / mouse input (idk about the last point really)

Neutral: No access to VR (but saving a few bucks)

Con: Missing out on a lot of genres (Strategy games, MMOs and CRPGS don't release on console)

Con: 99% of my games are on PC, have to rebuy some

* **2. Go all in on a desk setup with PC, superultrawide monitor and scale down the TV area significantly** 

Pro: Won't abandon my PC library, access to all genres

Pro: Access to VR

Pro: best graphical fidelity (but I don't care **that** much about graphics) and Ultrawide experience

Pro: I like to multitask which is easily possible on PC

Neutral: I work at a desk 8-10 hours a day, might bother me to relax at a desk at home someday

Con: Most expensive (\~1,5k PC \[+ \~ 400 every 2 years for new gpu\] + 1k Monitor, 600 VR headset \[gotta buy it if I have the horsepower\] + \~ 500 for the TV = \~ 3,6k+ total)

Con: looks nerdy AF (huge monitor, desk)

Con: Netflix experience suffers from the cheap ass tv

Con: Several different devices i could spent money on (monitor, tv, mice, and so on)

* **3. Go all in on a nice TV and buy a decent gaming notebook** (basically the same as in 1. but the gaming notebook would substiute the ultrabook and console). 

Pro: Keep my PC library and access to all genres

Pro: Versitility -&gt; Can hook up to tv to function as a console or can unplug it to write some documents or game on a (small) notebookdisplay

Pro: Least amount of devices i could spent money on -&gt; just Notebook + TV (Monitor, mouse, keyboard are integrated and limited performance of the Notebook kills desire for VR) 

Pro: still somewhat cost efficient (\~1,2k Notebook + 1,7k TV = 2,9k total)

Pro: Clean and doesn't look nerdy at all (no console or huge pc setup)

Neutral: Limited access to vr

   Con: Performance worse than PC and probably even console due to small formfactor and portability. FOMO (fear of missing out) since its basically a PC but so much worse performance with console everybody is on an even playing field at least. This is a huge Con.

I've been in a relationship for almost 4 years. We had our ups and downs obviously but it was the one person that never failed to make me happy. I live in a kinda toxic household, I'm antisocial and it's not easy for me to let people in, but he understood me and helped me a lot.

497,"Hey guys, I would really appreciate any advice you guys have.

So this is a really long and messy story, I'm sorry.

So I met this guy about 2 years ago now and we became really close about a year and a half ago. He admitted that he really liked me but I was too scared to admit that I liked him so I kept it hidden even though I knew that he liked me. I eventually ended up telling my friends to.

During this my closest friend was in a LDR with this guy but it wasn't really going the best (she was pretty much cheating on him) and I was always had to call her out on it. She ended up breaking it off with him (in a VERY messy way might I add) and after about a week or so she tells me that her and the guy that I liked were dating...

I found out that she had been on dates with him and even kissed him while in this LDR (she had told him they had already broken up) so I called her out and told them not to date cause I knew she would do the same to him. I was especially hurt cause she was telling me not to date the guy cause he was weird and annoying and to just avoid him and then she starts dating him (knowing I liked him).

She ended up unfriending me and I ended up blocking her cause she didn't like that I would call her out for her wrongdoings (apparently I was being manipulative) and I'm just petty. My other best friend who had agreed with me from the start and had told me that I needed to tell her that what she was doing wasn't right eventually started ignoring me so I blocked her to. That's my 2 best friends gone because of this guy but we stayed as friends,

I eventually told him that I did like him but couldn't commit to anything cause I'm loyal and respect girl code (even though I'm not friends with the girl anymore) and we just continued on. I ended up distancing myself from him and I thought I had gotten ridden of my feelings. He ended up dating this other girl that really manipulative and he made a promise not to get involved with my friends anymore.

Fast forward a year and half going through patterns where I go MIA for like months at a time (I'm ISTP if that helps), I felt like it was time to stop being MIA and talk to my friends again so I was messaging them and my other closest friend who I tell EVERYTHING to (she's the only one that knows everything that happened during that time and since then, what was mentioned was only the tip of the iceberg) admitted that she liked this guy and I was like aww cool so my friends ended up convincing him to break up with his girlfriend (she was a manipulative bitch and he wasn't happy in the relationship) so she could date him. He ended up doing it and they're kind of like a thing now but not officially since he had just broken up.

They obviously asked me if I was ok with them becoming a thing and I obviously said it was ok because I really was ok with it... 

This was a couple of weeks ago and since then work has become extremely stressful and with my birthday coming up how it wasn't going to be important for me as my friends would only care about them instead of celebrating my birthday (I'm the type that's very critical of myself so need confirmation from my friends that I am important to them) and I started to get really down to the point where I was crying myself to sleep for nights in a row.

So my birthday was over the weekend and I had to stop myself from crying the whole time as I was stressed and just upset (didn't help I had my period) I had to watch their over the top affection which for some reason made me angry. I realised the day of my birthday that my feelings for him hadn't disappeared and had just been suppressed and became really angry with the realisation to the point where I snapped at him really badly and stormed out of my own birthday party in tears in the rain.

My friends came and found me and I explained how work had been getting to me and stuff had been going on at home but I spoke to him separately and expressed how uncomfortable it made me with all of the PDA as we had promised no more friends and how I had already lost my two closest friends cause of what had happened and didn't want to lose anymore and just about life in general. He agreed to tone it down and they have a lot when I'm around but now I'm confused on what to do.

Since finally admitting to myself that I still like him I can't stop thinking about it and I told one of my other friends who thinks I should just tell him but at the same time I can't tell him cause he sucks at hiding things from me (he hasn't told me directly but it's extremely obvious) so I know he still likes me and would break things off with my friend to try again with me (I'm trying to word that in the least narcissistic way possible). I'm too loyal a friend to break girl code and ruin things for her especially since this would be her first relationship and it's the first time she has been this close to a guy (similar to me even now) but at the same time I'm soo angry and sad at myself especially for once again being too late to realise my feelings that I can't stop thinking about it and at this point am ready to go MIA but never talk to him again (I've openly admitted that I don't want to even meet any of my friends crushes or boyfriends since it makes me REALLY uncomfortable).

I'm usually someone who thinks with their head which in this case is telling me to not tell him and just pretend I'm ok (as I have been and always do) but at the same time I can't concentrate and I'm just sad all the time which is affecting my already stressful job and affecting my desire to really do anything. I don't want to lose the last of my friends but at the same time I'm tired of constantly putting others before me and sacrificing myself and my happiness for others. I'm at a loss and just really need some advice from people who aren't involved in the situation.",04Aug2020,1
498,"So it hurts,it hurts bad. I was in a bad place and I really needed someone. I knew (I'll call him Adam) since last year and it all started on insta. Then overtime we have texts and talked a lot. He has jokingly asked that we should be a couple and I brushed it off every time as I thought that he was joking but last week he was serious and although I hesitated I knew him and I kinda liked him plus with everything going on in my life I wanted someone to hold on too. I know I'm stupid but I accepted it. We dated. I felt super weird at first because I still couldn't accept the fact that I was in a relationship. It was sudden and I've never even kissed a guy before what more date one.

Since this was my last senior year, I soon got scared that he might affect my studies. As even on the first day I couldn't stop thinking about him and he was on my mind 24/7 . I couldn't wait to get a text from him and I really wanted to talk to him a lot. I thought that was what love is. We did talk late night but at the same time sometimes he would ignore my messages and it hurt. On the third day I chickened out from the relationship as I told him I couldn't handle anymore pain mentally as I  already have shit going on ( I've got an ED, my dad's cheating, my mum's sick, my dad's slowly falling sick too as he is limping and more). He said he understood as I've already told him about my issues before. We stayed as friends and for the past 5 days since we broke up we've still been texting and talking. 

But yesterday I came back to boarding school and we just haven't talked much. He said he'll call but he hasn't answered my texts or messages. It hurts and it's exam week for me too and I can't stop thinking about him. I can't take my eyes off my phone and I keep looking for texts. How do I help myself?  I'm completely unprepared for my tests and with the shit going on in my head already, his giving me more stress by not answering or just replying me? I think I'm starting to love him more and I might want him back should I tell him that I want to be in a relationship again or should I just wait till I graduate high school in the end of this year and then start dating him again? Please I'm so clueless on love and I've got no one to tell too as my parents despise teenage love and so does my community.",04Aug2020,1
499,"As I type this out, I realize how entitled I sound. 
For background, we've been together for 7 years, since our teens, and now have a beautiful 1 year old. I've jokingly (and not-so-jokingly) make hints about getting engaged, especially as I see everyone else we've grown up with, get engaged and even married. However, I make him aware that even with my ""hints"" I only really want it when he wants it. 

Well, yesterday he finally proposed. And my reaction was terrible. 

The Proposal: 
He had just come home from work and I was sitting on the floor, watching The XFactor. Our baby was napping. I told him to watch a segment on the episode. Right after it was done, he goes, ""Hey Babe?"" I turn around, still on the floor, to him on his knee with a ring out. He asks, ""Will You Marry Me?"" I take the moment in. I say, ""Yeah?"" He asks, ""Yeah?"" And I switch my answer to ""Yes"". There is no happiness, no excitement. Nothing special about this moment. He continues with, ""We're being watched."" I ask what he means, and then look over. He was video chatting his friend the entire time, because the friend wanted to ""Witness"".
He realizes the vibe I'm giving off and mentions I didn't react the way he expected me to. I told him the proposal wasn't what I was expecting. He never asked my ring size, so the ring is too small. I told him we have to return it so I can wear it. But asked if I could get a different ring (I've told him many many many times if he were to ever propose to please send me a few ring ideas so he gets my taste. That didn't happen, and I think the ring looks more like prop jewelry to a funeral than an engagement to a wedding). He doesn't seem too open to the idea of exchanging the ring, I really think it's ugly. He asked me if I wasn't happy about it. I told him I was. Honestly I'm not sure. Why don't I feel that adrenaline? Why am I not bouncing off the walls and changing my Facebook relationship status? Is it the moment? The ring? The fact that we were just fighting the night before and he almost slept on the couch for the FIRST time ever?

I'm posting this to help myself understand what's going on my head. I waited *so* long for this. I wanted this *so* badly. But I can't figure out why I'm not excited. 

What are your thoughts?",04Aug2020,1
500,"Hello, my name is “A”, I am 17, in 12th grade and male. It is 5:31 in the morning and I have spent the last 3 hours crying off and on. I am posting this out of desperation. I have chosen to contact y’all in a last ditch attempt to figure this out before things possibly go down a path I don’t know if id return from. 

I’ll start this off by saying I have serious daddy issues. My parents split the same year I was born and I never really knew my bio-dad (who will be referred to as simply “dad”. He was around but not enough to make any meaningful impact. I have 2 memories of him and in both his face is the same face that was on his obituary. That is the only face of his I remember. Up until 5 years ago it was just me my 3 siblings and my mom. We lived in income based housing until we moved to Texas. 

I grew up envying others for their experiences with their dad. I still do. Like I said I don’t know what to do or even why I feel this way. I’ve spent the at least the last 10 years carrying this weight. I can’t quite remember what year it was but earlier in my life probably around 6-7 my dad died. 

 He died of a drug overdose. What I do know is he drank a lot and took too many pills that night. I have been told many things but I ultimately believe he committed suicide. He had been battling depression and I don’t believe he could accidentally downed a bottle of cancer medication on accident, even if your wasted. I never realized how much I’d regret not knowing the man until his funeral when I realized I’d never get to know my dad, of course at the time I didn’t understand why I was crying. 

 Over the course of the time between then and now. I have had multiple breakdowns centering around those daddy issues. Whether it’s 3rd grade me pleasing to god to bring him back or 6th grade me getting in the fetal position at the end of the football field crying. Luckily most of the time it just took place at night or in a situation where I could breakdown away from people. 

Eventually I was able to participate in a group who have experienced loss of a loved one and it helped. But after the 6th grade I moved to where I live now and the group was not able to come along. 

When I was being sold on the idea of moving away (which was tough because we moved around a lot so I never got a chance to make worthwhile friends) my mom told me I would have a dad. I was told I’d be able to do dad stuff. Hell the idea alone of having a dad was enough for me. Unfortunately that never came. 

We moved to Texas, by then my brother had graduated and was staying in Kentucky. We get moved in with my stepdad and he barely interacts with us. This is due to him not wanting to overstep any boundaries me or my mom may have formed (not that any existed tho) This was to set a trend for the past 5 years. 

Eventually we run into money from a dead relative and my family starts spending it. So I assume this will be the chance for me and my stepdad to do something together. Maybe a hobby or hunting or something. All that I knew was that at least then we could afford it. 

Unfortunately at this time my brother had came down to Texas to live with us. This is important because 1 he got the room I was supposed to get which means I still have to live in the upstairs living room which is nice until you realize you don’t get the luxury of privacy and our room becomes the family storage area. 2 he is both older and the only other guy in the house so all of the money for, the interest in, and the time for “guy stuff” or “dad stuff” or any god damn chance to spend time with my step dad went to him. I spent that entire year having to force myself in to this stuff because they would t include me on their own. Which in it of itself took away what I was seeking anyways, although at the time I wasn’t aware. 

A year of RC planes/cars, guns, and hunting later. All the money is gone and my parents attempt to make an investment for the first time by flipping a house. We didn’t even make a profit. But don’t worry my brother being an adult was able to help out and was able to do more bonding with my step dad. Unfortunately me being a kid I was not able to do anything and sometimes more of those days at home like usual. I didn’t have the trust needed to handle things with out hurting myself and my parents never bothered to try to build that trust because it was easier and faster to just get the job done rather than focus on doing the job and working with me. This is simplified but the idea is the same. This is also going to be a common idea for them. 

 So fast forward a few years to the summer of junior year and I’m talking to my friend. Somehow the topic of my daddy issues comes up (he was already aware of some of these issues), at this point I realized that I hadn’t thought about any of this for about a year at that point and had been just been tucking those issues away and ignoring them. After all me acting on those issues and making them known to my parents never did anything anyways. Shit always went back to the way they were. 

Ever since that day I haven’t been able to spend one day not thinking about it. I hate that I wasn’t able to do anything because all I wanted was to be able to have one fucking fond memory of having a dad. All I wanted was to be loved by him. Now I can’t get that piece of childhood back because it’s long past now. I have a job, I have responsibilities I have to keep up with. I can’t just enjoy those moments with the bliss of being a child anymore. I can’t take my parents word for it because they never kept a promise anyways. Whether it was them forgetting or circumstance didn’t allow it or they plain didn’t care enough to do it. 

I sit here finding it hard to go about daily life with out being pestered by my regret and I fucking hate it. I try to move on and focus on what matters but it’s hard when you have a daily reminder in the next room. Even outside of my house I’m reminded with life in general. Whether I’m hearing story of what someone and their dad is doing. Maybe I’ll see a youtuber doing something with their dad. I know none of this would be a problem if I just didn’t compare myself but how do you do that with something so integral to yours and others life. 

I just want to be able to live life and I can’t even do that and I hate it. I just want this to stop and I can’t do anything to stop it. I can’t talk to my brother because he’s the “suck it up” kind of guy. I can’t talk to my mom because she doesn’t even know what to do and history has shown that talking to her doesn’t fix it. I’ve talked to my stepdad too and yet again nothing gets fixed.  

I’m tired of staying up till 3 or 5 or fucking 7 crying. I’m tired of not being able to enjoy shit. I’m tired of it. So please help, please just give me a direction. At this point I’m at a loss and I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sorry for making this so long but the best idea I had was to give a complete rundown of my situation. Thank you I’m advance for anyone willing to help",04Aug2020,1

502,"
I currently live in an apartment in Michigan with my sister and one other person. Our current lease is up September 25th, 2020. We are required to give 60 days notice if we weren't going to resign our lease. We resigned the least about a week and a half ago because we decided we were going to spend one more year there. The new lease begins when the current lease ends.

A week ago my sister informed me that she will be moving out in November to live with her boyfriend. Fine, I was looking for someone to fill her spot and possibly found someone. It wasn't for sure yet. Today my other roommate told me that she would also most likely be moving out, but didn't give me a specific time.

I need to end the future lease. Whether the roommate decides to move or not, I don't have the time to wait for her to figure that out. To break our lease we need to give a 60 day notice, while paying  for 60 days of rent, with a $3,000 dollar fee on top of that. Is this our only option? Has anyone else been in this situation? Did your landlord allow you to just break the future lease without a fee?

Hopefully this makes sense, I'm just so frustrated. I am planning on going to my leasing office tomorrow to discuss options but I wanted to go in with some knowledge and advice on what should be done. TIA.",04Aug2020,1
503,"Hello everyone!
So a little about me. 
I dropped out of university, moved to the other side of the pond  and started a pretty successful business. Fast forward 10 years, covid 19 happens and now Im pretty sure I’m going to have to shut down everything I built over the years. I doubt I’ll be able to do what I’ve been doing for a long time. 

I don’t know if I should go back to school and try something new or is it too late for me to go back at 30?
I’m feeling pretty down and could use some advice from people who started a higher education later in life. 
I would also love to speak to anyone who is going through a similar thing.

Thanks~",04Aug2020,1
504,"So this is a bit of a complex situation - buckle in. 

I was in a relationship of 18 months, when about a month ago he bailed on coming to spread my great grandmother's ashes with me, and he broke up with me over text immediately after.

The next few days were really shit for me, but I was coming to terms with how toxic the relationship was and how mistreated I was for a long time. I put my heart into that relationship, and he used me for sex, while telling me what I wanted to hear (about us having a future) so I never fully gave up hope. 

I started talking to one of my good friends (who was also very close with my ex, as we have the same friend group) after the breakup and he really helped me push through the shitty part, and made me realise how much better off I was. I'll call him J. 

I would never be anything but loyal to whoever I am with (as I value that the most in a relationship tbh), but after talking to J for a few days I realised that I had developed a lot of buried feelings for him, as towards the end of my relationship with my ex, I was needing more that what he was giving me (my ex was also talking to girls online and hiding it from me, which is a whole other story - so that definately was a huge factor in my mind wandering to other people). Once again, these were just thoughts - and I would NEVER cheat. 

In the end, J and I realised we both had feelings for each other, and we knew it had been a long time coming. 

Instead of taking a break before getting back into another relationship, I was very aware that the wounds of my past relationship had long since healed, and I was ready to give my heart to someone who cared about me. 

We are still in school, and all of this ensued over the course of one of our 2 week breaks (Australia gang). Basically I left school with one boyfriend, returned with another. I knew the slut comments would ensue, and i was more than prepared for that - the thing that I wasn't prepared for was people thinking I had cheated on my ex, to get with J.

Even my closest friends who knew what my ex had done to me (he never treated me well but I won't go into details) still thought that I was simply getting with J for revenge. 

This is not the case. I know that. J knows that. This relationship is legitimate, and I feel really strongly about him, and vice versa - but the opinions from other people are really getting to me right now.

Am I the asshole? 

TLDR

I got dumped by my ex, who had been mistreating me for a while. One of our mutual close friends helped me realise that I was better off, and we started a relationship of our own. People at our school now think that I have cheated on my ex / dumped him to be with my new partner.

Today I got a job offer from an aged care facility and I'm freaking out!!!
A year ago I completed a course which gave me a qualification to be an assistant  in nursing (ain) in aged care. Meaning I'm to care and manage the elderly in their day to day.  Well.. as I said..  that was a year ago.. 

To most a year isn't that long and yes.. That's true but at the time I was a 16 yr old who cared primarly about which anime they were gonna watch next or whos online in minecraft as well i was fluenced highly by my mother who works in aged care who wanted me to follow in her footsteps.
Yes,yes excuses, excuses I know. But since then a lot has happened.
I've met a guy
Ran away from home
And am now living in a motel with my boyfriend trying to find a house to rent.
I'd like to think I'm beginning to mature and take responsibility for my own life but apparently not.
Im trying so hard to get a house but to do that i need money meaning I need a job so I applied for everything I could.
And Ta da I finally found something, but wouldn't you know it.. I'm scared,  I don't know what I'm doing and I'm worried I'm going to mess this up.
Everyone I know is so happy for me and proud my mother, father, friends, boyfriend. So why aren't I? I don't know what to do, I'm sure I'll be given buddy shifts in which I'll learn but what if it isn't enough? I don't want to disappoint everyone and I can't leave this job it's not fair to my partner to be the only one providing and I'm sick  of relying on him and centrelink to pay for food and other things.
I've done work experience in age care in the past but I didn't learn as much as I probably should of, I passed my course with flying colours and witnessed many things during my work placement, even experienced a resident I cared for deeply passing. This I admit threw me off aged care a bit, but I knew it was something it would have to deal with. But now.. I'm just not sure.

506,"I know this sounds stupid, but it’s a serious issue for me. 


I started falling asleep in class at the age of 14 and it slowly got a lot worse. I’m 18 now and leaving for college soon. Even if I’m not tired and had gotten a ton of sleep, I still fall asleep in every single class. My grades are slowly going down because I just can’t absorb any of the teaching that goes on in class. (I know I can copy notes afterwards or just study on my own, but it wastes a lot of time and time is of essence in the very academically-driven society I live in. The classes are tough as hell and the equivalent to high school here is so tiring and demanding that it’s common for students to fall into depression because of the lack of work-life balance.)

It’s not like I don’t find the classes interesting, I actually find some of them VERY interesting. 

I’ve tried 

- drinking water, 
- washing my face, 
- standing up (during the entire lesson; I still fall asleep, but less), 
- drinking coffee, 
- eating sweets, 
- eating other snacks, 
- doodling, 
- reading my own notes, 
- talking to a friend
-getting someone else to slap me awake and 
- even slapping myself awake. 

None of it works very well. Do I have some kind of vitamin deficiency? Is it really just little mental stimulation in class? In all of my classes, none of my classmates have this issue. At most, they only fall asleep once or twice per week, whereas I do so almost every single day, during every single class. 

I really need help... if I don’t solve this issue soon, I won’t be able to go to a good college and that’s what my family really needs right now.",04Aug2020,1

When I told the franchisee and the gm what happened, I get a text back saying, “awesome job, thanks”. Also, over last summer we had a health inspection where we received 96%, again on my shift. 

Today, I found out that to celebrate getting 5 stars, the franchisee, gm and three delivery drivers went out to a pub, then dinner and then drinks last week. All paid for by the franchisee and all were told not to tell anyone who works in the store. Neither myself or the other assistant manager got any type of reward. The other two part timers who were also working on my shift, not so much as a thank you. But three delivery drivers who just sit on their phones all day and deliver pizza get to go and celebrate?! After the health inspection in the summer there was no appreciation either.

Info to me: I'm from Austria, living in the US as an au pair right now, have a boyfriend of 9 months here.

1. I stay here and go to college here which would mean I give up on free education and healthcare in Austria and I would have to go into debt about 150k (tuition fees a lot higher for international students). BUT I could stay with my boyfriend!

2. I go back to Austria and get the same degree for pretty free and I would have healthcare and I would be around my family and friends. But I can't do a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend. I just can't do that. I've been away from my family for 1 year and that is already somewhat hard but to be away from him for 4 years (for degree) I can absolutely not imagine. He is the person I am closest to. Especially since there is no real end in sight.
In this scenario, I'd have to break up with him.

A friend told me that she had a somewhat similar situation and the way she decided to figure out which option made her sick to her stomach and after she put it that way it was an easy decision. 
The decision that makes me sick to my stomach is Number 1: Staying in US. I makes my skin crawl to go into SO much debt when I don't have to go into debt in Austria AT ALL.

512,"Currently 22F I really wanted to get into a food science program to become a research and development chef but unfortunately was not accepted into the program I wanted to get into. So now I am at a complete loss of what to do for the next year or what other degrees to look into.

Bit of background -

At 19 I moved overseas and spent just over a year travelling on and off in Europe and working in the 100% commission sales role. It was an absolutely amazing experience and I got to see so many countries while working this job. 

Next I went to Australia for 3 months (Feb - May last year) working for the same sales company and then onto Southeast Asia for 3 months (May- August) then the month of August in France.

September rolled around last year I had decided I might want to become a chef as I developed a real passion for food and cooking through my travels. I settled back in Europe and I worked in a kitchen for 8ish months until Covid happened and I lost my job in May. It turns out I hated it anyway the long hours, bad pay and back breaking work. However I still love working with food and the creativity it allows me. I love to cook and create and make amazing delicious things inspired from all parts of the world.

A month and a half ago I managed to find a job in a cake shop as an apprentice baker, it is okay but I am sick of working minimum wage. I want to get into a career or industry that allows me work life balance the ability to save, and have some freedom or sick days. I am over not getting holiday leave and 10 euros per hour. It is barely survivable.

I am strongly considering going to Uni to get a bachelor but I don't even know in what now as I didn't get accepted. I feel like I have tried a lot of different jobs and I am still not sure what I am even interested in. I don't want to go back to uni to get a useless degree. I want a degree that will provide good stable job opportunities.

What careers should I look into that allow good work life balance? Should I go to uni? Should I just attempt applying for other jobs? How do I get out of minimum wage? I feel like I have a lot of experience for my age and have so much to offer companies but don't know how to get my foot in the door?

515,"So, my parents have been split since the 2nd grade. After almost 9 years, I decided around a month or two ago that I wanted to move in with my dad full time. I love both my parents equally, but me and my dad get along much better. 

Recently, due to Covid and a medical related issue, I had to go back to stay with my mom for a month. My mom grew up through a lot of trauma, and has a lot of issues. She is incredibly loving and does the best she can for me. 

A couple weeks ago, she let me know we (me, her, her boyfriend) were all going on a trip out of town. It is roughly a 12 hour drive, and I like the place we are going, but I work 7 days a week, been working since I was 15 &amp; have started my own life. At this point in time, as much as I love her, spending time with her isn’t my go to thing to do. 

The trip is this Thursday and yesterday I told her I didn’t want to go. She broke down, crying, telling me that the only reason she planned it was to spend time with me, that she would rather cancel the trip and do something with me. 

This was a hard thing, I am a person who likes to please others and was never really taught to say no, and recently I’ve taught myself it’s okay to do so, but none the less I hate confrontation, and saying no etc. I feel like such a **** of a child, but I don’t know what else to do. 

Every time something is planned between us, I break down and don’t want to go. I would rather work than go on this trip. She is pretty religious, I am not. She still doesn’t see me as an adult, which I guess I’m not completely, but she still treats me like a kid. I don’t feel like I can talk to her about my life or anything that goes on. When I was a kid, after the divorce, she constantly worked and didn’t have much time for me. I understand this, I’m not an ignorant person, I’m well aware of the situations you can be put in. But that time has passed. I don’t want to be dragged around anymore and be stripped of my freedom, I want to do as I please, I feel like as if I have the right at this age and how I’ve already been managing my life and paying the bills I have etc.

I told her that, I told her I loved her but there was other things I wanted to do, that I’m not a kid anymore. I told her to still go on the trip with her boyfriend and she would have fun and I’d spend time with her before she left, but she never told me if she would go or not. 

It’s not f***ing fair that I have to feel like **** about this, I’ve tried so hard to become my own person and yet this still happens. She told me it was fine, that she understands, while crying etc. I texted her because I had to go to work, a big paragraph explaining my feelings, most of what I have mentioned here. And I was at peace, until now. Now it’s bothering me, now I feel like the worst child in the world.

My dad told me that I should do what I want to do, that if I don’t want to be dragged along I can say no, and I agree, I feel like I have that right. He isn’t trying to pull one on my mom, we are well past that stage. 

What am I supposed to do? Sometimes I don’t even want to see her. But that would break her heart. And she’s done so much for me I just couldn’t do that to her. I’ve tried to come to my own conclusion, but I need a 2nd opinion. I’ve talked to other family about it, friends. I understand that I should be the one to make a decision, but I just don’t know what to do.

It doesn’t help that not a single one of my friends moms are like this. They all have their flaws, yes, but not in this way.",04Aug2020,1
516,"I'm studying in a foreign country and around a month ago, I moved into a double sharing room in a student hostel. Recently my roommate was particularly loud at night after I fell asleep so I tried communicating the issue with her. Apparently she got upset and mentioned our clash to the head of office( Let's call her Karen for now). Karen, without communicating with me or discussing the arrangement with either one of us, then decided solely on her own within the span of one day to force us both to abruptly relocate from our old room into another building that is significantly more run down with outdated facilities. She didn't discuss this issue with any other office staff, and didn't mentioned a word to me about this entire decision process until after my rooomate already relocated. Now she's actually pressuring and rushing me to comply with her sudden reallocation and move all my things. I signed a contract and paid full fees for that particular original room when I moved in and this last-minute reallocation was the last thing I expected to happen.   What action should I take next to secure my old room and should I contact other hostel staff to discuss this matter? This woman alone seems to be handling all the affairs in the hostel and all the paper is concentrated on her hands.

517,"I'm 16 years old, my mom has schizophrenia but she denies it saying that she is acting normal. We know she has it because she was diagnosed by a doctor. She absolutely refuses to take any medicine, saying that it makes her drowsy.My dad found an alternative, a monthly injection that doesn't have any side effects but she still refuses it. She also refuses to talk to any professionals or counselor. My dad did not tell me about this until recently, he had been handling it himself, but I guess he finally got worn out and decided to tell me. I managed to convince her to take medicine once, but I did so by essentially guilt-tripping her, and I felt like shit after.   


The problem is, she only took the medicine because I insisted not because she realized that she had a problem. My dad now asks me to convince her to take medicine whenever she starts acting odd, but  I can't take it anymore, and either way she is starting to reject me as well. I really want to help her, but I honestly don't know what to do. My dad has already tried basically everything  (multiple doctors, therapists, family etc.) , but all it has done is make my mom distrust everything he says.

518,"Okay so I’ve lived in my house for about two years and took on a roommate back in December. Landlord knew she was moving in but didn’t add her to my lease (if that matters for this scenario). When she moved in, we went on several shopping trips to add decor and miscellaneous furniture to the house. Upon buying these items, i brought up the question “what will we do when we ‘split up’ “? She suggested that we put everything we bought together on a list and then when the time comes, we just compromise and split evenly and pick and choose who keeps what. Simple right? 

Wrong. The time has come. I’m moving out in a month with my boyfriend and my landlord is letting me leave her the house. I tried to bring up splitting our buys and she doesn’t want to give anything up. We bought about $600 worth of stuff together (large canvas paintings, shelves, new curtains, random nick knacks, even a $150 vacuum that she’s outright refusing to give up). I don’t know what to do because it was the agreement we made and now she’s not sticking to it. It’s at the point where I’m just about to pick through and just take what i want if she can’t be an adult and sit down with me to work this out. 

She’s even gotten to the point where she’s upset that I’m taking things that were in the house before she moved in, like my washer and dryer. She straight up ignored me for 2 days when i told her i was taking them, along with the microwave, lawnmower, patio furniture, gas grill, and most of the dishes and pans. And I’m by no means bringing these things up to upset her, I’m basically just trying to get her an idea of the things she needs to buy to prepare herself for when i leave. 

Also, it’s not like she can’t afford these things. She’s very well off, has plenty of money saved in the bank (or so she says), a decent paying job, and a boyfriend who helps out as well. 

I just really do not know how to go about this and take what i want from our shared shopping trips. Any advice would help !!",04Aug2020,1
519,"I (23M) work internal IT for an IA (independent appraiser) and have been working there for 2 years. Back in mid March, one of my coworkers (42M) came in looking like he was ready to start swinging, he demanded to work from home through covid as we have the capability and he claimed to not feel safe in the office. His energy rubbed off on the senior tech (33M) who shortly thereafter demanded the same thing. I was the only one who volunteered to come into the office as I tend to thing long term and figured that all our employees would be working from home so there would be no one in the office, thus, I'd be fine. Our boss begrudgingly agreed to let both coworkers work from home. Right before he was supposed to start working from home, 42M claimed to have back problems and went on LOA, leaving just me, 33M, and our boss. Since covid started, 33M has done little to no work. Hes a single guy living in a shared apartment with roommates. He has a very expensive gaming PC, multiple VR headsets, xbox and PS. During work hours he takes a bit to respond when we message him or even work on help desk tickets leaving me to pick up the slack for not only our tech who is STILL on LOA as well as 33M. Our boss knows hes not working and wants to either force him to come into the office to ensure hes working as there is only 3-5 people in a building normally filled by almost 200 precovid, or fire him. There are only two problems. Our HR person said my boss is not allowed to force 33M to come in as he claims anxiety (his actions on the 6 times when he comes in after hours shows otherwise), and our CIO, my boss's boss, says 33M is too valuable and she can't fire him.

I am going to ask for a raise since I've picked up the slack for 2 people and quite frankly deserve it, but should I do it now (next week when my boss gets back from a well deserved week off) while her appreciation for me actually coming in is still fresh in her mind, or wait until covid blows over and basically claim I deserve one for coming in faithfully for these last 4 months (probably 6-8 by the time this is over with)?",04Aug2020,1

Some context

(19m)


15months ago I had a female best friend, we were really close, I caught feelings but she was in relationship, confessed, obviously got rejected, she was really nice about it she wanted us to be friends
But I declined because it hurt to watch her with someone else
Thing I was most scared of is remaining 'friends' but slowly falling out of contact

Now because that was really shitty feeling I started distracting myself with some stuff i.e (chess)
I played more and more everyday (5000+games online) until eventually I started believing into my own lies and everything was atleast okay

Few days ago I met up with some friends on the beach around 10pm and heared she will be coming too

I acted normal when she got there I only sad 'hi' and thats it


Problem is all of my old feelings came back instantly 
And now all of my distractions feels like lies and that I was living in a lie for a whole year

524,"So I got into my first relationship around January and in the beginning everything seemed okay. Since I had no relationship skills I had no confidence. This lead to me being quite distant. She stayed with my despite that reason because she thought she found her soul mate. But situation did not improve I was still emotionally distant. After about a month of dating she slept with her ex and had lied to me. She finally told me but I let it go cause I for some reason did not seem to care. Maybe because we weren't exclusive and I was  distant.

After the corona had started we decided to quarantine ourselves. This is where most the problems started. She has BPD which led to her being close and caring at one minute and cold and distant the other minute. But her reasoning behind this was because of me being emotionally unavailable. At this point all of you can see the relationship was quite toxic. We kept breaking up and getting back together cause we were both really attached. Couldn't seemed to stop the cycle.  As much I wanted to be with her and around her, as soon as I am around her I wanted to run away from her. We had nothing in common. But we would laugh for hours and enjoy each others company when we both click. This happens for 20% of the day. The rest of the day was us quietly binging netflix or drinking. 

I always thought she was emotionally abusive since she always wanted me around and didn't want me spending time with friends or go anywhere. And when I am somewhere else she would call or text me every 5 mintues. She explained this as BPD so I let it go. I very quickly got used to this level of attention. This is where the problem started. Anytime she would message her friends I would get angry cause I wouldn't get that attention. I would constant make her cry. This would lead to me bringing back the past when she slept with her ex or accusing of her not loving or caring me. This would happen every other day. Most of the time I am the chillest person you'll find but I have extreme anger issues especially when a person I love behave a little different. One day I got drunk and tried to force her to have sex with my while she didn't wanted to. This lead to me getting angry again and made her feel like a piece of shit. She cried for hours and finally got the courage to kick me out. She told me she is terrified of me. The day after she messaged me and said that she's cutting me out of her life and blocked me on everything. 

One thing to note is that with BPD you have a 'favourite person' and that was me for months. But this can change really fast. Her fav person slowly started to change from me to one of her friends which led to me being jealous and that's why my anger got worse. The only reason she changed her fav person is because of my anger in the first place.

I managed to get a hold of her multiple times and repeated the same thing but this time she wasn't taking any shit. Called me some names and her friends took her phone to shit on me as well. 

In general I am known as a pretty "" nice guy "" but after this I realised I'm not so nice. I'm not going to sit here and claim she was a saint but she had always helped me through my anxiety and made me feel so loved. But I tried so many tried to ask for her forgiveness to which she turned me down. I realised that asking for forgiveness is only to make me feel good about myself cause I am struggling to live the guilt of hurting someone.

I am on a waiting list for therapy but the waiting time is months unfortunately.

I can't make up for what I did but how can I forgive myself and move on from it? I don't want to forget but genuinely accept responsibility but all I do is think of all of the bad stuff she did and blame everything on her when I know that its all my fault. 

TLDR: I emotionally abused my ex and she doesn't forgive me and I can't forgive myself.",04Aug2020,1

This of course put me off and I was a bit annoyed and she immediately flipped the script and started talking about how she shut down and that I made it hard for her too talk too me now because I was upset about the comment she made. We’ve talked about marriage and purchasing a house in the near future together I know she is not wanting to have another kid and I would love too have a kid but I see her son as my own so I am content.

526,"I have been working the same job for the last 7 years. I went from cleaning the cars to General Manager because of my hard work and dedication. I have committed countless hours and my life to help my boss achieve his goals, and I have always done more than is required because I know hard work pays off. Since it is a family owned business, I am extremely close to the owners/my boss. Theres the founder, co founder, then me. I am incredibly proud of how far I have come, and I know that I will be successful in whatever I do.

Considering I have dedicated so much time, and I feel a deep sense of personal responsibility to my boss and our organization, I am going to give him a years notice. This should afford us PLENTY of time to find and hire a good replacement. Here are some dilemmas I am currently dealing with:

1. My coworker and best friend is dragging me down. I am very proactive and a self starter, and I feel as though I have to spell things out for him even though he is the Location Manager. He was promoted against his wishes, mainly because we know he is capable, he just isn't motivated to do a good job. After sharing this with him, he assured me that as soon as I leave he is gone. Additionally, he assured me that when we leave, all of our supervisors would most likely leave as well. As I am sure you can imagine this only makes my suffering worse as now I have to not only find an adequate replacement for myself, now I have to replace him as well and worry about leaving my boss in a difficult position (which I would probably cave and not leave at that point, he has done so much for me I would feel wrong doing that to him). My gut says I should ask him to resign and allow me to build someone else up in his place who is hungry and determined to do a great job. He claims he wants to try harder and do better, yet when given the opportunity to work through a problem the other day, he legit didn't even attempt to try. My issue isn't that he could or couldn't do it, my issue is that he didn't even try to work through it even as I broke it down to its simplest components.
2. Given my incredible devotion to my bosses and their mission, I believe I am entitled to a severance package. My original boss (his best friend) received a severance, and my ex-coworker (who probably didn't deserve it as he poisoned the staff) received one, albeit much less. What would a fair severance package be for someone in my position? I have never done this before and while I believe I deserve more than both my ex boss and coworkers, I also wouldn't want to ask for too much and have him feel some type of way. My initial thought is 1 year severance at 1/3rd of my base salary? This would allow them to save in some expenses, and also offer me an opportunity to have some steady income for the year after I leave. My concern is if I ask too little he will probably counter with something less. Do I let him make the first offer? 
3. If you guys have any other advice for me or things that I should consider, PLEASE feel free to comment below and let me know. Anything helps. Also, I have enough money saved to pay off culinary school, and have all of my expenses for the duration of my culinary school paid for and then some left over. I have been a big saver and I have money invested in the stock market as well. Financially I am okay, but I also don't want to keep working at my job when I am as passionate about cooking as I am.

531,"So to give this post some back story, since I was about 13 I've suffered with social anxiety which slowly developed into a deep depression that constantly follows me. I've been through CBT and it really helped the SA side of things but the course finished in the middle of lockdown so I couldn't really put anything I learned into practice. 

I'm a 20 year old, who sits in his room all day playing games. I've been trying to break the cycle but no matter how hard I try I end up back here, stuck looking for something to do.

532,"I never thought I'd do this...well, actually I've always thought of it, but I was too afraid of cutting off ties with my mother because she's the only parent I've got. Though to be honest, I was extremely defiant towards her, and still am.

My mother is a good person, or at least that's what I thought before. Now I don't even know what her intentions, motivations, and feelings toward me are, she hides them behind a shell of ""love"". Whenever she's around, I keep having this thick, suffocating feeling that makes me picture an animal being in a cage, except it's me. She thinks herself always right, and whenever I try to be independent of her image of me, she'll put me down. 

She tries to make a fight out of everything, from me accidentally knocking something over, to me not wanting to go to the swimming pool with her. And she would always threaten me with things like ""Come with me and do this, or you're not getting your laptop back until you do what I say."" I feel not only trapped, because she'll try to push her nose into every private affair that I have, but it's because she'll pull out some cocky excuse for what she's doing that feels morally flawed but she frames it in a way that makes me feel guilty and puts her in the spotlight.

One example:

Earlier, I was rummaging through her wardrobe looking for the laptop she took from me the other night. Now, you might point out that what I was doing was wrong, and I would agree with you there. However, when I do things like that, I feel like I'm striking out against an enemy, like I'm dealing blows to my oppressor, and I feel like I shouldn't be treated this way.

Next, after I unsuccessfully searched the wardrobe, she comes to me shouting at me, screaming ""why were you looking in my cupboards again?"" and I ask her ""what's your excuse for you doing the same thing when you pilfer through my stuff?"". She just shouts at me and says ""this is my house, and I get to do whatever I want in it. You're supposed to follow the rules."" 

This makes me fundamentally helpless, because A: the rules involve her poking her nose into my business and pushing her agenda onto me to try and mold me into her image, ignoring the person that I am. B: if I don't follow the rules, I get ""punished"", so then I feel even more helpless and more angry.

And there's another thing too: I fear her. I fear her because of what she is capable of, and I fear her because her behaviour is affecting me too. I fear her because she can make me feel like a puppet on strings, controlling me and taking advantage of me. And I know that you shouldn't fear your parent, and that isn't normal. Each time she approaches me when I'm on a computer, I immediately close what I'm doing and pretend that I'm doing something that appeals to her. When she walks away, I reopen my tabs and continue. It feels like she's a hunter and you're the prey, and she's surveying your weaknesses, before pouncing on you when you're not careful.

But the worst part is, after I get into an argument or a fight with her, I just want to forget about it, about everything, and recede inside my mind until I can come out again. But forgetting about it only gives her room to try again, and strike at me again. I honestly don't know what to do. As the title suggests, I feel like a cornered animal, and right now, I'm terribly frightened of forgetting.",04Aug2020,1

534,"Hello there. I don't even know if I'm going to post this.

I'm 25 f, and just dropped out of medical school. Not just now to be honest, last year. I feel like I'm too old to start over with a new major (our system is a little different in my country) but what else can I do? I have to get a degree.

This is not the first career I drop out of. About 5 years ago I dropped out of Anthropology due to mental health issues. The I had the crazy idea of becoming a doctor, just because when I was 8 years old I said I liked it.

But studying something is really different to wanting to study it. After the mess that was getting admitted into medical school, when I started actually studying for the subjects, I realized I wasn't really interested in it. What I really, really like, and have always liked is writing. Writing and learning different languages. I guess that's how my brain is wired.

Although my family (oh my poor family) has supported me, and still does, I can't help feeling extremely guilty.

All I ever wanted was to go to university, get a degree and find a good job. I never thought I would end up like this, I never thought I would waste so much time and money. I feel like my life is over and I'm a good-for-nothing.

I still have some time to decide what to do. I have to take an admission text on January and then I can choose my major. I'm still deciding between Psychology and Spanish Literature and Language, I think I like the second one a bit better but I don't know what kind of job I can find after I graduate.

Has anyone been through something like this?

536,"TL;DR found a lot of nudes on my boyfriends phone from various apps and I don’t know if I can trust him again. 

Hello guys! This is my first time posting to reddit so lets see how this goes. 

I (F22) have been with my boyfriend (21) for 3 years now. We have been in a long distance relationship as I was going to university in a different country. I would see him every 3-4 months however for the last year I haven’t been able to go home. I finally am home after not seeing him for a whole year. We tried hard to communicate as much as possible for that whole year, obviously we had days where we fought and it was hard but we stayed together. I have been back home for a few weeks now and had a weird feeling that I should check his phone. 

He has never been unfaithful to me, we live in a small place so it’s pretty easy to find out if someone is cheating. He doesn’t message random girls ever, only his friends and has never really given me reason to worry. However as I had been away for so long and we had fought here and there I wanted to check in case. 

I checked his phone and found that he had a short conversation with a start up onlyfans girl on Instagram and received an inappropriate picture for her and had sent her a few messages flirting. I was really upset but he swore that was is and there were no other girls he had talked to etc. I also found he had downloaded a few live streaming apps that are usually targeted as ‘Meet random girls and talk’, in fact I found he had downloaded one of these apps last year and when I told him I didn’t like it he deleted it and said he wouldn’t use it so that was a lie. When I confronted him about these apps he said he only had them because he like to ‘smoke and live stream when he was bored’, however when I checked his camera roll he had so many videos of screen recorded footage of girls from these apps twerking, wearing skimpy clothes, flashing their nipples slightly etc. This upset me a lot as he always told me that videos and pictures of me were enough. 

I have no issue if he watches porn because I understand we were in a long distant relationship etc but I’m not ok with him watching live streams where he can interact with the girls and start to become familiar with them as he always watched the same girl’s live stream videos. 

Also as I mentioned above, he received an inappropriate picture from that girl on Instagram. He told me he just happened to find her on Instagram and she had made a live video saying that if someone goes and reports an account then she’ll send them a nude. So he told me he reported the account to see if she would actually send something so he was ‘curious to see if she would actually do it’. However I figured out he had been watching her live streams on one of the apps I had mentioned above and had been watching her live streams of her twerking and talking into the camera for months. 

I also realised he follows a lot of sexual Instagram accounts where girls promote their onlyfans, Snapchat premiums and other sexual things. 

It’s very upsetting to me because I don’t feel comfortable with my boyfriend looking for these things on Instagram and live stream apps when he has a gf who is willing to be sexual with him and send pics etc. 

He told me he will delete the separate apps where he watches the girl’s live streaming and that he won’t screen record sexual videos anymore and won’t follow any porn accounts on Instagram.

Basically I have no clue if I should just forgive him as he did not physically cheat on me but I am upset and wondering how I can trust him again with his phone and social media especially when I go back away again in a few months.",04Aug2020,1

I have a 7 year old daughter, I’m deathly afraid of having more children, I have medical issues that can increase the risk of death to me and baby but also the development of a child in utero. 

I have been with my partner for a good long while now 2+ years. The subject of children has come up and he wants one biological child of his own- granted not a massive ask (not that he’s asking for a football team of children) but I’ve said no and dont even want to consider it. 

I loved my pregnancy, it was the best time I can think of in my life. It was what happened afterwards that effected me. My daughter had to be resuscitated several times, I had a c-section as my pelvis was crushing her head and almost killing her, I was alone when delivering as her father stayed for an hour and his mother was a massive AH! I ended up with post natal depression (post partum) and also ended up with an infection due to the surgery and I didn’t stand upright for 3 months after the birth. I lost about 6 stone after giving birth and was extremely unwell. Also to add my health condition makes it more likely to contract infections of any kind with longer recovery. 

I do want to have more children but it’s a massive fear of mine to go through it again. I’ve suggested surrogacy or adoption to my partner and he is very accommodating with this and has agreed if that’s what I want as it’s my body and I’ll be the one at risk. 

He’s an amazing partner and step father figure in my daughters life, (she has a very good relationship with her dad) but I’m just absolutely terrified about having another child 

As stated I would like more children, I’m just not sure I could mentally handle it again",04Aug2020,1
541,"As the title suggests our almost 15 year old Pit Bull is on the decline. She's lost so much muscle and weight over the last year or so. Her motility has taken a huge turn in the last couple months where she can't go up the stairs anymore not even the 3 steps to get in the house (she's not allowed to go down the stairs without someone with her because she's lost balance and fallen down them)...so yeah a lot of carrying her around. She's having super difficult time getting on the couch we put comfy blankets on the floor for her but she prefers the couch. She having a hard time getting her legs under herself to stand and is very easy knocked over once she is. 

She has been to the vet and they think she has cushing's disease but to confirm we have to do an 8 hour test that will cost roughly $300. We don't want to put her through that stress because of her age. Our vet said at this age he understands us not wanting to put her through the test too.

Anyway my husband LOVES her she has been his sidekick since before my husband and I were together. She helped him through the darkest points in his life (long time girlfriend left him etc). She has watched over each of our small children when they were babies. She was also a surrogate mom to our other dog from the moment our other dog was brought home as a puppy (you get  the picture).

 I know we're approaching the end of the road with her but my husband is avoiding, partially in denial of this because he's not ready to let her go (I'm not either but I don't want her to be miserable). I'm trying to figure out a way to make this less hard but I don't think I can. Winter will be here soon enough and I can't see us doing 5-6 months of carrying her up and down the icy front steps and basically guiding her around our yard to prevent her slipping and falling on snow and ice multiple times a day. I just feel like she wont have a quality of life after the snow gets here.

Understandably since this is not what my job is geared for my boss told me I’m out in a couple weeks once next semester starts so I’ve decided to focus on school full time. Fortunately my parents will support me with the bare necessities of housing, food etc. and I have enough saved to cover school until I transfer when I’ll get loans.

Im a high school student with autism who has no idea how to handle everything anymore.

I live in a country where none of the schools had any school the last 5 months. Only private schools had online schooling, the public schools didn't have online (I have a scholarship to one and its the only reason we can afford it)

Now that so many people are saying we should restart this school year is stressing me out because I had school for months. Hating every single secon of it, i didn't cope whatsoever, I did do my work, but it made me extremely demotivated and depressed (I know, cringe, but theres no other way to describe it). I went to therapy but it didn't do much. My grades have droped a lot and its continuing to drop, im stressed I'll lose my scholarship and have to go to a public school where they will have to do the year over again. (And make new friends)

Along with that, were moving to a new house so our granny can live with us (she's getting old and were stressed about her). We were scheduled to move in 7 days from today but we recently found out its gonna be anouther 6 to 8 weeks. This move stressed me out so much throughout locked and its continuing to stress me out (I HATE schedule changes because of my autism). We have a 2 week break from this week Friday (first break in 5 months when we usually have a break every 3.5 months that's 3 weeks long). I was planning on using my 2 weeks off to help my parents move and pack but thats not happening.

My school is back to normal school (with masks and social distancing etc). We're writing exams right now and im not coping (stress from the moving, stress from not knowing any of the work from the last 6 months) and im so unbelievably demotivated and depressed I dont have the energy to study or do anything really. When i do have the energy I pack boxes for the move.

Then another tiny little thing is im super confused about my sexuality, i convince myself that im into girls but i find this one (gay) guy super cute.

TL;DR Super stressed about moving houses, exams, losing my scholarship and im confused about my sexuality.

I'm hoping the kind people of reddit could teach me how to cope with all thats happening. Even if you can only help me figure one of these things out i will forever be grateful.",04Aug2020,1

549,"Hello I’m(26M) talking to a girl (26) and a large issue I have is how she acts when she’s upset. She’s very sensitive in general and basically the slightest thing can ruin her day. That’s not a problem except for how she acts when she’s upset. Basically she wants to be left alone unless it’s to give her shit/do something for her to cheer her up. This sour attitude will go on for days at a time when she gets in her mood. I’ll try reach out but then just get blown off until she gets over it, at which point I’m expected to be waiting with open arms. This is very draining due to how easily she gets upset + how she makes me feel whenever she’s like that. It honestly feels like I’m expected to just fuck off until she’s ready for me again. This happened before and last week before I finally blew up on her yesterday. She listened but I can’t tell if she genuinely acknowledged this trait or was just saying so to appease me. 
She is use to throwing these tantrums whenever she’s upset and then expects the people around her to suck it up when she treats them like shit. She is a very kind and considerate person so I know she’s not doing this on purpose, it’s more like her reflex when she’s upset. I don’t think this is healthy behavior for someone who gets upset as easily as she does. This is the woman I want to marry but I cannot deal with that for the rest of my life. I need someone to be able to talk through their feelings. 
I will be texting her to reach out and she will just blow me off until she’s all good again. I feel very disrespected whenever she does this. This is not just me, she will behave this way with anyone when she’s mad unless they have gifts or something for her. I cannot marry someone who treats people like this.

So I’m having a bit of an anxiety nightmare with my mouth, I’ve noticed I’ve got a slightly impacted wisdom tooth on my bottom teeth, I can see it popping through a little hole in the gum. I didn’t think much of it until I noticed that if I stick my finger in my mouth and pull my cheek it exposes a gap between the gum and tooth, this sent my brain into overdrive and I’m losing my sh*t over it. The only thing keeping me semi sane is that if I just open my mouth, the gap is not there. On the other side of my mouth the wisdom tooth hasn’t impacted but I can sort of see what looks like pericoronitis though I don’t have any pain. Again if I pull my cheek to the side it exposes a gap, albeit a lot smaller than the first side
The part that freaks me out is the pain of the dentist, I’ve been a few times for fillings and it’s somewhat okay, I just get anxious beforehand for some reason.

555,"i had a hotel stay in london booked in may. obviously, the hotel was shut - the gig i was going for cancelled - and since i'm at the other end of the country, i couldn't have travelled down even if i wanted to. the hotel chain aren't \*massive\*, but still big enough to have branches in places like glasgow and liverpool, as well as london.

anyway, i messaged them about a refund and they were super difficult, stating that when i booked, it said in their terms and conditions that no matter what, bookings were non-refundable. even though they were closed and unable to fulfil my booking regardless. i checked their site and they'd changed their t&amp;cs when lockdown started, so towards the end of march. after some scouring on the internet, i found another customer who'd screenshot the hotel's t&amp;cs in january (when i actually booked) and it states that we have the right to cancel our reservations free of charge.

this proved to be a lifesaver, as once i forwarded them the screenshot, their attitude changed. my hotel stay passed with the country still in lockdown, and they agreed to refund me (and it's a substantial amount) within 90 days from that day. i have it in writing.

i've been in touch a few times since to remind them that the 90 days are nearly up, and they insist they're just busy and ""can't provide an estimated refund date"". the 90 days is up as of sunday and i've heard nothing.

worst case scenario, they disappear/don't refund me within the 90 days. if that's the case, how do i proceed? i actually started a charge-back with my debit card before they agreed to refund me, with the condition that i cancelled the charge-back. but if there's anything i can do legally (small claims?) or otherwise, advice would be appreciated. i'm obviously losing my patience with them, and a little sick of being treated like crap.",04Aug2020,1
556,"I'm in my mid 30s, family etc. I've worked pretty hard throughout my career, took any opportunity that came my way, took huge risks and have landed a pretty sweet $1.5 million dollar payday.

I'm struggling with what to do next.

Option 1:   
Where I live now, in a colder east coast location means that if I chose to, I could:  
Pay off my current house  
Invest the rest and withdraw at 2% each year  
Focus on my hobbies which make a small income  
I see friends and family regularly

This is a safe option, but I don't really like where I live right now. I'm not into winter activities and we get a 5-6 month cold season here.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2:  
I'm thinking above moving to the west coast. I lived there for a while before and really liked it. I have a few close friends out there but no family. This would mean:  
Housing cost doubles, I'd need a mortgage  
I'd only have about half left to invest  
My hobbies would probably grow in the larger western cities  
Many of my east coast friends and family would be online only / annual visits instead of monthly.  


This is an aggressive option. It's full of pitfalls and risk. It's also full of adventures, new places, new people, new opportunities. West coast Winters are like east coast Springs, I could go to the ocean in January. My west coast friends are thinking about starting a business that would be perfect. It also means disrupting my family so I couldn't live just anywhere, I know where the nice communities are and of course they are more expensive than the middle of no where.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway those are the two options I'm currently thinking of. Obviously I don't want to make the wrong call because it's not an easily reversible decision: the cost to move an entire family across country, selling and buying a house are approaching $100k. My immediate family supports me either way and trusts me with the decision.

557,"My partner and I are in the process of getting our puppy; he's a GSD (with a little Malinois) and he'll turn 8 weeks old on 15th August.

Normally I would not even entertain the idea of taking a puppy home before that point, because the interaction from his littermates at that stage is crucial in social skills, bite inhibition (though he wasn't mouthy on any of our visits with him), etc. However, some of the puppies were taken last week, when they were 6 weeks old, and the rest are being taken on Saturday (When they turn 7 weeks old). I don't personally agree with this, but unfortunately I have no say in the matter.

I initially thought ""well fine, ours is staying with his parents to learn social skills and make sure he doesn't have any behaviour problems or anything like that"", but then I did some research on singleton puppies (which is what he'd be, for one week); apparently they have problems with bite inhibition, so their parents must not really teach them much of that, as well as attachment issues.

My worry is that having all of his litter leave him, then being left alone with only his parents for the next full week would cause him to latch onto them more so than usual. This, combined with the extra parental attention (going from being 1 of 8 puppies to the sole puppy), might then make it all the worse on him when we remove him at 8 weeks. 8 weeks is the start of the first fear period, too, where negative experiences really shape their behaviour. My debate is whether this is better or worse than taking him a week early.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck between the two choices:  


* Get him at 7 weeks, and just make sure he's socialised and we train bite inhibition 
* Get him at 8 weeks, where he'll have been parented for a week longer, but risk the increased attachment and attention behavioural problems

565,"Firstly, a few things you need to know: My friend (18M) and I (18F) have known each other for a long long time (since we were maybe 9 years old?) but we only really got to know each other in high school. We became really good friends and we both developed feelings for each other and we both confessed sometime last year.   
I made it very clear that I didn’t want to date in high school for a couple of reasons - a) I wasn’t ready for a relationship, b) I’m involved in lots of extracurricular activities so I’m already very busy outside of school and c) I’m applying for scholarships so I have to keep my grades up and do my preparations for that.   


I guess you could say that we’re close friends that are exclusive with each other? We have a flirty friendship, but I never considered him as my boyfriend.   


This past year has been really hectic, we’ve had a major exam every 2 months and along with COVID, it’s been a really stressful time for both of us. I’ve been very focused on studying and yes, I admit that we haven’t really been spending that much time with him or any of my other friends for that matter. We’re in the same class, but we don't get to sit together since our school as an assigned seating policy (supposedly to reduce the spread of COVID). My seatmates are all friends of mine and they're all incredibly hardworking, so it really helpful for me to converse with them so I can learn from them during lessons.   


Yesterday, my friend asked to meet me after school and said that he feels I'm neglecting him and that he isn't sure if I even care about him anymore. I was shocked because we still talk pretty regularly and it's not like I've shut him out from my life? He also said that he's jealous of me talking to my seatmates so often (most of them are guys) and that he thinks I prefer their company over his. Weird thing is that he isn't studious at all (eg. he usually doesn't do his homework and only studies the week before exams) so I didn't understand why he was upset over that as we're clearly just talking about class material?   


So, how do I go about navigating this issue? My whole point of not getting into a relationship was so that I wouldn't have to deal with this situation like this. I already knew I was going to be really busy and I didn't want to commit to someone when I didn't have the time or the energy. It feels like he's blaming me for not spending time with him but our final exams are coming up in 3 months and I really don't know what to do...   


tldr; my friend and I both like each other, but agreed not to date. now he says that I'm neglecting him and I don't know what to do.   
Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks so much if you read all of this btw :)",04Aug2020,1
566,"I am trapped seriously, even way before this pandemic growing up I don't think me and my brother could say we ever have hung out with a friend outside of school before or slept over at someone else's house. Granted we never got the balls to ask and didn't have many friends really but she was the reason why. Extremely emotionally manipulative and overprotective. Despite living in a bad neighborhood and being easily influenced we've never been bad kids we've never sold drugs, got into trouble at school, any fights, or be around the wrong people, typical things young black males like ourselves get caught up in all the time but yet we still have lived this super sheltered ass life and I am sick of it. Because of this I suffer from depression and social anxiety.

I just graduated and turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, I'm grown and ready to do things on my own. I told my mom I wanted to hang out with my girlfriend for a bit and she gave me an ultimatum if I left I wasn't allowed to come back. Saying that this virus is going around (we live in Florida btw) and because she has diabetes she is high risk and I could catch it and kill her. But that isn't fair we've been trapped inside for the entire lock down for months now besides leaving for work and its taken a toll on our mental health. Plus other friends of mine have went to parties, the beach and came back fine. I want to go see one person and she wont let me do that.

I'm honestly about ready to move out and go stay with my girlfriend who I've met about 6 months ago I trust her with my feelings more than my own mom and can tell her anything and the few times we have met in person have gone great we both want to be with each other and she just got her new place. I have a job the only issue is that I don't have a car yet or my license and my girlfriend wont always be able to take me I risk being late and being fired or going broke using ubers. I have nearly $3000 saved up and have seen some used cars under $2,000 I could save up a bit more to get one but then I'd have to buy gas and pay insurance, I also have to pay for textbooks for college soon I have financial aid but it might not cover it all.

What should I do if I leave I risk losing my support system and put myself in danger, but I'd say its worth the risk for freedom. If I stay Im putting a strain on the relationship with my girlfriend and putting my mental health at risk even more because I feel so stuck. If I stay with my girlfriend whom's a manager at Wendy's I could possibly try and get hired and we can work together but thats not a guarantee with all the people unemployed and Im honestly not the most efficient and fastest worker.

I also was thinking about going to hang out with her in a couple of days and seeing if I would be able to comeback if I cant stay with her I should at least be able to see her its one person and we have both limited our exposure.

So do I ride this out for a few more months and hope this pandemic ends soon and jeopardize my relationship and mental health or risk losing my support and mom who despite all she's put us through emotionally I love dearly.

571," I am almost thirty.

I had a great childhood, not perfect, but still great.

As far as I remember, I was super excited about growing up and going to college.

But when I actually did, I faced a lot of challenges and failures. I didn't have older siblings or older friends to guide me. I was lost for the most part. I tried to do my best. I was also going through some health issues and anxiety and depression at that time. I could not study well and when I saw poor results I felt very humiliated. I lost so many opportunities. 

Growing up I had an amazing set of real friends. But in college, most of my friends were mean and shallow and cunning. The guys who I thought could make good friends were just doing it to get to date me eventually and when I declined they just changed. Anyway, I could go on but this is the general idea. I felt very lonely. I am still in touch with my old friends, they are still the same solid people. But it is hard to spend as much time as before because we are doing different things in different parts of the country/world.

Some great things did happen but they were rare.

Now I feel so afraid of life, I don't have the kind of excitement I had about life. It feels like learned helplessness. I feel betrayed by life sometimes. 

What do I do?",04Aug2020,1

577,"It's been months since I've suspected this. And here are a few things in the past I've noticed:

1. I saw his email a year ago and saw messages from a dating site. He told me they were ""spams"" after catching me looking at them. He deleted them before I got the chance to screenshot them.

2. One time, he left the house for a whole day, and went home and I saw a box of condoms and earrings in his bag, but I brushed it off cause men were allowed to carey condoms around.

3. Lately he's been going home later than usual, and deliberatly chooses not to sleep beside my mom. His facebook friend list is private.

TODAY however, I saw his phone open on the dining table as he went out to get something. It was opened to messenger, in a conversation of my dad, and a girl named ""Kat"", and my mom is not named Kat. It was a flirtatious back and forth with ""i love you's"" and ""i miss you's"". THIS TIME, I WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY SURE.

I dont have evidence since I only had a few seconds chance to look at the phone, and i didnt have anything to take a picture of it (sucks).

I've never said anything racist or transphobic or homophobic. However i have had some disagreements regarding the way BLM is handling it and promoting a victim mentality and spreading hatred towards cops, white people having to be ashamed etc. Thus i don't support BLM but i'm absolutely for equality and against racism, i just think spreading love and coming together is a much better way than to hate all cops and say that everyone is racist. Regarding transphobia, ive always stated that i dont mind if anyone is whoever they want to be however you can't change your sex as it goes against basic biology. She also said i support trump, I don't really support him, i just think hes not as bad as many people say he is and he has done a lot of really great things for America. 

These are my viewpoints however for some reason she thinks i am racist, homophobic, and transphobic. She didn't say anything about it the past week but she had been very distant, extremely negative towards me and blocking me occasional times. As we were in a long distance relationship i can't explain to her irl how i'm none of those things and have always been against them. She has blocked me on all social media and is unwilling to listen to me and understand what my viewpoints are. How do i make her understand i am none of those things. if this is the only reason that she doesn't like me then my relationship broke down over nothing. And how can i prevent these things from happening in future relationships so that my partner doesn't jump to those conclusions just because of my political views.

579,"Some back story. Throughout grad school I've been working with my professor and another student in a  type of work study program. The work was to help with my professor's independent research and eventually have the research be published. It was fine in school as I needed money, and the work was genuinely interesting. However there were some problems. Mainly that the professor was inconsistent with when we would meet and what work needed to be done. It often led to multiple weeks of very few hours then one week with 15 to 20 hours or more. When the pandemic started, we were still in the middle of the research, and it came to a halt. 

Fast forwarding to now, and I've graduated, moved to Boston, and have a full time job in my field. Money is no longer an issue. I'm not making tons, but enough to support myself where I don't need an extra source of income. I just got a text from my professor asking if the other person working with us and I wanted to continue to work on the research.

I'm at a loss. The research is interesting and I do like figuring it out and solving the problems that come with it. Though I'm not really sure if I want to commit to working 8 hours a day, then working more after work. I really value my free time as a way to relax and I'm worried that if I say yes, my life will become entirely work focused. On top of that my professor is in Rhode Island, so there will be times I'll have to travel to meet up with them to work. I don't know if this will be paid, but I assume it would be, but not sure how much. 

On the other hand this seems like a great opportunity to put my name out there. I just feel like it could lead to somewhere in the future doing more interesting work than I am now. So I'm worried that if I say no, I could be giving this up. 

Also I should mention this, the text was pretty neutral. As in, it seems like the professor would be completely fine with us saying no. The other person involved has already said yes. 

So I'm just not sure what to do with this situation.",04Aug2020,1

Now I was loving my job. Though I was still learning everything I was really efficient and felt comfortable working there. My manager didn't want to lay me off, but she had to because corporate said so. All employees still in their 3 month probationary period were laid off, including one of my coworkers who started work a day before I started.

A few weeks after I was laid off, I noticed there was a job posting on indeed, for the same position I was laid off from. I called my manager and she stated that all job posting were controlled by corporate and she had no say. To say I was upset is an understatement. 

Now, I'm a pretty person. I don't give up very easily. So when the first posting was put up after I was laid off, I applied again for the position. Of course, I didn't get hired. This morning, I noticed the company had posted a new posting (same position as before). I again applied for the job.

It sucks because she probably doesn't even think about me anymore. She's already gotten in and out of a relationship, where as I just barely started seeing a girl last month. It didn't last long with her though. We went on a few dates, we made out, we had sex, but it felt kind of off. It didn't make me feel how I felt when my ex and I were first starting to get involved. No butterflies, no giddiness...it just felt kinda empty. It was very weird because she was an old coworker that I had known for awhile and I had a small crush on, so I was pretty excited when she asked me on a date.

590,"So about a six weeks ago, my 15-year-old daughter was giving me issues. She was lying to me, staying up till 7am talking to this boy (I don't care if she's talking to boys) when she had a 7am zoom classes to improve her gpa (her idea). When grounded her, I took away her phone, though I noticed she had discord on her main screen. That night, I handed her phone back to her saying she had 10m to settle her affairs. Tell boy toy she was grounded so she wouldn't ghost him. She gives me her phone back after the 10m and I noticed she'd deleted discord. Now I'm curious. Now I'm going through her shit. Going through her DM, I noticed she was talking to 30/40 year olds in other countries, but I didn't go into as much detailed her discord as I wanted to. That first red flag got me scared about child predators. So I grounded her for two weeks, 1 for lying to me, another for staying up till 7am and told her she was banned from discord. I setup parental controls so she goes to bed at midnight, blocked discord from our router and on the Verizon side.

Here is my thing. Two days ago, I wanted to know if she had gotten back on Discord. The child predator thing really scared me. I logged onto her account on my phone and noticed she hadn't been on it. Not like she could, I blocked the hell out of it, but I felt like some kids will find a way. But! Going through her discord in detail this time reallllllly affected my mental health. It's one after another of just shitty things. Examples: Her sister (Sara), 17, has had two major jaw surgeries. Sara had broken when she was really little and it's giving her problems ever since. Unfortunately, it's affected her confidence and has given her minor nerve damage. What does my 15 year old do? Talk about ""You want the opposite of sexy? You should see my sister. That's an example of fucking ugly."" Or. she'll post pictures of Sara's hate and say ""Why doesn't she change her hair? Look how fucking ugly that is. Ugh."" - also, Sara was sick one night and the 15-year old's dog jump over the fence. Since the 15-year-old hardly ever acknowledges her dog, Sara came into her room and cussed her out about how she needs to take care of her dog. Now Sara is a straight A student and I've never heard her curse before. She's got great scholarships for college.  It was a real ""girl power"" moment, but the problem was that Sara was sick and was really upset. Her voice high pictured.  So shat does the 15-year-old do? Record the conversation and post it on her discord for her friends and strangers to make fun of.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is other stuff, like how she lies and says I called her a whore for wanting to wear a bikini top (which in this conversation, I actually encouraged her to do so), but for that, I don't care. If she wants to make me a villain for attention from her friends, fine. But the attacks on her sister really ... hurt and piss me off.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that ever since I banned her from discord 6 weeks ago, I see the changes. She's been better. Yeah, there has been minor stuff, I haven't caught her in any lies and such. But, I personally cannot get over the shit I saw. I'm... angry, Hurt. Something. It has kept me up at night because I keep reading how much of a shitty person she is. And I don't feel I can confront her over the discord comments because so much time has passed and she'll feel like this come out of nowhere. Should I just get over it? Or confront on it because it's not right.",04Aug2020,1

594,"Some context: I'm currently at uni &amp; had to buy a new laptop in September 2019. I used my laptop almost daily but took excellent care of it the entire time I've had it. 

When I got the laptop it made a weird clicking noise but thought it was just the noise that THAT specific laptop made when in use. 

However after about 2 months I noticed that the noise in fact was due to the back hinge cover on my laptop coming apart where the two pieces joined, exposing the hardware inside the hinge area at the back. Id have to keep pushing it back into place, otherwise my laptop wouldn't physically close properly again everytime I used it. 

I wanted to get it fixed but cause of Corona, obviously all the shops were closed &amp; the original retailer had closed their phone lines, so I had to wait until last week to get it checked. I was then told to contact the manufacturers and sent in my laptop to them. Now I've been billed £60 to get it repaired. (I understand its not a lot for some, but as a student, on top of the £400 I paid for the laptop, having to pay more for a fault from the manufacturer now is infuriating).

Even though I'm still within the warranty period they classed it as ""physical damages"" because I'd used the laptop and therefore I have to pay for them, especially since I left it this long (though I didn't have much of a choice due to lockdown).

I've read other people online complain about the same thing &amp; the company's customer services said they've had similar complaints (so it's clearly not an isolated case. I'm assuming it's something with how they make the laptops. How else would you get that many people with such similar complaints??) 

I'm just incredibly confused as to why I'm having to pay for a manufacturing fault. Is this process normal? Do I just give up on complaining &amp; pay the fee, even though the laptop's been like that since I've purchased it? :(  Thank u xx



TLDR: Having to pay £60 for a manufacturing fault that was present since purchase, criticized by company for not going to company earlier (even though everything was closed during lockdown). Do I continue to complain, or just give up and pay up?",04Aug2020,1
595,"Okay so  


COVID19 , Company is making redundancies, one of my friends is going to get made redundant let's call him A.

&amp;#x200B;

They are choosing him because he does next to no work (lazy), late every single day, and isn't that qualified either everyone else is better at their job even people who have been their for a shorter time period.  


He's gotten away with doing no work and being late every single day without a written warning and we don't do Appraisals so wasn't raised there either.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my other friend is also a Director at said business lets call him B.

A wants to take legal action against the company if they do the redundancy incorrectly, (IE Their Selection Process) Their selection process is because he is a big waste of money basically and doesn't do any work.

A doesn't feel treat unfairly, he understands why they'd choose him, it's just might not be legal because it wasn't raised in an appraisals and he hadn't been disciplined on it so he wants to make cash off of this. That's right he wants to make money off of it, not that he actually feels its unfair

I have messaged B telling him of mistakes the company has made that I was told by A so B can fix them because the company shouldn't be sued for this and it isn't doing anything unethical.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong to choose the company over a friend and should I protect the company going forward when A is sending me valuable information that may cost the company alot of money?

Do I just keep my nose out of it (bare in mind B knows A is giving me information) ?

Or do I side with A?",04Aug2020,1
596,"I’m only going into my junior year of high school, but this is the best time to look at colleges. As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized what I wanna do, but I don’t know of any colleges that fit what I want. I want to major in theatre and writing. I hope to become a professional play writer and even actor. But then again, I’m not one of those people who do well with popularity. Another thing I wanna do (since like, theatre doesn’t promise anything) I also want to become a teacher. It’s between English teacher, or an elective teacher that does substituting since elective classes don’t normally need a teacher, they more of need a baby sister who can explain stuff half the class already knows.

My heart is very much set on musical theatre and want to go to a school who’s main focus is the arts (I don’t have any specific school picked out at the moment, I’m more of doing that now), then have the teacher as my parachute as I get there. Is this possible to do in one school or do I have to pick one or the other? Like if I pick the teaching path I can still do theatre, just it won’t be as extreme as I want, but if I pick theatre then it’ll be harder to carry myself.

Any tips will help, I’m mainly just looking at colleges for now so I can aim for scholarships and see which classes I should take while in high school to prepare myself. I am in a college prep program to also help, but I wanna have a list of colleges already to be more prepared. Thank you ❤️",04Aug2020,1

I worked there as well and that’s how I know this person, he’s an ok dude but definitely not my type.

Anyways, he messaged me saying if he could have my snap, and I said sure (like I said I know him so I was like, I don’t wanna be mean).

Today though LOL he asked me for a picture because he “wanted to make sure it was me” and in all honesty I didn’t wanna send it because well, I just didn’t feel comfortable. I said “don’t worry it’s me” but he insisted on a picture and I sent a quick one.

It was then when I realized that this guy is trying to flirt with me lol he said I always look nice and “I’m glad you replied.” He sends the messages super back quickly and if I don’t respond quick he’ll send more messages.

Overall it’s super uncomfortable lol, again he still works with my ex and his friend honestly brings back really bad events with my ex so I feel completely anxious. My stomach has been feeling uneasy since he sent the message. Also, I do have a boyfriend and I feel like he’s not aware of that.

Considering my curfew had been at the latest 11, I feel that I can't complain too much. But I work two jobs right now, one of which I close every single weekday shift (10pm). Sometimes when I come home, I want to go to the store or just drive for a little bit because it is very stress-relieving as I feel most free/independent/in control while driving. But as I usually get home around 10:30, sometimes a little later, that makes it kinda difficult to enjoy myself at all. And my parents are strict about being home by midnight. Even if they aren't home themselves. And this isn't a flexible/situational curfew either. I feel like I'm trapped. And I'm not going to college, so I'm gonna have to put up with this until I'm on my own. But I know so many people (even some of which are younger) that have later curfews. People have always told me that my parents are way too controlling &amp; I just wish I could have a sense of independence. I feel like even if I had no curfew, I'm really not gonna stay out that late. But the restrictions just being there are so stressful.

613,"Even the formulation of the topic felt like a math puzzle, so bear with me. Now, this post is not that much about me regretting in a healthy way with myself: I have drive to push myself forward. If I truly want I have the work ethic of Miyamoto Musashi and this has been tested numerous times in a rigorous CS program where even if my problem solving skills have been laughably low compared to my peers and friends, I have managed to compensate that with discipline that has yielded a near perfect GPA. Now, GPA is not everything, what it represents to me is that I have a lot of room to improve in other areas (socializing, charisma, humour etc.), before any non-trivial limitations by IQ are going to eat me alive.

**But**, there is exactly one scenario, one question to which if I  ever receive the answer, I might very well not be able to live with myself. During the last six to seven years I have had from  time to time the fear that I might have suffered inadvertently permanent neurological damage, in some form or another, so that my problem solving skills (what some might call the general intelligence) have been reduced, possibly non-trivially. It should be said that I have never suffered brain hemorrhage nor blunt damage (to my knowledge) so that I would have had to go to hospital. One time during my childhood we had this really stupid competition with my friends to hold our breath and I won, by passing out and collapsing to the floor. I most likely did suffer from at least mild depression/heavy social anxiety &amp; inferiority complex for 3-4 years, so it is a tough topic to read about how depression can cause permanent neurological damage by killing your brain cells. I have also player American football for one year, done competitive boxing for some years and jiu-jitsu for maybe seven years during my childhood/adolescence.

What I am trying to express is that even if there has never been such instance that a neurological expert would have been forced to examine me, there has still been a lot of room for potential damage, considering the nature of aforementioned sports and the age of practising them. And the fear itself is not that am I or am I not *born* smart/stupid, it is that how I would handle the situation in which I am presented irrefutable evidence that my cognitive potential has been reduced in the past, directly implying that all the sacrifices I have had to make, all the frustration I have had to endure and all the hard work I have had to do not have the value I give them, as they could have been achieved, **by me**, with a slight alteration in how something did or did not play out in the past.

So, I already know that this is a hard topic to discuss about. I have considered multiple times to seek some professional, but I have never taken the step forward as I quite honestly do not see any value in the rigmarole. So I felt like it is better to reach out for a large forum with much lower latency, so to say, to see if anyone else has experienced the same thought or knows someone who has (and how that played out).

614,"I was talking with a woman on a dating app who I thought I had a great connection with. Her profile gave no indication of being deceptive. She seemed really well-rounded and like we had a lot of overlapping interests. Our conversation was very normal, but also pretty in depth personally. This went on for a few days until she hit me with the swerve: She was actually an exotic dancer and she had an OnlyFans page she sent me a trial link to.

Out of morbid curiosity, I went to the link, and after a day of talking through there, I noticed she unmatched me on the dating app. I asked her why, and she said she was just using the app to get more subscribers, and that it wasn't personal.

I suddenly began questioning everything about the conversation. Was she actually the person she had written herself out to be in her profile, or did she simply write a profile that sounded like a profile I would want to engage with? Did she even care about all of the things we talked about, or was that just part of an act? And if so, who invests that much energy in hopes of getting a new subscriber to your cheap OnlyFans page?

It made me very angry because I felt like my trust was violated and taken advantage of. I've never thought negatively of sex workers until this experience. She didn't feel any remorse whatsoever over pulling this, and even went as far to say it was my own fault for not being able to connect with women that I was single.

616,"Hey guys.. so my roommate and I have had class with this young lady for about a year. He used to just call her his classroom gf (but never actually attempted to talk to her or flirt etc). Fast forward a month after the end of our last class together and we began chatting on Instagram. She asked me about a dude who was trying to get with her and to her convenience.. that dude was also trying to pull stuff on me. Well, anyway.. we became friends over that &amp; started hanging out. She very quickly became my first actual friend. I have been here at my university for what is about to become my fourth year and I not once ever felt comfortable with anyone and simply felt like the friendship was pure. Until now, she’s moving soon, in two weeks.. and I have been super sad and I’ve even cried in public because of how much I’m going to miss having my first real friend at university. On top of that, my first REAL girl friend.. the first girl I can have boy talks and just be a girl with. I have had terrible experiences with friends here as they all have been extremely selfish and bully-like. 

So anyway.. the problem. Well my roommate decided to pull a move on her after I kindly asked him not to try anything with her (I was all for him trying to get at her beforehand, I encouraged him to stop being a scaredy cat. But he never tried. I also told him that. That even though I was all for him trying to talk to her before, that it was different now.) well, he ended up confessing and it really upset me. Because he knew how much her friendship meant to me as he saw me cry about how sad I was that my friendship was very short lived. I told him how hard it has been for me to make friends and how she was the first person to make me feel like I wasn’t alone at college anymore.

I confronted him about it, because she is temporarily crashing on out couch until her apartment is ready for move in. I asked him not to try anything again and he got in the defensive. He argued that he didn’t like me telling him that out of no where. &amp;&amp;&amp; I said:

“Just bc I didn’t voice how uncomfortable I was bc you tried to pull that anything on the first girlfriend I made here at Sam that made me feel like I wasn’t actually alone. After you saw how much her friendship meant to me. You tried something. I didn’t want to say anything before bc I felt selfish. But I just wanted to ask. Sorry for not voicing it out earlier. But it was a constant debate inside myself if I was being selfish about it or not. I didn’t want to feel like I was fate keeping her. Bc I know you can feel like that about things sometimes and I didn’t want to make you feel like I hated you or like I was hate keeping her. Bc that’s not my intent. I just don’t want this particular friendship to be awkward after any that may happen between you two. That’s all”


He said the following things : 

“Well, I’m going to be honest. I’ve spoke with other people about it, and of course they’ll side with me because they’re my friends. I did everything in a respectful manner. Also she’s a grown woman ham. I’m sorry you feel that way though. “

******

My response : “I’m aware she’s grown and that you are too and that’s why I didn’t wanna say anything. But then I felt hurt bc you knew how much her friendship meant and you tried. You know I supported you to go after her (with all the force and love in the world) before the friendship. But again, that was before our friendship “

************

“Ham, this is silly. I’m not trying to invalidate you but I disagree. “

**//this was because I said I was aware she was an adult, but that I would really appreciate it if he didn’t try anything **// 

So I agreed to disagree in order to end the conversation and avoid a heated argument. He then said ..

“I feel that it’s fair that we agree to disagree. I respect what she told me and will continue to do that. 

***// this was because she declined his advance toward her //***

Wouldn’t also be a bit silly in context to hold that above as well? I couldn’t have talked with her in the time period that you’re speaking about. She had a boyfriend. Just as you feel frustrated about the situation I do as well I suppose. I just don’t like the approach. It’s kind of cut throat no? 

***// this was when I told him I didn’t really want him trying anything now that the friendship was ongoing, but he did not know about the boyfriend until much later. because he never attempted to find out or actually talk to her//***

This above is me voicing my opinion on the subject just like how you voiced yours. I feel it’s only fair considering you wrote two paragraphs. “

Back story on him, he tends to have really bad situations when it comes to partners. He always ends on really bad terms with all his love interest/FWB. 
He is unsure if he wants a relationship at all.

621,"Little backstory.. I've known my bestie more than 20 years. We met in high school together and have been deeply involved in each others' lives over the years. She is, hands down, the most supportive person I have in my world and always has been. She's always there with an ear, money is a non issue (neither of us is rich. She is just one of those people who believes in supporting loved ones however necessary; even at her own financial expense) and she would drop EVERYTHING to be there if I needed her (I know this because she's DONE it. I've had a difficult life. She's been my rock). There are no guilt trips about the time, money or belongings she's sacrificed. She does it ALL willingly and with an open heart. 

Anyway, a few years after HS, we did what all young 20 somethings do. We married our SO's and started our adult lives. Unfortunately, this meant moving to different cities (her husband's career and my aspirations put us about eight hours apart). So, while we talked, texted and facetimed constantly over the years, visits were few and far between.

Until last year when we both finally relocated back to our home town. We were both so excited! We were FINALLY going to get to spend time together. She has children who I love as if they are my own. I have severe health issues that will significantly shorten my lifespan and now we'll get to spend my remaining years together. We could finally do the things! Camping! Just cuddling and watching a movie! Go to dinner together!

And we've done all the things. It's been (mostly) wonderful. Except... I've been noticing something... concerning. Something that, honestly, I think her parents would be rolling over in their graves about.

She is just MEAN about her expectations of servers. Especially fast food employees. If they ask her to repeat something, the eye rolling starts. If they misheard something and she has to correct them, she will ask me if they're ""fucking stupid"". The other day, an item was forgotten and I made sure to go back in for it just because I was worried she would flash. 

I always say something in the moment (""hey.. you had to learn your job, too"" or ""you've worked fast food. You know this isn't easy work... back off a little?"" or ""they're swamped and short staffed due to a pandemic.. how about a little grace?"" and the like) and she DOES back off, but you can see the attitude is still there. She isn't ever directly disrespectful to staff, but man... you can FEEL her readiness to explode. 

This is NOT how she was raised. These are not the morals and values she's taught her kids. She's had a LOT of hardships in her adult life that most people will (thankfully) never have to go through. She's mostly come out stronger. But there's an impatience to her now that I've never seen before and I am worried.

I don't want to see her in some viral video because she freaked out over taco sauce or something. At the same time, the last thing I want is to make her feel attacked. Not really so much because of her feelings (honesty is WHY we've been friends for so long. We are both familiar with each others' versions of ""tough love"") but more because, if she gets defensive and shuts down or reacts aggressively, nothing changes.

625,"Ok so i’m not really accepting myself as an aro/ace, single and virgin. Of course i am happy for my freedom and don’t want any partner. But i feel like i should, because there’s something inside my head that said i should because everyone else does(also my dad had told that the right person will come someday which scares me a bit cause i don’t want to). I also deal with anxiety which makes me kind of overthinking if i’m getting bullied by other people because i’m not interested in sex or in a relationship with someone. I know it’s really stupid for a 22 year old female to say that, but it’s kind of something i deal with, cause i don’t wanna be left outside.

627,"For most of my life I have been fairly introverted, mostly sticking to my room or going outside and doing things by myself and whatnot. However, roughly four weeks ago I had started in on a bout of illness and it looks as though I'm getting through it. Because it came out of nowhere and I googled my symptoms (rarely a good idea) I'd had a fairly healthy fear of death reintroduced to me.
During that time I spent a lot of time with my Dad and Mom individually (They are divorced) as I didn't want to be alone if I got worse.

Now that I am getting to where I feel mostly better I still find myself not wanting to be alone, so much so in fact that I will pace around the house, my legs will bounce or fidget, and I get anxiety so strongly that I'll get that burning feeling all over my body. It has also been affecting my sleep.

628,"So for some background...I’m pretty insecure. I don’t think i’m the most hideous person but I’m not really confident in how I look. My boyfriend knows that. Today, my boyfriend compared me to someone ugly. Now, I know “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and “well he might’ve thought she was attractive that’s why he said you look like her.” Yeah well, a few months ago I remember him telling me his friends were in a group chat making fun of the celebrity saying she’s not good looking and that she looks kind of manly. I wanna say I remember him agreeing with them but not saying it in the group chat. That’s the same celebrity he compared me to today. He said you “you know, you like ____ in the face” So as soon as he said that I quickly felt my heart sink and I’ve genuinely never felt so crappy.

632,"So I'm a male in my late 20's, and two years ago I began working at this upscale retail store in the Health/Beauty department.. 

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely the complete opposite of the woman that managed Health+Beauty... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Health+Beauty, one full year, I was never written up and never had any conflict with management... 

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired... 

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shawn, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things... 

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person... 

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup... 

1) didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

2) I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

3) He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

4) After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then, I was fired.

***** The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me... 

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups... 

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to do fire me.

Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset.  I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through.

Does this seem unfair?",04Aug2020,1
633,"I am a 16 year old girl and an 11th year student(junior). Over the past years of Highschool I have become less motivated. I do maintain okay to good grades. My freshman year I had a 4.00, and my sophomore year I had a 3.8 gpa. But, with junior year about to begin my motivation isn’t there. At the start of Highschool I was already not motivated, and I kind of just went through the motions. Luckily, I am a people pleaser. So, even if I am not motivated in the slightest I think about how my teachers would perceive me. I want them to see me as a good student. The last time I genuinely did work just for myself was elementary school. 

And my major problem is math. From the start  of my education career I have always struggled with math. In elementary school I was quite below average in math. The numbers confused me, and I would stay in during recess all throughout elementary just to keep up with a normal level math class. I was also not so great at writing and reading. My teachers talked to my parent and advised that I get tested for learning disabilities when I was young. They found that I didn’t have any learning disabilities. And I just recently had my iq taken by a psychologist, and I am normal. My iq stands at 113. 

But, overall I feel like I am incredibly inadequate. I don’t struggle with English anymore. English is actually my strong suit now, and I take college level courses. I also take journalism, creative writing, and psychology. love writing and enjoy psychology. The thing is I absolutely dislike math. I am taking a normal level math class(algebra 2). It is a chore for me to study and pay attention in class when it comes to math. I have to exert so much self restraint to concentrate. Sometimes I get into such a negative state of mind that I can’t even hear the teacher explaining the math. I drown everything out, and then I quickly get lost. I really cannot understand how someone would enjoy math. But, the problem that I am starting to become aware of is that the stem field Majors earn the most. I can’t just become a journalist. It is not a viable career option. Journalism is a dying field. 

I am passionate about journalism. Even as a child, when I was terrible at reading and writing, I still naturally had a love for it. I constantly wrote stories. When I was 8 years old I even created a 30 page ""book""(using the term loosely lol). I have always had a natural inclination towards English. 

Overall, it is all so disheartening. I am sub par at anything stem field related, and so I am destined to just have a terrible low paying job. I want more for myself, but I cannot do a stem field job. I don’t want to. And it is also so hard to see my brother(a senior in Highschool) do so well in math. All of his other classes are also easy for him. He excels in maths. He plans on becoming a doctor(an endocrinologist), meanwhile I want to study journalism. It is embarrassing. He seems so sure about his future, and I am always wondering what I envision for my future career. I am not that passionate about anything else. The only other thing that I might want to do is psychology. I have thought about becoming a clinical psychologist. 

I don’t even have a vague sense of what my future could look like. In school we had to take a career analysis assessment. When my results came back it stated that based off of my interests no career areas were found. I don’t even know how that is possible. I was the only one in my class that that happened to.",04Aug2020,1

637,"My rent is due by 8:30 AM on Thursday. I'm at a total loss about what to do. I've been struggling since the beginning of the year when I lost one of my jobs and had to pay to get my car fixed so I could get to my another job. Well now thanks to being exposed to COVID, my second job is over and I don't know when I can even try to get a second one. I've been using my $600 unemployment to pay the rent and expenses but now that that is over, I'm stuck. I live in a corporate owned apartment complex and they are not excepting partial payments or late payments. Evictions are being filed on Thursday. 

My friends can't help. I don't have a credit card. My parents are not an option. My credit is still recovering from co-signing on a loan for my ex-boyfriend and being on a credit card with my sister and both of them not paying on time (or at all). Payday loans are not legal in my state and personal finance loans aren't an option because my credit is shot. I'm making payments on my car so I have no title (but I would never want to do that no matter how desperate I am).

I tried the two charities listed in my area for rent assistance but they both said they have no money right now and I'd have to be on a list. I even resorted to trying basically begging on facebook and twitter for advice but nothing happened. The rent relief place basically told me I was too ""well off"" to qualify. Im on unemployment, but losing the 600 dollars and just the general mess that Georgia unemployment is   made that impossible to rely on. I gave my landlord all this information but they basically said tough luck and for me to figure it out.

Does anyone know if I have any other legal and safe options here? My landlord is very firm that they will still be filing evictions and that rent is due. I'm legit terrified about all this and am just wondering what my options are and if anyone had any advice about some thing I could try?",04Aug2020,1
638,"Hey guys, hope everyone is doing okay.

I've known this person, let's call her Danielle, for most of my life. We grew up together and for most of our friendship have considered each other ""best friends"". She introduced me into her group and I made numerous lifelong friends because of that. Over the years I have grown as a person, as have the other members of our group - we all have our own lives and we are all naturally more mature than we were when we were children.

The more I speak to other members of our group, one of whom also considers herself best friends with Danielle, the more I realize that she has basically not matured at all and has been using manipulative tactics to keep us all ""sated"" as it were; presumably so that she could continue to control the group. Eventually it got to the point where any conversation we were having as a group would wind up focusing entirely on her and her issues. I'm not exaggerating; another member of the group started to keep a count of the conversations that she derails and so far she has overtaken *every single conversation* we have had as a group since 2016. Everything is about her and if it isn't, she makes it about her.

She recently diagnosed **herself** with an extreme personality disorder that she explains as ""split personalities"". I happen to know from speaking to her husband that she has been checked out by numerous professionals; psychologists and therapists alike, who are all saying that she suffers from PTSD (which is fair enough - she had a rough childhood) but does not have these personality issues, especially none that would cause a split to her personality. The kicker here is that this self-diagnosis came around right about the time we all went to see the movie ""Split"" together when it came out.

I try to be as understanding and accommodating as I can be; in order to be a good friend, I have been there for her to talk to when she has problems and I have tried to support her, emotionally, through her many different career paths. Recently, though, I have reached my limit. I was actually diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder by a psychologist last month. I have started therapy and I am doing well. But whenever I talk to Danielle about it, the conversation is immediately derailed by the likes of ""Oh, I know how you feel. One of my alters has depression too."" or ""Yeah, I've been having nightmares about depression recently."". How do you even have nightmares about depression.

I just don't understand why she can't empathize with someone who isn't herself; let alone someone who has been there for her for two decades. It's like my problems don't matter because her problems are worse. Even though I'm pretty sure she is just making them up for attention.

We have spoken to her may times about her tendency to steamroll conversations. We have talked to her about her immature behavior, her tendency to make racist or inappropriate jokes while out in public, and we have talked about the fact that she has continued to send inappropriate messages to other men (in one case asking my boyfriend for a photo of him in his underwear - that was a very unpleasant few days). Her explanation for all of this always falls back on the idea that it was one of her other personalities in control.

Try as I might, I just don't feel the way I used to feel for her. Her presence at gatherings just makes me and my boyfriend understandably uncomfortable and anxious, and even now she continues to derail conversations and steal the focus. The difficult thing is that she has told me that she depends on my friendship, and that she ""doesn't know what \[she\] would do without \[me\]"". She has threatened suicide to her husband and has had the cops sent to her house a few times for holding a knife to her own throat. I feel so awful for the guy.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be responsible for her taking her own life, but I simply cannot let things continue. She doesn't affect any change when we try and talk to her and she just seems to want to maintain her place at the top.

Maybe I should just move to Mexico.",04Aug2020,1

I was in an abusive relationship and was completely lost in this person, to a point where I was not even thinking about my own future. I do have a closed legal case, (different matter), against this person to prove they are a piece of shit. I am mentioning this just in case it does come up, I can argue for my state of mind/situation back then.)*  

About 4-5 years ago (I was dumb &amp; 21) I may have been caught at a volunteer position fooling around. We weren't caught in the act, but I had my pants down...I never admitted it to the supervisor, and I said I was applying some cream. I know. But I made sure to never admit it. I lost my volunteer  role(expected) and moved on.  Throughout the years, I've had it over my head. Always fearing whatever work place I was at would find out. Always fearing, high anxiety. This is no way to live.

Fast forward, I'm about to settle down, I have a new job, new city, &amp; I'm obviously not an idiot anymore, but I am so scared of losing this opportunity. The volunteer gig is not in the same field as my current one, but it it is shared its industry. I know people fuck up, have done similar, or worse things at work. I just can't seem to shake this. 

The last email the volunteer supervisor sent to me was wishing me well, they'd miss me, and they know I'd do great things. They did not report me to the police, and to my knowledge, nothing was documented. The email exchange (4-5 years ago), was surprisingly pleasant, and it is where I noted that I was applying cream. I am forever thankful to them for not calling the cops or taking any hard action against me.

IDK. I want to enter this new chapter of my life, free. I'm even going by a nickname at my new workplace. I want to enter this chapter of my life without worrying so much about this mistake from years ago. I do recognize mistakes do resurface, but I don't wanna stress myself out forever. I can't anymore. 

Any advice or words are welcome. 

**TL;DR : caught fooling around at work 4-5 years ago (21 &amp; STUPID), it is in my brain and I can't seem to give myself a break, and I am always anxious that my current employer will find out. Even though I am in a new city, have a work nickname, and a complete different line of work(but could still cross their path).  Volunteer supervisor at the time took no hard action.**",04Aug2020,1
643,"Going to make up names for this of course. My friend (let's call him Joe) has been married to a his wife  (Sara) for about 2 years. 

There was a drinking party that included a lot of people (this is before COVID) and things seemed pretty normal. One of my friends (Chris) was talking with Sara for a lot of the night but it didn't seem off to me. 

On our way home, Chris had been snapchatting Sara, where she told him that she felt he was handsome and wishes she met him before she met her husband. We both thought that was incredibly messed up obviously, especially since she was using snapchat so theres no paper trail. I talked to Chris a few days later and he said that he talked more about it with Sara and she told him she was having doubts about her marriage because she's not on good terms with Joe's sister. While I happen to know this is true, it seemed like an obvious scapegoat that does not justify saying such grossly flirtatious things to someone her husband is close to and I'm very annoyed that Chris bought this excuse and let it go.

I was going to drop it because I have no evidence since the messages auto-delete and I'm not directly involved anyway. However, I went to a party a little while later and Chris continued to chat with Sara as if nothing had happened instead of distancing himself from her. I almost think he's happier about the attention from her than he is sad about our mutual friends wife aspiring to cheat. (\*NOTE - I don't think Chris has done anything with Sara and I don't think he's attracted to her).

There hasn't been any developments since this happened right before quarantine, so I've had a lot of time to think about it. Just wanted to know how others would handle the situation or if anyone has personal experience they would like to share. I know Chris won't ever say anything and I feel guilty because Joe wants kids with this woman and obviously wants to build his life around this relationship, and I think it could be potentially devastating for it to come down on him. I can't imagine how depressed I would feel if this happened to me and I found out that my friends had know the entire time.

My fiance and I put in an offer on a home that has a contingency (that the sellers can purchase a new house). They negotiated a pause for 2 weeks on us going further in the process so they can purchase a new home -- which seems like a small window, considering how long it took us to find a place.......

I'm just wondering if we should continue to look at homes? Or should we think that this will be our house? I've consulted my realtor and she isn't very nervous about it.

We are allowed to withdraw our offer anytime because the people selling have a back up offer. We don't own any property and there's no contingency on our end. We both love this house but I'm afraid the deal will fall through. Is this typical to have this kind of contingency?",04Aug2020,1
646,"I (19M) recently moved to a new city/state. Before moving I stopped talking to my best friend (19M) of five years. I am still not sure why. I have been telling myself it can be a sort of defense mechanism to soften the blow of moving fairly far away. However, i’ve also been having trouble finding the right way to tell him how arrogant and pretentious he has become since graduating high school. He is in a constant search for validation by subtly flaunting how much he is being paid and how he has a superior physique. He is constantly flaunting the fact that he is over-worked but doesn’t care. He makes insensitive comments without realizing it. He belittles people for not having the same work ethic that he does. There was one instance that perfectly summed up his character. I don’t remember how the conversation started but it was about an error that occurred at his work and we were trying to figure out what could have happened. I suggested that he could have made a mistake and he could have caused the error. His response was condescendingly, “No, why would I do that?” 

The conflicting part is that his up bringing was horrible. He had horrible parents that neglected him and would make him question his mental health. He had no support from them. His father was verbally and sometimes physically abusive. His father even left the family during our junior year. His mother is very manipulative. He even lived with my family and I for a short period of time because his mother kicked him out. 

He has made it a point to avoid being anything like his parents. He has been there for me through thick and thin. We’ve laughed together. We’ve cried together. We’ve shared our dreams and insecurities together. A part of me feels sad for thinking about him in this light.",04Aug2020,1

649,"So I also don't have any friends which is why I'm posting here for people's input. 

I graduated with a college degree in liberal arts that doesn't translate into any career field (it wasn't my first choice but last resort) and every time I do an entry level job search I don't even know what I'm looking for, I get anxious and frustrated with the current job search process, the job postings, and then have too much anxiety to carry through with it to the point of not wanting to answer phone calls. I honestly would prefer to start my own business or something else, because I'd really rather not be someone's employee.

I technically work for a family business doing some tech things, like working with excel, wordpress, trying to learn access, prezi, word for a variety of tasks, but I get paid very little and its just when a project comes up. Most of my time I spend online watching youtube/twitch/netflix, playing games like I've done for 15 years (i'm in my late 20s), and working out which I started doing in college but stopped completely due to gyms being closed. Essentially my family sustains me.  I just want to make and save some money and pay off debt, one day have a car/apartment

I do love learning things and am interested in a lot of topics, I just have low aspirations. I did amazing all the way through high school, but the college partying lifestyle took over, I even got a year of motivation after quitting drugs but I had no idea about what I wanted to do.

Some of the things I'm naturally inclined towards is writing, philosophy, religion, psychology, pretty much the liberal arts and humanities, arts and music, technology, a little bit of programming (c++, java, and some webdev). I keep thinking of trying to teach myself programming or write more or produce music but then I have no idea how to learn it and become unmotivated again. I've done way too many personality assessments and quizzes to try to figure out what I'd be good or happy doing.

So any input on:
- how to overcome (social) anxiety for job search, and talking on the phone.
- any brain storms on my interests of what I could do, how to get into it, stay motivated, learn a new skill that could possibly become a career, etc.
- what jobs would fit me best especially for the anxiety, honestly just the process of actually getting the job, I feel like once I have it, I can work hard and smart and do it well regardless of the social aspects, its just the initial part that's daunting.
- how did you find out what you want to do with your life if you have and if you've been a similar rut?

655,"I've been living at home with my parents and became unemployed a few months before Covid hid. I tried unsuccessfully to get another job and obviously the job market became even more scarce lock-down began. I recently got a part time writing job offer where I'd get paid 10 cents per cent for some copy-writing work. There will be countless pages and I'll be paid every 2 weeks by invoice for the number of words I write. The pages will be given to me in batches and for my first batch, I'd be paid about $200. IDK how many pages the next batch will be (and obviously my income will depend on this detail).

When I heard of this opportunity, I was very excited to get back to work. I hate not working and I've been feeling useless sitting at home. But my family also relies on the money I need. My father works full time and my mother is about to start a new job (and isn't/can't collect unemployment herself because she turned down a job due to safety concerns). She needed a substantial amount of money for training for this position and I without hesitation said she could take what I collected from unemployment. Meanwhile, I've been applying to full time and part time jobs like crazy to no avail (till now). I also want to add that I'll be continuing to apply for better jobs as I'm working on this project. I just don't want to waste time by doing nothing. Plus working makes me feel fulfilled and it adds experience on my resume.

There seem to be no more upcoming expenses they couldn't just pay for using their own expenses but their fears are ""what if something happens and you can't help us because of your low salary?""

Also, my parents never liked my career choice. They think I'm wasting my life and that I'm being taken advantage of because I'm being paid ""so little"" in their minds. I live with them due to covid so I can't just move out due to finances. My parents want me to reject the offer and look for something better. They even want me to change career fields to something they think is more respectable. This has been a very sore subject between us for year now.

My mother suggested I ""volunteer"" my writing work to the company so that I'm not paid. IDK what the exact laws are but if that's not illegal, it certainly is insane. Why would I work hard and not get paid for it?

She also told me she's not going to accept the job she's training for after all. The job was to be a private daycare teacher/worker but apparently she won't do it because it's too much given her health issues, and it's also ""beneath the training she received."" Her teacher apparently said if she (my mother) works at the job for a few months or so, he can get her a better position. But my mother decided she'll just take the training and apply to better jobs in the field. She also said that the family will need my steady income to help them through these hard times.

I want to do right by my family here and help them through these hard times. I don't want to be selfish. At the same time, however, I also really like this job opportunity and think it's a good way to keep my skills and resume sharp until something better lands in my lap.

So given all this information, should I accept the part time job or turn it down?",04Aug2020,1
656,"I’m in high school and this might be a bit long. So I’ve been in a relationship for almost a year with a girl I like (I’m m) but right around when we planned on going on actual dates together covid hit and since she lives with her grandmother with health complications I knew I did want to get close to her for social reasons because I don’t want to risk her or her family’s health. Now because of that we have just begun to talk less and less over the months and it’s just starting to feel stale. Now over the past week I’ve been in talking and facetiming a couple of my friends from my middle school who are girls, let’s call them mary and emily. Mary I’ve always been steady friends with we met up during quarantine and talked for an hour but last week we met up with a couple of my friends with one of her friends. This sparked talking more with mary than I have in a while which is fine by me we are good friends and joke around with each other. Now emily who is one of mary’s good friends but also a good friend of mine who I haven’t talked to in months, so I was facetiming mary two days ago, just talking and I thought: lets invite emily cause I haven’t talked to her in a while (this is at like 11pm) she joins the facetime and we all talk for like 2 and a half hours but then mary leaves without telling anyone cause she wanted to sleep, me and emily literally talked till four am and our conversation never missed a beat, we laughed, we talked about sports, our friend groups, etc. But more importantly it just felt so easy to talk with her and then the same thing happened again last night but this time we talked for even longer from 12-3:30 am just us two and it was great. And now I think I have a major crush on emily, I can’t help it, I keep telling myself you’re in a relationship you enjoy what are you doing this isn’t right man. Cause I never want to cheat on someone in any capacity it is just such a shitty thing to do to a person, even though it’s just talking I still feel disgusting. I don’t just wanna break up with my girlfriends purely because of two nights worth of talking with someone else, especially since she lost her dog that has been in her life since she was like 4. I wanna try and meet with her in person but I don’t know if that’ll help. Plus emily has had a crush on one of my best friends(who has a girlfriend[I swear this situation couldn’t be less of a sitcom]) for a long time, and while it’s fading and she says she’s trying to keep an open mind I know she still likes him quite a but. Plus I’ve known her for a super long time so she might just look at me as a brother or family friend type figure. I just don’t know what to do.

659," TL;DR: grandpa passed, distributing items to family; relative sent jewelry to my cousins that my sister and I were strongly attached to, without consulting people on what jewelry they were interested in; unsure how to approach this with my cousins and possibly getting stuff back (unless they’re also strongly attached to it)

&amp;#x200B;

 Hi reddit, I’m not sure how to handle this situation so please help if you can...

My grandpa passed away last december. The family has just recently started going through his stuff and figuring out who wants what and such. A shared file was set up, pictures were posted on it of items in the house so people could look through them and circle what they wanted and re-upload into their personal folder. I took pictures of all the jewelry (quite a bit) and posted it on there. I posted edited pictures of the items I’d have liked to have, but didn’t physically set stuff aside yet because I wanted to be sure everyone had a chance to go through the pictures, so I wouldn’t step on any toes. 

Some family came in last month to help get rid of all the other junk in the house, I told the 2 people blood-related to my grandpa that I could take care of distributing the jewelry, as most family hadn’t posted what they wanted yet, and they agreed. Turns out that one of their spouses actually took some of the jewelry and sent it off to their kids (I found out after searching for the jewelry I and my sister were interested in and not finding it)… This wouldn’t be a problem, except there was one piece that I really really wanted, like I’d give up all the other jewelry I was interested in to have this piece (not super expensive or anything, I just resonated with it). Also, my sister didn’t want much jewelry at all, literally 2 pieces, and both of those were missing as well. It’s just, I anticipated that this would be a slower process, of figuring out what people are interested in, sending stuff off if noone else was interested, and having a conversation if multiple people were interested in a piece; that’s what was happening with all the bigger items. 

So, I’ve been texting with the person who took the items, and they said they already sent them off to my cousins. I’ve sent several long messages explaining the situation, asking if the jewelries we were interested in were sent off, indicating my and my sisters’ strong interests in the pieces, and haven’t gotten a reply since the first response “yes I did send stuff off” which is making me super anxious and kinda sad that my relative isn’t talking to me… I’ve even texted them to ask if they're getting the multimedia messages because they are wonky sometimes, no reply. Just recently I texted letting them know that I would be contacting the people they sent stuff off to (my cousins) to coordinate things, only then did they reply with “coordinate what?” and I basically restated what I sent in my first message, no reply. 

Sooooo I’m quite anxious about the situation and kind of want to cry? I would like advice on how to approach this with my cousins - thankfully they are both kind, chill people, but I just hate this situation and feel scummy asking them about jewelry that was sent to them through no fault of their own, just a miscommunication with the sender on how things were to be distributed… but I’ve thought about it and I don’t think I can, or ought to, push this down, because it’s something that was quite important to me, and I also want to try to get the couple pieces my sister was interested in for her, I know she loved them but if she knew they were disbursed already she would be sad and disappointed but wouldn’t want to do anything about it. So if you were me, how would you craft the message to my cousins, expressing my strong interest in the pieces, being mindful of their interests, and explaining the whole situation with the ideal goal of getting that jewelry while not stepping on toes? I honestly do not know. Please help me",04Aug2020,1
660,"I apologize for the rambling and typos I’m about to type out. I’m not in the right mind.

Ever since growing up I’m been beaten for the smallest things. Anything I do that’s loud or something my dad dint like I was shamed and yelled at. He yelled at me so many times that I lost my mind and couldn’t control my body. 

I remember him having fights with my mom and would always blame her for things.

Here is the thing my dad is a pastor and well known one at that. His income helps us afford the house we live in however without me they can’t live in the house. I bought the house to help my mom and stayed with her because she stupid to stay with my dad. Once his abusive ass is exposed the community will turn on us and the life we will in all our minds it will be worse. I was planning to finally date and move on with my life and cut my dad out. But my mom is in this situation.

One day I had to use his computer to print something out but I saw he was in a prostitute facebook page of a korean girl my age. 
Unfortunately this life is normal for us. We were blamed for his outbursts and he blames us for not respecting him because people worship him for being a good pastor. 

I had to go to therapy and I was told that he won’t change and I have to bless him where he’s at but deep down I just want him to catch the corona and leave us forever.. I know I’m going to hell for saying this.

He is an impulsive spender and got our family into debt a lot. He was going to spend again and my mom confronted him and he blew up and made it a huge deal because my mom was against his financial decision. He grabbed a knife and threatened my mom and mom yelling to call 911. Thankfully my brother was there and told he’d beat the shit out of him if he touches our mom again.

Here I am crying and typing at work not knowing what to do. I’m finally responsible and the adult of this house but I’m so lost right now. I thought I was better but I’m still mourning the idea I’ll never know what a love of a father is and the fact I hate him so much. But I’m conflicted that deep inside me is once we separate from him he may kill himself or just he worst case possible. Why is it that I hate this man and still care for him this much?",04Aug2020,1
661,"I've [22 M] been a quiet kid since forever. I won't talk much in family gatherings, sometimes even in friends. Sometimes I talk a lot but only on relevent subjects I find interesting. But even in those conversations I have what you can call a bland face. It's not that I keep it on purpose, I just rarely feel anything/find things interesting or I'm more sad a lot of the times. I overthink things and stress out on little stuff making me anxious and non sociable. But ever since I remember I struggled with making new friends and starting/maintaining/entertaining a family/friend gathering. If someone would tell a joke or make some remark, I don't show any emotion, and that greatly turns off people around me and of course they'd rather have conversation with people who'd show them some response.

I am an introvert but sometimes I like having people around and I want to be able to express some emotions to keep everyone engaged and make them feel validated. But everytime I try, I just don't feel like showing emotions because I don't find the thing interesting and this even happens around my parents and I feel really guilty for not responding with a smile/laugh to their conversations.

I'm the type of person who'd rather have a quiet time with someone with just them being by my side but this isn't exactly helpful in making some loved ones and friends engaged or be more interested in me in a gathering, rather being a side doodle just listening to them talk. Also considering I haven't been able to have a relationship so far.

I know I don't need a ton of friends but sometimes I feel lonely and stuck and everytime I try, I relapse back to myself. So sorry for the long rant but I'd really like some help, so any helpful tips are appreciated.",04Aug2020,1

666,"First time posting on this thread, let me know if I should also post somewhere else. And if you need more clarity on my situation. 

Context: I share an office with our security guy (I learned the other day he’s not a licensed security guard). He works the morning shift, and I work the afternoon shift as the reception/HR assistant. We never really cross paths, except for the beginning /end of mine and his shifts. 

I will call him security guy for ease. Basically, he is an unbearable person to work with. Despite me not even seeing him for more than 10 minutes each day. He likes to complain about the most meticulous and ridiculous things. I will provide some examples below: 
- I wrote the date wrong by leaving a comma out, and he’s corrected my date by writing over it and correcting it)
- I write with a blue pen, he tells me I can’t because it isn’t “protocol”, but he’s not in a position where he can enforce rules 
- we have a sign in/ sign our sheets for external visitors. He will highlight every single empty/“incorrectly” filled column on the paper. 

Not only does he do the above things, if I ask him for a favour, he thinks it’s the end of the world and can’t do it for me. (Eg, I asked him to call the plumber in our little note book we pass to each other between shifts because a urinal was leaking out the bathroom door) - he decides to care more about me writing in blue pen, and ignores my request to call the plumber in the morning. 

Lately, my manager approved overtime hours for me because security guy doesn’t want to work his whole shift anymore. Which is fine, I’m okay with getting more pay. However I told my manager AND him that this coming week is finals for my college semester. I cannot work overtime until next week. He did not listen, and of course today I get a call from my co worker asking why I’m not at work yet (while  writing an exam). I told her the situation (and thankfully I have a good relationship with her and she knows the type of BS security guy likes to pull). 

How do I approach any future interactions with him when all he does is complain and focus on things that “bother him” rather than doing his job. 

TLDR: I share the office with a security guy, who I only see for 10 minutes to relieve his shift. But he makes my work life miserable by not doing his job and complaining about things I do that bother him.",04Aug2020,1

674,"Throwaway because this is hands down the most shameful thing I do. 

I love my dogs more than anything yet I lose my temper any time they gets into the garbage, pull food off the counter (the big one is a medium size dog so he gets on his tippy toes and then the two of them go wild), chew through a pair of particularly smelly workout clothes, or bark, so really I don’t fully demonstrate my love for them through my actions. What’s worse is these are all failings on my part. If I wasn’t so thoughtless I wouldn’t leave the garbage cabinet open, food on the counter within reach, or clothes on the floor instead of in the laundry room; the barking is just a dog thing, it’s what I signed up for. If I wasn’t so quick to react it wouldnt bother me regardless. 

I do dote on them and baby them constantly. I feed them high quality food, never hesitate to take them to the vet for expensive tests or medications, and we go on walks to their favorite field so they can run around off leash and we take trips to the beach frequently which they absolutely love. Not only can I afford to give them wonderful lives both emotionally and financially, I feel it’s one of my core purposes in life. I wish I would just follow through on this intention completely. 

There are no excuses for my behavior but for context I grew up in a house with a lot of yelling. My brother and I are in our late 20’s and when my immediate family gets together there is still often yelling. It’s our normal and I hate it. I completely shut down when I’m being yelled at.

Lets get directly to the point. 
Not one person has paid me to check about you. 

You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email? 
in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean). 

When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam. 

immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account. 

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you. 
Best solution would be to pay me $1084. 

We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video. 


The email goes on to provide me with bitcoin account number, instructions on how to send it, and a couple more threats of sending out the ""video""... 


 I realize that there is a 99% chance that it's simply a scam, but I'm looking for reassurance (or not, if I should in fact be worried). The password mentioned at the beginning used to be my password, but I believe I changed it for anything important years ago, the only things it might be left for is pinterest or some other media that I don't use anymore (isn't my facebook password or anything which he could use to contact my family). 

Should I be ignoring this completely or do I have anything to be worried about?",04Aug2020,1
682,"This year I have made a new friend and everything was ok before around January or February when she began to almost isolating me from other friends I felt like I couldn’t talk to them I had to talk to her. She would literally grab me arm and drag me away when I would be having a conversation with another person. 

Also I felt like I couldn’t say no to her we had to call because she wanted to I sometimes have stressful days and want to relax but can’t do it by myself because SHE wants to talk.

Then lockdown came and I began to feel a bit better about her and when we were aloud to meet in backyards we did and it was quite nice to be honest.

Then came one day when I tried to tell her about my anxiety I had a few years ago and she didn’t care didn’t even pretend to care just shut me down. This made me feel awful.

2-3 days ago I managed to confront her about the whole anxiety thing and she gave a rubbish apology that didn’t make me want to forgive her so I managed to tell her about her “apology” Then somehow I pulled up the courage to tell her about all of the other stuff she did this time she recognised that she made me feel bad and I said I would still be friends with her but I don’t know whether I want to 

So I’m still in school and I’m worried that she will start the horrible things she did last year and then I will just be in the same bad cycle of  she makes things worse and I start to feel like I don’t have a friend and feeling like I can’t have alone time

685,"My daughter (16) has lots of trouble socially. She begged us to let her do school online a few years ago and since then she hardly ever leaves her room. She doesn't have any friends. We've tried to sign her up for outside activities such as art classes and cross country but she came home crying every day because of her anxiety and inability to make friends.

Professional therapy is out of the question-we can't afford it. I've told her countless times that exposure is most important. To try putting herself in uncomfortable situations. I don't know how else to help her.

Anxiety aside, she never leaves the house unless I threaten to take her phone away. Even a five minute walk in the park she refuses. She very rarely opens up to me.

689,"Ok. First time posting. Please be kind. I (32F) am rather socially anxious and when it comes to my friends and family I tend be very much the people pleaser. I find it extremely difficult and anxiety inducing to say no or go against a decision made. As a result I tend to end up just going along even if I don’t really want to. My two friends and I have been planning a cruise for this October since early last year that was genuinely excited for. I’ve put in for the time off, we have paid all the deposits and bookings and it’s pretty much a done deal. 

Then COVID really hit. Earlier in the year it was easier to think “oh I’m sure it’ll be fine by the time it comes around” but now as it gets closer it’s become very alarming for me. My concerns range from the frivolous to the very valid social concern. I am nervous at the thought of going and not really being able to do anything due to restrictions; basically wasting all that money on a trip that I will be nothing but anxious and uncomfortable on. I am afraid going and not being able to get off the ship after. I know for a fact that I will have to quarantine from work after. And really it just plain feels wrong to me and very socially irresponsible to do this right now amidst the global crisis we are all experiencing right now.

I’ve tried to talk to them previously and I feel like my concerns were kinda swept under the rug. They are good people and great friends who have always been there for me through really hard times. However they both had a really really rough couple years personally outside of COVID and were/are banking on this trip for a much needed break. As such it makes me feel like they are kind of ignoring the bad and irresponsible facts of this plan because of that. The cruise line has been cancelling and rebooking month by month as needed due to COVID restrictions so far and so our cruise could very well have to be cancelled/rebooked anyway. But I really don’t want to risk this and I don’t want to go. I want us to rebook until it’s safer and I don’t know how to have this conversation with them again without feeling overwhelmed and anxious that this could harm our friendship.

Sorry for the novel. How do I tell them my concerns and tell them that I do not want to do this anymore without getting swept up and/or angry? Help me I have anxiety!",04Aug2020,1
690,"

Short backstory first, I am a 15 year old guy living in Sweden. My parents have been split since I was about 3 years old and they REALLY don't get along. Have no problem with social life, likes to play online games (mostly Overwatch)


Mom part

My mother is 50+ and to put it lightly, she isn't the smartest there is. She has a tumor in her hippocampus so she often feels tired and sick. She says that because of this she can't get a job, but since I don't know how it works when you have a tumor and since I have seen how long she writes(It is almost like a sickness itself) I have a feeling that her tumor isn't the problem. And since she doesn't have a job she is currently living of the states money(you can do that in sweden) which makes her very poor. She can't afford to give me an allowance, my dad gives me money instead(more of this later in the thread). 

Since we don't have a lot of money we eat cheap thai vegetables mixes(don't enjoy them) and somerimes with crabsticks. Other times we eat some mjöliga (don't know the word for it)potatoes with steak, BOILED(I kid you not) in water so that we get some ""sauce"" as she says to the food. It's honestly worse than the thai food since she according to her only can eat spices like salt and pepper since other spices(grillkrydda, curry) has to much ""taste"". Oh did I forget to mention she always has WAY to much butter in the pan so it always ends up greasy?

Short stuff about her to keep this as short as possible, ask in comments:

- She almost always walks around naked in our appartment, I hate and she knows it but she won't stop.

- She can never stop talking about random and uninterested things, either it's conspiracies or how she is inviting friends that she want's me to meet home to us, I hate this since I don't wanna talk to her 50+ friends nor listen to how smoking can PREVENT lungcancer and make your lungs stronger. She  also often repeats herself many times over and keeps on telling the same stories of how she had it when she was young (I know them word for word at this point).

- She keeps slandering my dad, telling me that he abused her gravely, both physically and mentaly.

- She always has a ""lover"" who she thinks is the perfect being in the universe. This can switch every other 3 months. When they say one slightly rude thing about her she always plays the victim card and tries to make them feel bad so that they stay. Problem is, every single one is already married and is just looking for some sidebitch that they can have sex with whenever they want. Did I forget that anytime that they are about to ""do it"" they also just HAVE to let me know that they are gonna have sex and that I should stay in my room with headphones on. This has gone on since I was 11 btw.

- For some reason she thinks that it's a good idea that despite being so poor, to keep 3 pets(2 cats, 1 dog, all lovely pets but we can't afford to keep them and she knows it)

- Me and her have no similar interests, nothing where we can enjoy time together. She thinks that inviting friends home and having a teaparty(I am a 15 year old male who hates interacting with other people, exept friends and some family and she knows this). Like, what do I do in this situation? I have told her that stuff needs to change but she thinks that we are in the 80:s or something.

- Also thinks that my father is gonna hack her computer, the wifi and probably all other things in this house.

I can bring up more stuff but ai think this is enough to give you the picture

Dad part

My dad is a 50+, currwntly living with F, my stepmom. He's a programmer, works for a big company so he isn't exactly poor. Stepmom is a dentist so there are no problems there. Dad's a really nice guy, he has the same viewpoint as me on socialising. He's currently teaching me to how to program since I wanna be a programmer in the future. He is a S-Tier cook. He likes to play battlefield with his brother (my uncle) on his freetime, takes a long run sometimes when he feels like it. He plays CSGO with me, my brother and my uncle sometimes (2v2) although isn't the best. Overall, really nice guy, smart and kind. He always asks if there is something that I need, if yes then he buys it for me(mostly clothes, I hate shopping). I really enjoy my time here, much more than with my mother. My father doesn't enjoy exactly enjoy ""flexing"" even though he is rich(example: He owns a 13 year old toyota) He doesn't care about if it's a speciel brand, just the quality.) He even has reddit, don't know his name though, he got that part quite quickly. He thinks that my mother is just very sick in her head and is making her stories up in her head. 

On the offchance that this post gets seen by him and he recognices this situation, please ignore it! I will take it with you if I want any changes.

Main part:

I honestly don't enjoy my time with my mother. Her personality fits right in with people that I don't like. At this point the only thing that is keeping me from moving is the pets because I fucking love them and for the fact that I am lazy and don't know if there is any legal stuff or something else. I also don't know if I will regret it later, splitting with my mother. I have seen a lot of stories on here where people have both regreted splitting up and some where they are happy.

I know that I would be very happy if I moved in with my dad but I don't want to make a decision that I will regret later. My mom has told me that she is only still living in Sweden because of me and that she would probably commit suicide without me since she has nothing else to live for according to her. I'm also afraid that if I move away that she will go to my school and make a scene (Mother lives right next to my school, father about 5km away or something) since she isn't that healthy in her head. She also wants me to tell her 6 months before (if) I want to move out or she will die. No idea hoe that works but don't wanna risk it. 

Anybody have some helpfull advice, I will take anything helpful at this point. If I was unclear then just ask me in the comments.

tl:dr
Don't enjoy living with mother at all, only staying because of the pets and because I don't know if I will regret it later. Will enjoy living with father, don't want to make a mistake. Any advice?",04Aug2020,1
691,"Let me lay it out for you. 

I am about to be a Junior in college while she will be starting to attend college next year. She needs to apply to colleges around January of 2021, and I plan on going straight to grad school which I can’t apply for until December 2021. 

The issue is I still don’t know which area I’d like to specify into for grad school, ontop of my application period being so much later than hers. It’s also difficult because my parents are helping me pay for college, and expect me to go straight into grad school (no gap year etc). 

I’m not sure what to do, because even if I know what I want to specify into I can only narrow down the college list so much. Plus I don’t want to hinder her, she has her own major and colleges to look for.

I know this situation is extremely tricky, but I’d like any and all advice if possible.",04Aug2020,1
692,"Firstly throwaway account because IDK who reads these and also it's a bit of a lengthy story. Bear with me.

From pretty early on I knew I was gay. I also knew this would go over very poorly with my family as they are full conservative republicans who openly voiced how disgusting homosexuality was my entire childhood. I knew unless I wanted to end up in conversion therapy I should keep my mouth shut until I was both over 18 and didn't live with them to break the news to them. Now on the flip side early on I guess you could say the entire time I was growing up I was the ""favorite"" compared to my 3 sisters. I never really did anything wrong, did well in school, was a leader in our marching band, etc. This was always my way of making up for the fact I was gay, I figured maybe if I was a good enough person with everything else I do then when I came out my parents would have enough of a reason to still love me. Fucked up I know but welcome to the life of a queer person. Sophomore year of college I decided to come out, man what a shit show. I was disowned by my parents for a period of time where I was told it was ""best I not come home for a while"" due to my fathers disgust and the general state of chaos me being gay had caused my parents. They took it hard, told me i was fucked up and in general made it apparent that they would never really accept this side of me. Which was expected, I mean it hurt but I spent my entire childhood prepping to lose my family forever when they found out so I wasn't super shocked, hurt, but not surprised. Fast forward a year, we are managing a relationship but it's rocky. We just kind of didn't talk about it anymore (still don't) and were trying to figure out where to go from there when I found myself in an extremely abusive relationship and ended up being in a pretty bad spot. I broke down completely, this wasn't the first time this happened to me but after everything that had happened over that last year I truly just lost my shit. I texted my parents that I needed help or I was going to end it all because I did not have enough strength to keep fighting for a life that continually let me down. I will give them credit, they were great to me during this period of time, helped me out completely after I couldn't work, could barely leave bed, and genuinely didn't want to exist anymore. They made sure I was okay and for that I was really grateful. But I felt like they owed it to me, I had never done anything wrong as a kid and never needed help, paid my own way so now that I needed them I wasn't going to feel bad for it. Now my dad and uncle own their own company and have for years, I had worked there when I was a teenager but never got along well with the guys who worked there and just really was miserable so I up and quit one day (didn't help I did this less than a year before I came out). So when I started recovering from the ordeals I decided I would try and help out my dad again as a way of saying thank you for helping me and that's where this whole thing really gets us up to date. That was three and a half years ago. Within one year of my entire life falling apart (gave myself a deadline - I am a virgo through and through) I had gotten myself pretty stable, switched majors to marketing, and was on track to run the companies entire marketing division. The only issue is that to my dad, me being gay really wasn't real. He constantly makes homophobic remarks, jokes, comments, you name it. When I first started I would just silently cry at my desk because I really didn't have any other options. I felt like garbage and was being treated like it but at least I was making money so I stuck with it. I poured myself into my work and over the course of the last three years I will say I have become pretty impressive. I do all of our desktop publishing, garner hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through being an inside sales guy for us as well, I take and edit all of our photos, videos, catalogs, etc. You name it I do it. But I am very unhappy. I feel like me and my father never moved on from him being a complete dick to me and he keeps it up to this day. He has never really apologized for making me feel this way and last year when my brother in law made homophobic comments on facebook I let everyone know they hurt my feelings, he got mad at me and made it clear my emotions on the matter did not really matter because my brother in law did nothing wrong. I am now at the point where I wake up angry. I walk in to this workplace everyday with the dream of it burning to the ground. I have worked my ass off and turned myself into a highly capable person who helps make this man millions of dollars a year and it's still not enough. I don't get apologies when he's a dick. I don't get thanks for doing my job better than anyone they've ever had. I don't get anything but the reminder everyday that I finally set myself free of these people and got so fucked up I blindly and willingly let them become such a big part of my life again only to realize one day that nothing was different. I live in a state I hate. I work with people who disrespect who I am at my very core and I want to walk out. I want to leave it all behind, take my dog, and head for the hills.

So I guess my question is, am I the asshole for wanting a happier life?

701,"Tl;dr, I can't stop myself from being a political reactionary on sites like Twitter and Instagram, it's taking time out of my day and making me depressed, I want to stop but can't. 

Recently, politics have completely taken over our lives; for better or for worse. It has swept every social media platform I use (Twitter and Instagram), rooted itself in every conversation I have with my friends, and ultimately made me an incredibly politically-minded person.

While this might sound like a positive thing, I don't think I'm a politically-minded person for the right reasons. It seems to me that I'm being political for the controversy and the reactions, and I hate myself for it.

Every time I see a tweet/story post talking about BLM/COVID/Pride etc, I click on it in search of controversy. I look through the comments to find anyone disagreeing with the subject matter, then go onto their profiles, then end up falling into a rabbithole of beliefs that I find offensive. At this point, I nearly always spend the next 2-4 hours arguing with someone about a topic that neither of us are going to compromise/change our minds over. I am fully aware of how futile what I'm doing is, but I keep doing it anyway. 

I'm not entirely sure why I argue online, but I want to stop. I've tried deleting Twitter and Instagram but every time I do I reinstall them within a day. It's gotten to a point where 90% of the conversation I have with my friends consists of me mindlessly ranting about something political and then begrudgingly nodding along with me. I hate this but I physically can't stop myself from doing it, it's like an unbreakable habit.

I'm a massive indie music fan, and I love Zelda games, The Simpsons, and linguistics. I want to stop wasting my time on pointless political ""debates"" and spend more time enjoying the things I like. I've come to Reddit because I have no one else to talk to about this, any advice would be massively appreciated.",04Aug2020,1

704,"just your average guy in the internet chilling and playing a games and I met a girl on a online game called ""VRCHAT"". Its been cool and all for 3 weeks and we hanged out a lot just like when you meet someone who have the same interest as you online. Just like that I thought I met another online buddy we have exchanged discord names and usually chat with each other and I was invited to a discord group chat that she is part of. long story short she confessed to me and told me she liked me, I never met her, I don't know what she looked like but surely I like her too because of her personality and point of view in life so I agreed and decided to get to know her better and we started ""going out"" as I would call it. We got to know each other and found out that we were actually just a few miles away. We went deeper in to a relationship that usually revolves on hanging out with each other online the whole day. We usually call each other on discord and do things like games and watch shows. Of course nothing is perfect we've been to a few quarrels and disagreements usually because of how I do things and how she says that it was okay but it was not really. Like for example I always get her caught online on another call so I asked her If I could check her discord account and I will provide mine as well. She agreed and told me that she's totally cool with it and that if it calms me she won't be bothered by it, and fast forward this past few week we have been to a quarrel I can't quite recover from. It started when she seemed to avoid me online, we missed each other's call and some times she deliberately ignores my messages and reply later on. We been together in the past 4 months of quarantine  and It was never to this point so I made dummy accounts and joined group calls and always notice that the usual laugh that she has always shows when she is together with other people so I decided to confront her about this because I've been so open to her that I trust her even with my own bank account. So she pointed out that we have been to close with each other although she was the one to initiate to call all day and she was the one to confess I felt that I was actually chasing her and got jealous with her male friends. She told me that she needed space, when I was always asking her if I was too clingy she always replies with ""I much more clingy than you!"" so it hit me hard and snapped and pointed that out to her that she is the reason why I became so attached to her. I told her that ""I feel that you're already done with me so you're gonna ditch me now"" when she heard that she replied sorry and that she really wants us to work out. I told her also that I was offended the way that she acted this past few weeks and so later on she replied that "" I want us to work out but if I always hurt you like this I don't know what to do, so I'll leave it out to you will you leave me or will you stay"" It felt like she was forcing me to leave her (she had 4 Ex online and that all of them left her but later on she confessed that she was the one who left 3 of them) so I told her that I will stay but now it seems that every thing has changed and its cold on both ends.

705,"I met my girlfriend at uni. She was in my halls in first year and we did a similar course. Her mum died while we were in first year, and as (at that time) we weren't much more than acquaintances she didn't talk to me about it, and I never asked. 

We got together in our fourth year and now I know all about the situation.

Her mum's birthday is soon and I'm not sure how best to approach it?

Do I try and distract her so she doesn't feel sad, and for the most part ignore the significance of the day?

Do I talk to her a lot about her mum and pay great attention to the day itself, and try and celebrate her life?

Do I do something in between/something completely different?

708,So as the world plummets down into a pandemic with no end in sight the United states continues to be less than prepared than most. I find myself in a very uncomfortable situation as many of us are however am looking for some feedback as to if I should be as concerned as I have been. I moved out from my parents home back in September last year and since my lease was now up as of July 31st I found a new apartment to call home. My job pays very well and I will be attending university soon in Los angeles. I did not want to go home because I have such a deeply rooted life here It just seemed like a bad idea at the time. For I'd have to throw most of not all future plans away. So I decided to stay. I moved In with my girlfriend instead of getting a roommate and we both have a collective 15K in savings. Obviously we don't want to have to use any of it since we are saving for school but nonetheless it's there. My rent is not an issue for us however things can change for the worst at any moment during a pandemic. And with unemployment benefits now diminishing to a near useless amount I find myself regretting not just going home. What would you have done in my position? Because things are great now but did I just take a huge gamble with my own livelyhood?,04Aug2020,1

Hi everyone, (Disclaimer: I am on vacation and desperately needed to vent a little, since my family situation is driving me nuts).

​

Some backgrond first: I'm a male 45 yo with a successful career and a loving wife. We did not have kids of our own and god did we try....! My wife has a very close relationship with her sisters, particularly with one of them mother to our niece ( 7 yo whom we love dearly and she absolutely adores us) and our nephew (11 yo). I am currently on vacation with my wife and my in laws and children( I paid for the trip in whole) and it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to handle the level of stress my nephew is inducing on me.

He is a generally nice boy, although he was diagnosed with ADHD as a little boy, and most of the time he is quite likeable to be honest. I clearly have a soft spot for my niece and it shows, and I just do not have the same affinity or the patience for my nephew, which also shows in my angry/comtemptuous faces. He knows I detest bad manners, selfishness and greediness (specially at the table) and he is a constant source of problems, taunting his sister and making her cry, breaking things and always acting like a vulture on a perch waiting to see what can he get from any situation, be it access to my cellphone, computer, my Oculus Quest, money etc... everything he does follows an agenda and aims at his own instant gratification.

I am constantly reproached by my wife and in-laws for my demeanor towards my nephew because it's not the same than with my niece, and ""he may feel hurt"" but the more time I spend with him, and it's been a lot during the last week (with one more to go) the more I find him unsufferable. He is driven by interest, needy and pretentious (as if he knew anything about anything) always trying to be the center of attention.

My impulse is to ignore him, but that's not an option, and honestly the more he tries to get things from me the less I am willing to give him anything, but my wife is giving me hell with the damm kid forcing me to put on a smile, bite the bullet and pander to the lil' bastard.

I feel bad because such an insignificant brat should not be able to fuck me up this bad, but he is literally ruining my vacation, getting me in a terrible mood and eliciting reactions from me that show me in a bad light.

I feel I should be well above this kid and not let him get to me, but he is being enboldened by my wife and parents and they have reached the point of mocking me for that, while freeloading, and that's more than I am willing to accept.

Any sensible advice on how should I proceed to avoid things getting out of hand in the remaining 8 days of vacation?. I most certainly will not be doing this again, but I don't want to have a family drama on such a ridiculous (is it?) excuse.

Sorry for unloading my frustration and anger here, and sincere thanks for any advice or perspective you could offer on this situation.

​

Thank you very much.

712," 

My best friend says shes dealing with a lot of emotional things, a lot of stuff from her past, people that hurt her and stuff, shes going trought a hard time with her family as well, her parents lost their jobs and shes the only one working right now.

She says she needs to be alone and focus on working and college, and i totally understand and respect that, but she was really hurtful towards me saying some really nasty things to me, when i was always kind and understanding towards her, she told me things she did in her past and i never judged her for anything and was always supportive, i would do everything to make her smile every single day.

She said i was the most amazing person in her life, that we had an amazing connection that she never had this with anyone, and i feel the same towards her.

Suddenly she changed so much towards me saying things that i would never say to her , i understand shes dealing with a lot of things but she even said our friendship isnt the same anymore that our connection isnt the same because things have changed in her life, i dont understand that.

She would share everything with me , saying i was always supportive and understanding, and if she ever had to make a decision she would come to me.

Now she says she doesnt like to share what goes on in her life because thats not the type of person she is, when she always shared things with me before.

She started questioning if i was in love with her, (wich im not) saying we would never work out as a a couple because we care too much about each other, when i never even flirted or said anything to make her think that.

She said she wants to be alone and that shes been ignoring everyone lately , but she post pictures on intagram hanging out with other people, and this is making me really confused.

Ive been leaving her alone for the last 3 weeks because thats what she asked, but i feel like shes lying to me about something, and its making me feel really bad. What is going on ?",04Aug2020,1

715,"Me and my friend Z we both graduated from the same university. In second year while we were discovering what we want to do our specialisation in I had become very interested in film making. She got interested because of me. Turns out she has few friends who are already in that industry and can help her out so she had an upper hand. I made projects and she blatantly told teachers that she did it and I was a part of it. I wasn’t too bothered by it. Then got very underconfidant and left my film making dream to pursue graphics and illustration and things were going really good at that front. Then after college she was working in films I was working in design agencies. She makes short films and a lot of times she has borrowed my help and copied a lot of my styles in her work. I feel bad but I just let it slide. Then she applied for masters in films and has gotten into a good german school while I have left my job in graphics and have turned to making paintings the traditional style. Honestly I haven’t been able to get a break in my painting career and I feel like I’m losing hope while my friends out there doing great things getting selected for so many international awards and what not. I feel insignificant and feel very shit. I know I’m jealous and a bad friend I supported her in everything till now but maybe the fact that she’s going to be going away and was actually my only steady friend and I’m not going to be able to spend time with her and also add being jealous into the equation is turning it into a huge roller coaster for me.

717,"so in mid july i had a consultation with an oral surgeon because one of my wisdom teeth had become a problem. i was told that they would 'try' to 'waive the deductible' and that the entire cost of my procedure would be around $650. i noticed that one of the tooth extactions alone cost $520 and it was not one of the teeth bothering me so i opted to not have it removed.

this reduced the price that i had to pay to be about $80, which i paid on the day of the procedure.

it has been about 3 weeks and i have just gotten a bill for $750. i only agreed to have the procedure done because i was lead to believe that the total cost would be $80. i've called them and they said that it is the insurances deductible, which they also claimed that they would 'try to waive'. the thing is i wouldve never agreed to have the procedure done and they were not upfront to me about the total cost.

718,"Myself [20f] and my co-worker [21m] recently started dating and everything is going really well. I really like him and it isn't against the policy to dat co-workers where we work.

At the beginning the two of us decided to keep it a secret from the other workers because we weren't serious and we didn't want others to feel awkward if nothing ever came of it (if that makes sense). 

However, we are now in a more serious relationship and my boyfriend has hinted to me that he wants to tell the other people who work there (some of whom are his close friends). He said he won't say anything without my consent but he has made it pretty clear that he is done with keeping it a secret (which I completely understand - it has been pretty hard to keep it a secret at times).

I am torn. I really want to tell them the truth because it has been pretty hard to hide it at times, but I am worried about so many things. Firstly, how the hell do you mention that? (the two of us are a pretty unexpected couple so its not exactly easy to bring into conversation). I have also seen lots of other relationships between co-workers end and it does make the other people on shift feel kinda awkward. I am just worried.

719,"I started dating my boyfriend July 9th, 2020. In my mind, this was going to be a fun and casual relationship for this summer before we both go off to college. 

However, I notice him falling more and more for me, and I feel like he is starting to depend on me for his happiness. He is depressed (because of past trauma), and I have had experience with depression so I am always there for him, but he brings up the idea of a long term future a lot. He not only wants to do long distance, but he keeps spending large amounts of money on me. It has been less than a month since we started dating, and I feel like it he is moving way too fast. I know in my heart I don't feel the same way he does, and I have tried to hint at the fact that I want to slow down but I don't think he understands.

On top of this, our one month anniversary is Sunday. He wants to do something big and special for me, and I appreciate it, but I have expressed to him that I don't need him to do that. It makes me sad to think of him doing all of this for me when I will eventually have to let him down. 

I like him a lot and I care deeply for him. With time I feel I could reach the same way he feels, but we do not have that time. Since he is depressed, I know he will take this **very** hard. I know his emotions and reactions are not my responsibility, but I do not want to hurt him. I need advice on how to tell him next week that i do not want to continue this relationship. I ultimately know that doing long distance will not only hurt him more in the end, but it would not be good for me. I want to start college independently, and I am in a good mental state right now. Please let me know if you have advice on ho to tell him this, and if I should wait until the day before he leaves or do it now.

721,"Dear Redditors
I need advice on a fairly big subject for me. I'm currently attending a Grammar School. It started when I met my GF. I got into the new year and was excited to learn and do good in school. But then the thought came that because I have a Gf at this early age that my school performance would Decrease. This thought was reinforced when I suddenly made worse grades and it all went downhill from there. I learn about 7 days in advance for exams and then 1 hour every day which I think is a lot. But nevertheless the grades went down, not much, but still a fair bit. I always thought that it was bc. of my GF and idk if that's true or it's the lack of confidence. Another thing I feel is that always when I try to concentrate on things like listening to the teacher that I don't remember what they said because I kept telling me that I had to concentrate,same thing with reading long texts and books.
So basically, I'm concerned that my GF has an impact on my school performance and or that I'm getting dumber and that I actually am not smart just learn a lot. (Tbh there is one guy that learns a lot but less then me and does so much better than I do.)

723,"I (18F) just started college last week, I choose a bio major. My dream was (and still is) to become an astronaut, but I found out NASA doesn’t allow people who have mental health issues (I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and OCD).
At first, I though I didn’t like my major, but now that I’m taking classes, I like it. I’m starting to love it. 

But I also have other dreams, like becoming an actress, a writer, an ice skater, etc.
I think I should just stay in my major because although it’s not high paying, I’d have stability, plus, I could maybe become an astronaut if I work even harder. But the thing is, I don’t think it’s right I’m staying on a major just because of the stability. 

I don’t like to feel like I’m studying.
Or I could also pursue my passions whilst finishing my major, but I don’t even know if that’s possible. 

My mom (53F) told me to stay in my major until we can confirm I have all those things with brain scans (I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist, but my mom insists I should just get a scan)

729,"Sorry this is so winded and ranty, I'm just at a loss. I feel like I can't ever win, and because it's such a pattern, something is wrong with me and I don't know what to do.

- I worked two jobs for some time last year, one being an overnight. I did everything I could to block out noise, earplugs, white noise, etc. I lived in the basement of a townhouse, and every morning right after I'd go to sleep, 8am, my roommate's boyfriend was upstairs stomping around for a good 45 minutes, keeping me awake.

- I moved to a one bedroom upstairs apartment, while still working two jobs. The downstairs neighbor had a beefy sound system that would vibrate the floor and wouldn't turn it down when I asked. I fought it for months and months with no relief, and I was so incredibly sleep deprived.

- Downstairs neighbors moved out right before summer started, and now I couldn't sleep because it was too hot. AC did nothing, it wouldn't go below 80 inside most nights no matter what I tried to do. Woke up every night (quit my overnight job by then) sweating like crazy and would be up for a good hour or more.

- Moved in with my mom for pandemic reasons. It was nice for a week. I hadn't slept so well in I don't even know how long. Her husband gets up at 330am, and it didn't bother me at all. Finally some relief? Nope, my stepbrother suddenly moves into the attic room after a breakup and gets up at 5am for work. Attic stairs are right next to my bedroom door. He wears heavy shoes and clonks down the stairs, and then slams the door at 5am. I've woken up every day since then and haven't gotten back to sleep afterwards, getting maybe 4-6 hours of sleep a night.

I'm so exhausted all the time. I feel sick and weak and unmotivated and like I'm in a dream every day. I feel like I'm missing out on life because my head is so fuzzy. I. Can't. Get. Sleep. I've been dealing with being a light sleeper for YEARS and I just can't get a break. No one seems to listen to me or understands that maybe you should be quieter when others are sleeping. I wear ear plugs, I use white noise, I try different falling asleep methods, I try using light sounds over headphones, I turn a fan on, I rearrange my bedroom. It's followed me from place to place to place, so at this point I feel like I'm the problem.

I dont want to say anything because I want to learn more and I want to get an internship and all that but I need advice. So he normally tells me about how pretty, smart, ect. Well today we had doughnuts in class and I mentioned that the napkins are cool because they have sea shells on them. He mentioned that I should be naked and that him and the other students should put the napkins all over my body. I thought it was very weird but I blew it off. Well i went i to a studio room to record and when i was done he came to listen to the audio. Well he started to say how my energy is super high and about how hes attracted to me and about how how he wants to hold my hand a lot. He said my hands were really cold and he kept rubbing my hands. I was trying to go with it (I think because I wanted to get through it quick so I can leave). He was saying how he would go to the head person in school and talk about me and other students but he would have to bite his tongue with mentioning me. He then started talking about a tattoo on my arm and was talking to me about if it was painful or not. He was rubbing the tattoo with his hand. He then asked if he could run his lips on my arm so he could feel if the skin was different since a tattoo was there. I felt really uncomfortable but again (I know I feel bad saying this because I'm dumb) I said sure. He said the reason is because hes hot something so that he couldn't feel that well in his fingers. So he lifts up his mask and runs his lips on my skin and kisses my arm. I felt so uncomfortable after he did that. He then said if he was younger he would ask me to dinner. After that we left the room and he said if I ever feel uncomfortable that I should tell him and that my Aurora is amazing.

I feel so incredibly terrible and dumb about what happened but I dont want to say anything because I feel bad about it. I also really want to learn about everything so idk what to do.

732,"Hello

I've made a throwaway account for professional reasons but I actually quite like the username I came up with so we'll see about that.

I'll break it down, I'm a young gay male who works in an office in an industry with predominantly other gay men. When I started at my company I started getting a lot of attention from guys in the office, comments about how I look and what they think I'd be like in bed - I've never thought I'm anything too special but do make an effort and go to the gym etc.

So I ended up getting friendly with everyone in the office super fast and people quickly caught on that I like to 'misbehave', go out and party and all that and I just play into it because they loved talking about it. Out of all of the juniors in the company, I'd say I'm the most well liked and have definitely progressed quicker because of my talkative nature and getting involved with everyone. This might all sound shocking to some of you but assured, my office/industry is pretty chilled and laidback about all this stuff. I'm also fine with people making sexual comments towards me but never made any back to other people.

There's this one guy in my office who isn't that physically attractive but we've always had this back and forth flirting / banter that I've always seen as quite innocent but know I'd take it there if it came to it... he's very senior. Everyone is aware of this 

Fast forward a bit and this other older / super senior guy (also gay) starts getting friendly with me. I'm obviously loving it because more of the seniors are taking to me. I never thought for a second it was flirting because I just couldn't look at him that way. He's also good friends with the guy I actually flirt with.

Anyway here's where we get to the actual title. We hadn't seen each other since Covid locked down our offices so we met in a park a couple of weeks back and all started drinking. It was so much fun to see everyone again and just a great day in general. Then people started to leave and a few of us stayed out, I'm chatting away to just the senior guy (not the one I flirt with, he's gone now) as two other people have gone off to find a bathroom, we're both flat out drunk. Then he just goes in for a kiss and I was so shocked I just gave him this half-hearted kiss back as not to embarrass him (bad idea with hindsight).

It was quite shocking as I just didn't ever think things were like that and he's so senior and comes off as such a professional that I didn't think he'd do anything to jeopardise his job. Then the two other people come back and I act like nothing's happened. We then decide to all call it a day and as we're walking out of the park he continuously asks me what my next move is/where I'm going, as if to say that I should go back to his place. I just replied saying I'm not sure and then found a moment where I could ditch everyone and make my escape (I was actually going to meet another guy lmao).

So I guess I'm just asking what I should do. I have to work under this guy and I like him a lot but don't know if I should talk to him just so we're back on the same page with each other, I do think that he was inappropriate but I don't care that much and part of me thinks maybe it was my fault because of my cheeky nature and the way I was with him. I just thought I was being friendly. I'd never go to HR just because it seems pointless and I don't want anything bad to happen to him and I'm not sure if they'd even care. Do I just ignore it, we were pretty drunk and hadn't seen each other in a while... maybe it was just lockdown horn.

Anyway sorry if this was boring / a non-event for people. I was just so shocked that someone so senior made a move on me and it's playing on my mind a little!!!",04Aug2020,1
733,"I (17M) recently met an amazing guy who’s 21. We have a lot in common and I feel really comfortable around him. We’ve gone on a few dates now. We’re both very into eachother and looking to start something more. His parents are completely fine with it but my parents are a different story.

My parents are both quite cautious when it comes to relationships. I have an older brother who in high school began dating a 15 year old while he was 18. Our parents were initially very freaked out by it but eventually grew to support the relationship.

I’m worried that the even larger age gap between us may concern my parents and cause them to cut of communication between him and I. How can I approach them with this in a mature manner and explain my situation? What do I do if there’s a negative reaction?

735,"-posting this on behalf of friend-

Last night I(15F) was in a call with L(16F) and D(16F), with D’s friend from school M(16M)

In this call L got high on weed, which isn’t out of ordinary.

We couldn’t hear L well in the group call, she was murmuring a lot. We went into a private call where she said she fell twice. She sent me a private voice memo where I still couldn’t hear what was going on. I only caught on to a few words like “wrong not right”, “falling”. 

I asked her if she was ok this morning because I couldn’t hear her well in the call, to which she said “fuck you”. She said she was “so fucking mad”, claiming that I knew she wasn’t okay and that I still went to the call to talk to L and D and that we thought she was a bother so we didn’t check in on her last night.

I thought she was just really high, that she is a lightweight and just tripped a few times. Come to find out she was having a very bad high after all was said and done.

I want to apologize but I don’t know what to do or say, she thinks I blew her off to talk to this new friend which isn’t true. I genuinely had no idea what was going on on her end. Help!",04Aug2020,1

739,"So here's a little backstory :

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Belgian-Arab teenager living with my 2 parents in Belgium. Our family is fine, but there are a few   
things that are wrong. 

My parents are really, really fucking racist. And the worst part is that they claim to be discriminated against and that we're the victims of racism a lot. My parents always have something race-related to say about people.  

They're probably the most racist towards  Jews, I dunno why. Anything bad that happens in the world is caused by Jews according to them. Ex : I asked them about the situation in the US right now ; they said it's all caused by Jews. 

Honestly, I could write a book about all the racist things they have said. They are racist towards everyone except, of course, Arabs (with exceptions).

I'm really sick and tired of the constant racism and no matter how many times I try to convince them that they shouldn't be so racist, they keep being racist.

However, today I was signing up for classes and just none of it feels right. I am so bored and uninterested in my college courses.  Then it snowballs into me being stressed and worried about ""am I making the wrong decision, should I be going for a different degree, a different school, drop it all together, etc."" I went through this before at another school when I was going to go for Environmental Science.

But now I realized that I never found the right friend group &amp; never was in the right environment where I could hang out with people. I know a lot of people suggest finding hobbies to make friends, but that's kinda impossible for my circumstances. I'm still a teen and where I live, teens don't have hobbies- they're obligated to study 24/7. So it's very rare to find someone my age outside of school. I want to go out more and meet new people. Is there any other way I could become more social?

744,"So I (female, late twenties) started my job a few years years ago. In the first month I already noticed that many things were going wrong. The people were really nice though and I didn't have a better option, so I stayed. There are so many things that are wrong:

**How the work is divided.**The department I'm working for has vastly more work than any other. I get about 80 to 100 mails a day while my colleague gets about 10. I know this sounds crazy, but that is just the way it is. He's complaining though if he has to help me once or if I get sick for a week, that I'm slacking off. Of course he is the one who got therapy for burnout last year.

There is another colleague who is talking for hours on the phone with friends and no one says anything. Another colleague disappears for hours into another office to do who knows what. And the colleague in my department and me, we are getting worked to the bone with no pause at all.

**I made the mistake to be motivated and engaged so I was basically punished**. So they gave me about the workload that in other companies whole departments have (like ""can you do employer branding for us, including videos, photos and an interview""). Or how about ""do our marketing"". Yet I still have to do all my other stuff. No monetary compensation, nothing. I should just do it all at the same time.

**The atmosphere in the company is horrible**. People are constanly mad and stressed out. You can't ask anyone for anything, they'll snap at you and tell you how it's impossible to do (well they're right sometimes). There is no structure to anything. Everyone just wings it and this means that everything is chaotic and unmanageable.

People are being watched via surveillance cameras by the bosses and their secretary. And she's quick to rat someone out. Which is meaningless though because almost no one applies at our company and those who start new will quit soon. So they can't fire anyone anyway.

People have no respect. They come to my desk all the time an ask the same questions all the time, they call all the time about nothing. I can barely concentrate on my work because I get interrupted about once every ten minutes. Even though my work requires a lot of thinking and concentration.

**I can never get my work done.** Works is lying for weeks or even months on my desk before I'm able to do it if it's not completely necessary. I have this constant feeling of doom and being overwhelmed looming over my head.

**I can't do my work properly** because it would be impossible to be able to manage enough in a day.

**The wage I get is horribly low.** About one of the lowest that you can get in my country if you're working in an office. Happily for me my living costs are low, but it's by far not enough to really save up and build myself a better life.

The straw that broke the camel's back happened this month. I'm doing a course after work that is helping me to do better work. I'm paying for it myself btw. All I asked for was to be able to leave work 15 minutes earlier two days a week and start 15 minutes earlier so that I could get there in time. I had to convert a leave day to free time and this way I'll lose about one holiday week. So instead of helping me out they make it harder for me because I have less time to regenerate.

This bad environment has also changed me for the worse. I notice myself getting angrier all the time because I hate myself for staying in this horrible situation and not trying/being able to find something better. I snap at people. I constanly have to argue and struggle for the most basic things. I was a quiet and shy person when I started, but now I find myself arguing with people and getting angry and lout all the time.

Currently I'm working on finding a better job but it's so insanely difficult during the coronavirus crisis.

Please tell me what you think of this workplace. I would love to tell you all the insane stories that happen there, whenever I tell someone people won't believe me.",04Aug2020,1

746,"I (21M), this past Saturday had to end a friendship (21F) of nearly 5 years. Background: I am a quiet introverted person who has always followed the label of hopeless romantic for a while now. The lady in question is more extroverted than I am as well as more experienced sexually and romantically. So to describe a timeline of what happened, this started last year. One of my close girl friends mentioned to me that one of my friends from boarding school was interested in me. So with this, I invite her to an EDM show in august. We have a great time and the chemistry is alive and well. However, she mentions that in the next week she will be taking an entire school year in Argentina, with that I decided to not make any moves for the sake of the distance.

\-------&gt; a year passes and that same mutual friend mentions again that this girl is really into me and that since the pandemic screwed travel she was back in the US. The girl herself expressed that she wants to meet up too so I go ahead and ask her out in June. Our first date goes really well, we establish boundaries and have a great time. We both express that we don't want anything serious and that a casual relationship is the best way to go. The following 3 dates go really well and the physical activity increases as well as nearly text-book signs of attraction, affection, and general strengthening our relationship with each other. This past weekend we decide to meet up again, this time I drive all the way up to her and we decide to go on a long hike, smoke some herb (legal in my state), and share a motel for the night. To me, it felt like a great way to spend some quality time with someone dear to me and who I thought I was dear to as well. However, as we start talking and hiking, she starts saying things that really put me off. She starts by mentioning how she wants to pay me back for the motel (I have no qualms for paying it myself) as well as for the weed and that she doesn't want me to feel taken advantage of. I brush it off as her just being nice or something, but then after a few hours she says something about how she feels uncomfortable with people liking her back, and that is caused her issues in the past. Lastly, in the end, she mentions that two weeks ago she was talking to a guy she wanted to HOOKUP with and that though it didn't happen she decided that she wanted to take birth control. For a little additional context, this past month we met nearly 5 times, a lot of kissing, touching, and explicit pictures and texts being exchanged during most of the encounters. My mutual friend also reinforces my idea this girl is into me in one or another. Upon hearing this, I get really conflicted, but because we had to sleep in the same motel as well as a hike for a little longer, I keep it to myself. That night, we hang out and spend time with each other and have a good time contradictory to the hike a few hours prior. In the morning, we wake up in bed kissing and holding each other, which confuses me a little but makes me happy as one would expect. we leave the hotel and go eat on a table outside. we talk and as a time for us to part ways comes up I pull up for a hug and a kiss goodbye but she instantly freezes up and rejects that. At this point, I couldn't hold my thoughts any longer and I ask her ""What are you doing? I want you to be honest with me.... are you into me or what?"". She responds by saying no, she isn't into me and that somewhere along the past 2 months she lost interest in me. I ask her to explain to herself why, and why she let me get physical with her in the past. She gives this response: "" For some reason that I cannot explain, when people I initially like, like me back I get uncomfortable. I really liked what you did this morning but I can't explain why I don't feel the same way now"". Safe to say things got awkward, I forgave her sincerely and left. I am beyond confused at this, She gave me every sign and accepted every single of my advances, yet did not have the gall to tell me how she truly felt?

Why do actions and true feelings differ?

How can someone express interests, lose it, and not tell the other person?

Was this situation avoidable? Did I make mistakes or was I just led on?

747,"Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

As many can relate, I come from a strict, religious household where it was uncommon to spend time outside. Although time has permitted my parents a tiny smidge of leeway here and there, I'm still faced with restrictions, such as curfew and no overnight-stays since I still reside with them. 

I'm blessed to have work during this time and would like to use it as an excuse to have a weekend away from the house. An average work trip is three days, which is perfect for my case.

I'd like to hear from people who have done this before, or just anyone who has beautiful ideas from their beautiful brains. Like, how else could I flesh this out? Do I deadass just tell them I'm needed for a business trip? How does this exactly work?

During this time, I've been working part time and attending sign language classes too.

A fellow student did the same and also did not get an answer from her (She definitely looks at her emails). My fellow student ended up texting/calling her.

755,"I (F25) have always been close to both sets of my grandparents (and so have my siblings). We talk on the phone almost every day and I make sure I go see them when I'm in my hometown. Since the pandemic started I moved back home and have been seeing them more (following covid regulations). 

Recently one of my grandpa's died and it hit us all very hard, especially me since I was always his favourite as his very first grandchild (not that he wasn't an amazing grandpa to all of his grandchildren!). The whole family is still trying to process that. It also reminded us that life is short and we should cherish every moment together. 

Now, my other grandpa is the kind of guy that always jokes around. We laugh a lot together, have so many inside jokes, hit each other jokingly, etc. Last week we had a family lunch together and after lunch I was laying on the sofa and he was laying in his chair with his legs up on the table, watching tv. I was wearing some shorts and bent my leg. He reached over and started caressing my thigh and I thought he was trying to mess with me and pinch me or hit me when I least expect it. But he didn't, just said he was giving me a massage, lightly squeezing. Now, he's 80 years old, his hands are shaking a lot, I was wearing short summer shorts and his hand was quite close to my crotch area. But I thought nothing of it. I even said to my mom later how surprised I was he was caressing me instead of his usual playful hitting. It occurred to me that maybe he wanted to show his love more now that we're dealing with the loss of other grandpa.

Then today he showed up when I was home alone. Usually he's always in a hurry, stays only for a few minutes, I even joke and say I need to give him a glass of water when he stops by otherwise he will leave in less than a minute. But today he comes in and actually sits down and asks me to sit next to him. We're chatting casually and he asks if I have any bruises from the massage he gave me (which is impossible as his hands are quite weak at this point). We laugh and he starts massaging my thigh again. As we're talking he takes my leg and puts it over his and tells me to lay back as he's massaging me. I mean, yes, this is something new, but I'm thinking he's just trying to be nice. But then...he pulls my shorts all the way up so that the line of my panties is visible and starts massaging there while telling me a random story. I'm confused at this point. His hands are really shaky and now are definitely going over my panties as well as my thigh. He asks me if those were the shorts I was wearing at their house the other day, I say no and tell him how I got these for cheap somewhere. I can't help but be weirded out by his hand on my crotch so I say he's tickling me and stand up. I start rambling about random stuff and he soon leaves.

At first I try to ignore what happened, but I can't get it off my mind for the past few hours. Like, what was that? 

I feel so weirded out and confused.

But also, maybe this is all in my head and he just wanted to be nice, I'm just not used to him showing affection like that (he also never gives hugs or anything). Losing my other grandpa has been hard on all of us and we've been expressing love more openly as a family. 

But I can't shake the image of his shaky hand over my panties.

757,"Hey everyone, I’m 28 and I met this woman about a month and a half ago who seems to have a good head on her shoulders, she’s 24 and a teacher.

She has a 6 month old baby and lives in an apartment with the baby’s father. They were engaged after finding out she was pregnant but that fell apart after she’s caught him cheating multiple times. They still live together even though they aren’t “together”. She says she doesn’t have feelings for him but he wants to make things work. He is aware of me (that’s what she told me) and knows that she is seeing someone. After all of this she has decided to move out and was approved for a house that’s she’s moving into in a month. I admired that she was proactive about the situation and just up and bought a house, pretty boss in my opinion. 

Here’s the thing, the father can’t afford the apartment by himself and relied on a roommate before she moved in. She doesn’t want to leave him destitute so she paid you the rent until December, when the lease ends. I figured that was really nice of her but there’s more. She’s going to move him into her new house. Her friends are telling her it’s a dumb idea and I agree. He wants to make things work but he supposedly “doesn’t like her” and neither does she like him. I feel like she’s getting his hopes up by moving him into a house with his baby daughter and her mother. He could be crazy, I don’t know but I feel like this has the potential to get bad.

She also told me she wouldn’t mind having my babies and that she loves me. I know these are red flags galore but she just seems so..level headed and put together.

My first 2 years I did great, a little above a 3.5 GPA. It started to get rough around the end of my 3rd year. I have already finished all my core science classes. All I have left are gen eds....you'd think that most people would drop out because they don't like their degree anymore or finances but nope, I can't bring myself to do the easy classes or show up to class. I had a professor drop my grade from an A to a D because of attendance (I think I missed like 17 classes) in a gen ed class...For the last year I have had multiple withdraws (probably around 7-10), add in some Cs and Ds, and now im at about a 2.6 gpa.

Also, I apologise for the occasional use of vulgar language.

In January, my Dad bought me a MacBook and connected his phone to it. This means that whenever he gets a text, it comes through to my laptop. Because of this I have discovered his constant using of escort services all the time. He will visit the website he uses to hire them and then text message them asking about prices and services. I ended up muting text notifications because it makes me feel so disgusted whenever the notifications pop up but I often spend time just going through all of the messages even though it makes me feel physically sick. Because of this I now know way more than I would like to about my Dad's sexual preferences, specifically anal and unprotected sex. There are also other things, like him asking them if they would smoke weed with him. Now the main thing stopping me from telling my Mum is the fact that I keep telling myself 'maybe Mum is just not into that kind of stuff and told Dad to go and see escorts' or something but that is just so unlikely and it feels like I am just making up excuses for myself for not bringing it up with either of my parents. I've also seen him ask for things like the 'girlfriend experience' (which is a term I would rather not have had to google search) which make me feel so bad for my Mum. In general, I love her way more than I do my Dad, which I know is so awful but I have always felt like this about him, it is nothing new. I just cannot look at him the same anymore. I feel dirty whenever I hug him and I can't see him without thinking about all of this.

In general, my Mum is not super affectionate and honestly I think that it is very plausible that they are simply not sexually compatible. But what if I bring it up and that does turn out to be the case and I just pryed into something that is none of my business? They still behave with each other as they have always done. I don't know how relevant this is but my Mum is spending a large sum of money on getting her wedding rings redone and I think that this is something I'd want to know before making such a big decision.

In case some of you are asking 'why didn't you bring it up with somebody before' (considering that this started in January) and there is honestly no excuse. I just really do not want to have a conversation with my parents about their sex lives, especially when it could rip our family apart. Also, this is incredibly selfish but I don't want my life to change so drastically. I don't want my parents to hate each other. I have younger siblings and I feel like if I did do something and worst case, my parents divorced,  I would traumatise them and it would all be my fault.

 Most of the time it is so easy for me to laugh about it with my friends and be like 'haha my dad is screwing escorts up the bum' but it is really upsetting and I feel really guilty and like I am letting my Mum down. The only person who I have talked to about this in depth is my best friend even though I know it is not her responsibility and she tells me that she would just ignore it and go about their daily lives but I can't. I have so much sympathy for my Mum and I feel like if I was her, I would want to know. I am also a very anxious person generally and one of my main fears is that if I brought it up with my Dad he would murder me out of rage or something (which would definitely not happen) but again, it is me trying to make excuses for myself not bringing it up.

In an ideal world I would visit the school counsellor but honestly I think this would be an uncomfortable topic to talk about with them. Am I prying too much or being too nosy? Do you think I should keep everything to myself? Should I bring it up with my Dad, or simply just tell my Mum?

Tl;dr: I have evidence that my Dad is seeing escorts regularly, is it my place to bring it up with either of my parents or should I just keep out of their business?

Thank you to everybody in advance, and again, sorry for the rambling!",04Aug2020,1
761,So back in my freshman year of high school there was this girl I had a crush and well things were going good for a while and then we just had a fall out and she completely just broke some parts of me but I’ve moved on from her but some of me is still broken but now there’s this girl I work with who has kind of grown on me but idk if she really has any interest in me but I want to try and make something happen but we don’t even talk and I’m just afraid that if I do talk to her everything will happen like before. I just don’t know how to approach it. Idk whether to forget it or actually try. Like idk if this matters but even on snap we don’t have streaks or anything.,04Aug2020,1
763,"So my [F29] wife of six years usually doesn't want to have sex with me [M28], and even when we do, she's usually very unenthusiastic.

I grew up in a very conservative christian household, received abstinence talks and no actual sexual education aside from pornography, which I started looking at way to early. 

So, I want to try and start over and am looking for some sex education material that would preferably be geared towards young adults. Any recommendations?",04Aug2020,1
764,"4 months ago I got fired from my job and I have not taken care of myself. I'm talking not brushing my teeth, not showering, not brushing my hair, eating, cleaning my room(haven't cleaned it since 4 months ago), stopped working out, stopped talking to friends, I've just literally been deteriorating in my nest. Any advice, tips, recommended apps, routines, or what you do on a daily basis to help me out?

I keep thinking everything is pointless especially during this pandemic, we all die and there's no meaning to anything and though there's a side thats freeing to it, it makes me think taking care of myself is pointless... idk....

765,"(18F) I know this is kinda dumb coming to the internet for advice like this but, idk what else to do. 

My best friend (19F) of seven years is dating now. The guy she's dating is a great guy. But every time I see them together it really upsets me. I think its because its just a reminder that, even though we're so close, we won't be able to stay best friends for much longer. One day one of us (most definitely her first) will find someone that we want to spend our lives with. I know that she won't go to me when she needs advice, wants to talk, share a life moment, or just hang out. She'll go to her partner. I won't be the person she goes to anymore. And I know that might sound selfish ""well duh she wants to go to her partner its natural."" I know that our relationship can't stay the way it is forever. People change and grow up and we move on. But its still painful watching it happen. 

She leaves in a week for college. We haven't been able to hang out at all though because she's been busy with work, getting ready to move, hanging out at a resort with her boyfriend's family, and now has her family over visiting. I doubt we'll be able to hand out together, just us, before she leaves. Like we used to.

I really want to talk about this with her, but how do I tell someone ""Hey I can't stand to be around or see you and your boyfriend together because it makes me feel like I'm not getting attention and like I want to cry""? Like? I can't just do that. Especially to her because I know it would make her feel awful and I don't want to do that to her. I would also feel like a little kid saying something like that because, even though she's only a year older than me, this past year or two has made me feel like that difference is so much bigger. I still live at home (an issue I'm still dealing with), no job (also trying to fix), and literally no friends besides her (I lost a lot of them after graduating high school). Meanwhile she's moving out, has a job, has friends, a bf, a car, and her parents actually treat her as an adult.

When she moves, I'll literally have no one to hang out with at all (not that I would much with quarantine but ya know.) I don't really know what to do rn. It feels like my best friend is slipping away and I can't really do anything about it without risking looking selfish and inconsiderate of her happiness.",04Aug2020,1

I actually ended up leaving for those 3 weeks to visit family and recently just got back. Anyways, he knew when I was leaving and coming back. So Friday he called didn’t leave a message. I never called back. Saturday was my last day w family so I found it strange he was calling when my trip was ending. Tbh I hadn’t checked his social media, but I did ask my mom the day before he called if she could and she told me there was nothing there. ( I know I know stupid me.) anyways I ended up checking (shame on me ) and in his bio there was a date (he’s in a relationship) but when my mom checked nothing was there. So why tf is he calling me if he’s in a relationship my mom said she feels like he’s doing it to eff w me.

768,"(This was originally posted on AITA, but posts related to suicide aren’t permitted) 

Hi there, to preface this, I am a 14 year old guy with diagnosed OCD, I attempted suicide around 3 weeks ago.

I was on my phone around 11 last night, my dad asked if I wanted to sleep in my parents room, I said no, not really making a big fuss. He asked me if I was going to be on my phone all night, I said no, regular back and forth blabber. While leaving back to his room he said something along the lines of “Whatever, keep your phone, I don’t want you to do anything crazy.” I asked him in a confrontational tone if that’s why he thought I tried to kill myself, he said he believed it was a pretty big reason. I told him off, basically saying that what he thought was pretty fucking stupid. He didn’t really understand, or pretended not to understand (I really don’t know) what he said wrong. He played it off as if I was just getting upset because he asked about my phone. I told him to fuck off because I was frustrated. He said sorry, saying that he didn’t know if he said something the wrong way to make me upset. I told him what he said again and he said, “Well was I wrong?” At this point I was very upset, and told him to stop being dumb, ( he’s seen how upsetting, and distressing OCD is for me ) I told him that I don’t care for/about the phone and it wasn’t even remotely part of the reason I attempted suicide. I told him that the only reason he apologizes is to make himself feel better, and that he doesn’t really care about his son. I mentioned that after I attempted suicide that he was upset at me because he had to wait in his car for hours, and told me that I should’ve succeeded in my suicide. He threatened to leave, and talked about how he isn’t going to get any good sleep because I can’t accept his apology. He now wants an apology from me because he thinks I got too upset (I yelled, and swore at him). How do I go about this situation? Do I apologize?",04Aug2020,1

I'm curious as to whether I am a neckbeard or not. For an intro, I'm an 18 year old male, I have few interests aside from anime, tech, and science fiction. I'm right wing libertarian, I spend most time at home or out alone.

\-I'm fairly anti-social. I don't hate socialising, but it is not my favourite activity. Since a young age, I was bullied a lot by my peers due to being different (due to my ASD) and my lack of social skills.

Due to bullying occuring throughout my life, I've grown up far less social than others. This has led to trouble making friends since I can remember, it also means that I dislike people. I dislike being around peoople for long periods of time, and get very nervous and stressed being around groups of people for more than one hour.This makes socialisation and parties very hard, meaning that I've become a much more reserved and closed off person as the years have gone on. My social skills as a whole are okay. What makes them not so good is my lack of ability to always pick up on social cues.

\-I am a huge anime fan. Most things I do while awake are anime related. Whether it be watching seasonal anime, or catching up with anime I am currently watching, or reading a visual novel. Most of my interests are anime related.

I'm pretty happy with this, although I've been told many times by people that having narrow interests is not good, and that I should branch out. I do not like having many interests, as I like to focus in on a select few or even one.

This is in part due to my ASD, meaning that I become obsesssive over things very easily. So in short, I love anime a lot. Thanks to that, I took up learning Japanese almost one year ago. At this point, I've spent around 2000+ hours with anime, and I don't plan on reducing my intake of the content.

\-My interests outside anime are far and few between. I would be lying if I told you that I have more than two interests outside of anime and Japanese related media. My two main other interests are; Technology (I study computer science) and science fiction (I love star wars and doctor who). My interests have never revolved around sports or anything of that nature, and anything outside my current interests tends to bore me in a matter of hours/days.

\-I've never had a fedora, nor do I plan on buying one. I tend to dress like an average person, Jumpers and Jeans most days. My wardrobe isn't anything special, and kind of reflects my personality.

\-My hygiene is alright, I brush my teeth everyday and wash. I tend to bathe a few times a week and change clothes every few days. I am somewhat underweight at 6ft with a slim build. I do have facial hair, but it is not fully grown and I shave rarely as I'm lazy.

774,"hi, sorry for the kinda vague title. 

I (19M, UK) have had an office job for 2 years, and despise it. I’ve been searching for jobs since pretty much the second week of being there. I dislike the people, the environment, the company, the work i do... 

as the time has went on of me having this job i’ve progressively been getting more depressed, and rather suicidal to be honest. i just don’t think i can hack it much longer being this unhappy , and i feel really stuck in my situation, with seemingly no one wanting to employ me. i’ve easily applied to over 100 jobs in the last year and nothing has came back successful.

the obvious answer is to quit, but i don’t feel like i can until i find a new job to replace it? my parents have pretty strong views of me not being out of work, and whilst i still live with them i don’t feel like i can quit and live an okay home life. i also don’t want to quit because of how it might look on my cv/resume if i have a big gap in employment?
any advice on what i should do, or even better how to find work quickly? i see myself really enjoying working for a small business (like under 5 people) but especially with covid it seems like a really hard workplace to find. 


help?",04Aug2020,1
775,"Okay, reddit, I really need help. Stay with me here, I'll try not to be confusing. Sorry if this is too long, I dont wanna leave anything out.

A little backstory: my daughters father, D, and i got together and unintentially got pregnant pretty early in the relationship. He already had a son, B, who was 1.5y when I met him. D and his first baby mama, K, do not get along. She is an awful person who got pregnant on purpose and is just an all around immature person. Anyways, me and D split when our daughter was 3 and have been successfully coparenting for the last three years. 

Now on to the issue. When our daughter, V, was around 3 (before we split), her and B would lay in bed and watch TV for a little before bed time. And one time we caught V putting her mouth on B's (almost 5 at the time) private parts. We talked to them both about how not okay it was and even privately talked to B about where he may have seen that or even if someone has done that to him. He denied it at first and then told us that he saw his mom and step dad doing it. 
Okay, accidents happen. We talk to K about it and she freaks out and lashes out at us and denies it and turns it around and blames it on us. ""If he's seen anything like that its not from us, he's getting it from you guys"" type shit. We were always very careful about locking the doors before we did anything so we know thats not true. 

It happened once or twice more before we split and i moved out. Each time we talked to him about how it was not okay for him to do that for for anyone to do that to him.. 
I do still get to see him and spend time with him occasionally. He does not spend the night at my house though because I do not have separate rooms for them. 

He is 7 now and my daughter is 5.  There has been three occasions in the past two months where B has been caught on top of V ""having sex"" and ""rubbing pee pees"". And once more earlier this year. Their clothes have been on, or Vs pants will be unbuttoned but not down.  It has happened twice at my house and once and their dad's (they didn't get caught at their dad's,  i just now learned about this from V). 

We have talked to them both about how not okay it is and how serious it is. I have even pulled B aside and asked him if anyone has been doing it to him and he swears up and down that no one has. He says he learned the word ""sex"" from his cousin on his moms side after they were allowed to pay GTA5 together. Then he went home and looked it up. He says his mom knew about this cause of parental alerts but she never told D about this.  The first time it happened my house,  we talked very seriously about this and I asked my daughter why she didn't tell him no and come tell me. She says that she does tell him no and she doesn't want to get in trouble. 

I have had multiple talks with her about how nobody is allowed to touch her there EVER (with the exception of mom and dad but only if we need to). I have told her about no matter what anyone tells her, she will not get in trouble for it and it is super important that she tell me if it does happen. And we have told B the same thing and how its never okay to touch anybody there with the same premise. We have even told him he can really effect his sister by doing this stuff.

My apartment isn't very big,  so if they go into the room (where there's room to play) to play,  I can hear them pretty good and make them come out if they start getting quiet.  There's no playing on the bunk beds and the door is always wide open,  lights on.  No exceptions.

Well today,  it happened again.  I didn't sleep well last night and I ended up falling asleep on the couch for about 30 minutes.  This is my fault, I know. But when I woke up, one of em peaked out of the door to see was I was doing. I immediately got up and asked what was going on and V told me B tried to get her to ""have sex"". She says that she always tells him no but he pressures her into it. We don't know what to do anymore since K won't work with us on it and only blames us. And all B was worried about was me telling his dad cause he didn't want is Xbox taken away. 

We plan on taking V to therapy for unrelated things as well as this but we know K would never let us take B. We know something is going on or SOMETHING.. we just dunno if we are handling this the right way or what. We don't wanna have to split them up or make it where they can't have fun together without someone breathing down their necks which is what we have had to do. I dont wanna think that we are being bad parents or not handling this well enough or what to do. Its hard when his mom is very unreasonable and doesn't even try to work with us. And I dont want my daughter growing up thinking this is okay and being super curious about that stuff right now anyways. They shouldn't even know that word. I feel like crying but I'm also mad and a part of me is numb because I just dunno what more we can do. We want to do whatever we can but D doesn't want to cross any lines to piss K off, like taking him to therapy against her wishes and shit like that. 

I dont know. I'm heartbroken and furious at all this. If anyone has any kind of constructive advice...it would be greatly appreciated.",04Aug2020,1
776,"Hi, so since the beginning of middle school, I've pretty much always had the problem of ""None of my stuff fits into this backpack!"" and ""My binders and backpack keep falling apart!"" which is partly my fault for being a little rough with them, but the fact that I'm being asked to haul around so much probably doesn't help the durability of anything (since I'm in so many AP and otherwise advanced classes).

777,"I love my wife to bits. We're each others best friends. When we met there was this click and we just really get each other. I have autism, so finding that connection was hard for me. But with her, everything is easy. 

We moved in together after 3 months, got engaged, married. We've been married for 2 years now and have been together for 4 years. 

We would describe each other as a power couple. She has a business that she was always afraid to start. Now it's blooming because we started it together. I'm the paperwork, she's the execution. It's about to take over her main job and become a tiny imperium. We fill each  others needs, we complete each other. It's just a really fun, happy and great relationship. 

But here's the thing. We do everything together. Have done since we met. We are never apart more than 8 hours (for work). We do groceries together. Pretty much everything except sports and hobby. 

Her family hates it. They think we are too close and always try to seperate us. Her mother will call and ask her to come by for coffee without me. If she goes, the conversation will be about me and it's always 'you will get a divorce eventually' or 'maybe if you spend less time together you'll be more like your old self'. 

So the last couple weeks we've been talking. My wife wanted to think about that last part, that her family doesn't think she's herself anymore. She has been through a lot. When we met she stopped drinking, stopped being depressed, went to therapy and just got her act together. She assertive now, before she was the type of person that would either cry or scream in any situation. She's happy. She feels like she's the best she can be. 

And now that she's past all that, i can't stop thinking about it. Her family hates me for changing their daughter/sister. They don't believe therapy was what she needed, she just needed them. But when i met her, she just drove her car against a pole stupid drunk, for the SECOND time. I do believe that therapy helped her a lot and so does she. 

I'm just scared now that we might be too close. Even though we're both very happy like this. 

Is there such a thing as being too close?",04Aug2020,1
778,"Heya, so our mom is trying to push my brother through Boy Scouts. The issue here is that he absolutely hates outdoorsy stuff, not to mention but has extremely different interests from everyone else in the troop. He's really shy, introverted, and amazingly talented but his interests are towards animation and coding. All the other boys in his troop are more athletic/jock type and everytime I hear from him about boy scouts he'd usually say something along the lines of ""that kid I hate was there again"" or ""that was hell"". Our parents are separated and before covid he would do activities he would enjoy more, specifically when he was at his dads who would try and get on his level and sign him up for activities like theater. Mom on the other hand thinks that any group is good for him, send him off to something like Karate, and kinda just tries to do anything to get him out of the house and off the computer. All his friends right now are online friends, which I think is fine, especially since he usually would make things like profile pictures/online art for the video games they play together. However, I also think it's important that he does activities with people offline. If people have any ideas on where to look that'd be amazing. He likes coding, animation, and I know he had fun when he did theater. I'm not sure what's open right now though since things are just opening up with Covid and all and not totally sure where to look. I'm usually at work about 40hour/week but from what I know the only time he really goes out is for boy scouts and being online is kinda his escape, his mental health has definitely gone down since covid and I would like to see him more motivated and energetic.

779,"My parents have a very odd relationship, they’re still together though. 

For the past week my dad has been renovating his apartments(has owned 7-8 of them for atleast 10 years) and has been working around the clock to finish so he’s barely been home. 

We had a wake yesterday for a really good family friend who died unexpectedly and my dad didn’t show. He originally told my mom he was stopping here first and my mom said “we’ll go together, we’re leaving at 3” and 3 rolled around and he didn’t show so we waited like 10-15 more minutes and still no show so we left. I texted him asking if he was meeting us there, got no response. My mom also called him and he didn’t answer. 

My dad said he was up for 36 hours doing renovations and felt like he would fall asleep driving if he went(he definitely knew in advance about this wake). Then said because there’s an event(it’s like a socially distant lunch in their honor) today he’ll go to that. My mom feels like it looks poorly on them if he didn’t show yesterday but goes today. She also told me she has a feeling he didn’t go yesterday. 

He was over an hour late to the lunch because he asked me to help him drop his car off at the dealership to get the engine looked at. She wasn’t happy about that and was texting me asking where he was and basically told me he missed everything(people speaking and such) but that he should still go. Then she starts questioning when we dropped the car off and such(in hindsight I should have told him we’d do it after so he’s not late, but I honestly didn’t think of it). I stopped responding because I wasn’t about to stress her out at the luncheon. 

My mom hasn’t been home so I know she’s going to ask me if he went, because she knew he was home and I was at the house. 

I don’t know exactly what to say. I don’t wanna get in the middle of it, but I also don’t want to lie to her. I thought about saying I didn’t ask him, but it’s possible she’ll not believe me.",04Aug2020,1

Recently we haven’t done as much due to COVID and other life things going on so I understand that bond may have wavered a bit, but as mentioned above they texted frequently about plans etc so they have kept in contact. A month ago Fiancé became curious (probably nervous too) if his best friend had just not chosen his groomsmen yet and finally decided to ask. Now as the title suggests my fiancé was not in his wedding party , my fiancé explained he knew Jim would have a tough time because there are a lot of people in Jim’s life that have been there for him for a long time that he wanted to honor. He told my fiancé they had talked about adding another groomsman and that he tied for that spot with another person, which I figured kind of poured even more salt in his wound but I don’t think Jim did so intentionally. Now my fiancé has been amazing about it, but I can see how much this has hurt him, he is still supporting Jim in every way he can and is trying to be a good friend. I’ve told him that he probably had a limit and he had to decide which one of his friends would be the most mature about the situation and decided that fiancé would be the one. It seemed to make him feel better but I can see it was hard on him. Jim is a great guy and I know he’s between a rock and a hard place, as well as making someone your best man should not guarantee them a spot in the others wedding party.

How do I console him without making Jim seem bad? Or should I just leave it be and stick to what I have said?

He’s a lot of responsibility and I work 8/ 12+ hrs. I planned to get a cat a year ago and won’t let that stop me. It just would be so much easier if someone else watched his dog.

785,"Hi :) so I was looking for some advice on how to deal with my siblings. They are pretty toxic and are always finding a rude comment to make me feel bad. They are always pinning their personal beliefs about me onto me! Like I've been watching cooking shows and mukabangs and they assumed that i was only doing this because I don't want to eat or something like that. And when I was working out  for an hour for like 5 or 6 days out the week (I'm 21), they said that i was being obessive and what I was doing was unhealthy. And when I wear makeup they say that I look so much different and talk about how I'm always wear makeup because I am insecure. And when I only do my eyebrows and put on mascara with NOTHING ELSE on. They comment on how they don't believe that I only have that on and say that I have a full face on because I look different. I hate how they are always commenting about the things that I do and how I look etc. They are always saying that my butt is small (LMAO) and when I do something different to my hair they imply that I'm doing it because I don't like my natural hair. They are always nitpicking everything that I do and I hate it I hate it I hate it. When I try to journal and paste pictures that make me happy/ selfies that I enjoy of myself (therapist recommended it) then they say that I'm super self absorbed and even called me vapid because of it. I am so sick and tired of them. They suck. Any advice on how to protect my energy and my feeligns?

786,"sorry for formatting, i’m on mobile. I know this is a really cliché issue but i’ve been dwelling on it a lot recently. 
bit of a backstory: i met my best friend a few years ago, and we’re around the same age. we’ll call him W. W and i have always been very close and jokingly flirty, blowing kisses at each other and such. (worth mentioning that we did date briefly when we first met but broke up for reasons i’m honestly still unclear about). he’s very dear to me and is one of three people i trust to talk about my mental health issues with, and he in turn talks to me about his issues. he’s also very good and supportive about me being bi which isn’t really relevant but just one of the many reasons he’s important to me :) 
the issue comes whenever he’s in a relationship. i always try to be friendly with his girlfriends because all i want is for him to be happy, but i’ve slowly come to realize that i want to be the person he’s happy with, and now whenever he has a girlfriend the jealousy eats me up. i genuinely want him to be happy and i don’t want to wreck his relationships so i usually end up talking to him less while he’s dating so i don’t say something i regret (his relationships don’t usually last very long so it’s not a huge problem). 
i’m honestly just stuck. every time he gets a girlfriend our relationship frays a little and i know it’s my fault because i’m more distant but i don’t know what to do. i can’t break them up because that’s a terrible thing to do and he’d never forgive me. i think i should just come out with it and tell him whenever he breaks up with his current girlfriend but i am so afraid of ruining things. i don’t want to lose him but every time he puts his arm around her it’s just a little bit more painful. what should i do?",04Aug2020,1
788,"Hello! I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’ve been able to manage it and feel okay for about a year, but since lockdown has started its slowly been creeping back up on me.

My husband and I are currently staying with my family in law, which consists of his mom, dad, sister, and 3 children (two adopted, one is the sisters). The oldest is almost 3, middle child is about 2 and disabled (cannot walk, very behind on development) and the youngest is about 1.

The children are taken care of by my mother in law, but recently she’s had surgery that has left her physically unable to care for the children. She needs our help watching and caring for the children for about 4 weeks until she’s healed.

My husband (who is currently out of work due to COVID) and I will watch the children until around evening when his dad gets home from work and then we are relieved from watching them. My sister in law does not offer much help because she is either not home or is high and finds a way to get out of it. 

The issue is that I am overwhelmed VERY easily. I am easily startled by loud sudden sounds (for example, they’ll run around screaming because that’s what babies do lol) and it leaves me irritated and anxious. I have to take constant breaks to let me calm down which puts more stress on my husband. By the end of the day I’m tired, snappy, and have thoughts of either suicide or self harm.

Today I slept in without thinking because I woke up not feeling well and my mother in law was frustrated, saying that she couldn’t deal with these kids by herself and was going to pick up my sister in law and bring her home. 

She ended up going grocery shopping with her without saying anything to my husband and I, and while we were trying to eat lunch, the middle child’s physical therapy had arrived (without us knowing he had therapy today) and we had to stop what we were doing to get him ready. She normally deals with his therapies, and for some reason won’t tell us what days and times he has it. 

She told us that she didn’t know it was today and apologized, but it was still enough to overwhelm me to the point that I shut down.

To make matters worse, my husband and I are leaving for a week to visit my family and she has nobody to help her with the children during the day while we’re gone.

I’m at a loss. I can’t say no to watching the kids because she has nobody else to help her and just the thought makes me feel horribly guilty. But at the same time I’m miserable every day and I can’t enjoy what I have left of the day afterwards. I feel so stupid being this overwhelmed by babysitting but I don’t know how to manage my emotions.",04Aug2020,1
789,"TLDR at bottom (feel free to skim for extra info)

Sorry for mistakes.

to preface, I live with my aunt and uncle. my mom and I are currently not on speaking terms. i’m also currently 16.

my mom has been very shitty to me since the beginning of 2019. right after christmas, when I had gone through a horrible breakup, she told me she never wanted to see me again. she also called me a selfish bitch, because me leaving was making my younger brother cry (he thought he would never see me again). I started talking to her again, about 6 months later on mother’s day 2019. I gave her a few gifts and went to see her at her house. fast forward to january 2020. it’s my sweet 16 and everything is going great! my party was to last 3 hours, and about an hour and a half into the party, I noticed my mom wasn’t there. I tried calling and texting her, and finally after 20 minutes she finally picked up. she told me how she didn’t think I wanted her there, because a few months prior I said she could stay with me the night before the party, but we got into a big fight and I decided it would be best to not have her over that night. I was heartbroken she didn’t come. I still am, I still haven’t forgiven her. 

we’ve been through a lot together. 4 moves, 4 boyfriends. I love her so much. she had told me since boyfriend #1 that if she remarried I would be her maid of honor, because I had been her rock for so long. well, now she’s getting married to her most recent boyfriend (now fiancé) and didn’t ask me to be her maid of honor. she asked my cousin, who’s a few years older than me. but, she asked me to be a bridesmaid. it hurt me so deeply; whenever me and my mother would fight, my cousin would come to her aid, and would sometimes text me and tell me how much of a shitty person I was for fighting with my mom. it felt like a stab in the back. when I confronted my mom, she told me that it was because my cousin lived closest to her, and she didn’t think I would say yes to being the MOH. my cousin had always felt to me that she was my mom’s long lost daughter, that every time I was fed up with my mother, she could run to my cousin and my cousin would always defend her. neither of my parents want me anymore, my cousin had her own parents so I felt like she was stealing something from me that i had been trying SO HARD to keep. I wouldn’t have been nearly as angry if she had chosen my aunt, my grandma, or her best friend. it was basically that she chose my competition, even though I should’ve have to compete for her love.
I got really angry with her, and told her how I felt. I told her how much mental turmoil she put me through during my childhood. all I wanted from her was an apology, and even then i had to force it out of her. then I cut all contact with her, and told her not to contact me ever again until i was ready to deal with her again. I also dropped out of the wedding, and am not planning on going to the wedding.
now, about 2-3 months later, everyone except one person has dropped out of her wedding. this whole time I haven’t spoken to her, I’ve had really mixed feelings about it. I miss her so much, but i’m not ready to be subjected to the abuse she’s put me through for years. I’m really conflicted about if I should reach out to her again. I haven’t even lived with her for 3 years, and at this point we’ve become so distanced with one another that she doesn’t even feel like my mom. at most, she feels like a friend. I also want her to apologize, which I know won’t happen unless I ask for it. I want to to be a given she apologizes, no matter what. 

TLDR; mom who’s abused me and has been a bitch for years finally pushed me to my breaking point, and I cut all contact with her and dropped out of her wedding. now, everyone is dropping out of her wedding and I don’t know if I should contact her again to “save” her special day. 

I would really like to hear what everyone has to say. thanks.",04Aug2020,1

791,"So I wanted to know if I would be the asshole in this situation. I have a friend \[21F\] who for the past 3 years was sucked into one of those MLM things and has been progressively LOSING money, yet she posts all this stuff about being a boss bitch and how she's making money to have this facade for the people. She also works a minimum wage job so she's not making much and I know she was just desperate for money. She doesn't go to school and was going to go to beauty school but couldn't afford it, and now she definitely won't have money for a while for anything but bills. 

She doesn't only promote the MLM, she uses it too. She had this whole ""weight loss"" thing on her Instagram that she recently took down because in the past three years of using this, she has not lost any weight but instead gained it. She's now morbidly obese. She complains all the time how she's tired and achy and can't do any sort of cardio for long. Basically, she's unhealthy as shit. I used to be pretty heavy but I lost that years ago and I also had (and still struggle) with an eating disorder. So food/weight are sensitive to me, and I never want to offend anyone. 

So this is where I MIGHT be an asshole. I asked myself if I should just sit idly by, and let her do whatever she wants until consequences let her figure it out herself, or straight up sit her down and (nicely) offer her some advice about the fact that MLMs usually don't make you any money (I read 99% LOSE money!), how she needs to find a way out and I would even help with it, and how the shakes are not as healthy as they advertise it as. I'm in college for nutrition and it just baffles me how she consumes those + other food that has no real nutrients to it. The shakes don't even have fiber in them! She posts online pics/videos of the shakes and goes ""giving my body the nutrition it needs."" I know if I was her, I'd want to hear the truth. I know she doesn't actually know it, given what she tells me and her struggles. It's just sad, but I also don't want to be an asshole who just makes her feel bad about herself.",04Aug2020,1

Though I’m ve felt like such shit lately. I have a fast food job and I’ve been working there for a year. I’m so tired of it, every time I go in there I feel myself get stressed and just get upset over every small thing. My coworkers are fine, I just hate serving people. Everyone’s so mean, and I can’t take it anymore. I’m only 15 and I feel like I should be able to be a kid. The main reason I have a job is because my dad lost his and I wanted to help out, now he has a job but my parents are tight on money and they ask me for help sometimes. I told them I wanted to quit in September because I’m so miserable there and they said it’s fine but I know it’s not. I don’t wanna disappoint them, I don’t wanna have to just sit there jobless for months. 

Needless to say I’ve been very stressed out, I’ve been lashing out at my parents and my sister. I don’t want to but it just happens when I’m really focussed on something and they distract/start arguing with me. It’s an impulse thing, I’m just a bit of a hot head lately.

795,"there's nothing i hate more than a stranger who i don't know giving me a attitude. i go to this supermarket. this young girl who works there has a attitude problem. i noticed her behavior and she was giving other people attitudes for no reason. until one day she gave me one. i was too occupied in my own thoughts to notice her attitude until i walked out the supermarket.

i decided to walk back in and pick up a few more things on purpose and went right back on her line to see if she gave me that same attitude. i swear to god i was angry and annoyed. but then she never gave me another one. so the next day i noticed she was yelling at this old Chinese couple who didn't understand English. i'm even bothered how the store manager was there and didn't say anything. so i had enough went on her line and as soon as i got to the front to pay for my things i told her nicely she has a nasty attitude and she should lose it because she's giving people attitudes for no reason and she's being rude, i told her that her attitude is disgusting and she started laughing looking at the manager saying ' what attitude' i wanted to knock her in the face so bad. 

i complained to the upper management and the guy told me that i'm not the only person who has complaints about her. there are other people who complained as well. i can't stand looking at her. she has negative vibes and she's just a nasty person with no respect towards other people. yeah i have attitude problems myself and i also have mental health problems which causes my mood to change but i'm never disrespectful towards others. i would never go out my way to be rude to random stranger for no reason. even though i have bad days, i can't say i'm rude to others because i'm not. i treat people how they treat me, i act accordingly. i know bounderies. i know respect and i believe you should always give people that respect because if someone was to treat you that way then you wouldn't like that.  in my head i see myself beating her ass but then i would go to jail so that's why i'm trying my best to control my anger.

After a couple years he seemed to be a lot better, they never fully went away but things calmed down definitely. Well recently they’re getting worse and I don’t know what to do.

797,"I've struggled with this since high school. Honestly, in a larger classroom, I wouldn't expect anything to change or anyone to listen to me, but my classes are all very small (under 30 students) and I tend to take a lot of workshops. I've struggled in the past with suicide and self-harm, and while I'm doing much better, I still have a lot of difficulty when those subjects come up. 

I also take a lot of creative writing classes. Every class, at some point, has had a student who decides they want to write a very romanticized depiction of suicide, or some gritty, dark story with cutting. I get it, and I'm not trying to put them down, but it's really difficult for me to read those types of stories, and even more difficult for me to give them an honest, objective opinion on their prose or whatever. I don't want to bend the rules just because I have trauma, but every time I've met with a teacher and asked if maybe we could have trigger warnings I get: a) nothing or b) called a snowflake. To be fair, it's not just the creative writing classes where I encounter these topics (last year we watched a film where a mother tried to convince her kid to make a suicide pact with her), but it's the most common. 

I guess part of my question is this: am I being unreasonable? I want to be warned before I read someone's graphic depiction of rape. I don't *think* that's unreasonable, but I'm biased. It's difficult not to take these things personally when I try to ask for change, and I also just...abhor the thought of a teacher putting two and two together and realizing I have a past with suicide.  

*Is* there a polite way to tell a teacher: ""hey, x writing about this put me in a month-long mental tailspin that wasn't great; can we never do that again?"" I know that trigger warnings are also, technically, spoilers, but I'd like to think my mental health is important, too.",04Aug2020,1

800,"Before anyone says it I know I can block them, and I will. I’m saying what do I do with all the nonsense they have done up to this point? 

The story: I made a hair appt with a salon in my area that’s super expensive and what I thought would be a luxury experience. I followed them on Instagram and it was fine. I waited for my appointment, but two days before my appointment I noticed a series of Instagram stories where some artists and some patrons were not wearing masks. This made me concerned since I take care of an elderly relative and I debating cancelling, but I figured I’d clarify first if masks were still required. The area I’m in is a hotspot but I truly did not know if this particular business required masks or not. Their office was closed so I messaged their Instagram account asking “Are masks no longer required for appointments?” No one replied so I figured I would call the next day and check. I called and spoke w the GM and she apologized and said masks 100% are required and that she would talk to the ppl who weren’t wearing their masks in the stories, and she asked me to please keep my appointment so I did. The next morning I received a DM from the business account saying “ Are u the mask police? It was the end of the night and that was the stylist roommate. Rude...” I was shocked. I literally just wanted to know if masks were required or not, I wasn’t gonna shame the business for wherever they decided, but I was going to make whatever decision was best for me. I was so surprised they responded in that way. Anyway, it was also the middle of the day and there were tons of clients in the background of the IG stories. I replied back to them “ Oh wow. Thank you for that info. I’ll go ahead and cancel my appointment since I am high risk and it’s not a priority for y’all. 

Also the way you responded is extremely rude especially after someone from this salon already talked to me yesterday apologizing for the lack of masks in the stories yesterday, but it’s clear that whoever you are is very defensive of this and I clearly struck a nerve here. I will go to a salon that values safety but above all, is not bitchy to their clients!” I called and cancelled my appointment with the GM, and I specifically asked if she sent me the nasty dm. She said she didn’t have access to the acct but that the stylists and owner do. She said she would let the owner know about what the account said to me (sure whatever). And I thought that was the end. I posted on my story a screenshot of them asking me if I was the mask police because 1) I could 2) I couldn’t believe they said that 3) I would want to know if a business acted like that. About two hours later the business DM’d me again saying “  Boo-hoo 😭 such a Millennial..  we’ll continue to be one of the top salons of Orlando! Without your exaggeration! Even if once in awhile a mask goes down. We are 98% safe🤷🏽‍♂️good luck on that hair cut.” LOL. I was kinda entertained at this point because I was literally arguing with a salon. Whatever. I replied back “Omg are y’all trying to mock me haha y’all are so unprofessional 😂😂😂” and moved on. It did bother me how rude they were, and lots of ppl that I showed the messages to recommended me to report them to the BBB and I did. I simply attached the conversation to the BBB report and moved on. I didn’t know who exactly was messaging me but just in case I blocked the owner and the stylists on IG. I didn’t block the salon cause I wanted to save the messages. 

Fast forward to today, the salon followed me and 10 min later sent me this DM “Nice try chubs,you claim social justice but this was an issue between you and me. reporting us to the bbb. Criminalizes our staff of hard working Mothers, Fathers, Elders, Gays, minorities etc!  My attorneys will be contacting the BBB.”

805,"I'm 15M if that matters. FYI, I've only recently been noticing this stuff because I've probably just kept a blind eye to it. So basically my parents have been getting really perturbed and annoyed at me because I've not been really productive this summer and they've yelled at me a lot and made threats and my dad has also come very close to hurting me because of this. They've called me lazy, unproductive, and they've said that I have it way too easy. They now also want me to take a bunch of online courses which would take away a lot if not most of of my free time.

Is this abuse or am I just overreacting here?

If it is some kind of abuse or something or other could you give me advice on what to do? And if I'm overreacting and this is reasonable and I'm just being a spoiled brat please tell me also. Thank you!",04Aug2020,1
806,"Hi

I have some events which have transpired with this friend which make me question her sincerity of our friendship and in most of them the blame was always shifted back onto me, whenever I brought up my issues with her actions she always exclaimed I was ""acting weird and that people don't act like this"". I need advice in order to see if I really am being ""weird"".

An overview of our friendship: we've been friends for around 10/11 months, in that time Ive grown pretty close to her often viewing as a sister (I do not have any blood sisters) and I believe she has grown close to me too but I often wonder if this is true or whether I'm just in a heavily one sided friendship.

Early on in the friendship (2/3 months in) I would ask her to come out and try to see her etc just standard things I'd do with any of my friends and it wasn't as if I wanted to see her every week, but I'd often be met with excuses whenever I asked this wouldn't have made me think twice usually as I understand people are busy and whatnot. However, all the while she was giving me excuses she would make ample time to meet with other guys (not platonic) it was as if she'd jump to those opportunities and just ignore me asking her to go out. After this had happened a few times I thought its best to be upfront so I asked her about it (along the lines of ""Why do you make time for these guys and not for me"") she ignored it but I pressed her as I wanted a response to this she blocked me on snapchat but after a few days she added me again and we went on w the friendship. I didn't think too much of this, but maybe I should've saw the signs early on?

The next thing that made me doubt her friendship was when she asked me to come to a party with her, the party was one of her friends and I didn't know anybody there except her, I accepted the invitation (I'm not particularly a party person and at this point she knew this) it was an ok night up until she pretty much abandoned me. So, first off I asked her if she wanted to take some pictures and I was ignored so I went off and left her for a bit, after I was kind of uncomfortably high and wanted to sit down w a friend and so I asked her if she could just sit with me for a bit to alleviate my anxieties and this again was ignored it was at this point she hooked with a guy at the party (I don't really care what she does with other guys) and I was ignored for the rest of the night. Then when everyone was heading off and I thought it time to leave I asked her to leave with me as I was supposed to take her home (her mom took us their so I thought I'd return the favour and get the uber for the both of us as we live like 5 mins away from each other) to this I was met with blank stares as she could careless about me at this point and was hellbent on staying with this guy. At this point I'd had enough (perhaps with a lack of better judgement) and left. After this I didn't message for a few days and neither did she but then she did and asked if she could call as it'd been on her mind all the time and she wanted to sort it out. I asked her for her reasons and she stated it was all because she was drunk and then she pushed the wrongdoing onto me as I was the one who had left her. Again we moved on from this.

The prior issues arose again namely the making excuses to me but making time for others.

At one point we had argued about something I don't remember, we hadn't been talking for a few days but we had started again and after a couple days of talking I asked her if she wanted to meet up for my birthday (which was around a week after I asked her) and this was around April 2020. She replied with a no saying that she didn't plan on going out at all and seeing her friends as per government advice (I had told her I would stick to social distancing rules she still said no). I had no issue with this until I went out for a walk and saw her with another guy like 2/3 days after she'd said to me she wasn't going out and I felt utterly betrayed by this, however I let it slide and we didn't talk for another week or so but we did once again continue the friendship and it wasn't too bad after the respite, was actually pretty good and we were getting close again. I did ask her about the incident and she said ""oh I never said I wouldn't go out"" I'm adamant she did say she wouldn't but I gave her the benefit of the doubt.

Over the time we've been friends she's attempted a couple serious relationships which didn't end well and I have been there for her throughout, often I would drop any issues I had with her in order to be a shoulder for her rather than bringing them up and possibly making it worse for her.

Recently (we've been friends for 11 months at this point and she's told me I'm one of the closest people to her, this is why I see this as such a big deal) I again reached my boiling point w a persistent problem she has whenever we're together (I find this incredibly rude but I didn't bring it up for a while because I thought shed be able to see my discomfort). She always goes on her phone whenever she's with me and often is just messaging other guys (again non-platonic). We'll be talking, joking etc and then while I'm in the middle of speaking she'll just pull out her phone, firstly I'll prod her with something like ""are you listening"" but after this time after a while I just shut up and stopped talking hoping she'd realise to which she responded by carrying on with her phone and pretty much acting as if I weren't there. On the way home I'd had enough and confronted her about it saying ""what is it with you and you're phone are you bored being here with me or something"" she responded with saying ""oh well what do you want me to do you're not saying anything"" this response was abhorrent to me and I said ""the reason I'm not talking is because you're on your fucking phone constantly"" (keep in mind I'm usually the one making conversation and pretty much had been the entire night and she knows I often enjoy silence spent with my friends but the presence of a phone tends to ruin this for me as it feels as if the person is absent from the space) to this she didn't say anything and instead went back to her phone and moved away from me (for example we were at the bus stop and instead of waiting with me she just stood a good few feet away from me and was just replying to voice notes and shit) opting to sit away from me on the bus all the while having a whale of a time talking to whoever she was messaging on her phone. When we go off the bus she thought I would just leave but as I see her as my sister and I know she doesn't like walking home alone at night (lack of streetlights and such) I told her I'd walk her home she probably would've preferred me not too tbh. The short walk back was again silent and the distance she kept was apparent, again staying on her phone. Usually we see each other off with a hug and she usually initiates these and says ""I love you"" to which I hug back and say the same, this time I had to initiate to which she gave a half arsed hug if I've ever seen one and I told her I loved her to which she didn't respond and I said ""ahh you're not gonna say it back"" half jokingly but half hurt from the lack of reciprocation she then just said ""love u too"" and quickly turned away and went inside. We haven't spoke apart from when I messaged her the next day asking if she wanted to meet in a couple weeks as she had spoken about it the night prior and she responded ""idk"" I asked her why as she was pretty sure about it when we were together and she said ""its because you always act weird"" she was about to go away for a few days and I didn't want to sour her holiday so I said ""do you want to talk about this when you're back"" to which she just said ""yeh"".

The reason I think about this so much and why it holds such importance to me is because I really do love her as a sister and it truly does hurt when someone you see as so close pays little attention to you're feelings when you would throw yourself into any situation to prevent them from harm or offer your own time to make them feel better. I truly don't care about her relationships with other guys its just when these people are seemingly more important (enough that I can be ignored in order to reply to them) and take precedence over how I feel. Like the thing about going on her phone, I'm not asking for the world here its a simple gesture and if she asked me to do it and told me her reasoning as I did I would oblige without consequence. Keep in mind whenever she is with a guy who isn't me she tends to stay off her phone (she usually has speedy replies) and resorts to ""I'll message you later"" to whatever I've said and often the case is I have to message first later instead of her actually getting back to me she often states ""oh sorry I forgot"". This kind of makes it worse to me like when you're with me they are all important enough for you to interrupt our vibe and reply to them but when you're with some other guy my messages lose all importance.

I just want to know whether I'm justified in feeling betrayed and hurt by her actions or am I overreacting?

At times I feel like the bond is truly there and she does love me but I'm conflicted as to whether her words are empty especially with this latest event, to me I would find no issue with such a simple request if it came from someone I held close to my heart but she clearly doesn't think like that or maybe I'm just not as close to her as I thought and felt I was.",04Aug2020,1

813,"I don't want to bore you all with too many details. The short version is that i have been writing on and off for about 10 years. I made some progress over the years, but every year or two i start to find that the process is no longer rewarding. 

I start to stress about it, everything about writing becomes a tedious and frustrating chore. My ideas stop being interesting, plots never quite come together, characters seem stilted, and i get stuck expressing the same ideas over and over.

So i've decided to quit trying to write. The only problem is i've spent such a long time telling myself that i am a writer, that i'll write x and y, and it's become so ingranied in my perception of myself. So when i think about not writing anymore, i'm left with a sense of freedom and relief, but i also sense a sinister kind of meaninglessness waiting for me if i abandon this 'role'.

Any advice?",04Aug2020,1
814,"My elderly grandmother (94) recently was hospitalized and has left her very weak. We brought her home yesterday for in-home hospice care, where my aunt (retired nurse) said that she'll give her about 2 weeks to live. My grandmother is very alert mentally, but is in pain and can't eat much.

For the most part, I'm fine and have accepted that she will pass eventually. I'm not sad when I talk to her, and I know that she has had a good life.

825,"Everything is just too difficult. I can never get myself together. There are so many barriers that just make everything impossible for me. I don’t even know how I will be able to get through high school. I’m starting in less than a month and with everything that’s stood in the way lately, I can’t see myself even trying to get through. I don’t even think I know how to try anymore.

I don’t know how to even clean my room. I’m just staring at a void of manga, pencils, legos and papers spread across the ground. Sometimes I feel motivation, but it is lost very quickly as I realize how hopeless everything is. Everything is getting worse. I plan on cleaning it later but the other issues are always still there. 

In middle school, I didn’t pay attention in math at all so I’m essentially screwed already in that area. To be fair, I have no excuses. All I wanted to do was draw on the papers being handed out and I couldn’t stop. I came out with better drawing skills, but I don’t know anything about actual math other than some geometry as that interests me. 

Even if I tried to pay attention, there was so much to get distracted by. This will sound strange, but it’s hard to pay attention with so much going on. The lights are always too bright, the people are too loud, the desks are cold and everything is just scary. Even my own clothing begins to bother me sometimes. I feel too much of everything, and the only way to attempt to tune everything out is drawing. Especially last year, my math class was extremely loud and obnoxious. These kids would always throw things at me and make me pick them up, then say really confusing things. I’ve even been punched for no reason and I don’t really know how to defend myself. All of this made me choose to just draw the whole class as that as that was the only way to cope. It also made me look too focused to talk to people as I feel better just avoiding that altogether at school. I was already hopeless with math, and now I know nothing. 

People at school are always jerks. I get chased in the hallway by people making weird noises, I get made fun of (especially when people think I’m not listening) and everyone seems to kind of dislike me other than a few people.  I only really talked to two people in school. I had three friends from there, but one of them I talked to online as we didn’t have classes together, the other I never was really close with but sometimes we talked about nintendo, and the other guy was kind of a bully but it was better than nobody. Or at least I thought at the time, but my only friend who seems to actually care about me (I don’t go to school with them) told me I shouldn’t talk to them anymore if they were going to be a jerk to me. This made my focus even worse as I have no clue what somebody will say in order to make me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed so I feel like I’m always scared while roaming the halls.

My constant fear of everything makes my only instinct as to just get through the day. My grades eventually stopped mattering to me and I just focused on trying to cope. I’ve always had this focus as people were hard to deal with in elementary school, but everything got worse instead of better so I had to completely forget about my performance. I don’t even know how I passed last year. Quarantine made thing worse when all I wanted to do was cope to the change in routine rather than do my work. My computer screen also broke and I never figured out how to tell my mom so it was really difficult to see the assignments.

My feelings are also making me less functional. I cry way too much, sometimes more than once a day. It’s because I hate myself. I realize that I avoid talking to people simply because I don’t know how. I should know social things but I don’t. People always misread me and I always misread other people. I’m horrible with other people. I admire many people who are nice but still good with socializing because of this. Particularly my best friend. I sometimes feel that I even LOVE her.. it’s weird looking up to people, but I feel so much lower than everyone else. I’m too stupid to talk to others properly. I don’t even know how to tell others when I’m upset sometimes because I don’t always know how I feel other than bad. I feel like a worthless scum who always accidentally makes others feel bad. People always think I’m being rude. Apparently my body language is out of sync so that could be why. I feel like everyone else’s is out of sync, but that clearly isn’t the case as I’m alone on this most of the time.

I just feel so wrong and almost disconnected. I feel that nobody truly wants me around. Sometimes everything feels one-sided. I care about my people, but do they really care back? Sometimes it feels that they are just trying to be nice. It really sucks. All of the info I’ve stated is what makes me want to give up. I don’t want to uncontrollably cry anymore just from being the way I am. I won’t last in high school. I know it. I think my mental health is collapsing. It’s never been the best, but I feel constantly unmotivated and exhausted and I can’t stop thinking about how much I dislike myself and how many social interactions I’ve screwed over. I don’t know what to do. I’m too scared of telling my mom that I almost feel sick from everything. 

Sometimes I want to just run away from everything. I think it’s bad that I hit myself sometimes but I don’t know. Everything is just hard now. There are so many things to come to terms with, that I’m gay, that everyone hates me for some reason, that I suck at everything I do... I don’t know how to get help. I’m so alone. My mom will likely disregard me as she has in the past, and my dad is not responsible for me. Even if he was, I don’t think I would be able to trust him as he abused me in the past. My mom doesn’t even care that my teachers said I might be autistic. She always says that I don’t have it, and other times she calls me an “aspie”.. she doesn’t want to get me tested, and I can’t trust her with this either I guess if I will just be invalidated. I’m only 13, but I think this might be  what a a midlife crisis feels like. Alienated and lost. everything just hurts.",04Aug2020,1

I realize that it’s just a game and one of the reasons I end up going back to this way every time is because it’s just easier to play, but playing like this so much has made me think about my future.

They bullied every short or skinny classmate but they didn't defend themselves and that's how I stood out from them. They were coming to tease me every now and then but it was meh. One asshole started to bully everyone but I was the only one to say anything and I was the main target from now on (he slapped me and ran away). This kept happening around 3 months until we were in art class. He was going around and teasing some of my classmates and was pushing my pencil and trying to slap me. This kept happening for around 15 minutes but he finally sat down because the principal entered the room (everyone was making too much noise), the desks were for 3 people and with rows, he was sitting in front of me and his desk was on lower ground than mine. Anyways he started pushing my pencil again for 2 minutes and I got up and punched the shit out of him while he was trying to protect his head. The thing is he bullied me only on breaks because he is a pu\*\*y and the teachers couldn't see him. On the next break he kept trying to slap me. When I got home I was pissed off and told my mom (my dad is in another city) what has happened in the last 3 months and she talked to my class teacher and next day they called me and the sh\*thead from class to go to the principal. We went and I have a very good memory so I told everything in every detail. He denied slapping me and I said let's see the cameras (this is important: he is with the best grades in my class and I can report him to the Ministry of Education and Science and they can expel him from school and the class teacher and etc. don't want that) they said ""it's a lot of work to turn on the cameras, are you sure you are not lying (or something) and I said let's see the footage. And as I remembered I told everything to the detail. The look on his face was priceless, the big bully almost sh\*t himself. I was thinking about staying in that school so I didn't report him (when i go back now I totally should've).

I moved schools and got into a school with worse grade students. Everyone is cool for what I've seen (the quarantine started after 20 days in that school). The bad thing is they have a lot worse grades than me and my grades were in 22nd out of 26th place in my old school now they were 1st out of 26th. Everyone thought I was studying and I was genius or something. I didn't know sh\*t about chemistry, physics, german and math and they thought I do lmao. In quarantine everyone hit me up about homework and I wasn't doing the homework lol.

&amp;#x200B;

When someone hits me up and asks me for advice or to do something I'm always there for them on the second. When I need advice or immediate help they leave me on seen or respond after 5 hours to 2 days. Even my cousin has only me in his steam friends and becomes invisible for some reason. Everyone lies to me and I see it. I haven't talked behind anyone's back so I don't think they ghost me because of something like this. I am very honest and don't lie to my ""friends"" too. I feel like nobody cares about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice what should I do, should I dump all my ""friends""?

And why does everyone hate me?

834,Basically a few weeks ago my sisters and I were playing and one of us accidentally broke one of our devices. Our parents got really mad but replaced it. (it didn't cost too much since we had like a protecting service). Today I was just sitting down I got up and picked up the iPad and it had a small crack in it. It was probably our dog since he was running around and one of her nails cracked the screen. The problem is if I said that to my dad he would still get mad for us making excuses. I'm really scared rn since Idk what to do and we literally broke the same thing like 3 weeks ago. Any advice on what I should say?,04Aug2020,1
836,"Hello :) 
My brother is getting married this November, and his fiancé asked me to be his bridesmaid. I’m 22 but I’ve only attended one wedding where I was around 6 and all I remember is blowing bubbles and eating cake, while wearing a dress I didn’t want to put on. She asked me to be her bridesmaid and I said yes, but i thought that just meant standing near her at the alter. I had no idea I was supposed to plan things.

837,"I started delivering for Uber Eats on a bicycle this summer to have a bit of extra pocket money during the school year. Most of my deliveries are for people who live in huge condo complexes and coming from the suburbs, it seemed kinda scary at first. Within the first week of working, I had customers who would waste my time and not provide me with a entry code and expected me to just sneak in. I probably made 5 dollars less per hour because of customers like that. The worst day was when I had a customer who gave the entry code but didn’t provide me with proper information about how the elevators worked. Apparently you need to get a key fob from the concierge. I was confused at first and asked the front desk concierge about how the elevators worked and he ignored me at first, than I told him the unit number and the customer’s name. He responded with “what do you want me to do with this information!?” In a demeaning tone. I was never in my life treated like that, I asked the customer via text and he told me get the key fob from the concierge. I really didn’t want to talk to that man but I had to do it. He ignored me and told me to fuck off in an angry tone. So I’m 15 minutes late on the delivery and had to tell the customer to come down to get his food because the concierge wouldn’t cooperate. The customer made it look like I was lazy and didn’t want to go up to his unit so in the end I had a report from the customer and had to deal with a nasty person. On the bright side I did made 120 dollars in 4 hours that day because of previous generous customers, I decided to fuck it all and asked my dad for a lift. I cried all night and felt like a women. I abandoned my bicycle and delivery bag at that condo complex and never went back to delivering, the money was good but not worth the hassle. Working for my dad’s office as a clerk pays much less but it’s much better because I’m surrounded by nice suburban people not pretentious city dwellers",04Aug2020,1

Back story- we have been together 3 years and the beginning of us dating a few months in I said I was falling in love with him, and then saw CONSTANT messages from someone else. CONSTANT. Granted it’s normal to date more than one person at a time, he lied and said it was his cousin and I was “crazy” it was “his cousin” plot twist- it wasn’t. It was a girlfriend of a year and a half- which I just found out a few months ago. He says he never loved her, and she threatened suicide so he could never really break it off. For the past few years, I’ve (naturally) asked relationship questions and he’s voluntarily given info multiple times like “I kissed a girl once when I had a girlfriend” ie me. He’s going to therapy trying to figure out why he was so afraid to tell me the truth, but i sincerely don’t know how you can trust someone who has blatantly lied to you so many times. I’ve found other questionable things in his phone when he’s handed it to me, and he gives some kind of story and obviously I have no way of knowing if it’s true or not.

842,"I’ll (32F) preface this by saying I’m not alone in my life. I have friends and family I can count on. But, for various reasons, we all leave pretty far apart from each other, and even though I like spending weekends at theirs or inviting them over, it’s not the same as having my friends nearby.

Furthermore, I was sheltered by my parents, a lot. They’re kind of hermits and pessimistic people. So when I was young, I wasn’t allowed to go out after school and every weekends and holiday were spent somewhere else. That made me an introvert who’s a bit afraid of the unknown.

I’m in therapy for anxiety (medicated for it too, if that matters), so that’s covered. But I would like to be able to have a life a bit more active. Except every time I look for activities, either in things that I already do alone/have done in the past, or new things, nothing tempts me, everything’s scary. It’s a little miserable, to be honest. Quarantine didn’t help, for sure, but it was like that before. It’s just that I’m even more aware of it now.

843,"Bit of backstory: I grew up bullied and always always felt ugly.  I am quite small and thin and growing up I was always made to feel the ugly one, even my family members compared me to my siblings/cousins and always told me I had an average face compared to them. 

They always dated around (my relatives), while I also never been in a proper relationship. My first relationship, if we could even count it was abusive and he also cheated on me, told me I was too skiny, that I should wear make up and dye my hair blonde. 

 After that relationship, I couldn't even look at guys or people in general. I have a bubbly personality otherwise ( I think I am kind, I always care a lot about everyone I meet), so people enjoy my company which gave me enough to heal in some ways. Or so I thought. 

This guy kept talking to me at my workplace, he handed me his number one day out of the blue. We went on two dates and he ghosted me. He lives next to my workplace, so I always see his car, but he avoids coming in the shop since he ghosted. 

A month later ( just now), I saw him befriending on every social media, another girl. She is beautiful, she works for a charity, seems very kind. 

I cannot stop comparing myself to her. That she is more beautiful, more successful, better in every way. I also cannot get over the fact that I didn't even deserve closure and that during those two dates, I have done something so bad that now he avoids me completely. Especially since on the first date he admitted he came in to shop only to see me, which means I must have done something that he ghosted.

I realised that I have not healed, I just never went back to thinking of how much I hate myself because I was not even brave enough to look at anyone romantically and think ""Oh maybe they like me.""

I don't know how not to compare myself to girls and feel utterly  worthless. I don't know how not to hate myself, my looks, my personality so much. I always feel I am too much or not enough and the constant feeling of looking ugly just gets me. It hurts me really bad. 

I don't know how to think about this. I feel I don't deserve love and no one would want me more than for a one night stand (maybe not even that) so that I can experience love. I just really would like to experience it.

847,"This might be extremely typical. But please bear with me.

I am 26 years old and have been rejected by my crushes 19 times. I have not gone on a date in my life. Only two girls have ever accepted a date from me, one whom cancelled twice at the last minute, and another who forgot (I try my best to believe she did).

I am extremely lonely and spend my time watching movies with my pillow at home and holding my own hand to sleep.

I get jealous and emotional of my colleagues and friends who are attached or.engaged, though I don't show it in public.

I have been bullied and ostracized all my life, in part I believe due to my face, with eight skin moles.

I really want to date and find a girl at last. I have tried my best to be happy alone, but it just doesn't work. There is a biological need in me to seek companionship and, though I may deny it, sex, though I am happy to abstain as long as a girl will want it.

I am extremely passionate in my hobbies (astronomy, design and geopolitics), read widely and also try to indulge myself in other pleasures like gaming to try to broaden my appeal. Nevertheless, no girl is willing to talk to me in these social circles, and the single ones are practically non-existent. (I have not avoided any girl)

I am desperate that at the age of 26, I have no female friends, and no girl willing to even talk to me and respect me as a friend and potential partner. The only girls willing to talk to me are those I helped to do homework and projects for. Other then that, I am ignored and forgotten.

I want to sign up for dating sites and apps, but due to my face, low self esteem and depression, I am afraid to be humiliated and be rejected a thousand times more and sink myself further into depression. I need advice on how to proceed...

Please kindly do not suggest:

Taking a break. I did that between 2017 and 2019; the result was a total wall of silence.
Get a hobby. I already have many hobbies, I don't lock myself in the basement all day.
Be happy alone. Please just don't.

I posted an [AMA a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nailbiting/comments/hircw3/my_ama_powerpoint_was_more_effective_than_rat/) about my 23-year long nail biting journey. My biting and picking got so bad that I applied rat poison to my nails, and that didn't work. But I found a way to quit for good.

The community response has been overwhelming, and I've been lucky enough to use what I learned on my journey to help other nail biters on Reddit quit when nothing else worked.

The joy of helping others conquer this demon made me realize that I want to dedicate more time to helping people quit biting and picking their nails. I want to help as many people as I can.

If you have a moment and have suffered from nail biting or picking, please take a minute to fill it out my [questionnaire here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__pHOlWlUNE9PTVgzTU1CWEVHRDVMSTQ1VUo0QVJOOC4u).

I'll post the results and what I've learned at a later date.

Are there other ways I could get more answers so that I can affect more people?

852,"I applied for two jobs at the same time. I started working at one, but I got an offer from the other. Not sure which is the better offer.

Thankfully I work in an essential field, plant growing and selling. I’ve worked for nurseries, green houses, and farms and in my area, these skills are in high demand.

I applied for 2 places. Both are massive national wholesale nurseries. One hired me within days, and the other just gave me an offer.

**The Good Nursery**

So I immediately got hired at a “Good” nursery for $15/hr (pretty low for my experience). The job is all-year round, and pretty easy, though way beneath my skill level. There are definitely possibilities for lucrative upward advancement, but I’m not really sure of the paths, and I haven’t made clear to ownership I’m trying to move up. It’s definitely not a dead end job, but I’m not sure the upward path.

**The Better Nursery**

I also applied to another massive wholesale nursery for the same job. The major difference is that this nursery has opened a retail nursery that’s a massive agrotourist site. It’s quickly becoming famous, and well known in the area. There’s a berry farm with a grocery store, cafes, a nursery and garden center. It’s also really growing. This year they built two commercial size greenhouses which probably costs them $2 million dollars (so I know they’re growing). The job is for $16.50/hr. However it’s seasonal, there’s a chance I will not have a job Nov-Feb.

**An important point**

I made it absolutely clear that I’m not super interested in retail to the better nursery, I’m more interested in upward mobility. My interview was phenomenal, so was my cover letter (they basically ask for a full biography for the cover letter) and after the interview the owner of the entire nursery (with 1,000+ employees) wanted to meet me. Our discussion was awesome, and actually quite fun. She assured me they will need department managers for the retail nursery, and as it grows, this job could be as lucrative as wholesale. She also said they might have an off-season job for me, but they can’t guarantee it. 

**The question for y’all**

Do I stay with the job I already have being unsure of the upward mobility? Or do I take the job at the better place for more money, not knowing if I’ll have a job in winter (though better nursery says I will have one in spring).

My wife thinks I need to stick with what I have, job security is really important in Covid, and what happens if there’s a major second wave this winter?

All my friends in the industry say I should work for the better nursery because the fact I’m on the big bosses radar, and she knows I’m trying to move up, is a golden opportunity. They say if I do well at my job, there’s a good chance she would go out of her way to keep me hired in winter (though she personally won’t guarantee it).

She said if she ""somehow fails"" shes gonna keep trying until it works, shes saying that shes gonna miss people and shes sad but its what she ""has to do and really wants."" She also posted today that she knows she doesn't actually want to die but its ""too late to turn back and not do it"" but it isn't too late :(

Problem is I don't know her real name or where she lives, I have absolutely no idea how I could get in contact with anyone that could actually do anything. I could report her account but all that twitter would do is give her the dumb suicide hotline ping, and that isn't good enough. Shes attempted before so this is likely not a bluff.

855,"This is something that has bothered me a lot in practically every aspect of my life. I feel like I'm living my life on fast forward, except I'm not any faster, just everything else. I've always been told I'm slow at basically everything. My showers take 20 minutes. 10 minute class assignments take me a full hour. Even moving seems to take minutes, not seconds. I used to think I was just tedious in my work, as I always score well on assignments and have been told I do good work at my job. But menial tasks at work that take others 45 minutes becomes a two hour ordeal for me, and the outcome is the same. It has started to wear me down mentally to think that I'm just a slow individual and it scares me considering I want to be a graphic designer. People want quality work in a short amount of time, and I fear I won't be able to compete.

The most obvious example I can provide is during my exercise routine: after I finished working I went to change positions to start the next. All I had to do was lay on my back. Simple, right? It took 20 seconds. While that doesn't seem like a lot of time, keep in mind I started in a plank position, so it wasn't like I had to move very far.

Can anybody explain this to me? Or at the very least, does anybody else feel the same?

861,"My mom and I were talking the other night. It was soon after my boyfriend had just left for the day. He had been over at our house that day hanging out with me and my parents. They both like him a lot and definitely approve of him. Ive noticed that my mom does love giving him hugs and does have her hands on him a good bit. I’ve never said anything or thought anything if it because she is touchy with a lot of people. My mom was talking about how great I did finding him and about how much she liked him. 

She then said, “man if I was with him I’d be on him all the time. Too bad I’m not your age anymore.” She then followed that up by admitting that she has the hots for him and that she thinks he’s super sexy. I was pretty freaked out and disgusted at the same time. I told her that was totally inappropriate and that I was done with the conversation. She laughed and kept going and said “better watch out, I might can still get him.” I had enough at that point and started yelling at her and told her that I wouldn’t be bringing him over anymore. She got upset and said that she was just kidding about stealing him. I told her that I wouldn’t feel comfortable bringing him over anymore since she is that attracted to him. We got into a yelling fight and so I left and went over to my boyfriends place. I told him about what happened. He was casually smiling like he thought it was a joke. He ended up laughing and saying it wasn’t a big deal and that it is just a compliment to him. I got upset as he obviously didn’t think it was a big deal like I did. 

So right now I’m not exactly very happy with my mom or my boyfriend. How do I move forward with each of them? Is it fine to continue to let them be around each other? Was she joking or serious?

862,"So I know from the surface it seems like a clear no, but it's a complicated situation. I'll try to explain quick and I'll call just call the guy M and the girl F.

I'm a trans guy, and when I started high school I drifted towards the other queer people there. I ended up meeting M and a few other people and we got along really well. Me and my other friend my age started playing DnD with M, and I met F through one of our campaigns.  

We were a group of friends of 2 people my age, one person 2 years older than me, M, and F. Then around the beginning of my 10th-grade year there was this big thing (doesn't have anything to do with M and F so i wont talk about it) but i ended up losing all my friends at school. 

This has left me with just M and F, I had a lot of casual friends at school, but no one I really talk to outside class so with corona and all I've lost contact. M, F, and I hang out around once a week (there's 0 known corona cases on the island) but we voice chat pretty much every day. They make me really happy and my therapist hasn't expressed any concerns, in fact, she called my friendship with M the first healthy friendship I've ever had.

The closest to an inappropriate thing we've done is drink, and that's only been 3 times. I also snuck out of the house one night to hang out with them, but all we did is sit at the park by my house and eat Mcdonalds.

However, I've occasionally mentioned the age of my friends to other people and they've been concerned. I love them so much and I feel safer around them than I do anyone else. Am I doing something wrong?",04Aug2020,1
863,"  

So I’m curious what everybody has to say about my situation that I’m in. Please don’t be mean tho. I’m not sure what best course of action I should take…

So basically in a nut shell I was diagnosed COVID19 positive with a negative test and never informed of it.

About a month ago I started having 2 symptoms- GI upset and headaches. Pretty much 2 symptoms that could be linked to soo many other illnesses. I did an e-visit with my PCP and she referred me to Employee Services to get the COVID test done (I should add that I work for a health system). So I get the test done and the following day I was suppose to receive a phone call with my test results but instead it popped up on my MyChart and it was negative. So I call employee services that afternoon because nobody had reached out to me and they reevaluate me and I told them I had those 2 symptoms still that the headache was more than likely sinus related, but no fever or respiratory symptoms. They said since I was still symptomatic that I wasn’t able to go back to work yet and to stay home until a nurse reaches out to me in 2 days. So 2 days pass and no phone call so I again called them and they reevaluated me and I was symptomatic with those 2 symptoms still and that they would contact the physician on call and they would call me. So I talk to the physician and she said she possibly suspects COVID even though it was a negative test and that over 30% of the swabs come back false negative (I work for the lab and even my boss has told me they are able to get 99% accuracy with our testing methods) and to get the blood IGG testing done in a couple weeks if I wanted to know if it was COVID19 or not and that I am to stay home until my symptoms go away just to be safe and that I would receive a call after the holiday weekend to reevaluate if I could be released back to work or not. So Monday comes I still have a headache just hanging out in the back of my headache but nowhere near how bad it was the week prior. They still wouldn’t release me. 

So all in all they kept me off work for 2 weeks and the last call I told them the headache went away and they released me back to work.

So I go back to work and get on Epic and access my chart, lucky for myself the health organization that I work for allows employees to access their own charts they just cannot be altered in any way. I start reading the notes from all the calls and see that they CONFIRMED me as COVID19 positive and was placed on the positive registry. My jaw about hit the floor. She never told me I was COVID19 positive, she said she maybe suspects it but just be safe and stay home til the headache went away but never told me she was diagnosing me as positive. Never told me to urge family members to get tested. I TOLD the doctor I have a 5 month old daughter at home. I TOLD the doctor I work at the hospital. I was NEVER instructed to get tested again. I was NEVER contacted by the state. None of this is adding up for me. I was never even called for a follow up or told to follow up with my PCP. 

I am very angry. 

I did inform my coworkers.

So what am I missing here?

What course of action should I take? I never had COVID19 so my health records are false. I have an appt later this week with my PCP to discuss this with her.

870,"Hey guys,

My first two years at university were pretty miserable. I made them that way-- mixing standard student anxieties with what I'll reluctantly call depression, some frequent paranoid catastrophic about every social mistake and a perpetual fear that none of my friends valued me for good reason, as well as lack of enthusiasm for school itself and no discernible major or career path of interest. It sucked and the whole time it seemed like I was just fighting my mental health to maintain relationships, only to decide I wasn't worth them or didn't like them and try to sabotage myself. And while I've been getting by academically, settling into a general major (marketing) with a decent gpa (3.3), I've definitely just been coasting downhill as I haven't applied to any internships or even figured out exactly how I want to use the degree.

When COVID hit, I was independently glad everyone was putting a pause on life, and hoped I might grow a lot with the free time. Up at school there was always a force on me to hang out with my dorm neighbors whenever possible, despite mood or work to be done. Back home I was pissing away time online like my old self. It felt welcome, but I didn't really get any motivation until July  so naturally I didn't feel ready to return to campus life next week. I agonized over a choice to take a leave of absence for weeks, and finally pooled together the Pro's of mental health, time for career discernment, all of the relevant encouraging posts on reddit, working out, and personal growth into the pessimism I had for on campus COVID policies and in a moment of courage withdrew from school.

Now I can't sleep. I'm seeing people moving into campus already and can't stop thinking about how I'm throwing away my only chance at college friends, how I won't be able to graduate with anyone, how 'm wasting key months of my youth and how I'll always be a step behind people my age. I can't stop thinking about the mistakes I made on campus and the loose ends I'm leaving behind without any closure. I didn't always like my friends but at least they were there, and I feel like even best case scenario from this gap, if I grow as a person and feel more stable from it, the primary conclusion I'll make will be regret for the people I threw away and spite for my lack of gratitude.

Back in June we were virtually signing up for our dorm rooms after the cancellation of  study abroad displaced a good deal of the student population. I would have liked to move off campus with a friend or two, but hadn't had contact with anyone I knew since March, so I was to pick between acquaintances in my old dorm and randoms in a new one. At that point I was feeling extremely ashamed of the weak person I'd been at school, and decided rather than try to improve relationships with people I was just alright with, I would benefit from a fresh start in my junior year.

If I had taken a room in my old hall I wouldn't be writing this right now, and would have saved both of us a good deal of time. If this week I had to choose between tackling COVID with those distant friends and waiting it out from home, I'd be packing my suitcases. But the dichotomy I found instead was between an already lonely time trying to make new friends in a new hall, along with social distancing regulations making gatherings even less frequent, and isolated time to grow at home. I picked what I thought was right, but now I can't even appreciate it without paining over what I chose to miss. I'm trying to contact the school about maybe undoing the request? And maybe finding space in my old dorm? But honestly it feels like too little too late and I feel like they'll just try to put me in any other random dorm. And at that point I still don't know what I'd do. I'm just beat up over this, and feel like I'm unable to make peace with what I thought was the right decision, and might still be right if I can't be with my old friends. I feel like I've ruined both options now, and would really appreciate any guidance on moving forward from here. 

Many thanks, y'all.

880,"So I know there are a lot of these floating around out here. This situation is a bit different in a way, so I will do my best to explain and not make this a novel.

My husband's brother is getting married this October, and this wedding scenario is downright stupid. I've been really kind about it to the in laws, but my husband is tired of me panicking over this to him (he is standing up in this wedding, and there is a huge bridal party...We're talking 9 bridesmaids.) The venue they are having the wedding told them that due to COVID there can be no more than 50 people, and that they will also let them use the venue for free next year as well. (I think the venue was hoping they would just postpone it entirely for next year.)

Instead of doing the right thing and cancelling until next year, they have decided to have a ""small"" wedding this year with immediate family and close friends, AND have their huge wedding next year too. They even had to postpone their honeymoon until next year, so I cannot for the life of me figure out why they are compelled to have 2 weddings.

They are even bringing their EFFING 85 year old Grandma. They did not seem to even think twice about this...

The venue is indoors, so I have no idea how they are going to socially distance 50 people in the place, and I assume no one will be wearing masks.

I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, and have not told many people since it is my business. I really don't feel safe attending this due to my illness and being in the middle of a global pandemic, but know that I will look so bad for not going.

SIL to be is not a big fan of me to begin with, and is not a very nice person in general. If I don't go, I will end up being the A-hole and feel screwed no matter what. My in-laws are very naive people, and don't take most things seriously.

884,"I am moving out with my girlfriend of nearly 3 years, and I feel bad about not offering my sister to move out with me. 

I'm 19(m), and up until now, I have lived in my parents house my whole life. My older sister who is in her early 20s also still lives with my parents because she has been going to college in state. We have always been close, in fact my whole family is close(hence why we both are allowed to still live in our parents house).

She, like me, has been wanting to move out for a while. Due to where we live and cost of living, it's nearly impossible for people our age to move out alone and without roommates. Early last year, we had talked of moving out together and even looked at some places. But, because of life, that got put on the back burner and we never went back to it.

Now, originally, my girlfriend and I were going to be moving to another state for college this year. But, due to covid and some other things, we're staying in state this year. When we made this decision I didn't offer my sister to move out with us for a couple reasons. 1) Me and my girlfriend are looking forward to living together just the two of use. 2) My sister had already set up moving out with a couple of other people.

But, recently, her friends backed out on her, and now it's not looking like she'll be able to move out with them any time soon. Meanwhile, me and my gf have found an apartment that we like and might sign a lease within a week. I can tell my sister is getting down lately. I can't tell if it's because I didn't offer for her to move out with us, or if it's just because I (the younger sibling) will be moving out first while she still lives with our parents. 

I am beginning to feel bad about never offering. I know my girlfriend would be against living with her because she wants it to just be us, and while I would have nothing against it, I kind of just want it to be the two of us as well. Do you guys think that I'm being a jerk for never offering?

TL:DR My sister and I currently both still live in our parents house. I am moving out with my girlfriend and am looking forward to it just being the two of us. My sister's plans got messed up and is now probably going to continue living with my parents for some months to come. I can tell it's really bothering her, but I am looking forward to it just being me and my gf. Am I a jerk for this?",04Aug2020,1
885,"Hey reddit, 
I have a 2 year old Russian tortoise and is real healthy with a balanced diet.

After doing a long amount of research I didn’t really have an answer for him as multiple forums said different things. 

I’ve seen that there was a tortoise who ate leaves of a medical marijuana plantation floor and apparently is real happy..? Shell showed signs of pyramiding which I can only assume is because the only thing he eats is the leaves and nothing else. 

So I thought I’d come here to ask.

From a social / dating point of view, it seems needing a car is even more important than if you live with family, but it's such an expensive investment.

My parents never picked up on this, and I also had a unhealthy relationship with my Dad; he would criticised me for my lack of friendships or ""not doing anything in life"".

He is extremely hyperactive, and I guess appropriately for his age also extremely disrespective towards me and his parents. I would like to have a nice relationship with him though, because we really have good fun together and I want to keep that up. But sometimes he just does really annoying and selfish things and it often comes out completely randomly, like there is no particular reason why he is behaving like this, and I'm not sure how to react to it.

You could say I'm being too kind, or maybe too pussyish not to do anything about it, but I got used not to react to these things much, but they do bother me and I do want to do something about them. I feel like I need to set some rules that he should follow, or otherwise I won't give him my time, because I do have better things I can and should be doing as well.

Whenever I try to come up with a solution, the amount of things that 'bother me' just kind of fog my mind from coming to a satisfying conclusion.

Any advice would be appreciated.",04Aug2020,1
905,"Maybe I’m insane. Please tell me if I am. I just feel like this would be considerate. 


Long story short. I had a gf for a year and we had an amazing relationship. Unfortunately I got her pregnant and she came from a very religious Arabic family. The only option in her mind was to have an abortion. It completely devastated her. I stood by her throughout the entire process but she hated me for it and blamed me for basically ruining her dream of having kids. 

We broke up. She hates me. Blocked me and changed her phone number. I wasn’t crazy. I understand why she felt that way but I feel that I should send her flowers. It’s devastating her and I cannot even begin to comprehend how she feels but it’s also pretty bad for me too. I was supportive for her but cried in secret. To me it’s also a baby I would never get to hold. 

The “due date” is in a few weeks and I want to send her flowers. No note. No “trying to get back together” just something I feel would be considerate but I’m also emotional about this entire situation myself. 

Any advice you can give I would appreciate it.",04Aug2020,1

It seems like at the last minute she's needing other things we didn't discuss or she didn't mention (when we discussed potential move in dates I told her I just needed a month minimum and she didn't object so i took it as that not being an issue for her) initially and I'm kind of wanting to say nevermind (we haven't signed anything yet, it's all been discussion) now that suddenly I'm needing to ""give"" much more on my end when I'm the one with the apartment she wants in the first place",04Aug2020,1

So please dont judge me. I have trypanophobia (fear of needles) and tomorrow morning I have my wisdoms out in the chair. 

I'm kind of freaking out. I know the fear is irrational,but it doesnt take the fear away. And because of the fear, the pain will be much worse than it normally would be.

910,"Context: Our lease is up mid-September. I’m going to be having a baby literally any day now. So if/when we do move, I’ll have a month-old newborn and 2 toddlers to handle as well. 

We(my husband and I) currently live in an affordable 2-bedroom house. It’s not a bad place to be, but our landlord is a bit stingy. He’ll never hire anyone to come out and make simple repairs, which means things won’t get fixed properly for weeks, or we don’t bother contacting him at all. There are lots of bugs, which are more annoying than anything else. 

We’ve been looking at a 3-bedroom apartment. I like that we’d have more space and better maintenance. There’s no yard, which kind of sucks, but there’s also a dishwasher, which evens that out. 

The apartment is obviously more expensive, so if we went for it, we wouldn’t have a ton of extra disposable income. And I don’t know if the stress of moving with 3 little kids and all that comes with it would be ideal right now. 

I can answer any questions people have, but for now that’s the jist. Should we move or stay put?",04Aug2020,1

I was ready to accept all these issues just to have a job that was in my sector, but suddenly there are lots more jobs being advertised that are at my level, well-paid and won't mean relying on a bus home from the middle of nowhere at 7pm.

Financially, I'm stable for the moment but who knows what's in store in the future? If I get this job I will continue to apply for these better jobs and will basically be waiting for an opportunity to jump ship which I know would be crappy for the employer, but would it also be crap for me?

917,"Need some advice please. So, my grandma just passed. My grandpa passed away 3 and 1/2 years ago. The co-executors of the estate aren’t dealing with it until 6 months to a year from now. I’m basically house-sitting until that happens. Would it be rude of me to set down a few rules for family to visit? Mind, all but 2 of my mom’s siblings live nearby, with the 2 living out of state. I also don’t want one of said aunts bringing over food, as she tends to bring over treats and I am trying to lose weight.

The rules would be:

1. No coming over without calling or texting first. 
——this is because my family in the area has a bad habit of coming with no call or text ahead of time. I’m hoping to get a work from home job pretty soon and don’t want anyone coming over unless I get a call or text first. Most of my mom’s siblings have a key to the front door, so I can’t just lock the door. I do have permission to add an extra lock to the front door, so I’ll be doing that the next time my stepdad comes to town.

2. No bringing over food unless you’re taking it with you with when you leave. Any unhealthy food left behind that my mom, stepdad, or I didn’t bring in will be tossed.
——like stated above, I’m trying to lose weight and one aunt loves to bring over stuff like ice cream and chocolate candies. Cookies too. This is after telling her multiple times that I am working on losing weight.

3. Multiple offenses-3 or more in a certain time period-will get a call to the uncle that is the one co-executor that offender wants to house-sit while mom or stepdad is out of town. The time period would be probably a month or so.


These are the major ones. My mom and I had been my grandparents’s primary caregivers-grandpa for his last couple months and grandma her last 3 years-she had dementia and couldn’t care for herself. As far as some family members are concerned, the house is my mom’s and mine, as we did the bulk of the care. There’s 7 siblings altogether and though we know some don’t want the house, we don’t know about the others.",04Aug2020,1

I even flew all the way over there to visit and look around, which cost a few hundred dollars. I, myself, called the apprenticeship proga yesterday and, as usual, they answered on the first ring. They told me that they haven't had any missed calls or messages.

921,"Basically, I was raised by parents who took an extremely laizzez faire approach to parenting.  I was rarely disciplined, I wasn't forced to do chores, and I was never encouraged to pursue special skills others my age developed (no instrument, no sports, few clubs, no special talent of note).  I was also obese, had bad hygiene, and didn't have many social relationships out of school.

I was able to disguise this problem in college, because I had so much free time.  I got top grades and I was generally my best self.  I lost weight, built up a couple of solid hobbies (frisbee &amp; board games), and made friends.  

Now as an adult working in corporate I feel like a fish out of water.  I got a job I'm overqualified for and don't really like.  I struggle to focus beyond hitting the bare minimum standards of productivity.  I've gained most of the weight back.  I struggle to motivate myself to study for certification exams I'm smart enough to have completed already.  I still struggle do chores with any consistency.  I leave problems to the last minute to solve.  I struggle to pursue any hobby that isn't TV.  

How can I build some sort of discipline.  I've built a plan for making myself the person I want to be in the long run, but I always just find myself not having the energy or drive to get it done.

924,"Hi!  

I have a question or I need some advice shall I say. I'm a 19 male who is currently visiting uni but because I'm not happy with the university i choose i decided that i would begin to work( i did so like at the begining of the year, around feb) and because of the Covid-19 situation, things got a bit delayed. Not in a way that I would be lazy and do nothing on the contrary i found myself an architect and i did some work for him as a student and we got along really well so i decided to ask him if he wanted somebody for regular employement and not just a student, to which he replied that he was planning on giving me a job offer anyway. So all was well and cool but today i called him to talk about the whole employement situation and he said he doesn't have any customers as of yet so he can't give me a proper paycheck if he would employ me, but he will have customers by late September or mid October so by then we could talk more about proper wages. The thing is I have a status of a student and i have it till mid september, but after that i don't have it anymore so i will have to take care for bills, health insurance, and other stuff and basicly no income except for the money this guy will give me ( and it doesn't even cover rent). I don't have these expenses right now bc i am a student and in my country students get certain privilieges( dont have to cover health insurance and reduced rent) which is why i can currently live with the money he gives me, and i don't want to fall in to much debt. My question is should i try and risk it with this architect and just wait it out or should i just go to a different Uni and just forget about this guy... Sorry if its all to confusing it's just a big decision to make and im just scared tbh.

TL:DR-  I wanted to leave Uni, tought i found a potential cool job, but because of Covid Employer doesn't curently have any work for me, so i don't know if i should risk it and wait it out until he gets some work or should i go to another Uni.",04Aug2020,1

926,"So I’ve known a group of people from my CC for well over a year now. That group was unstable to begin with, but when I showed up I acted like some sort of glue (“the alpha”) between the guys and the drama of the girls. I know one of the girls really appreciated and enjoyed having me as a close friend for the last year. 

We had a lot of good times. But recently she not only started blowing me off. I watched her disrespect and walk over her closer friends that she called her “brothers.” Now, I can be an intense person sometimes. I have some strong, maybe unhealthy boundaries. Something felt OFF though....I immediately distanced myself. 

A few days after we all hung out she snap chatted me individually (normally plans are made in the group chat, she rarely would message me separately) “Hey my parents are out of town all weekend so you should plan on coming over thanks”  
 
So my ass reading that at 1am apparently took it the WRONG way man. Like wtf thats how you open a conversation about hooking up! Girls have sent me the same line before to initiate....but nope! she actually just meant she was just trying to get everybody to hang out again so I just made things weird! 

Yeah so nobody ended up hanging out. I had to go out of town anyway, and yeah it made me feel like a loser man.  It gets better. Saturday night comes, she posts on her fucking story with a guy she was hooking up with! Like wow this just took a weird turn, and ouch. 

I messaged her Monday and told her I don’t think we really should hang out anymore and explained I decided to move on from her and the group. She said that wasn’t fair to her. 

Its been a month now, we never talked things over at all. Lots of unanswered questions. She was left confused and I think It actually shocked everyone tbh. Both sides of this, (me and the group) have many unanswered questions. I put up a brick wall between us. 

Before I move away, is it the right thing to reach out to her and ask to talk about things?

BACKSTORY: 3 years ago my friend had an affair with a man she met online. It wasn’t romantic or anything of the sort...more like a Dom/Sub relationship as the guy gets off on being in control. They only met once to have sex but other than that would chat on a close friendship level. When she wanted to break away from the relationship, he got threatening and she eventually confessed everything to her husband. 

PRESENT DAY: My friend is still married and they have grown closer than ever since lockdown. The past month or so this guy has reappeared in a very worrying and alarming fashion. It began by sending her emails to her work asking to talk to her (which she ignored) 
He’s sent flowers and chocolates to her work office along with romantic cards. 
He created a fake Instagram account using her brothers name and added all the family, her husband and myself. He’s created various other Instagram accounts which he attempts to contact her through. He made one recently and posted up pictures of her (including old photos of her in underwear) to get her attention. He changed his WhatsApp profile picture to a photo of him standing outside her work!
She eventually caved and called him on a withheld number begging to stop and he said he would. Since then he’s made more Instagram accounts but worse yet, he actually turned up when she went out with work colleagues last Friday. He doesn’t even live anywhere near the area - I’m talking a 2 hour drive away! 
She approached him and told him to leave her alone. He promised he would yet now he’s back making new Instagram accounts again and trying to reach her through Facebook.
I’m the only person who knows and she’s refusing to tell her husband or even inform the police as she believes she has it under control.
She doesn’t, clearly. She’s begged me not to say a word and hopes it will fizzle out.

I said we were not going to, and he said ""oh okay just confirming because she can't drive so her dad will probably do it.""  


I asked why and he said ""she's 14???"" as if that was clear to begin with. I asked him why he was dating a 14 year old and why he was trying to get others to sext her. He said she's not his girlfriend, but rather his sister. I ended up reporting and blocking the guy.

Now she is stating we never paid a bill outside rent and she wants us gone, moved back after her boyfriend broke up with us, and took my girlfriends phone claiming it’s hers. 

I spent all my money I saved on court last month to get my oldest daughter from my ex wife, and have no money to move into a new apartment, especially with my credit being in the mid 500s. 

My girlfriend has all this in text conversation of us agreeing to everything on the phone her mom took and just surrendered back to sprint. All I have are payments through cash app titled “rent (month/amount)” to her mom. 

I can definitely be in a better spot in 30days as I have a very well paying job now but only started 45days a go and used my last months pay to back pay my attorney and pay up rent. 

Now her mom is saying she will call the cops on us for ‘destroying her property, stealing her money, and physically beating her younger daughter’. None of this is true and I don’t want any drama because of an ongoing custody case I’m in, I don’t need an unstable house hold.


I don’t know where to turn because it kills me to think of using our states squatter laws to stay here until we can leave. My daughters come first and her mom is emotionally abusive towards us both, and is trying to insinuate my girlfriend has been lying this whole time. I’ve been paying the rent here so she can pay her mortgage and now she moved back in after I paid this month and is threatening to call the cops on us and throw out our stuff. All the evidence we have is on the phone she took from my girlfriend. 

She is currently across the house in her room while my girlfriend is driving around town in my car to avoid confrontation with my two daughters, without a phone.

i’ve recently decided, with the help from my incredibly supportive partner, to be open and public about my pronouns. my mum is pretending to be supportive but refuses to actually acknowledge the fact that i’m not a girl. i feel incredibly invalidated and it’s really getting me down. how do i talk to her about this to make her understand that this is just who i am?

939,"I’m friends with a guy for about a year now. I’ve liked him for quite a while and expressed my feelings for him 3 months ago. He said he doesn’t feel the same way but really appreciates me as a friend.
Yet, we’ve shared a few moments last summer where we would make prolonged eye contact and have deep conversations until late in the evening. Since last summer, we only talk through messaging because he lives abroad.
I found out that just a few days ago he created a new playlist on Spotify called “sweet dreams” which contains a lot of songs I introduced him to. He would make comments about these songs in the past, referring to them as songs he wouldn’t have known were it not for me. 
Why would you listen to songs that remind you of a girl before going to bed, if you don’t have feelings for her ? He also has a playlist called “depressed” which mostly contains love songs.
N.B. He didn’t have Spotify before I introduced him to it. He only started making playlists after I showed him how.
Does this mean he has feelings for me? If so, why did he say he didn’t when I confessed my feelings for him?",04Aug2020,1

You can pick up the general idea from the message I want to send, but I went into detail in a previous post (I don’t remember the exact title, but there was a warning about death threats in it)

But basically: a close friend stopped talking to me out of the blue, four months later I find out she’d lied and told everyone I’d sent her death threats and bullied her

I want to send this to her mother, someone aware my friend stopped talking to me but not yet aware of what I’ve found out

“I know it’ll be annoying to get yet another message from me, but I’ve found out about something very concerning from a friend of mine.

Apparently she left school because of bullying, which I’m sad to hear about and I’m sorry I didn’t stop it from happening. But, according to a friend Chloe said that I had joined in with this bullying and had sent her threats of death.

I know that I never did this, I didn’t even know she was being bullied, but there’s no reason for you to believe me when I say that. However, I’m genuinely concerned about her mental well-being...

Can you talk to her? There’s no need to bring up this whole “drama” thing, but it sounds like she really needs someone to talk to right now”

Please suggest what I could say better, or what I don’t need to include/should add

950,"I was harassed and almost ran off the road by 3-4 middle eastern guys.

It all started when I was leaving work last friday. I was walking to my car where my girlfriend was waiting because she had just been into town and I was going to drive her back home.

We were driving, and I was about to turn left out onto the main road. I was halfway out into the street when a speeding car coming from the opposite direction was trying to squeeze his way through. I just kept on executing my turn because I thought ""This idiot has to stop"", and he did, but he didn't like it.

I was done with my turn, but he honked his horn at me twice. I turned around and did the universal hand gesture for ""What the fuck, dude?"". They followed me for a little bit and when I checked my rearview mirror I saw there were two middle eastern guys in the front seat, they were making indecipherable hand gestures at me, so I kept doing the ""What the fuck do you want?"" gesture a little while until we were driving over a viaduct with two lanes. They drove up alongside my car, and since it was hot outside I had my window down. They rolled down their window and the guy in the passenger seat said something along the lines of ""Come on then"", a clear invitation to fight.

I work out every single day, cardio on even days, weight lifting on odd ones. I'm not huge, but even in a 2v1 I would've liked my odds. However, my girlfriend was still sitting right next to me, and I just wanted to go home. I don't remember if I responded with anything or if I just stared angrily at the guy, if I responded it was probably something like ""What the fuck do you want?"".

We kept driving, and they were driving incredibly erratically, in the middle of the road while right next to us, I had to drive up onto the curb to not crash, lucky there were no pedestrians around. If they had forced me further I would've fallen off the viaduct.

Luckily while we were driving we met another car ahead of us in my lane, so I had to slow down and they seemed to drive on ahead, I thought they were finally going to fuck off.

I kept driving, and after a very short while noticed that there was a car behind us, with two middle eastern guys, I could not tell if they were the same guys, I mean no offense but they all look very similar, same hair, same beard and what had transpired moments ago went so fast that I didn't really get a good look at them, and I didn't get their license plates or even make of the car. The only thing that reassured me a little was that those two middle eastern guys behind me right now seemed perfectly calm in their car, and were not driving erratically, yet.

I don't know if they noticed me eyeing them in the rearview mirror, or if they just gave up, but I saw in my rearview mirror how they stopped their car in the middle of the road, did a K-turn (Blocking other traffic while doing it) and drive away the opposite way they came from. What made me kind of nervous is that when they did the K turn there were two cars who turned, so I don't know if these middle eastern guys were even more 3-4 people dispersed amongst two cars. On the viaduct there was only one car, I am sure.

But why would they just randomly drive there, then both turn around?

I live in a small town, so odds are I might run into these pricks again, and I don't feel good about them probably being able to recognize me, while I can't tell any of them apart. 

I needed to get this out there, hopefully someone has some advice or reassuring words. Even if I never see them again it feels bad knowing that people out there act like this, and can do this to others and get away with it just because they know a bunch of angry wannabe thugs.

961,"I’ve had this guy friend for about 7 years - we met at work years ago and became close friends over time. With him being gay, we had a fun/special type friendship; pre-corona we’d go out and dance, adventure places and explore, and just in general have fun together. Though, I’m making him sound too sweet- he had an aspect of his personality that was very destructive. He absolutely refused to work through emotional arguments and would instead sweep them under the rug, pretend like they never happened, and move on.

I put up with this. Over the years there have been many instances between us where I wanted to have communication on issues/situations, to no avail. One example of this would be his depression, where he’d flat out ignore my attempts at communication for months and then out of the blue call me like nothing happened. Another example would be all the times he’d (perhaps slightly drunkenly) ask to kiss me/makeout while we were out having fun. He also went through periods of trying to be very “jokingly” physically intimate with me. When I one day confessed to him all my feelings for him, how the friendship was really confusing for me, and how I wanted to know why he wanted to kiss me, he got angry and would shut me out.

Fast forward to recently where we’d been spending a lot of time together (similar work schedules). I just got this brand new job a few months ago and it’s been the most incredible experience - he knows how great a gig it is, and he’s made multiple sly comments making fun of the company (despite me offering to try and help him get in). We were out for some beverages when we ran into one of his friends from high school. She was amicable, introduced herself and asked us where we were working. I shared my role and workplace. Later in the evening, my friend made a mocking comment and said it was so funny when I told her where I work. As he was laughing aloud about it, I asked him why it was funny. I said there was nothing funny about it and told him he was being mean. He replied saying that he refused to be called mean while out in public and said he was going to get up and leave. At that point I reiterated how I thought he was being mean and (drunkenly) got up, left him, and walked home. 

He later texted me and I told him off (still somewhat drunk) - I said it’s unfair to make fun of someone’s workplace and I was sick of it. I told him to leave me be and that maybe losing a friend would help him become a better person.

I know what I said was harsh, and I feel like a complete idiot for actually being the one to start the feud and “ending” the friendship. As I’m getting older I’m learning that cutting people off out of spite isn’t always a great option. For me, when I do that it’s always stemming from pure anger, pain, feelings of hurt. But when I cool off, I’d rather talk with them and try to communicate about our viewpoints. I just feel so stupid that I said that to him because what I really was feeling inside was “how could you say something so hurtful to me? I don’t want to be hurt by you so leave me alone.” So, I tried communicating with him afterwards and, almost 2 weeks later and he let me know he doesn’t want to continue being friends.

I guess I’m posting here because I’m wondering how you would handle this situation. How do I stop getting so angry/forward and learn to cool off when I’m mad? How can my friend of so many years actually be done with me? Despite the negative things about him, we have had some of the greatest times together and it pains me that this friendship is over.

Since I've started, I've worked overtime once but I've been offered it in total, six times. Of those six there was once I tried taking it but someone else accepted it before me, so I've turned it down four times in total.

Today I received a text message from a co-worker on a different shift saying that our supervisor asked him to ask me if I would be interested in two days of overtime, one of which would be on my day off. Included in that text was ""This will be the last time OT is offered to you if your not interested."" I'm very confused on why suddenly if I don't accept, I'll be bared from being asked.

I'm a (29 F) and is planning to move to San Diego with my bf(29). We've been together for many years.  I'm currently living with my family, but have been planning to move out regardless.  The first time I mentioned it to my mother about San Diego, in May; her response was ""you're an idiot and cannot afford it.""  Now my bf has money and will be paying for most of it until I'm finished school (which is close to be finsished).  The move is for his job mainly.  We have a place picked out already and I it's close to the college that picked to finish my program.  I mentioned today tobmy sister that I'm going to finish schooling in San Diego and my mother butts in and says, ""you're not moving to San Diego!""

981,"So I have this friend that I’ve known for a few months now. We’ve hung out here and there but we haven’t hung out too often until recently. Recently we’ve been hanging out a lot more and it’s resulted in a small crush.

My issue isn’t that I’m too nervous to talk to him. Like I said I’ve been friends with him for a while now. My issue is making constant conversation with him for a good amount of time. 

For example we went to the lake with a few friends and when we left it was him and I riding in my truck. We made conversation for a few minutes before we just turned up the music and jammed the rest of the ride home. 

I don’t want to get too big of a crush on him until I can make good conversation with him and get to know him a little better. I’ve always struggled making conversation with people and it’s one of my biggest faults. I ask questions but after a while you start running out of questions to ask people.

982,"I was fired last September after I bought my first set of nice furniture, so it's been in storage since last November. 

I was paying $40ish per month because I was sharing it with my mom but she is moving out of the unit in October. 

I originally gave myself one year max for the storage unit but now it's August and I don't have a full time job still. I'm renting a furnished basement apartment month to month.

I like the freedom of being able to pick up and move.

But I also think I might be settling down in MA in the next few years.

When I think about selling the stuff I feel resentment and frustration. I know I won't be able to get good prices and I bought it all new. Also I think selling this stuff will make me feel like the Canada chapter of my life is over and I failed. I guess if I can keep the furniture at least I will have interesting pieces someday in my house and I can say I got that in Toronto.

I wish I had a family with a house that would let me put this stuff in their basement. :(

I don't know how to decide how long I should keep this stuff in storage. Would love your opinions or advice!",04Aug2020,1
983,"Basically, I have cut all contact with my in-law family because they have too many issues, I just cannot be around them anymore. 
They live one time zone away from us, so pretty far. 

I am afraid that my nephew (21) may actually suffer from Psychosis, he is simply in a really bad way and doesn’t really make sense. He also has incredible mood swings and is quite scary at times. He has a history of illicit drug use, not sure what, how long and how much, but not just weed and booze, he took other stuff as well. I think that may have fried his brain. Or maybe he just gets high on the reg, still and it’s the drugs talking, not sure, though. 
He recently broke off all contact with me, yet reaches out in peculiar ways, pretending to be somebody else, all kinds of charade, (just this second he is responding to my YT comments with a fake user, and he also cursed me out earlier with that same user) I thought he was taking a piss out of me but now I think he may be actually indeed losing touch with reality and it’s actually not fun and games anymore. 

Now, I believe he really, really needs to seek help for his mental health. This doesn’t seem to be something he can just live with, this is very severe, the way I see it.
I am the closest person in his life. He doesn’t really trust anybody, and rightfully so, people in his surrounding are unsafe and not stable at all. He has nobody he can rely on, he half-relied on me there for a bit, but he felt very conflicted about it, too. He basically has the biggest crush on me and he really can’t handle it bc I am a whopping 25 years older than him and married. I think this crush developed because he has no mother to rely on, so I became his surrogate. He has been emotionally attached to me profoundly since he was a very young child, he recently confessed. He still lives at home, but I do not trust his parents anymore. 

I know he is a full-on adult now and he gets to make his own decisions. But he is not able to do that, he may be suicidal, severely depressed, he has access to weapons, I just think something really horrible could potentially happen given his level of despair and rage at times. 

I could just straight out tell him to seek help, I actually already have done so, but not sure if he will do anything himself. For a second I considered reaching out to his father but that would be like ratting him out plus father is useless when it comes to mental health. He is a ‘push it down and ignore it and all will certainly be well’ kind of a guy. 
They have been contributing to or even caused his condition, so not a good idea. 

We’ve had massive stress in the family lately, things he most definitely is too young to handle all on his own so I tried to be there for him by writing him lots of emails. He read them all and they did help him, I can tell and he said so himself. 
Still, the stuff he needs to face now is simply horrible plus he lost the last stable people in his life recently with the big fallout. He is not allowed to be in touch with me, never was, so he started sneaking, which does make sense. 
He is super controlling and bossy and simply cannot take a no for an answer, so it’s been tough on me to loosen the grip he had on me. He is just incredibly intense in all his emotional expression, everything is on steroids for him. So in a way, I should be thankful that he broke us up. 

I can definitely totally see myself spiralling into a dangerous and scary dynamic with him, at times he reminds me of Ted Bundy, or better yet Norman Bates. 
But I still love him so much and it is sooo hard to just leave him fending for himself, so I have been risking my sorry existence in order to help him and who knows, one day he may strangle me as a thank you. 

This has been eating away at me for 2 years now and I finally am starting to see what the problem is with him. He was just acting completely selfish and kind of out of character the last time I saw him, that’s when I started worrying about him. His family always tells me just how fine, fine, fine he is doing and how very proud they are of him and all his accomplishments, while in reality, he was just rejected from Uni... bunch of liars... :( 


What would you do in my situation? Has anybody ever lived through something similar? 
I can not bear the thought of him getting completely destroyed and I knew he was in deep trouble yet I was not there for him...",04Aug2020,1
984,"Bit of backstory: My mum &amp; Grandma have had a difficult relationship but over recent years they've become closer. My Grandma has had cancer for a year but has been deteriorating rapidly over the past few days (doctor said shes got a month left at most). She lives away, we visit her almost everyday and she has an at-home carer.

My mum is a single parent and doesn't have a big support 'net' of people to talk to. I've never experienced grieving and want to help her through this time. Whenever I ask if there's anything I can do to help she tells me that there's nothing - but I call tell she's extremely stressed and anxious (obviously).

I've already been doing some extra chores around the house to try to ease some stress from my mum. Because I'm only 15, I can't run errands or drive to the supermarket so this is the best I can do.

Is there anything else I can do to help my mum, anything I can do/say while my Grandma is dying and after she's gone?

985," I'm sure a lot of people have a collection of selfies in their phone. For me I've been taking one almost every day. I feel I'm doing it just to remind myself that I look ok and haven't changed much. Like of course not, nobody ages over night but I feel I need this constant reassurance that I'm not. Not just that but that I look ok.

 Still I don't know what the hell I'm trying to accomplish because I pretty much take the same selfie and see the same exact face every time. What do I need to keep taking them for? I try to look for flaws only to be disappointed every time. Nobody cares more than me either. I get some sort of high taking picture of myself and seeing what I look like everyday.",04Aug2020,1

I have been with my girlfriend for almost three years now. Our anniversary is on August 24th. We are the average couple; students working on their Master’s degrees and both working full time. We travel, sleep over each others houses(still both live with parents), we are intimate, we have some arguments but never anything huge that we would break up over. Around June 28th my grandmother was diagnosed with COVID-19 and I was near her before she was diagnosed. Meaning I was at risk, and I began quarantining myself and my girlfriend completely understood and thought it was for the best. 

We continued to text and talk for the next two weeks and it all seemed normal. She works at a mental hospital and works night shifts every once in a while (11pm-7am) and that has messed us up in the sense of communication because she’ll be awake and I’ll be sleeping or she will go in to work early at 7am and get off at 3pm and I’ll still be sleeping. 

Without seeing each other for the past two weeks, although we were talking, we weren’t talking as much as usual, I can attest to that. Mostly, because she was either busy with patients at work, or because I was asleep (my sleep schedule was also very wonky at the time. I wasn’t sleeping well and fell a little “depressed” because of the fact that my grandma and I might’ve had COVID-19. On July 14th we both had received negative COVID-19 test results  She was already being very distant and didn’t want to meet up and I insisted. She had a doctors appointment that day and I knew where her doctors was so I just showed up there and she smiled when she saw me and it felt kind of normal. After her doctors appointment, we decided to pick up Denny’s and take it to the park for a “picnic”. We were talking the whole time at the park and before leaving she told me she wanted a break in the relationship. I began to ask why to find out why she wanted this and asked what I did wrong and she said it was because she was confused because she had some sort of feelings for a coworker at her job. She said she didn’t know what to do and wanted a break to figure things out. At the time, I was so in shock that I didn’t ask the right questions, but I took it maturely and respected her decision and we left separately and started the break. She said she wanted a month and that we could text because she would feel very odd if we didn’t. She confirmed at the park that she did not love the coworker nor felt anything really for him, it was just a physical attraction and that she just didn’t know what to do. On July 19th she came over to my house and we made up; (so much for a month). She said she loved me and only me and wanted to be with me and no one else and we got back together. During the five day break I sent her two bouquets of flowers, one to her house and one to her job, just so she could see that I was thinking of her. She greatly appreciated it and showed it. We decided that what we needed was to get away and go on a mini-vacation and that’s what we did. (Mainly her idea).The following week we went on a 4 day getaway and spent our time at a hotel and traveled the city we went to. It was perfect, as if nothing had happened and we had a great time. 

Now, two days ago, after asking the right questions, because she wouldn’t lie to me but she wouldn’t tell me the truth unless I asked, I found out that her coworker actually kissed her before we even went on break and she kissed back. After that kiss is when she decided to go on break and kissed him 2-3 times after that. Her excuse is that since we hadn’t seen each other for “so long” (2 weeks or so) that she felt detached from me and lonely and felt like I did not want her because I was not talking to her as much. She said it was a “normal make out session” and that they did it at work. I’ve asked her several times if they went out anywhere together and asked if they even texted but she said no to both and that it was just a work fling that happened just at work a few times. Mind you, we had said to each other that we weren’t going to be hooking up with other people when we were talking about going on break. So, she cheated on me, lied to me about it, and then asked to go on a break, and kissed this coworker again. She has guaranteed to me that she never had sex with him nor even touched each other while kissing. It was just a spur of the moment thing at work and that they just kissed a few times. After she told me, I was very hurt and didn’t know what to think but after talking a while and after she told me she would break things off with him completely because she says she loves me and only wants to be with me and said she has taken this as a learning experience and won’t do it again, I forgave her. It’s been a couple of days now and we have had sex and she has slept over but it just doesn’t feel the same anymore. Every time I look at her, I think of him, every time I kiss her I think about his lips on hers. I told her it would take time for things to
go back to normal and she understood. Tomorrow she goes to work and says she will talk to her coworker and break things off with him. (Her coworker is 37 years old and has a wife and two kids btw).

990,"To make things clear - why didn’t I post this on:
r/AITA - because I’m asking for advice
r/relationship_advice - because I’m asking for judgement
Sooo I think this is the best place to post.

I (15M) am abstinent. My friends like to drink and smoke a lot, but I was always against it. I haven’t even drank energy drinks once in my life - I don’t think I ever needed them and I know they can be harmful. I don’t think these things are *that* bad in small amounts, but they quickly can get out of control.  

Introducing let’s call her Beth (14F). I know her for several years, but we have seen each other maybe 1 or 2 times a year on camps. We had fun together. She had a crush on me for long time. Recently we got closer and we started seeing each other almost daily. ATM we are just friends, but we are really close. 

Anyways, Beth likes to drink energy drinks. That wouldn’t be a big problem if not for physical and mental health concerns that I have. She does weird things after drinking them. She gets really unpredictable. Beth admitted that once after drinking she went on a field alone, and she started crying for no reason. And for the physical health - she is really clumsy - she harms herself every time. She probably has some minor heart problems. And still, that doesn’t stop her drink this crap. 

I told her what I think about it, she talked with her sister, and decided to stop drinking. She failed after few days. We communicate via Snapchat. She told me she was going to buy a drink for her sister, and when I asked her if I should ask her sister - she said no. That’s when I snapped and didn’t respond to her for the rest of the day. She sent me various texts like: “At least i was honest with You”. 

Some time passed, and I saw a post to dare someone to not drink for a month. I dared her, and she accepted. Two days go by and you know what? She sends me a photo of an energy drink and Netflix, and tells me that she cannot take it. I was mad at her and stopped responding to her again. This happend today and I plan to not respond to her for the next day too. She says that she’s really sad that I don’t respond to her - I think that I should be the sad one here! I care for her, and she can’t even keep her words for more than 2 days.

And that’s when it came to me - Am I the Asshole here? I think that I may be little over controlling, like - I’m not her father? But at the flip side - that’s really harmful for her and I think it’s the only way to make her stop.

What do you think? Did I go too far? Should I stop convincing her in this way? What should I do? Should I apologize to her? Or the other way around?

Thanks for any honest opinions, and excuse me for any errors - English is not my main language, but I try my best.",04Aug2020,1
991,"Im (17f) doing intermittent fasting so I only eat a few hours that I'm actually home, and I like to eat snacks here and there. I dont do cico (calorie counting) but I do make sure I'm not overeating/eating from boredom ect.  

I guess that means things I buy (with my own money) are just sitting there, tormenting my brother (12) who is home all day with free reign of the house. Anything left in the deep freezer/kitchen is seen as up for grabs for him, and boy does he eat sweets. It was someone's birthday recently and he ate 5 out of the 12 cupcakes the night before, probably along with icecream and 90% of the milk in the house. 

To solve this (partially) I bought a mini fridge for my room (after my mom insisting that we shouldn't have to hide food, no fucking shit we shouldn't HAVE to) but I believe hes stealing stuff out of there too (going to get a lock but I have to get paid again first)

Now, I'm only allowed to have fridge stuff in there, so other snacks (oreos, chips, ect) still have to be kept in the kitchen. Well... I know for a fact hes eaten both my oreos and a bag of chips. I came home and wanted to sit down with ~5 oreos and a glass of milk. I still had MY milk in my fridge, but who woulda guessed it. 2 oreos left in the family sized container on the counter, closed improperly, and almost no milk left in the kitchen refrigerator (maybe like 1/4 cup)

I confronted (maybe yelled a little bit) at him about, not only eating my food, but leaving the TWO oreos improperly closed on the counter. I also texted my mom (who was still at work) she said SHE would buy me more and not to argue about food. 

I bought another bag, and specifically told him this time (since ""we didnt tell him not to eat [an entire family sized bag of oreos in one sitting], he didnt know it was yours"" bla bla bla) that it was mine and not to eat it, and I come home to it the same way. My chips also surprisingly emptied (again, maybe a handful left, just so he could deny it) and he denies touching them.

This kid is pissing me off, and so is my mom for not stopping him. She said if I kept arguing ""over food"" she would make it where she was the only one buying food and it would be a free for all, aka first come first serve, aka im the only one who's actually being hurt by that threat.

I dont get how she sees me as the bad guy, not even making him pay for the goards of shit he eats. Those oreos would've lasted me a whole month, but as of right now, I'm out however much they cost with nothing to show for it. ""She'll buy me another pack"" just for his piggy ass to help himself. 

What should I do? Just wait out the 10 months (9 months 4 weeks 1 day) until I can move out? That seems like forever. Is there like a magical combination of words I can say to politely tell him I will shit on everything he owns if he doesnt back off? I'm honestly at a loss here, theres a lot of bad shit going on in my house but eating 5 goddamned oreos after an 11 hr workday would make it so much better, atleast at the moment. 

Tl;dr: my brothers a pig and eats everything and anything he wants and no one seems to care, only viewing me as the bad guy for ""hiding/arguing over food"", when its food I bought with my own hard-earned money. Sorry if this is a mess.",04Aug2020,1

Covid messed up the internships I had an interview prior so now I was stuck going on indeed and asking professors for any opportunities. Nothing came up. 

Internships I apply for are video editor interns 
2 internships got back to me. One I didn’t answer I felt like I would get absolutely nothing out of it. This one that I replied too I thought it would be intresting plus they SAID they were willing to pay. I replied they sent me what they’re about and gave me a bunch of criteria I need to meet and when I’m ready for an interview. They then said in the same email that it was unpaid when on the post on indeed it said it was. 

This is a remote internship. But they are about the 4th industrial revolution of technology and AI, I was super confused why do they want a video editor. And what does this have to do with that. Anyways I have two choices ultimately and I need advice please. 

Since the fall semester is coming up the deadlines for internships are waning. Should I

Try to take this internship currently work 10-20 hours a week basically for free, get my credits.

If I get this feeling from the start of the day, god the entire day I’ll just be thinking about eating all the time until night hits and I can’t for the life of me take it anymore and just eat everything in sight. 2 hrs ago when I felt a binge coming, I ate an apple (wasn’t satisfied) then ate a tangerine (wasn’t satisfied) then ate a piece of bread (hmm) then ate a slice of cheese (okay now I was satisfied). 40 mins later the feeling of binging is on again so I eat half an avocado, 2 squares of dark chocolate and 2 tsp of Nutella. Guess what? I still want to fucking binge. If you think this is too much food, all of this is just to tame the binge we haven’t started yet. Any advice is appreciated!",04Aug2020,1
994,"Hiya! So, I just graduated high school. Lots of stuff is happening in my life and it’s milestones I wish my old best friend was around for. She did something a few months ago that was very unlike her. She spoke behind my back to a girl that I used to be friends with. Basically to make it short what happened was the girl was using my best friend for her car, I brought it to my best friends attention that SHE WAS BEING USED.. and it back fired in my face! It was ENTIRELY unlike my best friend to do that. The girl my bestfriend talked about me to is going to another state 3.5 hours away for college. However even since then, it’s hurt me pretty badly. We don’t talk any more, in fact the last time she texted me was our graduation day.. she told me “congrats” to which I responded “congrats to you too, it’s a shame we ended the way we did.” She never responded. I’ve been pretty alone all summer feeling like I’M the one who did something bad. Well, anyway, that’s why i’ve came to Reddit! Any advice is welcomed. Should I text her and check up on her perhaps do a coffee date or just leave it alone? Thanks.",04Aug2020,1

997,"Hi so I’m new here &amp; this is my first post &amp; I have no clue if anyone will respond but incase they do..

A couple of weeks ago my bf asked me to try on some sexy underwear he bought for his ex before me. I didn’t want to because my body isn’t as good as hers &amp; Its weird but he talked me into it and it looked awful so I took it off straight away and felt rubbish. He tried to cheer me up by trying to turn me on and I told him I just wasn’t feeling sexy anymore but he just kept on going then started penetrating me, he asked if it was good and I didn’t answer him and just lay there like a dead body basically. This was the first time I had ever not been in the mood with him, and I usually get really into it, plus I’ve spoken to him on many occasions about how in the past I’ve had great trouble getting the words out when I want to stop as a result of past trauma so I think he should’ve realised. 

When he was done I cried and he felt awful and kept bringing it up and telling me how ashamed he was, and he even spoke to his mum about it as he felt so bad, but then the next time he got drunk he did it again. This time around I actually kept telling him I just wanted to stop, cuddle and go to sleep but for a couple of hours he kept taking the covers off me and fingering me and trying to get me to have sex. I also told him he should’ve been more aware of not pressuring me after what happened last time and after apologising for it so much, to which he just responded with lewd comments about what he wanted us to do to each other. 

I spoke to him about it the next day and he is apologising lots again and saying the same stuff as before basically, but it’s harder to believe this time around. I don’t know what to do because I love him so much, everyone who knows him thinks he’s an amazing guy and he really is! And I also adore being a part of his family. His mum &amp; little sister are the best and i couldn’t bear to lose any of them. I just don’t want to let myself down by ignoring red flags. 

I’ve spoken to a few friends about it that know him well and they think I should tell him we are over if it happens again and to wait and see if he makes any kind of special effort to make it up to me rather than just believing his words, as we all know he isn’t usually that kind of guy; he’s so caring &amp; great most of the time. What do you guys think of this? Am I being an idiot for not ending it straight away? He was drunk on a while other level I’ve never seen him on when it happened, but I know if someone else was telling me this I’d probably be telling them to get out :(",04Aug2020,1

I saw someone else make a similar post that had a very similar problem to me. Someone commented that ""she may just be the face to the feeling of missing out on something"". That's probably what's happening to me. I really have never been good at analyzing my own emotions.

It's a small town, she's friends with some people I was friends with, so I knew about her, I just didn't know her personally. The guy who was dating her (my crush) kept posting pictures of them together and they were super cute and I thought ""oh I wish I had that damn it"".

But recently, I started feeling a bit down sometimes, and it's something that I've experienced in previous relationships. My gf is so knowledgable about art history and music in particular, and in lots of other subjects in general, and I'm always so impressed by her knowledge, and I feel down because I always feel kind of stupid. She says I'm very knowledgable about lots of stuff too but I can't believe it. The relationship is mostly great but this little habit of feeling down instead of, you know, feeling lucky that I have a gf who can teach me lots of things. 

I've been seeing psychologists for a few years and I've already told my current one about this issue, but I feel annoyed because I can't quite put my finger on where the issue comes from and how to deal with this.

1018,"My landlord hired a housekeeper to clean our apartment before another roommate joined us. (He usually does this). Based off of previous experiences (I contacted past tenants) with the cleaners he’s hired, they’ve never had things stolen. Our landlord also claims that the people who recommended her have never had any issues with her. This time it was a weekend, she came with her daughter. 

My roommate and I discovered two days after they had cleaned that either one of them had taken an old wallet (with money inside, healthcare cards, but no mj IDs) and an expensive 24K gold necklace. At first we thought we were imagining things, but we looked through the whole house, garage, car, sidewalks, storage rooms, etc. and indeed realized they had been stolen. 

We have accepted that we will likely not get these items back. When we went to inform our landlord, he appeared to brush off our claims with “keep looking” and “I hope you find your things”. We’ve looked through every nook and cranny (e.g., we dismantled all of our shelves, looked through boxes, bags, etc. to see if our things had fallen). We have messaged him several times about our experience to only have this be his response:
- “Sorry to hear about both! Please continue to look. The cleaning person, xxx, came highly recommended and never had any issues - though it was the first time I used her.”
- “I reached out already to my contact. They were very surprised and disappointed with what happened. Hopefully, both of you will find everything.”

1020,"Hello,

I am all out of ideas here so anything will be helpful at this point please!

My bro has served me with an ultimatum that this is this argument is sorted or he walks away from the family for good. For him to even say this I am so angry inside at him, because I believe in my core that you fight to keep your family no matter how bad it gets. 

Me and my brother and sister used to be really close, ever since my sis worked for my bro it's gone horribly downhill. To the point where they can't be in the same room together without it being hostile and nasty.

Both of them have opposite opinions as to why this is happening, and see the exact same events from their own side. They are both so hurt by it but from my own direct observations I believe my brother is fully at fault. 

Over the years this has been happening my bro seems to have less and less empathy and in my opinion is selfish. He's also tactless and mean with my sis so I feel a lot of anger towards him. As a person he is fun to be around but self absorbed and lazy when it comes to other people (always on his phone in your company, rude to his lovely partner in front of his family, doesn't think birthdays are important so he's late/half hearted to family parties, tactlessand careless around family members that need support due to their own personal issues I.e. Grief ) 

I worked for him briefly too but it ended one weekend when the manager was away, and I was put in a situation where health and safety was a risk and an event was cancelled by the booked person as a result (the manager had forgotten to tell me to carry from the higher shelves the huge heavy speakers to the lower floor. It was by that point a busy, wet, bar floor and impractical and unsafe to do so). 

I refused to do this or let my brother threaten other staff into doing it through the phone. By this point I was in tears at the whole situation and told him on the phone and in person how angry I was that I was put in that situation. The fallout from this was that he called our mum to say he was worried I was having a mental breakdown and may need to be sectioned. 

Months later he still thinks I wasnt	 ""acting normal"" and hasn't considered to even say ""we don't agree, it was horrible but I'm sorry it was stressful for you and let's move on"". Hearing him say again that he thinks his sane, intelligent, logical sister was mental unwell to disagree with him fills me with so much rage, I don't know how I can move past it. 

I can't see how we more forward because we all feel hard done to and no one is willing to move forward without an apology, and none of us think we are in the wrong. Ive spoken to my brother and his partner this week and they have confirmed the above - they feel hard done to and isolated now that me and my sis don't talk to them as much anymore. 


Tl;Dr bro and sis fallen out but I have issues with bro too. How do I get everyone to move on and try new tactics to spend time together happily?

***Mental Health, Insecurities about Appearance (****written in 2018, edited overall well into 2020. Journal - Blog Hybrid)*

***Hating my looks***

*I hate my looks. I always have and I always will. I hate that none of this will change. I hate to deal with anger, depression and anxiety as a result. I hated that I couldn't understand my feelings for the longest time regarding all of this -- something that some people don't experience. While I can change my body shape, get my voice checked by a doctor to rid myself of its hoarseness, and improve my vocabulary, the insecurities that hurt me the most regard features about my appearance that I can't change.*

*I am repulsed and disappointed by my face. My brown skin, large nose, small lips, large ears, hair that never works with my face shape are my main flaws. When I enter the bathroom, I have to adjust the mirror so that I don't have to see myself. It's depressing seeing myself.* 

***Rejected because of my looks***

*People generally want nothing to do with ugly people, look down on ugly people, consciously or unconsciously think we're less capable, less trustworthy, creepy and people may treat them worse or even exclude them. I don't go outside because I don't want to be a part of a society where I'm rejected or seen as less****.*** *How can I go outside comfortably when I'm seen as though I am fecal matter unconsciously? Why can't I be mentally strong enough to not care about how I'm perceived? Why should I invest time into something that doesn't serve me? I feel like giving up on anything involving interacting with people. I go back and forth with myself. Are there people who exist that look beyond looks to accept me? Black people and the LGBTQ are accepted and advocated for, why can't it be the same for ugly people* 

*(That being the case, black people and the LGBTQ are represented in media lately not because people like them any more than they did before. It's because influencers and organizations have to save face in a world where these groups of people have found their voices thanks to them standing up for themselves and coming together. The majority of people don't care one bit about their struggles)?*

*Ever since I was a teenager, I tended to stay indoors because of this for days on end, weeks on end. Sometimes even months on end.* 

***A short note about rejection*** 

*Standing at 5'5"" or 165cm makes me short. It sucks. It adds insult to injury. It's just another quality of mine that I dislike especially because it causes people to see you as less. It also makes me feel beneath Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don’t want short men anyways. I can't even feel manly if I wanted to.* 

***Brown is the new nothing***

*Brown skinned men have it bad. Dating studies show that brown skinned men are the least desired romantically. Dark skin isn't attractive here. Our facial structures are less attractive too. We are seen as less manly, and less human. White men are seen as attractive because of their light skin, governing eurocentric beauty standards and because of white supremacy. Those ideals shaped the western world, so while there is less racism here, it still pervades people living today. It wasn't that long ago that people of color were seen as unequal and forced to have unequal treatment. While slavery and segregation are gone, people of color still face discrimination and are seen as less than. Oppressive systems are still active which keep people of color destined to fail and destined to never find their true self.*

*Negative stereotypes don’t help brown men either, as they perpetuate this idea of inferiority subconsciously. We’re known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly, submissive, IRS Scammers, terrorists  and more. We're not represented much, and if we are, it's not in a good way. At least African Americans have Black Lives Matter and liberals who advocate for them. We have nothing like that. People don’t even recognize our struggles. Travel videos over the internet make brown people out to be bad people. Rich white men have the luxury of having a peaceful vacation, but instead of living in peace, they want to take the time out of their day to “expose” how hard working men and women of their poor nations are trying to make a living by raising prices for tourists and making them look like they’re in the wrong. If a tourist doesn’t want to buy the products, they don’t have to “expose” these hard working men and women for raising prices. Tourists are likely to be wealthy, and sellers are right to try to capitalize off of that. There exist a myriad of videos on YouTube featuring predominantly American men prank calling indian men who are known to scam. I do not condone scamming in the slightest; however, the way these videos are edited suggest that all indian men are these shady people. They incorporate cartoon images of disfigured people and make viewers associate that with indian men. While I don't want to stoop down to the level of these inconsiderate people who make others out to look bad, I can't help but think that white people view themselves as superior, see others as inferior and enjoy mocking those who aren't like them. I can't bring myself to hate these people because of their ignorance. All I can do is hate having been born a brown man*

*(Going off on a tangent here, while it’s nice that minorities are being represented, representation isn’t the end goal. If a problem hasn’t been solved, it gets addressed. Once it’s solved, it is left alone. That means that as long as there are race issues, race will be a topic. That means that while people are more conscious than ever about race issues, it puts a lot of pressure on minority groups. We want representation and for people to stop talking about race. When race isn’t acknowledged anymore, we’ll feel less self conscious, normal and not seen as people who need help.).*

***Attractive and white people at the top*** 

*In addition to not wanting to go outside because I don't want to be somewhere where I'm less, there are specific groups of people who I don't want to be around either. I don't go to places where these kinds of people frequent either. I've been conditioned to feel as though I don't belong. The average New Yorker my age will have likely graduated college and enjoys activities like going to rooftop bars, restaurants, museums etc. The idea of places like that intimidate me because of this imaginary class barrier. It is very well legal for me to go somewhere like that, but I don't feel like I could.*

*Governing eurocentric beauty standards denote me as socially inferior in the western world. As a result of being seen as inferior to people overall, I especially feel uncomfortable around attractive people and white people. My views might be distorted from the truth because I've never been in a position where I could get to know the real person behind an attractive or white face.* 

*Attractive people are made out to be superior to others and often feel superior to others because society and media emphasize looks and sexualize everything because it sells and grabs attention. Modeling reinforces the idea that people with attractive features are superior because the goal is to establish what beauty is, which is creating a hierarchy for looks, which leads to hierarchy of value as by emphasizing looks, modeling is making people think that looks equate to value. It is exclusive, and exclusion and rejection hurt people. Attractive people also feel superior to others because they place their value on their looks and sexual value, and when someone is repulsive like myself, I am seen as worthless.*

*White people have always seemed to be at the top though how I understand them. They're designed to be because of systems that benefit them, give them privilege and oppress and destroy others. As a result, many of them are skilled, talented, successful, confident, wealthy, intelligent, not plagued with insecurities and adversities and powerful. They're blessed with light skin, tall and slender figures, good health and attractive features. Their looks, and imaginary value that society has put on them and real value based on skills, talents and accomplishments make me feel small, unmanly, and uncomfortable.* 

*White supremacy doesn't exist blatantly anymore. It's subliminal. Many things are made by them and made for them. It’s often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy American ones (middle class and wealthy are the same thing to me. Middle class means privileged and happy to me, while wealthy means super privileged and happy). Sure, minorities are receiving more representation, but it'll never replace anything. Eurocentric beauty standards still dominate and the rich and privileged will continue to be as such.* 

***Class and Status***

*My feelings concern beyond white people though. They also concern feeling uncomfortable and beneath people with higher socioeconomic status, professionalism, intelligence, value based on impact on the world, knowledge about the city and world, experience and accomplishments. They intimidate me especially because I don't know their true selves. I have no accomplishments or skills to my name to make me feel on par.* 

*It is draining seeing people who I'm beneath now and always. Triggers are seeing resumes and business profiles of professionals like linkedin accounts, seeing people in person and hearing about someone's quality through word of mouth. I feel pressured by myself to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par and to be accepted. It doesn't help that people in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you’re good enough for the job, rich white men perpetuate white supremacy and professionalism, the latter being a  measurement of how assimilated you’ve become to whiteness in the sense that you speak formally or ""properly"" like a white person. It's all about changing to become like them for acceptance. Professionalism and white supremacy are two governing entities that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. It's crazy though because I'm so isolated that I'm only now realizing that white people at least here in New York City also like to talk less formally at times too. I'm not sure if it's a mockery of black culture or it's just them wanting to seem cool, so I haven't developed a strong opinion on that.*

***Romance***

*With attractive people, there's another layer to it.* *I'm not good enough for them romantically because I'm ugly which makes me feel beneath them on top of already feeling beneath them because of the looks disparity****.*** *It's hard to not feel beneath someone who thinks you're not good enough for them romantically.* 

***Envy***

*In addition to hating my appearance, hating the disadvantages and internal struggles I face because of them, I naturally envy the lives of others. I envy attractive people, white people and any person who was born into privilege of some sort whether it be being born into wealth or becoming a childhood actor or singer of sorts because they'll have talent and money when they're older as a result of however it was that they got the position to begin with. Their lives are easier by default. Everything involving interacting with others is easier for them because an aesthetically pleasing face is enough for people to give them special treatment (**halo effect**). They are easier to trust. They have money and resources to advance themselves. They have lots of support from their family. Their parents actually know how to raise them. They are treated nicer, have more opportunities to be successful, can literally use their bodies for modeling and acting and adult acting to get ahead in life and to get even more status and success. They can find love and comfort. They can be happy with their looks. They can be confident. Their looks don't hold them back. They aren't seen as inferior. They can be rude and worthless otherwise but people still flock to them. Sometimes, even seeing them smile angers me. Their happiness at times bothers me even when it shouldn't. Their smug faces rub me the wrong way.* 

*On the other hand, I do recognize downsides to being born attractive and white. Attractive people have a hard time deciding whether or not people are with them for their looks or for their personality. Attractive people are seen as a status symbol. Some people feel as though having one by their side elevates their social value. In addition, some people have the intention of pursuing a relationship with attractive people.* 

*White people face guilt because they live in a world where their ancestors were slave owners, racists and bigots. Just like minorities, they were born into a situation that makes them uncomfortable.* 

*Those downsides do not come close to compensating for their privileges and advantages. I’d rather be attractive and white.*  

*The combination of discomfort and envy is overwhelming. I become irritable on top of probably being angry about being envious. The only solution is to escape because the anger and frustration and self consciousness increases. It's another reason why I stay home. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. It's moments like these that have led me to have dark thoughts. They're triggers.*

***Beginnings***

*I first experienced these feelings when I attended high school, like most teenagers do. Before high school, I only went to public schools in my district with other low income minorities or to private schools with low income minorities as well. In high school, there was a clear divide between students of high value, students who put on high value personas and those like myself who have low value. High value students were models, students with parents who actually went to college, let alone top tier colleges, students with variety of skills, talents, and overall character thanks to exposure to the world, exposure I still don't have. Some of them are the kind of students who feign experiences of trauma and adversity when in reality, they have never struggled a day in their life just because it's trendy or to appeal to college admissions representatives. I wasn't prepared for the culture shock. I was struggling emotionally while I was at school, but I didn't have the self awareness or insight or the right words to express myself when I asked to see the school's counselor. I didn't get anywhere with them.* 

*I'm not having experiences that will make me happy or a better person because I'm too stuck because of my insecurities and because I'm stuck because of the depression that comes about as well.*

***February 23rd, 2019 Update***

*So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling. It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary, but I'm sure that in the world of top students, she's just a normal person. I saw their linkedin account. They’ve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteer, have work experience and internship experience, attended an amazing university, graduated with honors speaks 3 languages, supports themselves, isn’t going to settle for the career they have now, once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state, is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It’s a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. It felt like a heartbreak to find out they were married too. It’s not that I had feelings for them, as I barely knew them. I guess it’s more like I was unrealistically and insanely quick to feel fond of them I’m guessing because I felt like they were one of the few people who I really felt treated me like I was an actual human, even though I also didn’t enjoy being treated like I needed the support because it kinda reinforced my inferiority to them. I’m one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. I’ll never be as accomplished as them. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them.* 

*I was also uncomfortable because I didn’t have much to say because I’m not really cultured. I don’t do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time and are situated. I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn’t really help out because I’m not a very social person and I didn’t have much to say because I don’t know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it’s just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable.* 

*I just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn’t going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I’m already ashamed and guilty enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they’re helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college career especially since I’m a lousy 20 year old student at community college. Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did.*",04Aug2020,1

1024,"So I was staying at my girlfriends house over the weekend and went into the basement to grab a beer from the fridge. Between the stairs and the main living space in the basement there is a hallway. Halfway down the hallway is a room where the fridge and beer is. As I’m walking down the hallway, I see my girlfriends dad sitting on the couch like he usually is, watching sports. Usually he says hi when I come down, unless he’s sleeping. I saw him with his eyes closed and assumed he was sleeping...until I saw the unforgettable. He was vigorously jerking off. I quickly went into the beer room obviously making some noise so that he would be aware that someone was down there. I left with my beer and as I left the room, there he was heading back upstairs. We awkwardly said hi to each other and pretended that nothing happened. I don’t think he knows that I saw anything. I haven’t told anyone about what I saw. My only concern is that is his grandkids were also over at their place that day and often go into the basement to play with all of the toys down there. I wouldn’t want them to witness that! I don’t know if I should tell my girlfriend or just leave it. I personally think it’s awkward and maybe a bit gross because of where he was doing that, but also kinda hilarious. 

TLDR: Witnessed my gfs dad jacking off in the basement. Nobody knows I saw, don’t know if I should say anything or just keep it a secret.",04Aug2020,1
1025,"I've had a lot going on recently relating to financial issues. 

I'm suffering from Bipolar Disorder and desperately need to speak to a therapist again. I had to stop seeing my last therapist due to money issues. Lately, my lows have been more severe and result in suicidal thoughts and planning.

On top of the mental health issues, I have an eye issues (Strabismus) that requires surgery. My parents cant afford the expenses to see a surgeon to get the issue treated. 

The problem is...I want to get a job to help my parents pay for things like medical bills and other needs, but I can't due to the inability to drive and my parents working all the time.

1028,"I'm near legal age where I live, I've been living with my grandparents in a farm but I had to come take some classes in the city so my parents suggested staying with them. 
Tonight while I was bathing my dad switched off the gas&amp; meaning no warm water,  I finished taking the soap off bc cold water doesn't bother me much, and then when I got out he said hi,, I was like hey? //we have this lil window between house divisions, and I thought he was hanging clothes or smt// he asked abt the water and I mentioned it got cold all of a sudden and I also mentioned it being super hot at first but ""Usually that's how it is, I guess thats how you guys like it"" he started getting angry because I said 'You guys', and after I explained that I meant the house hold in general he got worse and then told me ""Fuck off"" and to ""Get the fuck out of this house"" since I didn't like the water,I answered saying I didn't want to speak anymore since I felt disrespected and he said I had to ""Earn respect"" since I ""don't deserve it""&amp; told me to fuck off again.
Now my question is, how do I handle this tomorrow? Should I reach out to someone and sleep else where for today? Unfortunately it's a bit late, but I can try.

This isn't the first time he has told me to ""fuck off""  but recently he was trying to get 'better', my moms solution  is for me to go work to get my head free of thoughts relating to this. I've been in this house for only a day though? I'm unsure if she is projecting what she feels onto me.
 I'm also pretty sure my dad is cutting all financial aid by my legal age. 
I honestly don't understand why he sees taking care of his literal children = changing nappies. Providing water doesn't fit into nappies?? And I did not take a long time bathing if that matters, usually I take 5 min but a bit longer if I wash my hair, which I did today.
I don't know what to do or how to adress this but I do know that I'm not taking this behaviour anymore, I think I've had enough years on it and I have been working on realising that I don't deserve to be punished or to fight&amp;try and please him so much to be respected, besides I'm not even sure if the respect he demands is humanly possible.

1031,"For the past 2 years in uni, I've tried industrial engineering and computer science but I didn't like both of them, not a single thing could interest me and I'd always get bored during classes no matter the difficulty of the subject.  So I've been thinking of quitting university for 1 year or to only do 1/3 of the courses and spend the free time on youtube to see how it's like to start a channel, how far I can get with making guitar covers and see if I actually have a passion for it to be able to do it consistently. I've always had this idea in my head so I just wanted to get over these thoughts of mine. Note that I will be living with parents and do part-time during weekends. I'll always go back studying after that one year unless I become successful but I doubt I would get so lucky.

1032,"I'm 20 and I have a sister who is five years younger than me. She constantly plays browser based ""dressing games"" which involves social interaction such as moviestarplanet and avataria.

She has been playing those both for a while and asked me to make her a ""VIP"" in the first game. I refused pretty much most of the time but in the end I ended up making her VIP two times one for a month and one for a week. She gets upset when I refuse it and keeps getting worse each time.

I can surely call myself a gamer since I have wasted countless hours upon mostly fps games and I did buy games from steam.  
What I don't understand is that these both are just cash grabbing games to me. They consist of only playing minigames to earn obtainable in-game currency and spending them on in-game cosmetics, no objectives, no goals. She knows that but keeps trying.

Once, I tried directly talking to her about what I think of these games. I told her that I would state my thoughts part by part and she would correct me whenever I have made a mistake, and if I be rude of any kind I'd just apologize, stop talking and leave the room. To summarize, I told her about both games consisting of endless grinding and buying cosmetics to show off other people and she agreed with all of them. I then told ther again that it does not make sense to pay those games that does not even grant a full time status. Five minutes havent even passed and she still insisted on buying a VIP status.

For the record, that is her own money. I kind of feel bad for not letting her but I know that she could be spending her money on something better.

1033,"Hello everyone this is really important and i need to post about it so i can get some help. Before i turned 17 everything i did and every interaction i had with people online and a majority of in person was monitored by my parents, specifically my mom. when i turned 17 my mom took spyware off of my phone and i was free to actually have interactions. I started making friends online and they are more important o me than anything. my online friends are very important to me because i have social anxiety and aspergers and i have moved 14 times throughout my life so making and keeping friends has been very hard for me and It is hard for me to interact with people. I had to grow up very quickly. When I was 7 my brother was born and I had to raise him because my dad left and my mom started to work two jobs. He is ten now. We are not close and have a horrible relationship. i lived a lonely life until i met some amazing people from games and twitter. i found fun in drawing. Drawing is my biggest hobby and if I am not talking to my friends it is what I find comfort in the most. 

recently my mom has discovered pizza gate theory + Q theory which has been driving her somewhat crazy. she talks to me about it non stop. I asked her to stop talking to me about it because it makes me uncomfortable. I can not give my opinion about it without her screaming at me and saying I am wrong. she associates everyone that i speak to online with a pedophile and lately has not given me privacy. she needs to know everything i do online again. i do not have privacy and she is taking away my friends. my mom is only letting me be online for thirty minutes a day. i told her it was unfair because my friends are very important to me and they are helping me through a rough time in my life right now. My dad is homeless and my family life is bad and she says she doesn’t care. She is acting as if everything is A-Ok in my life even though she is stressing me out. my mom has now broken my drawing tablet and has taken away some very important things to me in my life and is now trying to take away my friends. I am limited to 30 minutes a day(monitored) and can only text my friends. I can not even call them. my mom has taken away my medications and will not let me speak to anyone. she is going crazy and i am going to go crazy with her. i don’t know what to do.

1037,"My dad is an awesome person, unfortunately he married my mom, who clearly has issues. They got divorced when I was around 8 and we stayed with my mom for a couple of years, after 3 years of abuse (both mental and physical) my dad took us in. He has been a great dad overall, he took care of us, he spent all his time working so me and my big bro (28M) could study. 

Unfortunately, my dad lost his job when I was like 15 or so, since then I've worked my \*ss off to finish both highschool and university, working part time jobs and getting good grades, I finally graduated university a month ago. It's worth mentioning that since he lost his job we moved (me, my brother and my dad) to an aunt's house (my dad's sister) and we've been living here ever since. My bro moved out 2 years ago though.

My brother just had his second child and my dad sometimes goes to his house to spend time with his grandchildren, he spends like 2 weeks with him and 2 weeks with me. He has a conflict because he usually asks me ""Do you need me around? I can stay if you want"" and to be honest I just want him to do whatever he enjoys the most, I'm not someone who has the power to tell him what to do, and if he enjoys living with my brother and his grandchildren it's fine, I'm a grown man and I can do more than I could do a couple of years ago.

My dad has this idea that the mental health diminishes whenever you do not feel useful anymore, and he's been afraid of that for a while, so when he asks me ""Do you need me around?"" I feel bad because if I say ""yes"" maybe I'm making him stay with me when he would rather spend time with his grandchildren, which is completely valid and understandable. But if I say no, I don't want my dad to feel useless, I just want him to be happy, he's been an amazing dad who has always put my brother and myself before everything else and I'm working my \*ss off to compensate that (I don't think I could ever do so, but I'll try).

What should I do? I don't know if he's reaching a crisis, but I don't want my dad to feel useless, but I also don't want my dad to feel forced to do things he really doesn't want to do. Whenever he goes to his grandkids he has a blast, but since I work from home I usually do not spend too much time with him until the night when we chat while we dinner, but most of the day he's just surfing in the internet and it makes me feel bad.

TL;DR: My dad has reached an age in which he might or might not feel useful anymore, he asks me if I need him around (like to stay in my house) or he could go to live with my brother to spend time with his grandchildren. If I say yes I could be forcing him to stay and I don't want to, but if I say no, maybe he'll feel useless and I don't want him to feel like that. What do I do?",04Aug2020,1

1040,"I (20NB) am in a long-distance relationship, and have been since Christmas (we were friends for over a year beforehand). I have been planning to move in with my partner (25NB) since before we even got together. I am currently living with my family, which is abusive and immensely controlling to the point of tracking my location and purchases, not allowing me to visit certain doctors, having people ""keep an eye on me"" at my job and university, etc. I've been planning this secret move for months, and at this point, have about a week/a week and a half to leave before it gets much more difficult.

My partner and I met online, and while I love them dearly and want to live with them, the 20 years of abuse has me doubting whether or not my instinct of ""this feels too good to be true"" is warranted or not. They have offered to help out in any way they can, as at this point my leaving would require I leave almost everything I own here. I would probably only be able to take my cat and a backpack with necessary documents and essentials. They have their own apartment, and while they have asked that I help pay rent + utilities (understandably so), they have offered to help with everything else, including doctors/medications/therapy, a new wardrobe, and so on.

To be fair, if our situations were swapped, and I were the one living on my own independently, I would absolutely offer the same things to my partner. On the other hand, the way I was raised, any support that my parents gave me was ""an investment"" (their words, not mine) so that I could help support them, do things for them, continue to participate in their religious activities, etc. They very much have controlled me through guilt and obligation for past kindness. I'm finding it immensely difficult to believe that my partner isn't taking advantage of my situation so that I feel obligated to ""pay them back"" in some way or another.

Before you advise that I talk to my partner about this, I have. Extensively. They've assured me that, no, they want to support me because they love me, and that even if it turned out that we didn't work out as live-in partners, they'd still want to help me. They've also told me that they will never ask me to pay them back for the things they do for/give to me. I've been manipulated so much, I genuinely can't tell if it's too good to be true or not.

When they are out on the balcony, which is every night, they are so close that they can rest their arms on my window. I smell everything that happens in their bathroom, and hear it too. 

Because I am very conscious of their presence, I assume they are conscious of mine too and it absolutely terrifies me. When I turn around in bed at night, I'm anxious. Did they hear that? When I pee, I do it as quietly as possible. Oh god, please don't listen. When I get hungry at 2 am, I don't dare to put an egg in the pan because my fridge opening will be heard loud and clear and that's just embarassing. And let's not talk about sex.

Do other people feel like that too? Am I just too sensitive? Am I worried for no reason?",04Aug2020,1
1047,"Throwaway account obviously. I'm a basketball player and the coach I play for has the players work in the summer he expects everybody there. In previous years everybody has shown but this year (This is unrelated to covid) most of the girls and a few of the guys bailed out on practice for no fucking reason.  One specific girl has blown of practice every day, we know she isn't sick or out of town because she has been attending volleyball (which is directly after the basketball practice ends) This is concerning seeing as she is one of the best players and refuses to attend practice because of a past argument with one of our teammates.

1049,"Hey guys. I'm a 23 year old woman that enjoys my day job, but my day job pays extremely little. I'm looking for a way to make an extra (roughly) $200 a week. I got an offer to be a medical courier at $15 an hour, Monday through Friday, 3 hours per night (I'm guessing $180 a week after taxes). 

The hours are 5pm-8pm which wouldn't be bad except it's a 40 minute drive back so I won't get home until almost 9pm. This wouldn't be so bad but my partner goes to bed at 8pm because he gets up at 2:30am for his job. To make our lives easier, I just go to bed at the same time and I get up at 4:45am so it's better anyways. I also have a hedgehog that needs to come out for at least a half hour before I go to bed so I'd be going to bed even later. To add on, my start time is technically 5pm but my first stop is at 5:30pm, an hour away from home because of the summer traffic in that area. So I would be driving to my first stop 30 minutes prior from when I start getting paid. On the plus sides, they pay mileage (I'd be using my car). 

I also was approved to work for door dash, which I could, in theory, work similar hours but actually be home in time for bed and seeing my hedgehog. My problem is, hourly rate is not guaranteed. However, I also have the potential to work more than fifteen hours in a week. I could also do this on weekends, whereas being a courier is a set route. 

I'm just not sure what I should do. If I accept the courier job, I'm pretty set-in. I'm responsible for something set every single day. If my car breaks down, I have evening commitments, so on, then it's going to count against me as a call-out like normal employers. With Doordash, I can do it as I please. If I want to make more money, I can literally just keep working. My home area has lots of restaurants and doordash seems to keep pretty busy, for the records. Waits on weekends can be up to 2-3 hours. 

If anyone has any input, I'd appreciate it! 

Tl;dr: have the option to begin a courier route over 40 minutes away from my house or begin working for doordash in my area. Not sure which to pick.",04Aug2020,1

One of the guys was similar to my age and the other older guy is in his 40s. I told the older guy he could save one of my pictures, it was one without my face and he did, and sc told me he did. 

Now what I’m worried about is ones with my face. Sc hasn’t said that they have been screenshot or recorded on either picture/video, I had some on my story too.

 I’m just anxious that somehow they’ve saved them and they’re gonna be all over the internet. And my mums going to think I’m a weirdo for chatting up and getting kinky with an older ugly guy, tho he was nice. 

I haven’t replied to any of them, haven’t opened their latest messages. I’ve just deleted my account.  That’s all I can do. But I’m just ashamed and I’m pretty embarrassed. I wish I’d never done it.

1066,"Hey so I’m 26, and currently on holiday celebrating my mums birthday.. she has invited several of her friends on the trip aswell, a huge argument has gone down and I right now I need some reflection, advice whatever before my head explodes. 


We were watching a film and for 2 hours of this film, there was a lot of racist remarks about characters in this film, I was educating these older people making these comments on racism and the conversation got heated, very heated and I begin shouting, which is my biggest problem when I get angry. 

To calm down I was coerced in going outside to where my mother and her 4 friends where all in there mid to late 40s and unfortunately this wasn’t to calm me down, it was to carry on the conversation I grew very tired as I was extremely outnumbered. And the original aggravator came outside and again the conversation got heated. My partner who calmly defending me the entire time removed me from the situation and we went on a hour long walk to clear my head. 

Now to outline this argument, it was me trying to educate that there is oppression and systemic racism in the uk, white privilege isn’t “guilt tripping” it’s something we need to be aware of and change. However this was then greated by I am racist but dont want to be labelled a racist type comments, ultimately the conversation ended on which was said by my mothers “best friend” the original culprit who said these racist remarks is entitled to his opinions, I am entitled to mine however I cannot defend mine as I have not paid for the roof over the head in which these comments took place. 

So I left, came back and my mother and her Best friend are discussing this issue still, everyone in this house ignored me and overhearing the conversation being had was I have no respect and I have no valid opinion as I do not own the house we are in. (We are in a holiday home) so this got me very very angry, and I confronted this group and said would you like me to leave, after all I am not a “friend” in this circle I am simply my mothers daughter. I am then confronted with “I don’t listen” which at this point I am sober and everyone is drunk, I am letting them speak but they arnt talking they are talking about irrelevant things that happens 10 years ago. So I said, which I now see as a main aggregated  comment “ maybe your a little to drunk for this conversation” this made my mothers friend flip, switching in between, “we love you but your to clever for your own good, fuck off, go to hell, shut up bitch” etc she then denies saying any of that... I am looking at my mother saying why are you letting her speak to me like that.. and I attack her back with fuck you, who the fuck are you telling me what to do. 

Now this is where it really aggravated me, I have been struggling career wise lately, my job underpays me, I’m struggling to save for a house as well as pay for driving lessons. I confided this with my mother and her best friend earlier this day, well  her comment and final attack on me was “I’m the woman who can afford a house on a 40 grand a year job and owns two cars” I just look at my mum and am shook. The rage in me I wanted to hit her, I already despise this woman as it is as she is a talk at you, Karen type of person. But I’m polite and she’s my mums friend so I’ve always ignored it.  My partner, step father and another “friend” is with me saying come inside, calm down all while I’m standing there saying shut up, and she’s saying leave no one wants you here. My mums silent. 

I go up stairs, start packing crying and my mum comes in and tbh this conversation was to long and me and my mum don’t have a good relationship we know this. 

I don’t live with my family, but when I do go round there are always people including this best friend there, they drink a lot which I don’t, and my mum has a “visage” she puts on around her friends and for a while this has bothered me as I haven’t seen my actual mother for years.

My mother defends her friend, I don’t know why - she doesn’t want me to leave so I have to stay but I do not want to be here, but if I leave I’m pretty certain it will end mine and my mothers relationship. 

Me and my mother don’t argue, infact we rarely have and actual conversation. we don’t have a close mum and daughter relationship, there are always problems with other people that seem to be our problems. 

My issue is now, I’m expected to “resolve” this issue with my mothers friend, although I do not want to see her again, the resolution will be one sided her talking at me and me nodding my head. 

There’s 14 people here, bar myself and my partner we are the youngest by 20 years. I honestly couldn’t give a monkeys on any opinion on me, I know the atmosphere will be “she ruined the holiday” but I don’t know where to go from here, I can’t leave and I can’t acknowledge that I am in the wrong. 


This is long and I’m sorry I’m just venting and don’t know where to go from here.",04Aug2020,1

Also, apparently my boyfriend and I have only been together for a month and we haven’t had sex yet. Now, the other day our conversation came up to him mentioning that he likes to be dominant in sex, and I, without any idea, agreed to being submissive.

The problem here is that I don’t even have a clue on what he meant with dom/sub and now I’m really anxious on what I should or am supposed to do. He seems to be a really soft guy (or at least that’s what I know so far) and he reassured me that he’s not going to do anything that I may not like. I tried reading up on this dom/sub thingy a while ago and I got scared. I don’t want to turn him off though, because he seemed like he really liked this.

1068,"Okay so this is my first time posting because I need some advice. My( f22) boyfriend(m 21) have been in a relationship for 7 months and have recently moved in together. We have barely ever fought and we trusted each other more than 100%. Now the other day I came home from work(I work 40 hours plus every week while he is studying, doesn’t work) and I hop in the shower. He was trying to be sneaky and snap a pic but realized I wasn’t paying attention so he instead snapped a pic of himself in our bathroom. Now just for a little background I used to have a lot of guy friends and boyfriends when I was younger and I had them on Snapchat. Now I only use Snapchat for my sister whom I haven’t seen in a year. But below her username is everyone I haven’t spoken too (but they have messaged me and I opened it up and never replied). Anyways he accidentally slides over and sees all of these people. He asked me to block them all( on insta and Facebook too) which I am completely fine with because I don’t need those people anyways. The slight problem is that I never cleared my conversations with said people so he saw some stuff that was not meant for him. As in pics when me and him didn’t even know each other and I was with someone else. Anyways, he now thinks I cheated on him. And because I got rid of everything because he asked me too I have no way of proving myself. I know there’s the “my data” on snap but he doesn’t want to look. I have never cheated, never thought about it and never have wanted too. We have made up but it’s going to be a long road. Any suggestions on what I can do to gain that trust back?

They are usually just random periods, about 2 a day for like an hour where I feel so empty and like everything I do in the moment is useless. I am a 18 yr male and I am in a relationship. These slumps are partly a cause of the relationship party not. A lot of times it’s when I’m with my girlfriend that these “slumps” occur. Most of the time it’s because she has told me she doesn’t see us together forever. I know it is a little unrealistic to think otherwise but she said she “sees us together for a year”. Because of this, a lot of times when I’m with her I just keep thinking “why am I doing this, it’s not going to last. Every second I spend with her and every thing I do for her is a waste and is just gonna make it harder for me when we do break up”.

We also told the assistant manager and she talked to him bin our area. He started to get upset and also cursed me and my co worker out somewhat.

While traveling I had a near miss incident where I narrowly missed a deadly accident (almost half people died). After coming back home for a break before leaving to travel more, I was very thankful and appreciated life and was the happiest I’ve ever been.

1077,"I just turned 21 and have been at college for about 3 years now. I spent 2 years doing sporadic classes at community college and then a year at a decent sized university this year. I’m studying sport management which is something I thought sounded amazing when I first heard of it. This college I attended was 100 miles from home and although there were some bright spots I would say the majority of the time I was there I was unhappy and lonely. I met a few friends and planned to room with one of them for the fall semester. However because of COVID I will be doing this semester completely online. I also interned at a business down there that was likely to lead to a permanent position after graduation, however again because of COVID my internship was cancelled they did however say I could come back in the spring of 2021.  

Anyway, I moved out of my apartment in the city I went to college in about a week ago and the feeling when I was back there was just sadness. Leaving that city made me so happy and I thought then and there I had made up my mind. That I wasn't going to go back and that I was going to transfer to a college closer to home. I have 2 major choices and these colleges are huge. 30,000 plus students as opposed to my other school of around 9000. So it would be a massive change for me. I just don’t know what to do because now I feel like I should go back and just finish out the 2 years. I also don't know what to tell my buddy as we were planning on finding a place to live for the spring semester. I don't know if I even want to major in sport management anymore as the job I have lined up after college isn't what I really wanted to do and the pay is a joke.

It almost looks like it's too far from the AC to have come from it, as the water is not on his bed which is directly under the AC, but it's at the foot of his bed, which is still very close to the AC, but it's illogical that it's not on his mattress when his mattress is directly below the AC in the window, but it's on the carpet at the foot of his bed. It's strange.

Anyway, the thing that makes me wonder if this is some kind of chemical is because he said this soakedness has been on his carpet for like 3 days. He said he noticed it like 3 days ago but he was in a hurry so he just left and didn't clean it up. He came back 3 days later and the carpet is still pretty wet.

So, if this was water, it would most certainly be dried up by now, right ? Or maybe it wouldn't. Or maybe it would. I don't know.

I wonder if it could be freon or something since it's not drying up very fast at all. I am reading that freon is supposed to be a gas, but is liquid when it's ""condensed"" whatever that means. Can freon even leak as a liquid? 

I have no idea what this is. I made him throw a towel on it, but something more than that needs to be done if it's a chemical. I hope it's just water.

Anyone know what it is?",04Aug2020,1

1080,"I purchased this vehicle from a Ford dealership last October, now I bought it because I thought the price was good especially for a 2018 car. When I purchased it, I was not told whether the car was in an accident or not, if it was I would not have bought it.

A week or 2 ago my 2018 Ford Focus gets the check engine light on, I took it last Friday for inspection by appointment and end up finding out that the vehicle will need repairs for the ac and radiator and will cost around $1600 or so. They end up asking if this vehicle has been in an accident which it has not since I purchased it, I'm told that I'll have to pay out of pocket since it was suspected to be in an accident.

1081,"**TLDR:** Hard working woman, with some past, needs a friend/mentor who can talk from time to time and give advice - someone who had worked hard to get to the point where they are now. 

I’m not gonna lie and going to be dead honest, so I hope to be taken seriously. 

I’m 29 years old woman who wants to study and work, but due to my very difficult situation (can't explain here) , the only thing I can do is to learn on my own and wish to get to the point I will be able to leave the place where I live currently.

Why do I need an advice? I study and build my portfolio 6-7 days a week (only really have about an 1-2h every day) , maybe there is something I can do better if it comes to time management, getting rest, planning. Just need someone to understand and can somehow relate. 

I don’t want to be a prisoner of my current circumstances and I feel that I’m wasting so much of my potential only because I made a few bad decisions and now I’m completely dependant on someone who does everything to keep me locked up.

Why wealthy? Quite often they had to work their asses off.

1. Best friend told her that she likes a boy and the boy didn't like her back, so my sis told her that ignore him because he was wasting her time. The best friend said that she was crazy and stupid for telling her that. 

2. Yesterday a classmate of theirs asked about my sis (she sent a SMS to the best friend) saying how she was. The best friend told her ""Excuse me? She's mine, just mine"" (the best friend show the screenshots and my sis showed them to me). And few minutes ago the best friend said to her ""I am still angry with you"" and kicked her from the groupal conversation they have with another girl (F12). 

In a summary, this best friend just insult my little sister and has toxic behaviours, low self-steem and I understand her, she has a really terrible life and I want to help her to understand that she shouldn't be in that way, because I know she's not bad, she's just a lonely kid. Her parents don't pay attention to her and she always get rejected by people.

1087,"This is gonna be a pretty long post. Mainly because in order for most the things happening to me rn, you need to understand the weight of it. 

Let’s start around February this year. I’m kinda in a relationship kinda not. We’re in the same friend group, she was probably my closest friend in that group, but we both had feelings for eachother. We were keeping it a secret, just testing things out. I thought it was going really well, but I guess she didn’t feel the same. I’ve not really had a good history with relationships. Lying, leading on, cheating, always the victim. So even though I’m used to it, it still hurt. Out of the huge group, I just lost a relationship and my closest friend. 

Now March, I’ve heard some rumors about my friend group. Things like they’re all toxic and they talk shit behind eachothers backs. I didn’t pay too much attention to it because it didn’t seem like it was happening to me. Until I found out it was. COVID hit, and it’s like I was completely forgotten about. They all kept talking to eachother, kept hanging out together, everything. But just completely forgot about me. It’s now August, and the last time I’ve spoken to somebody that isn’t family was 4 months ago (except a couple friends I play playstation with, but they aren’t school friends, only online friends. Even then we rarely talk/play)

Both of my sisters are social butterflies. Always talking to friends, always hanging out with them, always having sleepovers, etc. Now that restrictions for COVID are much more loose, the past couple months have been hell for me. A few days a week at least they’ve had friends over. Each time just another reminder that I now have nobody. Absolutely nobody. 

Some more minor things, half my family forgot about my birthday in July. My dad and step-mom are constantly arguing. I’m losing any enjoyment I once had in things like video games, cooking, or just doing little projects. Before any of this, I was already suffering from pretty severe depression, and all this has just made it worse.

Lastly, I’m a Senior in high school now. This was my last summer as a high schooler. And I did absolutely nothing. And even my summer when I was going into my Junior year I did nothing. I have no high school memories at all. None. And with how things are looking now, I feel like my Senior year, WHATS supposed to be my best year, is gonna be my worst. I have no expectations to go to prom, homecoming, etc. I just feel so empty.

I have nobody, nothing, nowhere. I feel like there’s nothing for me. No reason to keep pushing through. I know this is a lot to take in, just imagine living through it. But if there’s an answer to any of it, what is it?",04Aug2020,1
1088,"Cross-posted from r/relationships

TLDR; Lots of problems with my closest friend and I'm not sure if it's possible to repair things as long as she is in a toxic relationship and unable to see my perspective.

It's a long story. But basically, my friend Nora started dating a girl named Jane last year and it has been endless problems since. Nora had gone through a bad breakup with her boyfriend before Jane and was in a self destructive state for a long time where I was always there for her. This was the beginning of an uneven dynamic between us but I held out in hopes that she would be back on her feet soon. This was not the case. When Nora got with Jane, a toxic relationship began immediately. Nora was then leaning on me for their problems and I tried to set boundaries and tell her I didn't want to hear all their BS which was ignored. It was painful for me to watch her go through this pain all over again.

Aside from those issues, I am bi but have been with my boyfriend for long before I met Nora, but she has been slagging my relationship and telling me to get with a girl for months now. Nora has also lowkey slagged my partner. On top of this, she sometimes flakes on our plans (she lives out of town so we don't see each other often) which makes me feel like I'm not a priority.

I called Nora out on things being one sided about a month ago and she didn't seem to take any of my feelings to heart. I asked for space which she respected until 2 weeks ago when she texted me saying she missed me and asked me to take accountability. I haven't replied because I didn't know what I had to be accountable for and I don't know how to move forward if she won't take what I said to heart.

Fast forward to today and I was going to finally text her. I did some self reflection, and although stuff hasn't been perfect between us, I value her as a friend and wanted to move forward. That was until I saw a tweet she liked today. It said ""If my friend wants to talk abt the same toxic partner for the 100th time i will listen bc that's what friends r for"". This was obviously a dig at me.

I've come to you [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/) because I do not know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call her out for the twitter pettiness or just be the bigger person. I don't know how to text her back when I feel like she won't see my side of things. She is the most emotionally intelligent person I know so I am confused why she seems so blinded. How should I move forward?",04Aug2020,1
1089,"I really want to make this as anonymous as possible.....I have to older relatives that have been with each other for over 25 years.

For no reason! With her remaining money, she still has to pay the bills, but his groceries and she’ll even buy him expensive gifts.

1091,"   TLDR: Boss pressuring me into getting rapid covid testing since my results from last Wednesday are not back. Doctor told me even if my rapid test is negative I still need to be in quarantine until my other results come back and the 14 days is up. Boss doesn’t understand why...


   Hey everyone, first post on Reddit so hopefully I don’t mess up too bad... So, I started my current job towards the end of March, right before COVID really kicked off. I work for a medical supply company, so fortunately I was not laid off during all of this mess. 
   At the end of June, one of my fiancé’s coworkers tested positive for COVID so she had to be tested and quarantine. Out of respect for my company, I informed the boss and she told me I have to get tested too, and they would both have to be negative before I could come back to the office. My fiancé and I knew they would be negative but better safe than sorry. I voluntarily asked if she could have I.T. reach out to me so I could work from home to help with the influx of orders. They did and I only missed one day of work. About a week and a half later, both tests finally came back negative and I was back in the office.
   Fast forward to July 24th... my coworker who sits three feet from me started complaining of body aches. Didn’t think anything of it until Sunday when I started getting sick. Monday I went to work but my coworker called out. I felt better than I did Sunday but still not the best. Tuesday I felt better than Monday and started a new task so my mind was focused all day. Sometime in the afternoon my coworker and her brother left work abruptly, and on the way out I asked if everything was okay. He was hesitant to say anything but told me his sister tested positive. I wished him the best and he went home.
   Now, I was fully expecting my boss or someone to tell me to go quarantine, but that didn’t happen... I woke up Wednesday and felt drained, I was super fatigued and lethargic, headache and a slight fever. I went to work... My supervisor asked how I was feeling and told me my coworker was sick too, and that was it... not, “hey, she tested positive and you don’t look good so leave,” but instead I had to ask my boss if I could work from home. I left and went to go get tested that Wednesday. I worked from home the rest of the week with no problems. Wednesday and Thursday, the only way I can describe how I felt was that stage in between buzzed and drunk, I was super uncomfortable, still had diarrhea, and wasn’t able to taste my food.
   This Sunday my boss texted me asking if I got my results yet, to which I said no. She said my coworkers brother hadn’t either and he was going to get rapid testing done. I told her to let me know so I can go do it as well. I still wasn’t feeling the best, but certainly better than Wednesday and Thursday.
   Fast forward to today. I told my boss that my test results would be in 6-10 days after I got my test, today being the first day. I didn’t hear anything about my results so I started work as normal. At 8:30 I get a message saying my coworker tested positive again, and my boss asking if I can go get rapid tested today. I said sure, got the number and called. The lady on the other end was nice, new to the job so when I gave her my insurance information she messed up and told me I wasn’t eligible. Whatever, my results will be in soon anyway. I inform my boss, she tells me that my coworker and her brothers insurance covers it because it is the companies insurance, I inform her I am not on their insurance because it is too expensive and the test would cost me $158...
   An hour later I get a message saying they would pay for it if I went and got it. I called the place back and they informed me that they messed up my insurance and it actually was covered. I set up an appointment for 2:45. I got a phone call from the doctor around 3:00, he asked me some generic questions then got into COVID stuff. I told him I was tested last Wednesday but my boss wants me to get tested again today because my results are not in yet. He asked me my symptoms, and I told him. He said I had/have COVID and a test today wouldn’t do anything because my other results would be back in soon, I still have to be quarantined for 14 days and then tested again next week. I told him disregard, I won’t get tested and I’ll wait for my original one.
   I message my boss and tell her word for word what the doctor said. She informed me that the point of me going to get tested today was to see if I had a negative result so I could come back into the office tomorrow... I told her the doctor informed me I still need to wait 14 days, and with that I didn’t hear back. Just for reference, the only thing that I cannot do at home that I can do in the office is answer the phone... without me or my coworker in the office, there seven others who are more than capable in answering that phone.
   I called my dad and vented about the situation and he was pissed. He told me to go get tested, and this rapid one is positive, then I’m out of work for two more weeks. If it’s negative, I still have to wait for the first test, and then still have to be quarantined until next week. So I called back, got an appointment for tomorrow at 8. I informed my boss and she asked how I convinced them to give me the test... I told her I just signed up by the doctor still wants me to be quarantined even if it is negative... she replied she was confused and asked why they’re giving me the test then... I asked my coworker if she is this way towards her and she said no...
   So what do I do here? I’m thoroughly pissed off and am ready to look for a new job. Am I jumping the gun here? I just think my health should come before answering a phone... sorry for the long post and hope I didn’t mess up!",04Aug2020,1

1096,"So my husband is wonderful. I love him, and I know he adores me and would do almost anything for me... unless it involves his dad. When we got engaged and were talking logistics I'd mentioned I wasnt changing my name. He was incredibly hurt and felt rejected at first, but after thinking about it he said he understood as there was no reason for me to do so besides that being ""traditional"". We've been talking about having kids now and I mentioned I wanted our kids to have my name as well. He was particularly upset. Once he calmed down he went on a long explanation about how it was up to him to carry the family name because his older brother hyphenated his and his son's name and there is no one else left with it. I pointed out if we had only had girls it would be the same thing, and how his nephew DID have the family name, but he and his dad also had the mothers side added in. I asked him if he would ever do that for me (not that I want it) and he said no. He calmed down some more and thought about it and I think agreed to a double last name? It turns out his biggest worry was letting his dad down, and how he didnt originally want to tell his dad there would be no one to pass on their name, and how upset his dad would be, etc. This was also why he was originally upset about my name, he felt it would disappoint his dad and he didnt know how to tell him

Before we got married, we also talked about moving to another state for a fresh start. My husband was hesitant, but did seem interested and we did start talking about logistics. He mentioned it to his dad and his dad was depressed about it and my husband backtracked WITH ME.  He said there was no way we could move, how if his brother hadn't moved we could have because he KNOWS his brother would have stayed for their dad (I dont think so, but not the point) and how it's just our lot to have to stay.

His dad is not a bad guy, he is older and I can understand the worry about leaving him, and I really dont think his dad is pushing my husband on any of these points. These are just a couple examples, but it definitely has gotten to the point I feel like anything we do has to involve his dad's happiness. My husband doesnt make those considerations for his mom or stepdad, just his dad. I really feel like he's putting HIMSELF under pressure and making assumptions that aren't based on reality. FIL seemed proud if anything that his grandson had both sides names. Even when he tells my husband that my husband says there's no way his dad means it, he's just trying to be supportive about things he cant change. I'm okay with not moving or debating our kids name, but I'm NOT okay if it's because my husband is trying to live his life for his dad.  Is his dad going to come before our kids as well? Is he willing to sacrifice our relationship to live up to this ideal? I dont know what to do!",04Aug2020,1
