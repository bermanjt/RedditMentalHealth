0,Ok so I (14m) overheard my dad say to my mum that he regrets having children. I can understand his opinion as I personally dont want to have kids in the future but should I care?,23Mar2020,1
1,"Here in the UK it’s only a matter of time before we lockdown and that’ll last a minimum of a few weeks

Plan was that we were supposed to stay at my mums boyfriends house for the weekend but I asked her when were going back home and she didn’t really answer

I said I just want to go home as I don’t want to be stuck here in lockdown but she just ignored me and went “we’ll talk in the morning”

I told her she clearly is planning to stay here and I’d rather be at our own house but she just said goodnight and walked off

What should I do? There’s nothing wrong with my mums boyfriend or his house but I know if we were to lockdown, I’d want to be home instead of here but my mum won’t acknowledge that",23Mar2020,1
2,"Hello. I am looking to partake in extracurricular educational activities this upcoming year, and I do not want to take on student debt. I am from a larger family, and I currently attend college and work part-time. Other than scholarships, what is the best way to raise money in the next 5 months? I have considered crowdsourcing but I know that can be highly unreliable.

I have heard of philanthropist sponsoring, but I haven't the foggiest idea where to start down that road.",23Mar2020,1
3,"I (20F) work in a big box store retail job. I live with my cousin who has a child with heart defects and brain damage, a weaken immune system. With the whole Coronavirus thing going on I am worried for the child’s safety. The store I am working at is apparently essential and doesn’t have to close. So I told my manager I wasn’t going to be coming in due to the safety of this child. She was ok with it and understanding. She said she wasn’t going to let me go and when this virus blows over I can come back. Later in a call with the manager she mentioned how she didn’t know what I was going to do financially. I took this as a hint to no unemployment. I can’t work in a store and bring this virus home to this kid, he could die. My concern is can I apply for unemployment even though I still employed by this company. I have googled it and found that California is being more open to unemployment reason during this pandemic. It says it’s a case by case basis. But I am scared that the company I work for might get mad and fire me or my manger might get mad. What should I do? I wasn’t going to apply but I am getting pressured by my family to apply and it’s stressing me out.",23Mar2020,1

My mother passed away today. I got a call from my aunt and she told me that my mother had only hours before she would pass. But she passed minutes after my aunt hung up. My mother lives 12 hours away  so I wouldn’t have made it to be next to her. I’ve had a lot of issues with her during my life. But now I’m heartbroken and confused on how to feel.

So much that sometimes I regret changing groups but It’s because I am very unsure too. 

So, since this coronavirus thing happened. I haven’t had contact with them. I mean like playing online games or those type of things. 

I just sent a meme about this situation to all of them and that’s it. They responded typically like haahaa. 

We haven’t had more contact. Do you think they like me? Our “friendship” will get cooler if I don’t talk to them?",23Mar2020,1

10,"For the past four years, I rarely ever grew sad. A few times a year I would cry, but that's it. It's not that my life is fantastic and I have nothing to worry about. I've gone through heartbreaks that reside in the back of my mind, or lost friends I really loved and cared for at one point. My relationship with my parents isn't the strongest. In elementary school throughout middle school, my mom used to verbally (sometimes physically, but very rare) abuse me and my sister. My dad was always working, so I never had real conversations with him, even to this day. Besides that, my mom changed a little bit and we have grown closer. (I dont know if that will come into play). Yet I still rarely cried and rarely felt sad, I guess. But up until three days ago, I've begun crying over little things. For example, yesterday I cried because I couldn't find my tv remote, then I cried a few hours later because my room was a mess (??). And today my show kept buffering and I just started crying, followed by degrading thoughts. Does anyone know why this is happening to me? I made an account solely to ask this because I really don't feel comfortable confiding in someone I know lol...",23Mar2020,1
11,"I’m sure this type of question has been covered before, but I could use some personal advice. 

I’m a 21 year old girl in college and I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t upset about my own appearance and jealous of other girls.

I’ve been wearing makeup since fifth grade to give you an idea of how long this issue has persisted. My moms job was makeup artistry at MAC cosmetics so I always got free stuff and I learned from a pro. For her job she had to wear makeup daily and look nice while judging the beauty of other women. I know that fucked up my self esteem. She would always comment on what I “needed” like blush, foundation, bigger eyelashes, etc. She didn’t mean to ruin my self esteem as she always thought I was her pretty little girl, but the way she pointed things out made me examine my own flaws more carefully. 

I think I’m semi attractive. I have a handsome boyfriend, I get some compliments, I take decent pictures, but I can never tell. I don’t even know how I really look anymore. I can’t visualize myself in my head. I feel like I have no idea how I look because I only know how my flaws look. The way I perceive myself changes daily and I never look the same when I look in the mirror. I completely dissociate if I look at myself or pictures of myself. Sometimes I don’t even feel like my face is real. It’s horrible. 

But the worst thing is how I compare myself to every girl meet, and I mean everyone. I’m jealous of every girl at my college for one reason or another. I regularly try to stop myself, but it’s the first thing I do when I see someone. The second my eyes reach a girl I’m comparing my eyes, hair, thighs, complexion, etc. It feels like it will never end and it’s a miserable, gut wrenching feeling. 

 Ive researched a bit about body dysmorphia, but my therapist doesn’t think that’s my problem. Is this normal? Does everyone feel this way or am I crazy? It takes up a good portion of my life and I’m tired of it. Help please",23Mar2020,1
12,"Trigger warning — suicide / abuse 

Hi first time poster long time lurker.. just needing to vent and if anyone has helpful advice it’s much appreciated. 

I’m 22 (turning 23 in two weeks) I live at home with my parents in the Silicon Valley, I have a younger brother we are 18 months apart. 

For a bit of background my family dynamic is not like most, my father was never part of my life. My family at a young age consisted of my mom, my brother, my grandmother (moms mom) and me. I had relationships with extended family but not great ones. When I was 11-12 my grandmother died and my father decided he would move into our family home. I did not know this man, I had seen him a handful of times threw out my life. One day during the summer before 6th grade he showed up with his best friend and a moving truck. Apparently he had been convincing my mother to let him move back in since her mother had died. 

Fast forward a few months he wants to take me and my brother to the movies to see Piraña 3D. The movie with all the naked girls. We were 11 and 12. After the movie we were talking to the parking garage and got into an elevator, he started to jump and I backed into a corner and said he was scaring me. He became enraged. He told us to get into the car, rushed home and told me to get in the house. A few minutes went by and I could hear my dad yelling at my mom. She comes into my room with him a few steps behind her and I tried to shut my door to prevent him from coming in. He punched my door several times and it broke, the wood splintered, my mom just stood there, silent. 

Fast forward a couple years, I’m arguing with my mom and my dad comes in and tells her to leave he’s going to talk to me now, he starts in how I’m spoiled and don’t have any respect etc. I told him how he’s talking is making me feel like hurting myself. His response: “do what you need to do” and he walked away. I was 18 at the time and had access to my prescriptions. I emptied the bottles, swallowed them all. Stupidly, I waited 20-30 minutes before alerting my mom. I had become physically ill and was losing consciousness. The last thing I remembered was being on the freeway in the ambulance. I woke up 9 days later. They had to place me in an induced coma to save my life. I woke up with so many ivs even one in my neck. First person I see is my mom, then he walks in. “Hey buddy”. 
No they did not place me in a 72hr hold they released me from the hospital. Why, I don’t know. 

Two years later my parents called the cops on me, for raising my voice, the police came, told me how much of a spoiled pot smoking brat I was after talking to my parents and told me if they have to ever come back I will be going to jail. They left and my parents took me to the hospital, the therapist informed my mom she would not have her in the session that this was to talk to me only. My mom flipped, I could hear her begging to be let in after they let me back. 10 minutes into the conversation she determined I was not a danger to myself or others and said she would be right back. A long time went by. (20-25 minutes) a different woman returned and said after speaking with my parents I needed to be placed on a 72hr hold. I just broke down. I didn’t spend 72hrs, I spent 22 days. My parents left my in the hospital and refused to pick me up. I had a court hearing just to be found competent to be released and since I had nowhere to go they called my parents and told them they had to come get me. 4 days before my birthday. I’m sure they would have left me in there if it wasn’t for the staff at the hospital I was in. They helped me so much. 

After that point my parents rarely spoke to me unless it was telling me what I needed to do or what I had done was wrong. I stopped eating food in the house after being yelled at for taking 2 bananas. (“Why would I need TWO bananas?!”) I don’t even get to lick the bathroom door because my mother will use a screwdriver to pop the lock and insist she needs to come in to get something. If she tells me not to use something in the house and I tell her I have every right, my father comes and tells me to pack my shit that I have no rights here, I don’t pay rent after all (I have offered, they told me the rooms in the house aren’t for renters they are for their children.) 
I had a miscarriage earlier this year and tried to come to my family for support, instead I was told how STUPID I was for even letting it happen, I know this is a toxic environment but I don’t have anywhere else to go, I was getting help from a therapy group to move to a shelter but my mother cut transportation off (I do not drive and she was taking me to therapy per her condition of my living in the house) 

I know what everyone is thinking at this point, MOVE OUT etc. I don’t make even near the amount of money I would need to support a cat let alone myself in a house by myself. And yes I do work.",23Mar2020,1
13,"TLDR; How do I stop being friends with someone without outright telling them? We are now living within streets from each other and have a meshed friend group. 

I’ve been friends with a woman for about 5 years now. We became very close and our friend groups combined very quickly. She has always had qualities that are annoying, but who doesn’t. However, over the last year those qualities have become harder to ignore. She’s not a bad person, she has a very kind heart, I just don’t mesh well with her anymore to the point of not even wanting to talk to her. I recently moved very close to her (my options were limited) and she’s now pressing more than ever to hang out / catch up / etc. Because I don’t have any real issues with her, and don’t want to hurt her feelings, I’ve just tried to distance myself from her. Because our friend groups are pretty meshed I don’t want to do anything that could create a problem for us or our friends, I just don’t want to be her friend anymore. Has anyone else had any success breaking up with a friend without outright telling them that they no longer want to be friends? I’ve given what feels like obvious passive aggressive hints (ie never making solid plans, not responding to texts) but it doesn’t seem to register. I know this is terrible and I should just be up front, but I don’t want to hurt her or disrupt our friend group.",23Mar2020,1
14,This quarantaine shit got me fucked up. No damn sleep because i cant do shit all day except work whats just once per week.

15,"My husband does very well at work but we have student loans so his job basically covers all of our basics + a little extra.  I work two half days a week in banking.  I’ve worked there for years and have made a name for myself there, made friends, and am making more than any other banker I know.  However I only work around 10 hours a week so it’s really not much.  Lately I’ve been feeling uneasy about my job and now with the Coronavirus stuff I’m having panic attacks going into work.  Customers cough directly on us and laugh. People make rude comments, and I work shoulder to shoulder with my coworkers. 

My parents and husband are high risk, and I one young child at home.

Am I taking this too far? Should I not make this rash decision?  My husband supports me either way but says he is worried about our loss of income...  and is worried about me as well.  

I had such a bad panic attack today that I couldn’t breathe and had to lay down to calm myself, and then I was wondering if I had the virus... I’m literally driving myself insane.  I can’t stop reading news articles and reading about the virus.  Please give me advice.",23Mar2020,1
16,"Hello, my brother is someone is either really kind or extremely offensive/hurtful. Every time there is an argument of any sort, he ends up screaming, being rude and hurtful, not listening to any side, and feels the need to win the argument simply my screaming at the top of his lungs. Even when it is all over, he will not speak to the person until the OTHER person apologizes. He has not once said sorry or apologized in his whole 22 years of life despite being the wrong one in multiple arguments.

2 days ago, my brother went off on me simply for having a different opinion on ONE topic. The things he said were hurtful and triggered my suicidal thought/gave me a panic attack as well. He said stuff along the lines of: better off dead, threat to society, supporter of child bullying, reason people kill themselves, ignorant, dumb, idiot, useless, supporter of rape, and all in all better off if people like me were vanished from the world. All I did was sit there quietly and basically let him verbally abuse me. He even went as far as almost throwing a 1.5k dollar phone I bought him as a gift simply due to anger.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been 2 days, and we haven't spoken to one another. The stuff he said was hurtful and keeps replaying in my head and at this time, I cannot stand to look at him. What he said was overboard and ridiculous, and growing up, I was someone who literally did everything for him, which I guess is my fault and probably this is why he is the way he is. Growing up, he had no form of responsibilities, everything was always handed down to him. He is not appreciative of nothing. He is 22 years old and lives under my parents, pays no bills, has no job, and also talks trash about both my mother and father. I'm not sure if it's worth talking to him first or simply waiting to see if he will man up and own up to what he did (which I know he won't). He did something similar to our cousin, and my cousin has not spoken to him in almost half a year.

 My panic attack lasted nearly the whole day, I did not sleep whatsoever due to it, and now I am having chest pain and headaches. All I can think about is the cruel things he said and the way he blew up on me for no legitimite reason.

My new manager is a guy 20 years older than me. I’m 24, I’m new to this job field and I just feel terrible all together. I’m in the training stage and he tells me by his actions that I’m doing a terrible job. He snatches things from me, ignores me when I asks questions. Also when I ask him to show me something he beats around the bush. There is also one other female that works with us, she’s my same exact age. They get alone fine.

18,For years I’ve been receiving cryptic messages from a stranger online. He’s always asking whether I want to play with him or rambles about religion. I never responded or blocked him considering how he only sent a message 3 times a year. Today he sent a message about atheism and “how those who don’t believe are those who failed to see the light”. It was so pretentious I had to respond. In which minutes later he got back to me requesting to know where I live. So I blocked him and now I’m afraid he might do something like find my ip and plan some form of harassment.,23Mar2020,1
19,"Ok. So I don’t usually take things personally or get angry quickly. But sometimes I am rly annoyed by simple stuff. 

An example would be example a friend bragging about himself all the time or making a 100% mediocre thing and being super proud. So I just can’t help but tell ppl like that how megalomaniac they are. And then a big fight starts, no one gets what I rly wanna say and think I take it personally and everyone gets home in a bad mood. I hate that. I don’t wanna make anyone feel bad but I don’t have a discipline in not saying what I think sincerely. I can’t lie or not tell what I think when I know it is true.

How could I control those impulses? Are there exercises to say STOP when you feel like saying smth like that and just keep your mouth shut? Anyone has this “honesty” problem? It rly ruins my relationships with ppl and overall it makes eneryone feel bad.",23Mar2020,1

I work at a vet clinic/boarding facility/doggy daycare and I work in the boarding and daycare side. Daycare is dwindling and we have a solid 4 boarders when normally we have upwards of 30-40 at any given point. The owner had a meeting last week and has been sending messages to the GroupMe about protocol for this time, but none of it can be done by daycare staff (washing hands, social distancing, gloves, the like) because I have to be outside and can’t go in every time I touch something. It’s clear that they’re mostly focusing on the clinic and making sure they’re safe while we’re just left to figure it out. I don’t feel it’s necessary to keep my building open as clients aren’t as abundant as they normally are and I really don’t want to have to keep coming into contact with people every day because they want the money.

22,"Okay, this might sound stupid and stuff but please bare with. So I need to tell my crush something that she wanted me to remind her about because she is very forgetful and I don’t know whether to ft or just call her. 

If I was to call her, it would only be for that reason and that’s the end of talking, which suits the reason of the call. But then after the call, we probably won’t talk and that’s bad

But if I ft her, it could seem very unnecessary at the time but it could also mean we could talk for a lot longer. We could talk about anything instead of talking about nothing, but she might think it’s weird if I do ft her just to remind her about something. 

This might sound stupid, I know, but I overthink everything and I’m not sure which one would be the best, thanks",23Mar2020,1

24,"Me(18M) and my boyfriend(19M) have been together for about 6 months. We've kinda taken it slow and are also long distance. This both of ours first relationship too.


We've had a couple talks about sex and affection and hes made it clear hes not very affectionate and lacks the desire to have sex. Hes not very comfortable with it yet so we have gone beyond kissing and cuddling. I definitely have a sex drive and though sex is far from a priority, it's still something I'd want to have with my partner. 


We just had another talk and just discussed it some more and we both are aware that if we continue like this we might not last. I told him I love him and dont wanna break up with him but at the same time if we continue to be abstinent we might not end up getting what we need out if this relationship (ie I won't be as happy as I could be). The thing is neither of us wanna break up with eachother. Hes a really great guy and I really do love him. 


I'm scared of the inevitable. Like if we hit a year together and are still not going beyond kissing then it might be a good idea to end the relationship, as hard as that is to say. Aside from sex we have a ton in common and really get along. For me sex is more of a rite of passage too so I'm not very sex driven or anything, I just wanna reach the normal relationship milestones.


Does anyone have any advice? Maybe some success stories would help. I just really want this to work out between us since hes a really great guy.",23Mar2020,1

Her face is also beautiful and she's the sweetest person I've ever met. However, she doesn't like the way she looks and keeps telling me that she wants to 'look like the other girls' (partly for me). I keep telling her that I don't want her to go over the top working out and stuff just for me, but I said that if she wants to get skinnier I'll be there to support her. I'm not sure how long it'll take for her to reach the point where she's happy with herself and until then I'd like to let her know that I literally don't have any problems with the way she looks. But every time I tell her how pretty or perfect she is, she always shuts me down. Not in a mean way of course, but whenever I mention how much I adore her she tells me to shush. Plus the other day, she said she thinks that I don't actually mean the things I say when I compliment her but didn't give a reason as to why she thinks I'd be doing that.

37,"I have a boyfriend of 4 years that is my high school sweetheart, our families love each other and we love each other. He says I’m the one and wants to get married a few years after we finish college and get good jobs. We have a cute puppy that we share as our “child” and everything is great. He is very supportive of me and going to college but I can tell he doesn’t want me to go away. 

However, I graduated from high school last year and stayed home to go to the state community college that is local where me and my bf go too. I’m so tired of living at home with my parents it’s has taken such a big toll on me mentally and emotionally. I want to transfer to a university next semester since I’m about to complete my AA. I want to go to the big state university that is 2 hours away from home. I have always dreamed of going there but there believed I could. I’m an excellent student with a good GPA. I just don’t know how me leaving for 2-3 years will affect my relationship. I don’t know if I should go to the closer university that is only 45 minutes away so I can come home to visit him more often but I don’t have a passion or desire to go there like I do with the other school that is my first choice. 

I want to major in nursing and both schools offer a great BSN program that I would be applying for. I’m just stuck on what to do and where I should go.

39,"So i’m 22M and my ex gf 22f broke up last month after 3 1/2 years, i broke up with her because all we seemed to do was argue and it got toxic with name calling. i knew i ended up making a mistake and wanted her back a few days later, long story short she doesn’t wanna be back in the relationship yet she’d rather be friends for a little bit to see if we changed at all and so she can heal from stuff in the past (i tried to go no contact she didn’t want that). So we text on a regular basis and we can talk on the phone no problem, we just have the same convos we would before just without the i love you, etc. so today we hungout for the first time as “friends” only for like an hour, she wanted me to go to target with her to pick up a couple things so i said sure. so we ended up going like normal and before we got home i asked to have sex (first time since breakup) and she declined because it’s the middle of the day (we both live with our parents)😂. i didn’t mind tbh i expected that answer. anyways, before i got out of the car i asked her if i can have a kiss before i go and she looked confused, and asked why i should kiss her, i kinda laughed it off and said nvm as i was getting out of the car. i’m wondering if i’m making mistakes here because she knows i’m ready to get back in the relationship to fix things but she just needs her time to heal she says. i’m wondering if i’m just gonna stick here in the friend zone forever but idk cuz she still tells me she loves me and just doesn’t wanna be hurt again. should i just decline hanging out and just stop texting her altogether cuz honestly i don’t see just having her as a friend in my life or are we just going to slowly ease into this? any questions plz ask!!!",23Mar2020,1

47,"When I was ~10 (8 years ago) I had this roblox account and I met a girl who was a year or two older on there. We became friends and played together for years.

We last spoke briefly in 2018 when I wished her a happy birthday 'cause I knew she was turning 18, but I don't think we really have spoken much since a year or two before that. 

The thing is, our friendship really did mean a lot to me. I still think about it occasionally. I still have her skype saved an am tempted to send her a message along the lines of ""Hey! I know it's been awhile! How are you doing?"" and figure she's free to ignore it if she doesn't want to talk to me. 

I'm just not sure if that's weird? I know we were both kids when we were friends and never knew each other in real life. But we spent hours playing together and talking every day for years.

50,"Hey guys! So I need some serious advice.....

So I started working at a factory that makes medical parts. My sis works in a different department from me, and basically I operate machines. I love my department and everyone for the most part is much older (like 40s and up). However, there’s one guy that’s still older than me (I am 23 and he must be in his mid to late twenties). His name is Mike. He’s super tall, maybe about 6’5, sort of skinny. He’s kind of like the handy man, he fixes the machines and makes parts.

To make a long story short, he’s super dorky and loves nerdy stuff, just like me. I mean, I just got a big lord of the rings tattoo, haha. So of course we hit it off right away. And then I find out he’s got a crush on me. A BIG one. And everyone was shipping us and teasing me about it basically from day one.

I’m naturally the kinda person that when people tell me to do something I do the opposite so I sort of gave him the cold shoulder for a while. However....

Now, three months later, I fucking have feelings for him. He makes me laugh. He leaves notes on my machines. We like the same things and honestly, sitting at work for nine hours a day, my mind sometimes runs to the gutter. He likes to shake the back of my chair when he walks by to mess with me and make me laugh. And I catch myself looking for him whenever something ridiculous happens so we can laugh about it. There’s so many other things but it would take a while to list them all.

And it happened out of nowhere. I don’t date, I don’t get crushes. I’ve never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, and I’m still a virgin. I honestly thought I just couldn’t have those feelings for someone. And yet now when I make him laugh my stomach flips, and I get all warm. My knees get wobbly.

This would seem perfect except for the fact that we’re coworkers that work very close together. Hell, if he was just in another department I would go for it. But we’re practically shoulder to shoulder every day, six days a weeks.

I need advice. Should I go for it? What if it goes wrong and we have to still work together? This is honestly causing me a lot of stress.",23Mar2020,1

My friend is on the verge of losing everything that they've worked so hard for, and I'm the only person they can turn to for this. They may be losing their job soon and they need my help to keep them stable while they look for a new job.
The problem is, the amount of financial help they need is more than I can provide. I might be able to help them but only if I give them my entire paycheck (basically). 
I love this friend to death and they said they'd do this for me in a heartbeat and I feel terrible because I'm not sure if I can do it.
Everyone is telling me it's a terrible idea and in my heart I know this is going to be hard. I know it's going to put my life on hold, I know it's going to be uncomfortable, I know it will cause an issue because I have other obligations, but I know that I need to do it. 
It's so hard because they want an answer and I told them I have to do some thinking about it and they were crying when we got off the phone. 
This arrangement will only be going on for maybe a few weeks, maybe a couple months but that's a few weeks/a couple months where I'll be working my ass off and giving every penny of it up. 
On top of that, they want me to go live with them during this. I have to leave my home, my love, everything for this. 
I need to do it. I feel like I really need to because I wouldn't be able to deal with my friend losing everything when I had the power to stop it. But I'm just not sure. If I do it I'll be putting my entire life on hold, if I don't my closest friend's life is going to crumble right in front of me and I'll watch it happen.

61,"So my mother has clinical depression and anxiety. And my dad just doesn’t seem to know his limits.

She stays at home for weeks on end and I feel really bad for her. She really has let herself go.

64,"I normally wouldn't ask this type of question, and typically am the type to think things through on my own. I figured the large variety of people on here might be able to help and chime in with all of your own life experiences. This might be a long story but I think the entire background needs to be presented, so please bear with me. 

I met my current wife when we were both 19. We hit it off instantly and I moved in a week later. We were inseparable, and if you believe in the twin flame stuff, we felt like that described us very well. We could read each others minds, sometimes literally without any prior context. 

She had a rough up-bringing. Abusive father, quiet mother. She had some growing pains as a teenager and her parents couldn't handle it and offered her up for adoption - her grandparents took her in and raised her for two years until she was 18. She is smart, strong, passionate, outgoing, and has a lot of mental issues because of this. She is the oldest of 3 other siblings and the next youngest is treated entirely differently/unfairly even to this day - this was the root of many of the families problems. She is from a hard working middle/upper middle class family and had a decent materialistic upbringing/no hardships other than family life. 

I am from a similar social class family. My family is much calmer and a little more on the intellectual side and have not really had any family issues or major hardships. My father was diagnosed with Parkinson's when I was about 13 and he was laid off by a jerk-of-a-boss. My mother did not really have a career and was forced to do the best she could without a degree or a career to back her. She went through menapause around this time and, being a decade younger than my brothers I was mostly the only one around to go through all of this. My dad has had two brain surgeries, second one is kinda working, certainly slowing the progression for anyone wondering. 

So...my wife and I had a lot to bond over, and some obviously very different backgrounds. Well, everything was going great. We got engaged in February of 2018 and just happened to conceive our first child only a month later. We had already planned our small wedding for that June, and were married. 

My wife had a horrible pregnancy. Our wedding day was one of the only days she was not constantly sick and vomiting, granted she was not happy about starting to swell up and have her dress re-sized. She ended up having a gallstone blockage and could hardly eat anything without getting sick and having a gall bladder reaction. Many, many, many late nights spent in the hospital without anything they could do but offer percocet (she refused to take because of her pregnancy). She complained of preeclampsia symptoms to the doctor every visit. No special attention seemed to be given. Around 30 weeks we discovered our son had a mast on the bridge of his nose, which we later found out to be encephilitis of some form - I can't recall the exact name - his skull developed later than his brain and a small part of tissue/brain was trapped outside of his skull. On our last doctors visit her blood pressure rose twice, but the doctors did not make any special note of this and cautioned of preeclampsia and recommended inducing in one weeks time. Later that evening my wife had a sever abruption. 

I'll spare the details, however, the doctors performed a miracle and while both my wife and son were near death, they revived both. My son was technically born without a heartbeat and they were able to resuscitate him. My wife and I had some amazing support while at the hospital from our families, doctors, nurses, and everyone in between. The NICU team was incredible. Unfortunately, a long week turned pretty gloomy. I put our dog down one day before our son had a massive stroke and siezures ensued and he lost all brain activity. We were faced with the tough decision to remove his life support at one week old. My uncle passed away from cancer complications the same evening. 

We were devastated and didn't know what to do with ourselves. We had just purchased a home specifically for raising a family in a home and not a rental that we might have to move often. Unfortunately this home is in a neighborhood neither of us like, with lots of young couples with newborns. (LOTS, every one of our neighbors has children under 4 years of age)

Long story getting shorter - We have both suffered the ensuing depression, self-blame, fights, and misunderstandings. We have both tried to do better, and enrolled in school, counseling, grief groups, child-loss groups, and have tried to focus on getting healthier and our careers. 

My wife ended up having a major gall bladder attack and had severe jaundice before finally removing the gall bladder - put a stint in for two months between diagnosis and surgery. Spent Christmas and New-years in the hospital. 

Months go by and we seem to be doing better. We're not drinking like fish out of water, we're doing house projects and our jobs are ok. I decided to enroll in school full-time this past fall semester. I did great and got all A's across the board. Everyone was proud of me. We did not manage our money well and what we saved was supposed to last us a few more semesters but only got us to this semester. I started working full time again this year and dropped all of my classes for a refund, to return at a later date. My wife is miserable and cannot seem to lose the weight she wants to lose. 

She was diagnoses with PMDD after tracking her migraines. She has severe debilitating migraines that she pushes through.  The doctor thinks it is directly related to her weight. She has put on almost 100 pounds since we met, she has lost some since the baby, but is stuck it seems. Her foot is fractured and she cannot run/walk much. I personally think that given enough drive and perserverance anything is possible, but I do also understand the grip of depression and anxiety. There is now only about one week out of every month that is somewhat enjoyable. I am not sure if I really enjoy it, or am just glad to not be anxious and walking on eggshells. 

She has been waiting 6 months for this surgery, and given the state of the world right now, has fought to stay on the surgeons schedule for her own sanity. This makes her extra stressed and anxious. 

When she gets stressed and anxious I try really hard to be helpful in any way I can. We have historically been a pretty good teeter-totter. Doing things around the home has usually been pretty well balanced, although being that I have been a mechanic and landscaper when I was younger, most of the house and car repairs are my responsibility. This is on top of house chores, which more recently, have fallen nearly all on my shoulders.  

I have been waiting almost two years for things to get better, to be happy and live a normal-ish life. I feel like I'm my wife's caretaker at this point. And for being the rock, support, and loving her when she doesn't love herself, letting her cry on my shoulder for hours at night assuring her everything will be ok, I feel abused. If I bring up at the wrong time the wrong thing - she will go off and yell at me and things can escalate very quickly, sometimes out of nowhere. I get anxiety when she calls from work because I know I'm going to be listening to her complain and yell and cry for the next 20 mins to hour. This happens almost daily, except that one week where things seem to be ok. I can come up with thousands of examples of where I (thought) I was being really calm and easygoing, and something happens or I say the wrong thing and shit hits the fan.  

It was my birthday this past february and my parents offered to take me and my wife to dinner and catch up on things. I can't recall exactly what happened, but my wife had a bad day at work and she wasn't expressing it well. I have a bad habit of continuing to ask ""is everything ok?"" even when someone says everything is ok, just because I can usually tell when something is wrong. I think this is what caused my wife to lose her temper and shit really hit the fan. I had to cancel dinner with my parents even though they were already at the restaurant waiting for us. This caused me to break.

I have lost most of my drive. I can't seem to stay at one job for more than a few days before I get anxious and stay up all night then quit the next day. I am not ""depressed"", although I am very unmotivated and unhappy. I have no one to confide in, hence this post, and I feel like I walk on eggshells 24/7. I end up usually being at fault for everything and being yelled at over the tiniest things. I want to stay, I want to support her. I want to stay hopeful that this surgery will work and I'll get my wife back. Her hormones are killing me and our marriage and I don't know what to do. 

I dream of being independent and not living in sadness and fear of being yelled at and resented. I used to get so anxious about getting yelled at over staying at work late, even though she didn't always work and we needed the extra money(I was commission as a mechanic) .I dream of not feeling taken advantage of or taken for granted, because I try so hard to stay positive and happy and helpful for the hopes of my wife having a better day, only to be beaten down later on. 

I dream of selling my house(in my name, wife had bad credit and wasn't working due to pregnancy sickness) and moving closer to the city and working really hard on getting my degree. I have a newfound desire to be a nurse. There is something so warm to me about being back at the hospital where my son was born. It might sound crazy, but those memories are some of the best memories. Nothing else mattered in the world except the health of my immediate family. Obviously it was some of the worst memories of my life as well, but there is this indescribable feeling that makes me feel at home. Maybe it's just knowing that this is the only place my son has ever lived. 

I just feel like I've lost half of my 20's being in grievance and just plain unhappy with the track my life is taking. I don't feel for my wife the same as I used to, but I care for her too much to ever leave. But that just it, I dream of leaving every day. I dream of telling her that I want a divorce every day. I know it will crush her, and I've tried so hard to wait until after her surgery to see if she is healthier and better and happier. I just don't know how much more I can take. I know it's not entirely her fault that her hormones are scarier than being a snitch in prison, but at the same time I want to fulfill my goals and dreams and feel like I'll never be able to do those things with her in my life. If you believe in the twin-flame thing, some say that some people are only meant to meet to better each others lives, and leave after this is accomplished. I certainly feel like a better and more accomplished person with tons of life experience crammed into 5 years. I just don't know what to do, but I have this burning desire to do what I truly want to, but I don't want to hurt her. She seems incapable of change because of her hormones, so it doesn't matter how many times I try to explain to her that sometimes she hurts me, she could do the exact same thing the next day. 

Surgery is 5 days away. She said her hormones could get a lot worse before they 'maybe' get better. 

I am inclined to wait and see just to be there for her, but I'm not sure I can take much more. 

I am past the concept of ""being divorced"" and don't care about the stigma anymore. I just want to be happy in life and feel fulfilled.

I have offered to go on walks with her, to go outdoors with her. Everyday after she works she comes home with a fresh load of cigarettes, beer, and fast food (at least 25 dollars of her 50~ are gone). Ive told her I will feed her addictions for her as long as she stays home.

Today I decided to beg her again. I approached her and told her ""mom, i know its hard to not work. I know its hard. But it will be much harder when you or dad are on a ventilator fighting for your life.""
She freaked out on me and cue my dad and her yelling at me saying that what I say doesnt matter. 

I am so scared they will get it. This virus could easily kill the two people who are most important to me. But my mom chooses to expose herself to it. I dont know what to do or what to tell her.

I wanna stop caring, because bad things keep happening and everything keeps getting worse. But thats my parents, I cannot just stop caring. 

Please help me help them. What do I even do?",23Mar2020,1

68,"Hello,

in the area where I live I have seen several times a mother who has 2 sons  +1 on the way. The older one gets constantly emotionally abused by her ( I am also assuming physically abused bc she threatened to hit him). She seems to have severe issues, her hatred towards this little sweet boy is horrible but even towards her adult friend for example she seemed frightening. she reminds me a lot of my mother who was also severely abusive and hateful. also i live in a very racist area (I am talking neonazis) in europe and the boy is black (the mother is mixed race). i am also half black so i know he has to deal with a lot of hostility and as a male physical violence will become even more of a threat. this mother is definitely a danger for him and somehow i doubt he has someone in his environment to protect him from her. i dont even know his name or where he lives or if i run into them again but i just keep thinking of him and i need to help him. do you have any advice what i could do?",23Mar2020,1

It doesn’t matter what it is- from what we’re having for dinner to what state we’re moving to. His is the only opinion that matters. If it doesn’t go his way, he throws a tantrum just like a toddler. He has obvious anger issues and is extremely narcissistic. He gaslights my mom and I and it’s really just getting out of control. I wish my parents would break up, but my mother doesn’t believe in divorce.

I’ve asked him before to take anger management classes or to talk to a therapist. But he tends become enraged while at the same time asserting that he doesn’t have anger issues.

I have severe anxiety and just the thought of actually going back to the store tomorrow makes me feel like i'm going to have a panic attack. My one sales rep is already at home sick with what she thinks is bronchitis that she got from her room mate but until she goes to the doctor tomorrow we don't know for sure. I've read tons of stories from other employees about customers coming into the stores and coughing all over the place. All of my coworkers from the store down the street put in for sick leave or PTO so they could stay home and quarantine, so all of their customers are going to be directed to my store. They all think I should do the same and I want to because i'm terrified to go in but i'm scared my boss will be furious with me and that i'll be risking my job, and I only have 40 hours of PTO and 32 hours of sick leave. If I use them all i'd either have to go back to work afterwards, quit, find another job (which is basically impossible right now with all of the layoffs) or hope that they'll finally be fined or pressured by the media or the government to close all of their retail locations by then and pay us anyway the same way they're doing with mall stores.

82,"I've (27M) been working at a grocery store for almost 3 years now, I worked my way up to a supervisor/assistant manager position and work 40 hours a week both early mornings and late night closings and have been for about 2 years now without ever asking a day off. I've been indifferent about my job and just don't really have any future goals in mind; I live with my parents, no car, no relationships, no vision of where I'll be in the near or distant future. I worked basically non-stop, always accepting extra hours, covering others' shifts, coming in when called due to co-workers' personal emergencies or covering for people who just didn't show up without ever really considering why I'm pushing myself. I've dealt with depression, suicidal tendencies, and have horrible anxiety and it cost me a romantic relationship I still never really got over and I used this job to bury it all in the back of my head. Nevertheless, I found ways to deal with myself and just pushed on for 3 years just aimlessly working hoping one day that it would all blow over.

About two weeks ago, during a closing shift that I was the manager-on-duty for, alongside two other co-workers, we were robbed at gunpoint by two men that came in just minutes before I locked the front door to close. They pressed a gun to the back of one of my co-workers demanding she open the register. She didn't react and I stepped in and opened the register for them while keeping hands in the air visible at all times to let them know that I wasn't making any sudden movements. Both robbers were armed and threatened to shoot and kill us if we didn't comply. One of them wasn't wearing a mask and had flushed cheeks and bloodshot eyes(drugs?) and seemed nervous, so I avoided eye contact as he demanded I take him to the safe. After they took us to our office and made me open the safe, they took every bit of money they could see and then threatened me again to open the lockbox where we keep our bank deposit. I lied and said I don't have the ability to open it when I could have, I guess I lied to them thinking it would make them leave faster or I was afraid of being responsible for the store losing everything and be fired for it. My bluff worked and they quickly left and my co-worker called 911 and I called and checked on my mom who was in the parking lot as my ride home to see if she was okay and if she saw them leave, which she missed as she had just drove into our parking lot as they were already halfway across the lot getting away. I called my manager and he arrived alongside the police. The robbers were never caught.

After all of that, I ended up staying at the store for about 3 hours giving statements to police, making necessary district/loss-prevention phone calls, and just trying to sort out the whole incident in my head which had only lasted less than 10 minutes. I then learned that the store would resume business the next day as if nothing happened and my next shift happened to be in less than 6 hours after getting home that night. I didn't sleep and immediately went back to work 6 hours later for a full 9 hours. I didn't feel off at the time, I guess adrenaline was what was keeping me going and I worked through the next couple of days just constantly recounting the story to co-workers asking if I was okay and making stupid jokes as if it was something to brush off. Then I saw the security footage and it hit me what actually happened days after the incident and I just felt a pit in my stomach. Since then I've just been feeling uncomfortable at my job, unable to focus, crying at home and just laying down in the dark doing nothing looking for an escape from that place. I even for the first time asked for just one day off of work because I just couldn't focus which made me feel bad just asking for. I even lost 10 pounds within 5 days after the incident from stress.

The store I work at is next to a bunch of hotel/motels that attract drug dealers and all sorts of bad people. We have constant theft, I fill a shopping cart almost every night I work with empty/ripped boxes of stolen items to place in damages. The very first night I closed the store as a manager, I had to call the police because of a drug addict bumping into things and making plenty of customers uncomfortable. After the robbery, I dealt with a druggie who refused to leave after being in the store for more than 4 hours trying to get money from a Western Union he didn't have the info for and was contorting his arms at random and talking to himself. I had a woman who tried to return items we could not provide a refund for threaten me that she was was going to pry open the register and take the money from me. I have cleaned poop from the women's bathroom ceiling before, i don't know how it got there. But less than a week passed after the robbery is when we were hit with the COVID-19 panic and we were bombarded with business and so many people have called out of work since and I've kept at it constantly without any rest.

Just the other day, the coworker I was with the night of the robbery showed me security footage of a night about 10 days after we were robbed when I wasn't working but she was. There were two men that looked extremely similar to the robbers and were watching my coworker and approached her to ask if we had an ATM or gave cashback, my coworker said she was near panic as she recognized them and asked another coworker for the phone as they were asking and they quickly left when she got the phone. We notified the police about this but I'm afraid to go back to work, I didn't think they would return to the place they recently robbed. I don't feel safe at my work anymore.

Should I quit without notice? My co-workers are good people and I don't want to leave them without help but I just feel suffocated being in that place now especially with the non-stop customers because of the coronavirus panic attracting even weirder people.",23Mar2020,1

84," 

so basically i am a normal average teenage guy, i like video games and books and i only have slight anger issues if pushed. i go to a normal suburbs school and i like to look at girls too. the thing is in the past year or so i have dated 2 girls to be exact and both of them have ended not so well. my first girlfriend was a cute redhead who i really liked. we dated in the 8th grade for a couple of weeks before she called me one day and said she just wanted to be friends, which i didn't object against, it was what she wanted.

then right after i graduated she texted me, wanting to get back together. i said yes because i still did have feelings for her. so we dated for another couple of weeks, but one day i took her to see the then brand new men in black movie, which she seemed to really like. during the movie she leaned her head on me, you know normal movie date stuff. after the movie i took her home and went home happy. the next day however i woke up at 7 am to find she had texted me wanting to break up with me. her last words to me since then was ""so uh yea, goodbye..."". i was really devastated, but moved on.

so i started high school, and was happy, made friends and had good times at my clubs, and then i started dating my second girlfriend. she was pretty nice at the start and we did have fun, going to the movies, hanging at my house, etc. We never did anything sexual in any way, (i am pretty bad at it for one, and i get nervous really fast in those situations.) but we were good together. then after 5 months i was getting kinda tired, having to drive her home from school everyday, it messed up my already massive homework schedule, and she never seemed to do much around me. The most we ever did was hug once, and talk, for 5 months of dating. the thing i wondered during that period of time was why didn't she want to hold my hand. let alone let me kiss her. I didn't want to go into a sex/sexual related relationship until i got like junior or senior year and i think she wanted the same.

eventually i wasn't able to handle it anymore, so i had to break it off with her. i didn't want to do things like my first girlfriend did so i took her off the side of the school after the day ended and i had some trouble trying to say to her that i wanted to end our relationship. she told me that it was okay and i could say what was on my mind, so i said to her that i wanted to be friends again and i thought she was still an amazing and beautiful girl, and i was glad of the months i had with her. she didn't seem angry or even that sad, but i did feel real bad leaving her that day.

now, even since then i have been going through my normal daily schedule, but i have had a thought on my mind, how could i ever try and find myself another good friend, a girlfriend to be exact, even though i still have my hanging thoughts of the last 2 relationships on my mind. i have tried to talk to girls, they are great friend wise towards me and i think that is amazing within itself. but it also seems that i have lost the sense of trying to date, because my past lovers are like a shadow behind me. ever so stalking me. and now every time i try to get closer to a girl i like it seems i stop short before i can tell her i like her. Is there any way that i can try and move on with a new girlfriend, without my past lingering over me?",23Mar2020,1
85,"I'm 19/F. I hooked up with this guy once or twice in February, wanting to try something new because hookups aren't usually my thing. We met online, both had dirty minds, but I guess neither one of us were very clear about what we wanted. And now I'm super confused, because I realized I wanted a relationship with him. 

I did eventually ask him if he wanted a gf, and he said yeah. Sometimes he'll hit me up, will send me videos of himself, but he keeps disappearing. Last time I told him to come get me, and he said he'd be there in 12 minutes to pick me up since I don't have a car, but he wouldn't be able to tell me when he was close because of wifi/data. So I went to wait outside, and an hour goes by and there's no sign of him. I text him, and never hear anything back. Not even the next day, but he read my message.  When asked, he says he passed out. 

And texting him now, he will still read/respond to my messages relatively fast. I see him watching my stories on snap a bunch. And honestly I miss him.

I made [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fet6ka/19_f_flirted_with_a_guy_and_it_might_have_been_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)about this. Before you read this, I must warn you I am a terrible person and very ashamed of myself. I will accept your downvoted. 

I approached a guy at a concert and asked him for his Instagram. I’m usually a pretty shy person so this gave me a small sense of victory. 

He asked me to go do karaoke with him some day. At first I was hesitant because I’m not really attracted to him (which probably made it easier to approach him in the first place). As well, after messaging him for a bit I realized we don’t have a ton in common. 

Nevertheless, I thought karaoke would be fun and I don’t really get out much so I agreed to go against my better judgement. 

During karaoke, he kept sitting close to me and he bought me a drink as well. He clearly thought this was a date. I’m super passive so I just went along with it even though I knew I didn’t see any sort of future with him. 

A couple days later he invited me to go ghost hunting in a graveyard. I thought this was a super cool activity and don’t know anyone else who would want to do that with me. However I also knew I probably shouldn’t be leading him on anymore. But once again, I went despite my better judgement. 

He invited me back to his place to watch a movie after ghost hunting, because there was basically nothing else to do with this pandemic going on. So we were watching the movie and I started to have some pretty bad thoughts. Basically, I haven’t had sex in a while and I was feeling kinda desperate with this guy sitting right next to me. 

I put his arm around me, then after a while I asked him if he wanted to make out. He agreed but he was probably the worst person I have ever kissed. And it was clear that he wasn’t comfortable doing more than that. So I just left after the movie was done. 

I told him I probably can’t hang out until the pandemic is over and he seemed kinda sad about that. He still messages me multiple times a day and I realized I kinda dug myself into a hole. 

He seems pretty insecure and I don’t think he has dated a lot of girls. I realize that this was really wrong of me to do but I don’t know how to get out of it at this point without hurting him.

90,"I have a friend (let’s call him M) who I have fallen out with. This is due to us slowly falling out over time and beefing a bit. I will share our views. My view is that I have a friend (called K) who has done pretty horrible things to me but for some reason I still hang out with him. I also have a friend called AJ who I talked to earlier about the fighting with M. I asked AJ if we can do part of our work (since we have schools shut and we have been sent work) but AJ declined because he is in a group with M and someone called S who do parts of work and share it to each other. I then told AJ this is because M is ratty (which I really think S is because it’s obvious he doesn’t like me). AJ then told M this and M got mad and thought I crossed the line. Because I was in a bit of a mood I said that M’s remix on something was gay (but not really meant seriously). M then said things about me sarcastically. We then took the beef to the dm’s. I told M I trust him and good friendships are built on trust and true liking. M doesn’t like the fact I still hang out with K due to the events that happened in the past with me and K. M then said that I destroyed his build in Minecraft which M thought was annoying (only because we were building a Walmart and he didn’t cooperate). From looking at our earlier conversations with M I see that M hates K and apparently M thinks I’m untrustworthy at this time which is false. His personality has slowly changed from being a funny guy who likes memes and joking to a serious guy. Looking into the start of today (start of beef) I see that M told me something that happened in school. In our DT class I noticed M had changed personality wise as M was telling me to shut up. Due to this I took his DT work and hid it from him for a few minutes before giving it back. M then says that I avoid him (I don’t imo) and on Xbox if we are in the same party K would always be there and call M salty. I join in for banter until he leaves. I did this because I remember playing gta with him and he killed me several times for no reason at all. I then left but they then joined my server and kept killing me. M then says that K talks about me behind my back saying ‘I want things done my way’ which is true but untrue. M writes a few paragraphs, the main point being in school I treat him negatively compared to K. M then gives me 3 options: 1, pretend to be friends like we have been for some time. 2, ignore each other and don’t be friends anymore. 3, actually be friends. Of course I choose 3 but M begins to say 2 is the most realistic. I then ask if he wants to end our friendship there, which he then says yes to due to the fact I suck up to K. We argue a bit more before M says when we play soccer he plays with his close friends (not including me). After a while I finally ask what option he wants to do. He hasn’t wrote back.

I have a crush on my dorms mate. I have given her some signal and there is some progress a step ahead and two back. I am quiet shy and awkward around her. I lose my charm and confidence. 

What is your trick to “fake it till you make it” with confidence around crush?",23Mar2020,1
93,"Corona Virus is upon us, so I decided that with this extra free time I wanted to relearn the basics of life. This is all because I believe my video game addiction in my early childhood didn't allow me to develop certain skills such as hygiene, folding clothes, eating properly, etc. Any extra advice for a young male in life would be appreciated as well.",23Mar2020,1
94,"Right now I'm 16 and I absolutely love writing. I've been doing it for over 3 years now and I've been writing a cohesive story. However, I recently got into a really bad state of anxiety with this pandemic happening and I couldn't eat and threw up when I tried to. I'm able to eat now and I'm happier but I just can't find my passion for writing anymore. 

I can write okay but I'm struggling with new ideas and what to do with the characters in my story and what things can happen. I've always found comfort in writing and had so many ideas but now it's hard to focus and come up with new material.

I've had writers block before but now it's like I completely just shut myself off and I can't think. Does anyone have any helpful advice on how to get back into that mindset? I've never taken a break for an emotional reason before so it's all new to me.",23Mar2020,1
95,"my older sister likes to come in my room when she's too lazy to go upstairs to her own room. 

i'm fine with that on its own, but she barges in without knocking or anything like that. i used to not care as much, but recently, it's been bothering me more. 
she rustles through my drawers and occasionally she'll take notebooks and diaries off my shelves and flip through them. i've told her that if she wants to do that to ask, and she agreed. but when i say that i don't want her to read through my diary or look through my sketchbook, she'll act personally offended. my parents will side with her and say that i ""have nothing to hide."" this has gotten better recently, so that's not my main concern.

i'm worried that i'm too mean to her sometimes. sometimes when she comes in, i'll feel uncomfortable in her presence. i was in a call with someone the other day and i felt awkward with her being in the room with me and i asked if she could go to her own. she again got very upset and left, angry. i don't dislike her. i love her a lot. but there are little things that bother me a great degree about her that i don't know how to confront. i feel really bad when i do confront her and i sometimes feel like i'm being unreasonable. is there a gentle way i can tell her about how i'm feeling?",23Mar2020,1
96,So I got a Paragard IUD back in February. I had sex without a condom on March 6. He came in me and now I’m starting to get worried about pregnancy. I’m on the pill as well. Is there a risk here? I’d go get a test but my state has a quarantine rule for Covid-19 right now.,23Mar2020,1
97,"I’m not freaking out about this because I wasn’t born yesterday and I know that it was only a matter of time. I literally walked in on him watching porn, he wasn’t exposed and I know he had just went to that site because he left the living room just a couple minutes before. I didn’t really say anything, I didn’t want to have a massive reaction on my part because I wanted to minimize his embarrassment. I used the restroom and went back to the living room for a minute, not knowing what to do. I then went back to his room and said “you’re good, don’t worry about it. Want to go for a hike?” and he suggested we watch Mythbusters instead. I didn’t know what else to do besides not make a big deal out of it. I’d like to know if anyone has their own story of how their parents reacted to a similar situation and if they didn’t react in a desirable manner what you wish they would have done instead.

99,"Context: I live with another girl in a two-bedroom flat in England. 

My housemate (HM) hasn't taken COVID seriously for the duration. Even tonight she went out to see the guy she's been seeing, when I've been desperately self-isolating as much as possible for over a week (during which time she has seen him five times, as well as socialising with friends etc). My longterm partner and I said goodbye a week ago, not knowing when it'd be safe and sensible to see each other. 

I'm so scared that my vulnerable family members (including my mother, who has two autoimmune conditions, and sibling who is just recovering from a severe lung infection) are going to get sick and I won't be able to get to them. They're self-isolating together already. My father has a house I could go to but his wife has innumerable health problems and I fear it'll be a death sentence if I go and I'm a carrier.

Three days ago HM said she wants her sister, who has been in high risk areas abroad and is now flying back to the UK, to self-isolate in HM room. I said I'd need to think about it, ask friends and family for advice. I've been incredibly cautious because... well I'm a decent human being who respects that this is serious and we all have to do our part, but personally I also want to be able to stay well to go and look after my vulnerable family members if/when the time comes. I'm very frightened for them.

We agreed that because things were changing so rapidly I could have time to think about it.

The next day she said I didn't have a choice and she was bringing her sister here regardless. I was devastated. She has two parents with houses, but she doesn't want her to go there. Her stepfather has a lot of money, and could pay for her to be put up somewhere, but she apparently hasn't sorted that out either. 

Today we barely spoke. Then tonight (while at the guy she's seeing's flat, of course -- after lying and saying she was ""going for a drive"") she tells me her sister is arriving tomorrow. I thought we'd be able to talk about it, but...

102,"Months ago my boyfriend suggested to me the idea to have a thre*some. I thought about it for a while and finally agreed to it. So, last month we posted on a famous NSFW forum here in Argentina  saying we were interested and DMs and proposals were welcome.

(For more context, I have the password of the account in the forum and I manage it). That's how I received a message just like many others and I suggested this guy (let's call him Juan) to move to Telegram and talk in there.

In the beginning the conversation was very sex-related as you could imagine and I have to admit that I played his game and liked it. You get what I mean? 

Nonetheless, the conversation left the sex arena very fast and moved to a more in depth and interesting conversation. And I loooved it. He's nice, caring and we actually have a lot of things in common.

A few days after we started to talk I had a big fight with my boyfriend and things scalated quickly. Our relationship hasn't been the same since then.

On the other side, Juan has been and awesome conversation partner and I really enjoy his company. We have gone out to dinner and such but never had sex (we agreed to it, because I don't feel comfortable to cheat on my boyfriend). We just kissed and I really liked though.

107,"Long story short , I’m graduated and woke part time. I can’t go to school in my country becuase it’ll cost 3x as much as someone who is a citizen; I’m a resident.

Right when I first started working , my mum stopped paying me an allowance . Fair enough. 

Then she said I need to start paying board , 30% of what I earn. Fair enough.

Then she asked for $100 a week when I only make 150...

Now she basically has me pay for anything I am a part of or need. Tooth paste? I have to pay for it. Wanna make cupcakes ? Buy the ingredients yourself. Little things like that which have started building up.
I’m only 19 and anytime I bring this up , she says “you’re an adult, you need to pay your way.” 

I feel like absolute shit becuase I can’t even save my money. I do 100% of the house work for her and all of the money I make , goes to my savings. Where is the money I’m paying her going ? New shoes . A nice dinner?

I love her but it sucks when you’re treated like a house mate rather than a daughter. I have been spiralling back into depression becuase of this and when I had a panic attack a few weeks ago, she sat down and asked me what was wrong. When I told her, she got up and walked out of my room and went to bed. The next morning she was acting like nothing happened.

112,"Hey everyone!

So, because of the coronavirus, like most people, my parents have take precautions such as buying a month's worth of food and masks for the whole family, stuff like that. Last week (march 20th), I wanted to go out with some friends but my parents did not allow it. That day, they told me that I was not allowed to come in contact with anyone including friends. They explained to me that this was called social distancing and that I should not leave the house for unnecessary things which I understood since the Coronavirus is extremely contagious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that in some countries the coronavirus is a huge deal, but here in Canada, the government has not put us under quarantine, which means I should be allowed to go out with mild caution. Keep in mind that I live in a tiny town with around 22 thousand people and it is very unlikely that I do get the coronavirus. Last time I was sick was 15 months ago (I've been counting), my immune system is extremely strong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I have to go to work. I told this to my parents and they said that I was not allowed to go. They are preventing me from working. I told them that I was going to get fired if I didn't show up, which they quickly replied by saying that the government has instituted a new law saying that employers are not allowed to fire their employees due to the coronavirus. I told them that even if that was the case, if I don't show up to work, I will lose money. They said that I would still get paid (which I seriously doubt). I then said that I would take a cab to work (since they're not allowing me to use the car). They said that if I do that, I will lose my ""privileges"" such as my phone and my computer (which I both paid for with my own money). I texted my coworkers explaining this to them and they said that they were fine covering all my shifts. They only problem here is that I won't get any money. So tomorrow morning I'm going to have to text my boss explaining that my parents are not allowing me to go to work which really sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do here. Should I try and persuade them so that they allow me to go to work or should I just stay home (lose hundreds of dollars) and risk getting fired?",23Mar2020,1
113,"Right now, I am feeling extra low. My s/o has been complimenting my friends looks and stuff. I know, it sounds like I'm jealous but I strongly believe it is more than that. My s/o says that I should 'learn or get tips' from them, because I would look better. Which, I know, if I had the time and could go the extra mile to make myself look better, I would. But, because I'm still a minor and I live with my parents, I can't go out on my own without a maid or somebody with me, for safety reasons. My s/o even talks about having s\*x with them and how tight they would be. I mean, I don't own him so he can think what he wants, but I feel like he should be more sensitive towards my feelings, just as I am with him. He even says that he likes je\*king off to my friends and that he 'releases a lot' whenever it's with them. And honestly, I don't really need to know that, I mean, there are some things you really *really* should keep to yourself you know? Sometimes he subtly comments on how I look, which makes me feel really bad. Most of the time he showers me with complements, which means a small amount, since I don't have a great self-esteem, but it builds up slowly like that little by little, sadly, only to get knocked down when he says something about my friends and how they look 'so hot' Which again, I think he should either keep it to himself or be caution when saying things like this. 

And idk, rn I feel more insecure than ever because he said he might be falling in love with one of my closest friends. Which is alright, as long as he's happy that's fine and it will make me happy, seeing him happy. I'd be rooting and helping him on the side, hiding that I am hurt, but hey, we don't own each other and we don't owe our lives to each other since we are both still young and it is not time to make such a huge life-commitment to each other, we can barely commit to all our school works lmao.

116,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I \[21F\] met him \[21M\] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",23Mar2020,1

124,"Just gonna try and make this vague, simple, and as short as I possibly can, sorry if it’s poorly worded. So about 4 years ago I moved across the state, with that, my parents pulled me, and my other sibling out of school. Ever since then, my parents have never bothered to send us back to school, despite us all being in favor for it. Also my third sibling, who’s a teenager with autism, has legitimately never had any form of schooling. We didn’t move to the best of areas, and no matter what they insist it’s for the best. It’s also worth mentioning that when they pulled me out of school, my attitude was noticeably worse than it is now, and they constantly use that as a reason why it’s been “better for me”, and why school isn’t “necessary”. I’m honestly not sure of the legality of the situation, or even the morality. Ever since it’s happened, I’ve become extremely anti social. I haven’t had a single friend since then, and my neighborhood doesn’t have many other people my age, so I’ve became socially inept, in pretty much every way. They also haven’t even sent us to the doctors in I don’t know how many years, or the dentist, so all of our teeth are completely ruined. It’s worth mentioning that we have a lot of animals, an obscenely unhealthy amount. I’m talking like 20, 30 cats, maybe 7 dogs? Something in that ball park, too many for me to even remember the names. Anyways, because of how much work always needs done, our house has naturally fallen into complete disrepair, the front door doesn’t shut, fridge doesn’t shut, and needs to be propped open with something, we have no carpets because of the urine that soaked into them from the sleuth of animals we have, there’s holes everywhere, and a ton of other nasty stuff. My father previously has physically assaulted my mother, multiple times, but he hasn’t for well over a couple years now, and he’s never hurt us, but it’s still at the point where I’m too scared to go to them and stand up for us in fear of physical altercation because I’m not big enough. I don’t know how it got this bad, I’m just lost on what to do now, is what they’re doing illegal? Can we be taken away, and if so should I call someone?

132,"So I have this friend who I play xbox with. Earlier today, a were playing. Then she told me she was going to take a nap, and she would play with me when she got up. So I sat and waited till she got up. She messaged me to tell me she was awake. And then I told her to send a party invite. Then I didnt hear anything for about an hour, where she messaged me and told me that she was playing with other people already. That upset me. And I told her. And she said, ok sorry and she would play with me in a little bit. And we did play. Then she said she was going to take a break for a but would be on later and we would play again. Fast forward a few hours. And I see that she made a post looking for people to play with. And so I told her she did it again. And she said that I was overreacting and got real upset with me. I tried to explain that I was upset that she told me we were going to be playing, and had me waiting, then just basically canceled our plans without saying anything. I think it would be different if she had said something like ""oh I'm actually gonna play with someone else"" or something like that. But the fact that she didn't even bother messaging me, really upset me. But she just keeps saying that I have no right to be upset and to ""get over myself""",23Mar2020,1
133,"I skateboard quite often. I sprained my ankle last year around the same time trying a trick down a set of stairs and I couldn't walk on it. I assumed it was a bad grade 2 or grade 3 sprain. I immediately started the RICE treatment when I got home and noticed the swelling formed and purple bruising appeared after a while. My foot remained tender for quite some while and I took a break from skateboarding for a couple of months. I picked the sport back up in the middle of summer (about 2 months after). I noticed my ankle still did not feel the same but I could still do everything I needed to do.

Everything was going great until a month ago when I rolled it and sprained it again. I did the RICE and tried to keep off my foot. I took another break for about 3/4 weeks and started rehabbing with ankle bands in hopes of getting my ankle to heal better. After I got back to skating, it felt like my ankle was better but still, never at its peak performance. After skating outside today, I sprained my ankle ONCE AGAIN which frustrated me. I believe it is the pair of shoes im skating in maybe. I am in my bed at the moment resting, icing, comprising, and elevating. I plan to do ankle rehab exercises with my bands once again and keep off my foot for a while. Is there anything I can do to get my ankle stronger or are these sprains just part of the sport? Its a little frustrating having ankle sprains so often as it deters my day to day living and deters my progress in the sport itself.

I noticed after my first ankle sprain, my ankle has never felt ""proper"". It still feels tender when I bend it to the side (causing tenderness in the outside area where my ankle was sprained). I also noticed my same ankle rolls every time. Im pretty sure my proprioceptors are just horrible now. I plan to RICE and stay away skateboarding for month now. I was just wondering how I can get my ankle stronger and heal faster?

Thank you.",23Mar2020,1

Anyway, I'm going to be with my boyfriend, temporarily, until the next semester. That means from as soon as I get there until the end of August. I plan to get a job, too.

First things first, I need to know how to tell my parents. I know they'll belittle me and say it's a stupid idea, but I stand by my choice. I just want to know how to get the courage, and what to tell them.

Second comes with moving. I don't have a car so I'd have to fly, and I don't mind not having much, but there are things I need, like my computer (my tower, mainly). I don't know how to bring a lot of stuff on a plane. I could ship it, but I need my computer for school so I'd need it asap.

137,"Hello! 
Background: I am 20 years old, no college experience, with a High School diploma.  
COVID-19 is making us all search for what career moves we can make, and I'm jumping on the train. Call this quarantine brain. A need to connect with others while being stuck at home haha. 
I need help. I'm very fortunate in that I still have a job and I don't want to take that for granted. I enjoy my job, I just am not making enough. I'm desperate to move out and start my ""adult"" life. In my state for a studio-1 bedroom rent is ranging from $1,200-1,600. I bring home $1,600-1,800 a month. Before everything hit the fan I was interviewing for the company of my dreams. They have delayed the interview process due to the recent events and I'm worrying they will forget about me by the time this is over. 
I don't have a degree, my current work experience is:
Food industry for 1.5 years. 
Retail for 1.75 years. 
Now I work at an Optometrist office and have been for 11 months. 
I was hoping to get advice on certificates, the best ones to get for a career. Or just things in general I can do to get my foot in the door. I want to take my new found free time and make the most out of it. Thank you for listening! :)",23Mar2020,1
138,"I've had this issue for a while now and it's effecting my relationships. 

Since I was around 14/15 years old, I've had this recurring crush on someone. 
It was an instant physical attraction, there were some flirtations here and there. Every relationship I got into, I'd still find myself fantasizing about this person, and not only in a sexual way. When those relationships ended I'd jump back to pursuing this person again. 

We have a lot of common interests and get along well, but other than that I really don't see why I feel so connected to them. I even went through a phase of thinking they were ""the one"" simply because I found myself gravitating back towards them constantly. I took everything as a ""sign"" this person felt the same way, whether it was them liking a lot of my social media posts or sending me a flirty message. I got addicted to the excitement and it's probably the most attracted to someone I'd ever felt. 

We finally slept together a couple of years ago after a long sexual tension battle, and after that it just kind of stopped until I got into another awful relationship, and I ended up thinking of this person constantly again. That relationship ended and now I've met someone perfect for me, I didn't think about this person once since dating my new partner. But now we're both stuck in isolation together, things have gotten a bit stale (not in an unfixable way, we just need some space) and Everytime I hear a certain song, play a certain game etc etc, this person pops up in my head.

I want it to stop because I genuinely am in love with my current partner, yet I still find myself wondering about this person and thinking ""what if"" and I don't want to at all. I don't even know if I actually have any semblance of feelings for this person or if I just fell in love with the excitement of this ""will we won't we"" thing we had going on for literal years. 
We don't even talk much either, and we've only actually met in person a handful of times. What can I do to overcome this?",23Mar2020,1
139,"My roommates gf is a trauma nurse at a local hospital. Understandably she’s been dealing with a lot the past few weeks. My roommate has been looking after her cat the last few days while his gf was working ridiculous hours to help with the pandemic (US btw). He is bringing the cat back to her tomorrow and I brought up the fact that she is at a high risk of being contagious, and basically how I’m worried if he has ‘too much’ interaction with her he’s likely to get infected and bring it back and infect me too.

It became a small argument (‘what am I supposed to do not be in a relationship for months?’) but I didn’t press too much into it. Basically he’s set on going over there and at minimum spending the night. 

What the heck am I supposed to do in this situation? How can I convince him to not go, or at least follow safety guidelines while he’s there?

Our lease is up in a month and I could possibly move essentials to my parents and live there for the next few weeks but that is incredibly inconvenient. Any advice would be great thanks!",23Mar2020,1
140,"So I am 17M and I have had my ups and downs with people in my life. My main issue with my core friend group is that I always think everyones out to get me and doesn’t want me around, either because they turn down hanging out (before the pandemic), seem disinterested in talking, etc. However, everytime I say, confront them about it or get mad about it, they think I’m delusional and that there’s no issue. It turns into a whole episode of me feeling undervalued and hurt and them waiting for me to get over it. It’s hard for me to recognize because they have no issue with each other from what I see and I can only know what I know, so I try to be aware of if they don’t like me so I am not hurt because certain people in the group I’m super close with, but have gotten more distant because of these style meltdown. I feel like everytime I try to work on myself, I get into a mindset of this is doing nothing for me and I get mentally and physically unwell until I snap again. It’s hard for me to wrap my brain around because my best friend used to hang out so much with me one on one, and now he’s never available. I’ve learned that he’s genuinely busy and doesn’t want to hang out with anyone, but it still hurts because I love my interactions with him. 

What do I do? If I try to say To give them a pass to have me leave the friend group, they are pissed because they think I’m overreacting, but I don’t want feel well in the group still. Should I stop talking to them if it’s too much effort to trust them? Or should I ask specific things from them? Should I ask them what they want from me as a friend, or ask them if there’s any issue they have with me no matter how small?",23Mar2020,1

My home town is really small and I never really fit in with most of the people here. Well no human interaction is actually driving me crazy. I’m a person who like to always have something to do and people to talk to. I loved college because for the first time in forever I finally felt like there was nothing wrong with me!

I’m also watching all of my peers not follow quarantine and it sucks watching them have fun! So I was thinking I could move my quarantine area...to my boyfriends house in my college town.

I just want to go and spend a few days with him and I already need to go back up there to grab the rest of my stuff out of my dorm. Also there still are not any confirmed cases in my college town.

144,"So, I’ve been toying with the idea of going back to school to study Paralegal. I’m looking at an online course from a local University, total cost just shy of $4,000. I applied for a Pell Grant, which I was approved for, only to learn the University doesn’t accept grants for online ‘continuing education’ courses. My only options are self funding or a Sallie Mae loan. I’m not looking to deplete my savings, and a loan would put me at around $10k total debt (which isn’t much compared to most people my age, but why incur it if I don’t have to .. ya know?) 

I’m thinking of using my Certification to work as an independent contractor, so I wanted some real life advice. Attorneys/Paralegals of Reddit, should I do it or would I be wasting money? I’ve done research on job projections and I’ve done job searches all over the web looking for Paralegal services, but I figure who would know better than the ones actually in it.

Overall I’m somewhat concerned and I’m trying my best not to freak out, but with how things look on the administrative level and how people seem to either ignore or underplay the importance of social distancing or the quarantine, it’s all worrying. 

I’m mostly wondering if I should just go home and go into two weeks isolation, then get into work as a delivery guy because apparently they’re in high demand. Or stay here and see how long I can go on doing this until I’m forced to stop.

That was fine with me the last thing I want is to make him think I am trying to force anyone into anything if they aren’t ready. I like that he was honest and didn’t lead me on.

She believes they are long dead people or people who got trapped in her. One example is a 'kin' called Tiene, supposedly a fire elemental from a different world, who is only around when she looking at hot men, other times she has kin known as Jophiael, who is apparently a extreme sadist and angel. 

Today I have realised just how bad this is, as she went extremely formal and pretentious an when I asked her other friends, they said this is how Jophiael, the Angel kin, talks. 

I have tried asking her to go see s psychologists about this, but she refuses to. 

Generally I simply play along with the whole thing, I do not know if that makes matters worse or better.

My friend is also rather depressed and has had some pretty shitty circumstances. From my understanding, things like Dissociative Identity disorder only happens after trauma?

Her and I got quite close in a fairly quick time, we would text non stop, and hang out a lot in person, after about a month or two of getting signs that she was into me I decided it was time to finally ask her out. When I did, I wasn't very surprised when she said yes in person, but then later than night when we were going through the details over text she said, ""I hadn't realized you were asking me out on a date"". I played it off like it was no big deal, but man did that sting, she said, and I quote ""I really really really really really like you, but just not like that"". But I'm a guy that usually doesn't keep pushing things on people, so I just backed off and stayed ""being friends"". But her flirting with me only got worse and worse, but I wasn't about to ask her out again, because it seemed like she was clear on not wanting to be anything much more. So my friend suggested I ghost her, he said it would show her what she was missing out on, let her come to her senses or whatever nonsense he told me. Especially with school being cancelled due to Corona, and not being able to see each other in person, it would be the best time right?. So I went with it... I started limiting texts, becoming more and more dry with each day that passed, and after like 4 or 5 days, I stopped communication completely. She would try to start conversation but I wouldn't respond. She would send me Tik-toks no response, she even said ""I don't know why you're not responding but I like sending you these videos so..."", and I even managed to not respond to that.

I said something to offend her and tbh she was totally right to be angry at me. I hurt her to the point where she cried badly and didn't want to talk to me. I kept apologizing, she didn't want to hear any of it and wanted us to either stay as just friends or not talk at all...she said ""i'm incredibly mad at you right now, you can't even imagine""...Me being the idiot that i am kept pressing her to accept my apology, and didn't really give her some space even though she literally told me ""I don't wanna talk right now maybe tomorrow when I'll be calm""...I kept making jokes trying to cheer her up to no avail, I eventually gave her the space she wanted, and we started talking the following day which was today and we started talking again like normal. You'd think everything is good now right? Nah, I can't get over the fact that I was so stupid to hurt her with my words, I can't get over the fact that that situation was totally avoidable, and I can't stop wondering whether we'd have gotten even closer if if weren't for what I did.

169,"So, it’s hard for me to open up here on reddit with strangers about this situation but oh well here we go.

So when I was about 10 or 11, my stepdad was very very handsy and still is. One time he sat really really close to me, and rubbed my lower back while moaning/grunting and it overall made me very uncomfortable but I was young and didn’t know how to say no. Another time, I was laying on my bed and he just got on top of me and started kissing me and moaning and grunting like before and it’s scarred me. Recently, all he does is just ask me weird questions and make fun of what I eat and sometimes touches my shoulders. Same thing with my real dad. He always slaps my ass in public as a joke but it’s just very uncomfortable. I’ve had a therapist for 4 months but I don’t know how to tell her. I don’t know if she’ll call cps or something. I know this sounds like a minor problem but it’s messed up my life a bit. For 1, I can’t undress in front of doctors, whether or not it’s a female. For 2, I flinch whenever someone touches me. For 3, I get uncomfortable around any men. Someone just please help, I’m lost on what to do. I’ve kept quiet for too long.",23Mar2020,1

So I’ve grown up fatherless and I never had a real father figure until about 4 years ago....This guy just dropped into my life when I needed him.

176,"I'm in a long distance relationship. We already said the L word and I've flown out to see her a few times at this point, so we're pretty serious.

One thing about her is that she has a lot of guy friends and half of them are her exes. She's had a lot of exes and the longest one lasted 2 months. I have never said anything, she can be friends with whoever she wants. All I asked is that she make sure their conversations are appropriate and that she doesn't let them flirt with her. She said if they do, she'll take care of it. 

Anyway here are the 3 major things regarding other guys that have happened in our relationship:

First, she had a friend that she sat next to in class every morning. Apparently while her and I were talking (not dating yet), this dude told people that he wants to hook up with her. She said no. He then asked her if he can send her nudes. She said no. Although she denied his advances, I don't think it's appropriate to continue being friends with someone who said all these things while her and I were still talking. I explained that I was upset about it, she agreed that I was right to be upset and said she would react the same way as me if she was in my shoes. She said she would stop talking to him. (She didn't, it took us 3 more conversations for her to finally stop). I was upset that I had to tell her to stop; she should have known to stop already.

Second, she has an ex that she is friends with. On her Birthday, he posted 'happy birthday to your fine ass self' on his story and tagged her in it. She even told me that her friends might think something happened between her and I since a guy is posting something like that on his story. Like she knows it's wrong basically. And I voiced this to her. I said it's inappropriate for a guy to say 'happy bday to your fine ass self', especially on his story. She said he knows she has a boyfriend so she already did everything in her means. I said no tf you didn't, 'everything in your means' would be to tell him it's inappropriate. Anyway, later that night, she says 'I want to ask you a question - actually never mind I know you'll say no'. I ask her to tell me, she says she was going to ask if she can hang out with the same guy in question alone. I got mad and said are you crazy. She I can't be mad because I made her tell me. I said either way she shouldn't have even thought about asking; she should have already known it would be inappropriate. I shouldn't have had to tell her this. She should have known already.

Lastly, in one of her last relationships, she actually cheated on her partners. She said he was psycho and she wanted to cheat to make sure it ends and she doesn't go back to him. The guy she cheated with was someone she'd always wanted to hook up with and she said she started to go to this guy when she wants something sexual. She hasn't talked to the guy she cheated with in a long time. It was her birthday and she started laughing while on the phone with me. I asked why she's laughing, she said she laughed at a text. I asked a text from who, she said from her friend. I said what friend, she said you don't know him. I said who is it, she said it was the guy that she cheated on her ex with. I said ok since it's her birthday, he's probably just saying happy birthday. I said oh okay don't get used to talking to him. She didn't say anything so I repeated it. She said don't worry I'm not going to talk to him every day. I said no, you aren't going to talk to him at all. She didn't say anything. I repeated it, she didn't say anything. I said 'so are you going to stop talking to him?' and she said 'well I don't really have a choice do I' and I said no. I said I shouldn't even have to tell her not to talk to this guy. What place does a friendship with him have in our relationship. We stayed on the phone for another 30 mins without saying a word to each other, I said there's no point in staying on the call, she said ok and we hung up. We haven't talked in 5 hours. 

IDK what to do. I don't think she'll cheat on me; I know she won't. But still, she is acting like she's single. She's disrespecting our relationship by doing shit like this and she's letting other guys disrespect our relationship by not stopping them. I really love this girl and 99% of the time, I'm happy. She's like no girl I've ever met before and I would actually die for her. But lately we've been arguing about shit like this too often and I can't take it.",23Mar2020,1
177,"For context, we’ve been talking for about a month. I heard from a friend of a friend that this girl was a whacko, so I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. I think I see what she’s talking about now.

She has abandonment issues due to losing a handful of people that were very close to her in relatively rapid succession. That I can understand. What I can’t understand, however, is how/why she’s so hypersensitive. She doesn’t like it when I call her “dude, man, bro” etc, even though I refer to every single one of my friends as such, so I said I’d stop. She’s always talking about how she doesn’t like how she looks and this and that and it doesn’t really matter what I say because she’s in her own head and I can’t change her mind. She hung up the phone and is refusing to talk to me because I interrupted her (unintentionally) mid convo and she got furious and hung up. I apologized and I can tell she’s still pissed.

Am I doing something wrong? Should I not be saying these things? Or should I consider moving on?",23Mar2020,1
178,"To give some context, this happened last week at my school. I live in Australia and most schools are still running, unlike other countries.

During the lunch break a couple of days ago I got together with my friends to eat, hang out, the usual stuff as we do during most school days. Eventually the coronavirus gets brought up when we're talking and we're wondering when school's gonna be cancelled, what'll happen to the our exams and assignments and so on.

Personally I'm not too concerned about it seeing how young we all are, none of us have any strange illnesses that could make it worse (at least I think) so even if we catch it thought it would just be like a bad flu. And the chances are pretty slim regardless because of all the measures being introduced to distance people. Since the boys seemed unusually worried about it I started to do some fake over the top coughing while pretending to be some patient that was dying to kinda sarcastically show how they were blowing the issue out of proportion.

But one of my friends, lets call him Jim, seemed really uncomfortable to this. He had been wearing face masks for the past week or two so it figures. Anyways he tells me to stop, but to be honest I think the whole face mask thing is really annoying and unnecessary plus I generally don't like him that much so I keep coughing stronger to try to get a laugh and make others understand. But no, he just gets angrier so I kind of retaliate by going right up to him and basically coughing on him.

This makes Jim freak out and start swearing and me and even says he'll ""drop"" me if I get close and cough like that again. Other people tell me that it's not cool and I need to stop. I stop but for the rest of the break the boys kind of act cold to me like I'm some kind of weirdo. Now since it looks like schools could be shut down very soon I'm worried my friends won't wanna hang out with me anymore. Was I in the wrong? What can I do to make sure they don't go away from me",23Mar2020,1

184,"So I was Skyping a friend earlier today and I noticed that she was all bundled up. As it turns out, my friend and her roommate apparently have no heat in their apartment right now because they can’t afford to pay. Neither of them currently have a source of income and my friend was already a broke PhD student, so she has almost no money.

I asked her about the heat situation and it sounds like they use oil (or something, my friend was sort of confused herself) and it will cost them $300 to turn it back on. I currently have both a job and savings, so while $300 isn’t cheap, it’s an amount I can part with.

My friend was brought up to view accepting gifts/handouts as weakness and knows if she just takes money from me, her parents would be furious if they knew. She also says she can’t afford to pay me back, so she won’t take a loan. 

My friend also explained that she might be able to get some money from her parents given the situation right now, but that if she does, she will owe them a huge debt and fears the repercussions of taking that money. It’s also likely not going to be enough to get by for very long. (Her parents seem like horrible people to me, but nothing I can do about that.)

My friend barely has enough money left to restock on food once what’s in her kitchen runs out and I’m really worried about her. I’m also worried about her roommate who is an elderly woman who also has very little money and is at high risk of getting sick. 

I’m extremely worried about the both of them, but know that I can’t just force my friend to take money from me. What do you suggest I do to help her? Obviously I’ve offered moral support and made it clear to her that if she needs anything (food, money, etc) she can come to me, but I don’t know if she’ll take me up on my offer due to the stigma it has.

186,"I’m diagnosed with bipolar, and I can’t hold a steady job. I’m prone to thoughts of extreme violence and frustration at the thought of working for someone, applying for work, pretending that I’ll find a passion aside from art, writing, and music. 

I’ve lost 2 girls I have been wholeheartedly in love with because the time I spend on my art HAS to make me money, or I cannot function in society at all. And I want to provide for my women, so I try and try and try and try extra hard. I would be useless and my thoughts would spiral into s.uicical depression if I didn’t have art as a pillar of my life. 

I work for at least 5-6 hours every day on painting, songwriting, poetry, or anything related to the thought. I think about it all day. Painting is what drives me to exist, music is a given because it’s always been such a large part of me. My other hobbies in the past have been more physical, so this winter, due to the cold, I’ve lost 30 pounds. 

I’ve tried cocktails of different medications, antidepressants, anti anxiety, I smoke weed in huge amounts because if I don’t, my body will start shaking and I’ll think of how much of a loser I am because I can’t provide for the women who have all loved me. 

My work is absolutely fantastic in my opinion, and in the opinion of anyone who knows about it. I’ve had posts reach 5,000+ upvotes here on reddit multiple times, this past year I probably made over $3,000 from commissions and selling personal art, but I cannot be happy with all the praise. I feel like I deserve more because of how hard I work and I feel like if it doesn’t come, I’m going to be a mooch and unloved for the rest of my life. I absolutely need it to work; there are no alternatives to me at this point. 

I have very good reasons for the anxiety that the workforce brings me, and I have very good reason to believe I don’t need it.

Gosh, the excess skin, strechmarks, scars, and other issues were making me feel less confident about myself. Now, I feel apathetic towards my body and feel uncomfortable about wearing just swim shorts or being naked due to the changes my body went through while on the psychiatric meds. I know that this crap may not dissipate once I am off these drugs and I may have to put up with it.


It just sucks. To make matters worse, my libido vanished, am dealing with ED, ejaculation issues, and anorgasmia. I worry that my sexual problems would be lifelong even after stopping these meds and that my chances at finding love are gone. I often see threads on Reddit about how some person is debating if they should leave their partner or spouse over their sexual problems. I honestly don't know what to do.

We went on a trip last week and there were some new kids there and he literally spent his time on his phone while they talked. I got that he maybe wanted his own time but it got to the point that I felt like he was ignoring them. Also, his conversations with his friends on the games are ridiculous and often end in our parents and I screaming our heads off until he shuts up. He thinks we are always wrong about everything and if I try to confront him about his gaming and his school work he gets at about being on my phone. I know how hard it can be to get trapped in something and I want him to just have a balance but still be able to make his own choices and be happy. Schools have shut down here and this means he is playing/looking at a screen for an exponential amount of time. I cannot talk to him without a fight starting and I have no idea what to do.

196,"I almost feel as if this belongs in “Am I The Asshole” because I feel like one right now. But hear me out: 

I’ve been looking for a job for a while, working has been hard for me over the past two years as my depression and anxiety have taken over my life. So much so I had to move home from college and I’m going to start online schooling during the summer. I’ve always worked small jobs to pay for whatever I can and to help my family. 

In January, I started working out and eating better, TRULY believing it was time for me to have my “start over” moment. I lost weight, felt really good, started a new antidepressant. I’m in a LDR, and because of my newfound (dare I say it) happiness, I told my significant other I was ready to work and save up for us to move in together early next year. And I meant it, I was so ready. 

So, after searching, I finally found a job that was decent pay, in my town, and would allow me to focus on school in the summer and not be too overwhelmed, as that is a common problem. I applied, interviewed and was hired within 2 days. It is at a pharmacy. 
When I was hired, COVID-19 was just beginning in the US. 

I worked two shift. A woman came through the drive through saying, “l think I have it.” With no protective gear, shoving her card into my face so I could give her medicine, not worrying about touching my gloved hand or getting as close to the drive through window as possible. I have a family member who has a weak immune system. I live with her. It’s in our county, and is spreading here quickly as I live next to a big city. So I don’t doubt the woman had it. I told everyone in the pharmacy and they shrugged it off and I continued being nearly inches away from sick people for the rest of the shift. Which normally, without COVID-19 would not have bothered me as much. 

Earlier, I let them know that I would not be coming in for the foreseeable future, but I am aware that they will probably fire me, and I understand why. 
I was so proud of myself when I got the job, when I worked those shifts without coming home and caving in, for making money to save for my LDR. 
Family does come first, always. And I want to protect my loved one, and be one less person that spreads this around. 
 
But it the right decision? To “quit” when people that need jobs so badly are unable to get them? Why do I have to feel so guilty? And mad that I was finally doing something and had to choose between it or keeping my family safe. Although I would always choose family.

So, after searching, I finally found a job that was decent pay, in my town, and would allow me to focus on school in the summer and not be too overwhelmed, as that is a common problem. I applied, interviewed and was hired within 2 days. It is at a pharmacy. 
When I was hired, COVID-19 was just beginning in the US. 

I worked two shift. A woman came through the drive through saying, “l think I have it.” With no protective gear, shoving her card into my face so I could give her medicine, not worrying about touching my gloved hand or getting as close to the drive through window as possible. I have a family member who has a weak immune system. I live with her. It’s in our county, and is spreading here quickly as I live next to a big city. So I don’t doubt the woman had it. I told everyone in the pharmacy and they shrugged it off and I continued being nearly inches away from sick people for the rest of the shift. Which normally, without COVID-19 would not have bothered me as much. 

Earlier, I let them know that I would not be coming in for the foreseeable future, but I am aware that they will probably fire me, and I understand why. 
I was so proud of myself when I got the job, when I worked those shifts without coming home and caving in, for making money to save for my LDR. 
Family does come first, always. And I want to protect my loved one, and be one less person that spreads this around. 
 
But it the right decision? To “quit” when people that need jobs so badly are unable to get them? Why do I have to feel so guilty? And mad that I was finally doing something and had to choose between it or keeping my family safe. Although I would always choose family.

201,"I'm trying to live more ethically. I have switched to a vegetarian diet, use more open sourced software that is more ethical, try to use less overly packaged food, try to support good causes but there are SO MANY THINGS. Everything has a moral dimension and I don't just want to give up but I'm exhausted trying to think about the ramifications of what I do all the time. I'm also trying to find a job and its paralyzing trying to figure out what jobs can really be done ethically and which ones might be contributing to larger problems.

I have tried researching and thinking about more and more about the things I use and purchase but I feel that as time goes on that is becoming so much of what I do. And there is always more to be done. Are you supporting mostly open source software? You can always do more. Are you vegetarian? You should be vegan. You bought a coffee at starbucks? You're contributing to unustainable packaging problems, child labour issues, and are foregoing the opporunity to use that money more helpfully. But on the other hand all of the starbucks employees would be out of a job if everyone didnt. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel like everything that I do is immoral. I feel like there's no escape and I am wondering if anyone has figured out a better way to think about these things.

We just got word today that our governor has asked all non-essential businesses to cut their staff by 50% to help halt the spread. I'm currently on vacation but I'm scared that when I come back I'll get the word that I'm out of job.

So I thought that maybe I could stream on Facebook or Twitch or YouTube to help generate an income.

I already have all the equipment that I need, so I don't need to worry about spending during a time that I should watch how much I spend.

I just want to ask if this is at least an idea worth entertaining?

I asked my friends on Facebook if they'd be willing to at least give me a chance and I got quiet a few responses saying that they would.

If this fails then maybe I'll apply to a grocery store or something but I want to save that for last since my last job was at a grocery store and it's just something I'm not very eager to go back to.

I'm not expecting to have millions of views or get rich just hoping to entertain some people and maybe make a few dollars a week. I should say that I'm a college student that still lives at home so I don't need to make a whole lot, just enough to continue to help out my family as I have been.

We couldn't even find an internship program to accept us and even graduates that went abroad were ignored since our college ""wasn't accridated"" (well the petroleum program idk about the others) what's frustrating is that after contacting the dean he legit said ""we are working on it we'll improve and get accredited"". It is annoying me that all the other programs in my college have been going on for years and are better but the single one that is still just an experimental disaster is the one I choose to go through, why is it even a new program when oil reserves will end in like 40 years.

So I recently got ghosted for the first time and I am so confused and hurt. I would appreciate any kind of

Here's the context:

I met this guy on Tinder back in May. (I know, Tinder is not the best place). Anyway, so I started talking to him the day before I left my college town to go home for the summer. He remained in our college town and I went home for the summer, six hours away. We initially wouldn't talk a lot but as the summer progressed, so did our relationship. We started talking every day, texting, and then talking for hours on the phone. We talked about our feelings and decided we liked each other. We agreed to be open to seeing where this would go whenever I got back in August. However, a week before I got back to my college town, he informed me he had met someone else and didn't want to continue things with me. I was very upset but eventually got over it. We didn't speak for the Fall semester.

Fast forward to the beginning of March. I get a text from him. He initiates conversation and I decide to reply. We talk for most of Friday and he suggests we hang out. We agree to meet up on Friday. We ended up drinking wine on the roof of our building (we live at the same apartment complex). We talked forever. The conversation was there. We laughed. We talked about what happened in the summer and decided it was a case of bad timing. It was going to well. We ended up going back to my apartment. We kissed, talked and we ended up having sex four times that night. I thought it was going great. He stayed the night with me and we talked until 4 am. The next morning we laid in bed for hours. He insisted on asking me about my past abusive and toxic relationship. He made it feel so easy and I opened up to him. I finally allowed myself to talk about my ex, which I never do. I got emotional. I opened up. He acted like he understood and said he couldn't believe someone would treat me like that. We went to lunch. Came back to my place. Had sex again. Made dinner together and he ended up sleeping over again. I thought everything was great. I felt like I found something with him. I didn't think having sex was wrong because I truly did feel a connection. He even said we had a connection and assured me it wasn't a hookup. I was on cloud nine.

The morning after our second sleepover, I left to work and he stayed in bed. During the day, we didn't talk. The rest of the week was weird. He would take ten hours to respond to me until he stopped opening my messages altogether. I asked him if everything was okay and he just assured me he was busy. I felt like he didn't want to talk to me but tried to believe him anyway. Finally, he stopped talking to me altogether. I was hurt and confused. I messaged him on Thursday and asked him what happened. I told him I was confused given our good weekend. He never replied.

Now I feel horrible. I feel awful that he didn't even give me the time of day to reply to my text. It feels like he used me and used my vulnerabilities against me. I don't know what to do now. Part of me wanted to text again and say he was an asshole but I know that's just me acting out on the hurt emotions.

Is this normal? What did I do wrong? Should I reach out again? I don't understand. I am hurt, confused and I feel used.",23Mar2020,1

I really tried to help him because I care so much about him, for me he’s is precious, a gem. But his mood swings take the best of him and he’s not looking to be better or make a change and all that situation together drained all my energy.

214,"I was playing Minecraft earlier to waste time during quarantine. It was really fun, and I was actually pretty happy and entertained for once. I was working on a home for my fox, and I’m thinking about getting him a friend. I repopulated my entire island with colorful sheep, cows, pigs, and chickens. I made a giant pen for my three horses, even adding a little pond and a structure for shade, and bonemeal-ed the entire area so there was some biodiversity. I let my fox out in the mornings for some (supervised) time out of the house. I absolutely lost it when I saw a wolf chase after a fox kit and ended up killing it (which I felt super guilty for, but I was happy the fox kit got to its parents). I live completely off of fishing and my farm for food because I want to keep my animal population big and allow them to be happy since I used to keep them in small, fenced-in areas. I even breed random rabbits I find, just because I like having them around. My house is surrounded by bee nests, all of which are undisturbed. I added steps to and removed any areas where animals could drown in all the ponds around me. I guided all lost baby animals back to the adults.  

While I was doing all of that, I had this moment where I stopped and just got really embarrassed. I felt like such an idiot for caring about animals that don’t exist and have no emotions. I felt like such a stupid little baby, because who else would worry about animals that don’t have feelings and don’t exist? That are just AIs with no needs or personality. I thought about the fact I did the same thing with my horse in RDR2 (and yes, I cried insanely hard at the end). I spent BANK on my horse and treated it like it was my child.

I ended up closing Minecraft and just crying a little bit while thinking about how stupid I am. Any idea on why I felt like that, or if I was right about me being an idiot for caring about virtual creatures?",23Mar2020,1

223,"Note: Some of these are going to seem, and possibly be, contradictory. I'm sorry but that's just how crappy it is.

[[I. I don't really care about anyone in my family.]]

I won't lie, I don't. It's not that they're terrible (They have their flaws, and I can think of many occasions where my parents' idea of parenting, while almost certainly (99.5%) not abusive, was rather lackluster.) it's just that I feel nothing for them, despite the plethora of good things they have done for me. So far I just feel guilty about not loving them (mostly about not loving my mom, lesser for my dad, nothing for my siblings). I don't hate them, sometimes I might be angry with them over them micromanaging my life, but that's it. I also have felt love for other people, so it's not that I am a (complete) psychopath. I would like to be able to learn how to more love my family (especially my parents) but while in secret.

With that out of the way,

[[II. I don't want to live in my parents' house.]]

I know what I said earlier, but I don't want to live with my parents. I have moved out for college back in late August, and I have enjoyed my time there with my new independence (in a rather loose sense of the term, as I am heavily reliant on my parents financially speaking). However, due to the virus that needs no introduction, my school has converted to online classes, making my living ""away"" meaningless in the eyes of my parents. While I came down to visit this last week for Spring Break, on the last day of that trip, my dad spoke discouragingly to my brother of my new town saying it has nothing for him (and me by extension) and how he should stay. Worse off, on the final day of that visit, my brother and my mom had a discussion (without me being involved) about me staying for a quarter of my time during the online school phase (4 days for every twelve), which was after we had a compromise. My mom isn't really making me do it by any means, but she's still my mom and I have trouble saying no to her on stuff like this.

The main reason I can't stand this is that I have my own form of autonomy in my new town, despite my financial state. I get to make my own decisions without their permission. They usually give me their permission to do what I want at their house, but in my town, I only need my permission. And this autonomy also frees me from when they want to micromanage my life, like how my beard should look, how I act, etc. This isn't true when I live a considerable amount of time with my parents.

Also:

* My recent visit (earlier this week) was five days, I only had three days to rest back at home, and the visit I'm in now is five days, and I'm afraid that because I couldn't acclimate back to my home long enough, I'll start subconsciously thinking my parents' house is my home when it isn't.
* I've always wanted to live outside of my hometown, and in my new town specifically.
* I don't know if this can snowball to them wanting me to live near them, especially since their house was next to my grandmother's when she was alive and I'm pretty sure my mom visits my grandma so little due to her living on the other side of the country.
* I want to have a job in my new town, and being gone so often will be an issue.
* The utilities at my house are better than my parents'.
* I don't want to complicate dating, especially if my parents don't like her.

I can grab a knife and with one motion end it in 2 seconds flat. I don't wanna die. I just want people to take me seriously when I ask for help. And I feel like they won't unless I do something drastic.

I know why no one helps me. No one likes to solve a hard problem if they don't have to. I can't find a surface hard enough to smash my head on without making much noise. I probably sound like an attention seeking brat but I don't care. If I had a knife in my hand I'd cut. Carefully choosing where it would look natural. Last time it was my finger. The scar looks like it's part of my natural skin. 

My main reason to live is my sister. Yet people say I don't love her every day. People say I'm a terrible sister because i don't know how to play with her. People say I shouldnt play with her because it always ends in fights. If I didn't love her I'd be that much closer to death. I've seen posts on here saying they are tired of the therapy. That they are sick of the hospitals. That they wouldn't stand for another pill. They don't understand what it's like to be told ""oh you don't need medication."" ""Oh your fine."" IM NOT. I'm so bad that no one wants to stay by my side when i say what goes through my head.

No one will care when they read this. I know. No one will know how to help. No one will try and help because they don't have to. So if your gonna upvote it, thanks i guess more publicly. If your gonna down vote, good for you, you helped stop my post from getting seen by some people.",23Mar2020,1
232,I'm 3 years into university and i started as a business accounting major then switched 2 semesters ago to interior architecture but I'm not doing well in school and I don't have anything more than mild interest in anything.

How do I end this in a way where she won’t get hurt? Do I try and distant myself over text? Do i ignore her in general? I only got a couple more weeks till school starts again cuz of Corona so plz y’all help me out lol

236,"Before I begin I want to explain my current situation a bit better, I currently live with my mother in room, in a house that is owned by a friend of hers, and last year was mixed with good and bad things that happened to me, I lost my dog who was 14 years old and it was one of the most painful things I had to deal with, but I was in a relationship where I felt a lot of love and companionship from, it was lasting for over two years and I had a lot of hope that we could build a future together, so my at the time girlfriend helped me a lot to overcome my loss, and I got a job in the middle of the year, sadly it lasted only 3 months but it was something, but it gave me a bit of a safe ground to atleast celebrate with her by going to a restaurant and spending time together, so I thought ""Well, this year was mixed, but I have a lot of hope that next year will get better"".

First day of this year, she broke up with me, with the excuse of ""I think we have to follow our own separate ways"", that broke me, I was planning a lot of things with that girl, she practicaly gave me reasons to keep going in life and pursue a better life and even think about creating a family with her, but all of that went down the trash in the blink of an eye, I'm still unemployed and no signs of jobs showing up anytime soon, and now with the corona virus spreading, I'm forced to stay at home with that person I said above, who is the most arrogant, selfish being I've ever known who literaly complains about everything that's out of place in the house (She is the owner of the house, and me and my mother have to share a room in because we can't afford a place of our own yet), sometimes I think ""how did all of this happen? Do I even deserve to be happy? My love left me and now this? When this nightmare will end?""  And due to this quarantine, I have to stay at home every day, forced to deal with all of this crap.

The result, I'm stuck at home, I feel  stressed out everyday, my chest hurts because of all the anxiety I feel, I'm forced to swallow all of the criticism, harsh comments and arrogant behavior that the owner of the house does everyday, if I respond or defend myself it will only get worse, I feel alone since my ex left me and I have no real life friends to talk to, atleast via message, with that level of intimacy to talk about my problems, and I can't vent out or find something to take my stress out, and if I talk to my mother about my problems, she starts to cry and blame herself for all the things I'm going through so it's pointless, what should I do in this situation?",23Mar2020,1

239,"here’s my daily dose of tea that pisses me off so if you have some time read it and tell me if I’m in the wrong cuz I’m salty as fuck lmfao

My boyfriend and I dated for like 9 ish months. All was good but in early January I gradually started to lose feelings for him. Things were getting tense, I had to force myself to stay and I always tried to convince myself I still had feelings but it got draining. The relationship got boring. 
He has very bad anxiety and can be very manipulative and blames EVERYTHING on anxiety. Like I remember one time I was going through bad mental health troubles and he freaked the fuck out when I told him I wanted to go on a break because he can’t lose me and blah blah blah and that he can help me. Which he didn’t lol but he was super manipulative and I remember all my friends telling me that was a huge red flag. 

I remember another time when I slept over at my best friends house and I slept in the same bed as her and he got genuinely mad at me. 

Then another time I remember I was talking to him about how excited I am for my vacation and he basically said that I shouldn’t be excited because I’m not gonna be able to talk to him(no service at the place) 

also I didn’t see him much anyways and 99% of the time we were just having sex and it was draining. our whole relationship was just us having sex, and half the time I just wasn’t even into it and just faked it. Like I remember on my birthday I told him I didn’t want to have sex on that day, because I really wasn’t in the mood. Then throughout the day he was making sex jokes to me and it made me uncomfortable, and then he was like “sorry it’s making you uncomfortable it’s just I’m still blue balled from last night( cuz we had sex the night prior but he didn’t finish ) and essentially was asking if we could fuck and I’m like bro you have a hand what the fuck but I ended up agreeing even though I didn’t want to. Then also not to mention when I was having an eating disorder issue this man literally told me once “jesus Christ just eat “I never forgot that.
It got boring and I eventually had lost all feelings for him and I decided I can’t lead him on, so I broke up with him. Also not to mention he asked offered to be friends with benefits a couple minutes after I broke up with him :/ so lovely

Mind you, I was going to break up with him either way. Whether or not this new guy came in the picture. I started having feelings for my best friend before the breakup. And it killed me. I couldn’t sleep some nights because of how much it bothered me and how horrible I felt. But I never acted upon it. He seemed to be a perfect match for me, he could emotionally support me, I can see him every day, he’s very mature, my parents trust him a lot, he’s very smart, super cute and hot lol and he’s very kind. He genuinely shows so much care for me it’s crazy lmao. We’ve been best friends for a long time and we have ties or we get annoyed and we bicker at each other but it usually is resolved pretty quickly but we’re always there for each other and we’ve seen the worst and best of each other emotionally.

Long story short I was like shit I’m not going to stay in this relationship anymore. I don’t have any feelings for my (now ex) bf, and I am really starting to like this guy. And I was almost certain he felt the same . So I wasn’t going to a.) cheat b.) lead my ex on. So I ended it. We were good for a while and I’ve just been fucking with him on imessage out of boredom the past few days. But we were on speaking terms and all was good. 

I ended up asking this guy out and it is amazing and I simply couldn’t ask for a better relationship. I’ve seen him more since I started dating him than I’ve seen my ex in 2 months lol. It’s great and I’m very happy and so is he. My friends and parents are super happy for me and have been super supportive for all of this. 

I was messing w my ex last night as a joke and I called him and we catched up on some stuff And he asked me what’s new. I said not much. I wasn’t going to tell him I had a bf cuz 1.) not really his business 2.) didn’t want to hurt him. Last night I posted a picture on my VSCO of my bf kissing me on the cheek cuz all my close friends are on my vsco and they all know I’m dating my current bf. I honestly forgot my ex had vsco and I didn’t even think he’d see it. 

Then today I was talking to my bf and I get a text saying “did you leave me for that guy lmao” and I was honest and I said yes and no. Yes because I did have feelings for this guy, but no because I was going to end the relationship either way.  He told me “that’s fucking shallow.” What, shallow I didn’t want to lead you on and like someone else while we were dating? I thought that was stupid lmao but whatever. Then he said “explain” and I’m like lol I don’t have any explaining to do we’re not dating and I don’t have to tell you shit lol. Then he sent this

“**Thanks for the closure. I now know what happened and I want nothing to do with you. Please don’t stalk me, and don’t call me again. I’m no longer a friend and I’m no longer putting up with finding out new things you’ve been hiding. Thanks for becoming the person you said you never would be. You’re a horrible person (then put my name), and I hope he breaks your heart”** 

Like what the fuck am I really that horrible through all this? It’s not like I cheated lmfao and like wtf am I hiding like it’s not his business. And I’m kind of scared he’s going to start telling people that I was a cheater or some thing because he’s an overdramatic guy. Am I the asshole?",23Mar2020,1

My husband does very well at work but we have student loans so his job basically covers all of our basics + a little extra.  I work two half days a week in banking.  I’ve worked there for years and have made a name for myself there, made friends, and am making more than any other banker I know.  However I only work around 10 hours a week so it’s really not much.  Lately I’ve been feeling uneasy about my job and now with the Coronavirus stuff I’m having panic attacks going into work.  Customers cough directly on us and laugh. People make rude comments, and I work shoulder to shoulder with my coworkers. 

My parents and husband are high risk, and I have one young child at home.

Am I taking this too far? Should I not make this rash decision?  My husband supports me either way but says he is worried about our loss of income...  and is worried about me as well.  

I had such a bad panic attack today that I couldn’t breathe and had to lay down to calm myself, and then I was wondering if I had the virus or if I was having a panic attack I’m literally driving myself insane.

So for the most part everything is closed, restaurants can do take out only. So they’re enforcing these rules tomorrow w state police etc- 

QUESTION : I work at a daycare for dogs - I do not consider that essential BUT through an agricultural loophole they say they can stay open - I love my job with all my heart but given how much is unknown about the corona virus and it’s transmission, plus how the infection rate it doubling almost daily here Part of me really does not want to go in. I’ve been sheltering in place past four days due to just happening to have off from a request. I would be in contact with people when getting their dogs from them, and touching leashes/belongings they bring along. Obviously I would practice good hygiene but I don’t know how I feel about this. I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic or if I should play it safe. If I choose to bring it up to my work and request to not come in at least for the last 7 days of the government issued mandate I may be frowned upon.

I can’t seem to figure out if I’m only becoming this quiet person to keep myself grounded and to be a version of myself that my family would accept (I come from a v conservative family).

I feel like how am I supposed to ever discover my true genuine self if I’m constantly so persuaded by people that I use it as a basis of who to be.Almost like my actions/personality depend on the people around me.

256,"Hi, this is actually my first time posting something about my life but I really need help here and hopefully someone can shed some light in my situation. 

I had a really messy childhood with a lot of violence, and then I quit high school because I got really messed up psychologically (apparently doing drugs when you have childhood traumas isn't the best of ideas), after that I stayed home because I couldn't really go outside without having panic attacks for a couple of years while I sorted that situation out. Eventually I did sort it out and nowadays I just live alongside my dissociation with no problems. 

Now the thing is, I always pursued art, and I thought that was what I was going to do career wise, and everyone kept reassuring me of it, I even went to a couple art events and met a lot of people in the digital art industry, got tons of good advice, but I can't find a job. I'm 26 right now and never actually had an art related job, I sent applications weekly for years with no avail, I even tried fiverr, up work etc. . I don't know what I'm doing wrong either, just for context here's [my stuff](http://instagram.com/robinvieart). I refuse to believe I'm that bad that I can't get a single commission or low paying job, I can't even get those 10 buck commissions on deviant art. I'm so embarrassed about it that I actually plain out lie when people ask me about it.

This year I got a job at a call center and stopped painting because of it (I really have no time to do both things, I draw a bit on paper during work but that's it) and I just have so much more energy, I met new people, I go out with them, and now I'm wondering, is it even worth  to keep trying to follow my dream? I always criticised people that didn't and fell into a regular job giving up all their dreams in the process, but now I kinda understand why they did it and see the appeal.

He pressures me about adding him to the groupchats with my friends and I, and when I say no, he says that he will text using my account, posing as me.

259,"Reddit; I went on a date with a guy yesterday; we maintained social distancing, walked five-six feet apart, just elbow bumped grabbed coffee and kept walking (now I think it wasnt the best thing to have done)
Anywho so this guy, looked exactly like he was in his profile so interms of appearance there wasn't any red flags; BUT..... In all that two hours we walked, he only spoke about himself, I would interrupt once in a while to say something but he wouldn't even pay attention and continued speaking about himself, he also started the date by speaking about his exe's ( I am of the same race as his former ex's). It was okay when he said one or two lines, but it went to a point where he went on and on. Anywho, coming back to him speaking about himself 90% of the conversation was about his work, he rambled on and on and it was boring me to death. I am usually a chit chatty person but he clearly beat me here lol 
Towards the end of the date I told him I need to leave and he himself said how he spoke so much to which I jokingly said ""yeah you didn't ask me a single question"" he was like "" I am not going to get a second date"" to which I said ""No that's not it, I seem to think you are very passionate about what you do and you really like your job"". So I didn't  exactly end it on a negative note.

BUT, he hasn't really written back to me or said a single word on the app after the date (during the date he kept mentioning about a second date that was before I pointed out he hasn't asked me a single word) I was atleast expecting him to apologise for totally consuming the date with his work stories and perhaps ask me on a second date I was going to give him a second chance.",23Mar2020,1
260,"Hey, this is a bit of a tricky situation and I genuinely don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been in love with my best friend for 2 years, I told her my feelings about 9 months ago and it’s quite difficult to maintain the friendship as she doesn’t feel the same way, but we also both care and love each other (in a friendship way) so much that after a few weeks without speaking, we’re back to being best friends. 

This leads on to this weekend, we are all at a house party of about 30 people, mates from my group (with my best friend) as well as friends from my other group of friends. We go back to my house to kick on, where I find out my best friend hooked up with one of my mates from the other group. 

Now he has a girlfriend, at the time she didn’t know, and while I was upset she hooked up with him it’s really not that big of a deal. I told her he had a girlfriend and she seemed upset about that too (we were all obviously very drunk and etc too). 

My friend that she hooked up with also came to my house to kick on with us an hour later. Now I was very drunk and didn’t realise it, but they continued to hook up at my place when I walked into another room and saw them. This hurt a lot and I walked out visibly hurt. A little bit of time passes by and my friend (guy friend) comes up to me and asks me if I have condoms. Now this won’t make sense unless I explain I had a lot of ketamine at the time (dissociative drug) and was very confused at that specific moment in time. I thought he was getting them for somebody else and nothing had clicked yet. I went to my room to get them when my best friend walked in. 

She said to me that she had something to tell me, and that out of respect for me she wouldn’t be doing it here. Me (still very k’d) didn’t realise what was going on until she asked me if I would rather her be safe with protection. My gut sank and everything clicked to me at that moment and honestly I was in shock that the condoms were for them. Mind you, she’s never had a one night stand in her entire life (we are both 24). The combination of being at my house, with my friend and the fact that she knew he had a girlfriend has just messed me up really bad. 

Now I have no right to say who she can and can’t sleep with and she doesn’t owe me anything, but considering the circumstances of knowing my feelings for her, being at my house and being with my friend, I genuinely felt very upset and in shock. 

They both left to do whatever they did, I went to sleep and the next morning she messaged me saying she had to speak to me. She came back to my house and started crying and told me how bad she feels, but she’s single and she can do what she wants and it’s hard because of my feelings for her, she doesn’t want to hurt me. 

While I agree with her, I still think in that certain situation what she did was not on, there’s a time and place to do it. 

I don’t want to speak to my friend that slept with her, he didn’t know of my feelings but he cheated on his girlfriend and I’m disappointed in him for that. He apologised when he found out but knowing what happened I can’t maintain the the friendship with him for now. 

My best friend and I have been a lot over the last couple of years, both seen each other at very low points and a lot of good moments and highs. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I feel likes she’s crossed the line and disrespected me. 

For now I’m not speaking to her, but I just don’t know whether it’s worth it to continue our friendship. We have the same group of friends and extended friends and it might be difficult to cut her out. I’m going to give it 2 weeks at least to think about it and decide whah to do from there. 

Basically the advice I need is, am I over reacting? Should I have done what’s best for me earlier and cut her out when I got feelings initially? And should I cut her off now after what’s happened?

This has happened ever since I started jacking off, if I get kinda close to busting a nut but refrain I will involuntary get like a half nut, I don’t jizz anything besides pre cum and what it does for me is makes me stop for like 10 seconds then I get right back to it. Thing is this shit happens like every 15 seconds if I let it I don’t know if I’ve been edging myself or something this whole time or what but I’m just worried it’s either unhealthy or it’ll fuck me up when I’m fucking a girl since I could keep going right after it but it wouldn’t be enjoyable for me until I “recharge”. Also they’re more intense the closer I am to busting if I’m not very close a super subtle one will happen if I’m super close something very close to a real orgasm will happen.

263,"I trust my fiance completely. We're both in college and live together. However we go to different schools. She has new friends that I'm happy that she has. In fact I really wanted her to make new friends. The only thing I've noticed is that she avoided mentioning me entirely to them. So much so that her new friend actually confessed feelings for her. She's still remains his friend and I've never been controlling so I told her that she can do what ever she wants to. 

I'm just curious, maybe I'm over thinking this? I'm extremely open and proud when talking to people about my engagement. I love talking about her and brining her up. But on her side, I feel as if I'm a secret. I've tried talking to her about it and she's told me that it's different between a guy and a girl. She says a guy isn't defined by her realtionship but she says that when she says she's engaged, people look at her differently and some don't even want to bebher friend. She says she wants to be viewed as an individual.

My views are opposite in some sense. I love the fact that I'm engaged and I'm in a happy relationship.

Also She's lost her engagement ring at the beach one day, so it's easier to not bring up our engagement in that sense. 

Idk, I could get over feeling weird about it. But I'm conflicted, should I feel weird or should I not.",23Mar2020,1
264,"I’m not quite vibing with my fwb. The first time we tried to have sex. Couldn’t get it up because my house was crowd and my literal entire family was in my living room killing my mood. At first I was ready to do it but with all the noise and my walls being almost paper thin so you could hear everything it just wasn’t happening.

Ok so how about the next time? Well my FWB takes a minute to get in the mood. She likes to grind a lot. She also seems like she doesn’t want it sometimes so I just hold her. Then after an hour or two she’s in the mood. While I’m exhausted and desensitize from all the grindin.

267,"This is the same guy that’s brothers with the guy I was in a long distance relationship with in my last post. I haven’t talked to him in months so I’ve decided I’m done with him. Anyways, his older brother is roommates with me and it’s just us two in the apartment. We constantly fight and argue about almost everything at this point. We’ve also only lived in the apartment together for one month now and our lease is for at least a year.

I have a mental disorder (OCD) and I have to check things in the apartment to make sure they’re “perfect” and organized a certain way. This has bothered everyone I’ve lived with, which I completely understand. He was understanding about it at first, but now he’s being a jerk. 

What makes me feel like he’s manipulating me is because he tells/promises me that he’s going to purchase me a new phone, new clothes, etc but when he’s angry with me and we argue he then says he’s not going to do that stuff for me anymore. I actually don’t need these things, at least not at the moment. But he insists on getting me stuff because as he says he is a “man of his word.” But when we fight he takes back everything he said. He does this continuously.

He’s verbally abusive too. We had a really big fight the other night, he said he didn’t care about me and said he hasn’t for weeks. Which is the same time frame that we moved in together. He said he didn’t feel bad. He said he wouldn’t help me anymore, etc. He mocked me and laughed at me. And then once I started crying after screaming at him cause of how upset I was, he proceeded to try and wipe my tears away and said it upsets him when I cry. I, of course, didn’t want him near me, let alone touching me. Which then he’s annoyed at me for not letting him touch me. 

We fight a lot and it stressing me out. It’s almost everyday and I don’t know how I can last a year with him. At this point he gets upset with me about eating all the chips or not taking getting a tattoo with him seriously as he said today (we had an argument today as well) I’m shaking from nervousness to even come home. One reason because of the OCD and what would be moved in the house that I’ll have to fix. I’m afraid he’s moved things on purpose out of spite, to hurt my feelings. He’s said that the reason he says these things to me is out of spite because he’s angry, as if it’s okay.

I’m also afraid to come home because I don’t want to argue with him. But I’m really upset by how he’s treating me so I come home with an attitude and don’t really want to talk to him so then he gets mad and argues. I’ve told him multiple times that after we’re done fighting I want to be left alone and not be bothered by him, but he talks to/bothers me anyways. And again, is annoyed by me not wanting to talk. Afterwards, he says he loves and cares about me and doesn’t like upsetting me and fighting. But then it happens again.

Is he manipulative? Is this verbal abuse? I don’t have anywhere else to go, so I feel like I have to just deal with it for now until the lease is up. What should I do in the meantime?

[UPDATE]: we had a huge fight tonight when I got home from work. He didn’t like the fact that the snacks I got from work were ones he didn’t eat. And the snack he did eat wasn’t a big enough bag. I got upset with him because it seems like nothing is ever good enough. I was using his card to buy everything and he had a budget so I was trying to save his money. And so I said fuck you and he screams at the top of his lungs at me. 

He is also called me psycho, a lunatic, crazy. He said i was the stupidest person he’s ever met. He says stuff like this too me all the time. When I called my mom he then completely switched what he said to me. He lied so he didn’t look bad and when I called him out on it I was a liar. Now he wants me to move to Portland with him. I don’t want to live there, but he “promised” it would only be for 2-3 months and then we’d live in Los Angeles. But I have a feeling we’d end up staying there. 

It seems like my mom doesn’t care at all either. She only cares about having to deal with my furniture and moving it. Also, is worried about getting fucked over with the apartment (she works in the apartment community service). She doesn’t seem to care about my living conditions. I don’t know who to call, where to go? I have nothing at this point. What should I do?",23Mar2020,1

I am terrified of making women uncomfortable. I go out of my way to not be seen as creep.

Things I do
- try to avoid interaction as much as possible 
- keep my distance
- call women bro or dude just so they know I won’t hit on them. 
- try to avoid eye contact as much as possible

I go so far out of my way to not not be seen as creepy that I am 21 and I have never even approached or asked a girl out. Out of the fear that I may make them uncomfortable. 

But don’t know I might just be really socially awkward and it’s probably unhealthy to have this toxic mindset. I don’t know I think it might be my anxiety but I’m not sure.

269,"This is going to be long. Not everything gonna be on order because it's too much info for me to organize correctly, but i'll do my best.  


Necessary background about her;  
She (19F) comes from a family that thinks she's a kid. She can't do anything at home (like cooking) without her mom being picky with her. Every wrong move she does, her mom yells at her. Everything she does, her mom complains about. Even when the fucking woman has asked my gf to do the thing. She can't leave her feet. It's always making sarcastic comments about her, and she's very, VERY, controlling with my GF.  


Now, to the problem:  
I'm getting stressed ALL the time with my GF. I don't have fun anymore being with her. I feel like she's a child all the time.  
She doesn't pay attention to the things she's doing (something we talked about and she's working on). She is a very slow learner, and, for real, I really HATE using this expression, but many times I think she's plain DUMB. Like, she can't understand a thing. She's VERY slow and for god's sake this bothers me a lot.  
She can't deal with her own emotional problems and is always venting to me. Always. Like, she haves BPD, and everytime she has a breakdown (like every two weeks) she comes to me crying and in panic. I want to support her, I want to help her, but EVERY FUCKING WEEK? I can't, I just CAN'T. I already have my own depression to take care of, which I'm doing very well for the last year, but the thing is, the way she talks about things is just making me feel very bad.  
Like, she's insecure AS FUCK. She complains about having no one, and if she wants to vent and at the time I just mentally can't, she goes to the twitter to post things like ""I'm a piece of shit, I really must be a trash"". And when she calms down she tells me that her mind tells her things like that. That her minds make she doubts the reality. That she have fear of being alone.  
Oh, yeah, and on the topic of being alone. She can't be alone. She demand from me attenttion constantly. Recently, I posted on my whatsapp status ""Sometimes I just need time to think"", and as she knows, everytime I get bad I really like to isolate myself for some time (not like a week, just one or two days, sometimes just some hours). She come to me (mind you I didn't said anything to her) and said that she understands me and will give me space to think. I said that I appreciate it. Not even ten minutes after that, I open my twitter to see she posting ""Do I really think in a wrong way?""  


She doesn't have anything to do. We talked about it and sorted that she really needs a hobby. She got back to drawings, started playing some games. But, some time ago she said she does it so she doesn't have time to think. She does it because she doesn't want to think. I don't think this is wrong, but she doesn't get any fun out of it (her words), she just do it to pass time. The only real thing I see she have fun doing is BEING WITH ME (?????????). She doesn't want to do anything with me, she just wants to BE with me. I like being with her but if I enable her we would be cuddling from 9AM to 23PM. I just can't. Sometimes we go watch some series or movies, but, or she doesn't understand, or she falls asleep, or she just don't focus on and take her phone to go see twitter.  


And the thing is. I'm getting stressed ALL the time around her. Every minor error she commits, it's like I feel a need to correct her. Because she's making mistakes on VERY basic things that every fucking human should know. Like dude I can't even walk on the street holding hands with her because when she's talking I need to pull her all the time otherwise she would be hitting everyone on the street. And for real, I already tested, if I don't pull her she really hits everyone around. Sometimes she would even make ME hit people. She get's angry because I'm slightly pushing her but she can't see that she's pushing me out of the sidewalk. She says she can't pay attention to more than one thing at the same time. Dude, I can't do it too. I'm really bad at multi-tasking. But for fucking God's sake I don't fall on everyone at the street when I'm talking to her and for fucking real she's the only person I have experienced that.  


It's like i'm policing her everytime. And she's getting very defensive. She says it's hard for her to open to someone, and that I'm the person she most trusts and that's why she always comes to me to vent, and that I'm making her feel insecure about saying something for me for fearing that I can get stressed. I'm holding this for months but she started noticing my stress only two weeks ago because the more the time pass the more I can't hold it. And she got sad because she noticed every move she does wrong I get angry, but it's like she does EVERYTHING WRONG. And I'm really feeling like her mom, or like my father that did the exactly same thing to me, of policing me and correcting me on everything. I just can't stop the feeling that she's dumb and she's a child. Like I need to take care of her all the time, I feel anxious about leaving her on her own doing things because everytime I did she just failed, and everytime she wants help, when I try to help her or teach her the very thing she wanted to know she just gets very defensive and angry at me.  


For an example about the ""dumb"" part; if she is going to make rice, I need to keep an eye on her to see if she's going to put the right amount of water on the rice because if I don't, no matter how many times she fails she'll always put the wrong amount. It's not like she's putting the way she likes, she admits that she's failing but SHE JUST CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. And this drives my anxiety to the limits, because I feel like I need to maintain an eye on her everytime she does something otherwise she'll keep doing stupid things.  


This post is an ask for help, and, a vent too.  


I really love this girl, and we don't have many problems on our relationship besides those things. Everytime something is bothering us we talk with each other about it. We are very open to each other and we always come to a conclusion and try to solve things. We think that communciation is the key so we use this a lot. I know she would do anything for me and I would do anything for her, so I really don't want to break up with this girl. It's just that thing that's fucking up our two and I'm trying my best to stop being stressed around her but it's hard.

There's more that I don't remember right now. You guys can ask anything and I'll be answering. Please, don't think about me as an asshole. I know that maybe I am, I'm just trying to see what I am doing wrong here, I need to know what am I thinking wrong. Everytime I read what I'm writting here I feel like a manipulative asshole. I just need help to know what i'm missing here. If i'm being this manipulative asshole, I don't want to be, I want to be a good man to her, and I just need to know what's wrong with my thought pattern.",23Mar2020,1

272,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I met him my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break, he invited me to pregame with his friends (which has never happened during our 2 years of being friends). First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that.

Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. On our last day of college, he asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",23Mar2020,1
273,"In my country the law states that a parent must pay child maintenance until the age of 18. However, the parent has to continue making payments if the child remains in education and is unable to support themselves. 

I am European but live in the UK. My parents divorced when I was really young. I live with my mum and haven't really been in contact with my dad. From what I remember the last time we spoke was on my 13th birthday so it has been more than 5 years. I received a really lovely message from him, I can only describe it as what an incel who got lucky that one time would write to their 13 year old daughter. I won't go into details because it's not relevant, I am just trying to make it really clear that our relationship isn't good.

6 months after I became 18 I received a message from him on Facebook. He simply stated that unless I provide him with proof that I'm in education, he will stop paying child maintenance. I provided him with the documentation while he just acted like a rude twat. 

My countries law also states that since I am an adult now, the money has to go directly to me. I only have a English bank account and I can not make one in my country since I don't live there. If the payments go onto my English account they will be significantly lower. My father only pays £120 each month so it's not much. Because of the exchange rate I would get even less. However, my mum did make me an offer that she was and is quiet  adamant about. Her offer was that the payments could continue going into her European account and that she would give me £120 each month. I suppose this may sound great but I don't believe I can trust her.

I will explain why, we had an agreement that she would give me the child benefits she gets for me because I go to college and from that I would pay her back for my internet/data bill. (Child benefit = about £60 while my internet bill is usually about £20.)  Lets just say that she hasn't been doing that and when I try to talk to her about it she gets irritated. She suggested this in the first place.

Today she brought about the topic of my child maintenance and I told her that I just need to create and sign the document instructing him to pay money into my account. I also gently mentioned that he would pay the money into her account and that she would give the money to me in cash just like she suggested a few days ago. 

She didn't like that and got quiet mad. It was pretty clear that she didn't like the part about having to give me my money. 

I'm not quiet sure what to do.  On one hand I can definitively get some of my money. On the other, I can take my chances and get all of it or none of it. The first option does sound more appealing but I'm not sure how she will react to it and I'm not inserted in drama.  

Which option should I pick? How should I go about it? Any tips and has anyone else been in this situation before? 

&amp;#x200B;

Extra context:

\-I'm 18, I don't pay rent or for any of the bills. Instead I baby sit my younger sibling (huge age gap) for at least 20 hours each week . I will move out when I will be 19. I would have done it at 18 but I needed to take a year off (not my fault) 

\-I'm a full time college student and don't have the time to work, that £120 per month would make a significant difference to me. I own two cats and take care of them financially and it would just allow me to improve my life quality by allowing me to buy new clothes and to have some fun from time to time.",23Mar2020,1
274,"My senior year of high school, when I was 18 and they were 18-19, this group of friends who I’d been very, very close with starting in 2nd grade stopped being my friends. They left me because I had kissed the crush of one of them - however the girl whose crush it was gave me permission to hook up with him. The next day, one of them screamed at me and threatened me, so I left the house. After, I would hang out with all of them except for the girl who yelled at me after the incident, and they’d promised I could go to senior prom with them but later changed their minds to please the girl that yelled at me. I went to senior prom alone, and at graduation I walked with my twin and not one of them, like we had been planning since our freshman year.

It really, really fucked up my ability to make friends, even four years later. I have a really hard time with trusting people, especially girls, because of them.

Last year, one of the girls got married. She invited me to go to her wedding, but I didn’t because all of the other girls were her bridesmaids and it would’ve been too painful to see them. 

I think it’s becoming an issue again because A) with the social distancing because of COVID-19, I’ve realized how little close friends I have now and feel like I burden my boyfriend because I’ve been incredibly lonely, and B) one of those girls - specifically the one who yelled at me and kicked me out of he group- is getting married at the end of 2020. Her stuff keeps popping up on my Facebook because we still have a lot of mutual friends.

I’m so deeply hurt that they cut me out of their lives and didn’t allow me to grow into adulthood with them, let alone apologize for how they treated me. Two days ago I had severe anxiety attacks all day and was crying for most of the day because of a nightmare I had about them, which consisted of them leaving me all over again. My boyfriend, who was trying his hardest to support me, suggested I reach out to them one last time to tell them how I feel, just to get it off my chest.

I don’t know if that’s a good idea, and unfortunately my therapist has been really ill and isn’t in contact at the moment, so I can’t ask her what to do.

I’ve been thinking about this shit nonstop and it hurts so, so much. Is reaching out to them individually a good idea? Is there something else I can do to temporarily make myself feel better, until I’m in contact with my therapist again?

then my best friend met a new friend. she introduced me to her. i thought she was nice. i ask the simple questions where she met her this and that. it was no problem. my best friend told me 'dont worry i wont replace you like you replaced me with your dumb boyfriend'  but i wasn't worried. a few months later i found out that my best friends new friend was talking bad about me. my best friend confessed to me that she never liked me and she was telling her bad things about me. the thing that bothered me is i was actually nice to this girl. i never disrespected her. i thought she was a good person because we would have conversations sometimes. its hard to believe someone didnt't like me when in fact i dont know them. im like the nicest and generous person ever, i confronted her. i dont like fake people. and i dont tolerate anyone trying to talk crap about me when i did nothing. i dont like hanging around negative fake people. thats why my circle is small. we got into a argument. then my best friend stopped talking to her. i got into a argument with my best friend because she knew that girl didn't like me and i was actually being nice to someone who was talking shit about me. the conversations would have been different if i knew she was being fake and talking about me. the conversations would of been way different if i knew she didn't like me because i stay away from people like that. i wouldn't have wasted my time talking to someone like that. i forgave my friend. then a few months later she met another girl. this girl was friends with the previous person who didnt like me, i didnt know that. she too was talking bad about me to my friend and my best friend defended her. your best friend isnt suppose to be hanging around people who dont like you, thats how i see it. it plays with my trust. for one year we were arguing because of these new people she was associating herself with. i dont give anyone a reason not to like me. if your nice to me ill be nice to you. if you show me respect i give it in return. if you act fake with me then i cut you off. i act accordingly. of course i forgave my best friend. she lost contact with that other girl,

so then my best friend started to grow more angrier at the fact that im still with my boyfriend. when i got sick and was in the hospital i called my best friend. all she asked was when im planning to leave my boyfriend. i said never. she hung up on me and turned off her phone. then a few days later my best friend said she will start giving men her number so she could replace me. then my best friend said she met a guy. i said okay. good. she started saying she woke up one day and decided to find herself a boyfriend. then she said she found a guy at the supermarket. they got close. they love each other. she said she was planning to marry him and they talked about getting married. she kept saying the guy is  a hacker and he hacked google for her and put her name on google to show her that he loves her. she started telling me weird stories and asking for advice. i was very supportive. she expected me to get jealous but i never got jealous. she didnt like the advice i was giving her because i told her that she needs to stop taking her anger out on men. she said she made him cry. this and that. so one day i asked to see him. she kept making excuses. then she finally introduced me to a guy. but it turns out he was gay and she wasn't in a relationship. she was using him to try and get me jealous. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so my best friend said i cant have her or my boyfriend in my life i need to pick one. i didn't wanna pick. my boyfriend dont understand why she don't like him. they never had one real conversion. my boyfriend speaks Spanish only. he dont bring her up. he dont talk bad about her. he don't gossip. so then one day my best friend started becoming distance with me. she said she needs to forget about me. so we dont really speak anymore, the last time i spoke to her i explained i was sick and she didnt ask me if i was okay. it was just a quick hello and goodbye. then she started telling people lies saying she was never jealous of my boyfriend and im delusional like always and im making things up in my head. she said i need to get my head checked and i need help. 2 years later and we never spoke again. i dont feel bad for not leaving my boyfriend. he is still with me and we just had a 3 year anniversary together. do you think im wrong or she's wrong? sorry for the bad grammer.",23Mar2020,1
280,"I’ve been reading subreddits about ‘awakening’, and the idea of there being a global government that work in secret to rule the world through media, things like 9/11, assassinations etc. Reading it all has showed me that people in power are going to be more of a threat to this government. All I can think is that they will be targeted and manipulated, blackmailed, and threatened to do the bidding of those in power.

282,"Hey guys,

I'm an 18F who is considering doing double jaw surgery. The only functional benefit it would have is to help me close my lips naturally. Other than that, it would be 100% cosmetic. 

I definitely question my motives for wanting to do the surgery because I think I have body dysmorphia about my jaw. Whenever I meet someone, I try to avoid letting them see my side profile because I feel like my jaw looks awkward and gives me an odd resting face. I've tried to accept my jaw, but honestly I hate it and would love to not have an overbite anymore. 

Insurance will cover it, and I've already found a reputable orthodontist and surgeon who came up with my treatment plan. I just want to feel sure that this isn't going to be a decision I'll feel ashamed of in the future.",23Mar2020,1

284,"Ok please bare with me as I’ve got to fill you in on a backstory.

So at the beginning of February I (20M) match with this cute (21F) on tinder. She actually messaged me first about one of my pictures and it was nice to receive the first message...that’s besides the point. Ok so we talk for a little bit and eventually she asks for snap, and we continue the conversation on Snapchat. So after about a week or two of trying to get to know each other we start getting talking about our weekend. I was doing, probably nothing, and she went snowboarding. I thought it was pretty cool, and she (jokingly) invited me to come snowboarding the following weekend. I said yes, I’d be down. She thought I was also joking, until the Thursday before I asked what the plan was. She was a little surprised that I wasn’t joking, but she was cool with me tagging along. So I’ve never snowboarded before, and she knew that I would need some help trying to learn. So that Saturday we spend like 3 hours of me pathetically attempting to snowboard. Honestly, I’m still surprised I didn’t break anything. After lunch I told her that she could go do some of the bigger slopes with her, because we spent all morning with me falling on the bunny slopes while her roommates were actually hitting the slopes. So after we’re done we head back to her place (this is where we met because I live 90minutes away). We go up to her room and hang out and watch some movies. Things went pretty well that day. We mutually agreed that we’d hang out again in the weeks to come. So like 2 weeks later we make plans to hang out again, and although our plans of bowling got messed up because the bowling alley was closed, we still had a pretty good time. So as we’re making plans to hang out a 3rd time she tells me that she just wants to hang out and watch some movies after work. I’m ok with that because I want to see her, and I didn’t have anything better to do. Things went pretty well (or so I thought) and we said we’d see each other again in about a month or so. (We both had plans for the weekends already) That was about 3 weeks ago. On both the 2nd/3rd “dates” we made out a little, but didn’t go much further. Fast forward to last Thursday night. I’m up late doing some hw, and she’s up late cause she’s on break. We talking as usual and the she changes topics and we have the “Why are you on Tinder/what are you looking for?” conversation. We really hadn’t discussed anything like that, and at first I thought she just wanted to make sure that we were on the same page before things got serious. For probably 15 minutes I just sitting there answering her questions, and she tells me that she’ll let me ask her questions when she’s done, and that I shouldn’t worry. So after I’m done answering her questions I ask her what she’s looking for. She then proceeds to tell me that she was on tinder due to peer pressure from her roommates, and that she really just wants to focus on school and work right now. I ask her if she actually wanted to hang out all the times that we did, or if she was just being nice. She tells me that after our snowboarding outing she wanted to hang out to get to know me. We agreed that we haven’t hung out enough to get to know each other yet. She says she still wants to get to know me, but doesn’t want to be around people due to COVID-19, and that she really just wants to focus on school/work now that all her classes are online. She also brought up the fact that we are 90 minutes away from each other, which wasn’t a big issue before. I offer a solution of just being friends, and only hanging out once a month, or even once every two, but she turned me down. 

I’m trying to figure out why she all of a sudden felt this way, or if she’s been hiding it all along. Part of me feels like either A. I did something (without realizing it) that made her not want to see me again. Or B. She never really wanted to hang out and was just being nice. I’d honestly like to see her again or just be friends, but I’m not sure what to do (if anything). I’d like to figure something out, but I also don’t want to invade her privacy (or keep asking questions) after she told me that she “doesn’t want to continue this”. Any advice?",23Mar2020,1

We used to at least watch YouTube together when we ate but now we just drive to get food and bring it home and sit apart. We don’t really spend a whole lot of time together watching movies or anything anymore and I’m (f, 19) getting kind of bored.

291,"This is a topic I don’t like to discuss but I just don’t know what to do with this. Have gotten some great advice before but still feel horrible. 

I come from a competitor family unfortunately. It’s just this culture we have that is to out due everyone. Me and my brothers always beat everyone in the family. We all graduated college at 17. My brothers both became masters of engineers before the age of 21. 

However I just entered med school. I finished college for good at age 18 and began working in the medical field. It was really interesting that I started to write papers and try to get them published. I met new people. Learned stuff from them. Went to Europe. Enjoyed time with family and friends. So I ended up taking a year off from school and preparing for entrance exams. 

After the year I was advised to get my masters and began my masters at a good uni. So I took another year before finally applying to med schools. 

Well I’m 21 now and in med school and also my masters is going on online. It’s time consuming but enlightening 

I don’t tell anyone my age as I’m not that insanely ahead of everyone and don’t really care. However my relatives make me feel horrible. 

My cousin made fun of how “old” I was to begin med school. I told him it wasn’t a race but that I was doing other stuff. I told him there’s more to life than racing. 

He says I’m the “rut of the family” which is super harsh. My parents told me to ignore but I’m still fuming. 

Should I say something? How do I prove I’m not old.",23Mar2020,1
292,"There’s no easy way to put it or simplify this, and it feels silly that I’m hung up on it. What I’ve done is turn my crush into my best friend and now I can’t enjoy having either. We’re extremely close. So close that I thought we had something, but I was wrong. No boundaries were set and now I would say our relationship lays somewhere in between friend and more than. The trouble is that I tried to back off the whole “more than” part and explain why it pains me every time we act that way. But I was too worried that things would either come across wrong or he’d freak.

He is/was homophobic, but he has told me he’s over that. I’m not 100% sure that’s true though, and his family is rather homophobic on their own.

I’ve told him once before that I had a crush on him and he turned me down. But we kept getting closer. Things have never added up. It’s like we get so close to crossing that line only to back up before it’s too late to turn around.

It makes me angry that I’m in this situation. That I’m hung up on someone younger than I am, and that I allow it to happen because I feel like it’s going somewhere. 

Obviously I still want to talk to him about it, but being in quarantine we can’t meet up in person. There’s rarely a time at all that we get to be alone. Also the time apart makes me feel like it would be weird to bring up how he acts with me around him. I’m feeling pretty stuck where I’m at. And being how I am I can’t do anything else until I face the problem right in front of me. 

My questions to r/advice would be: 

What do I do?

Should I talk to him about it?

If so, how?

What would I even say to him?

Any advice is helpful and if you’d like more info on something just ask and I’ll do my best to fill you in. Thank you.",23Mar2020,1
293,"Backstory: this last summer I moved in with my dad. )I was 17.5yrs old) just before my 18th birthday half a year back, my dad majorly screwed up and I told him to get out of my life for good. Further back in time my dad did some shady things and has a ton of shady connections and a few legitimate ones. In the since if he wanted to find someone, he could very easily. 

The story: I was just in Vegas last week for 311 day. I was staying of the strip with a band, I am friends with and work with. My sister knew I was in town and knows my view of my dad and understanding why agreed to not tell him I was in town (when this thing came to light I called her and she told me, she never told him I was in town). Saturday or Sunday, he called my mom and told her “I know u/ caffeinatedmess was in Vegas this week for a huge event and isn’t staying on the strip. I hope she is staying safe and is being careful. I want to talk to her sometime”. He knows what he did and he knows he not only burned his bridge with me, but his bridge with his mom. 

I’m now anxious because I was staying with a band and if he finds out I was with them, I don’t want them in the middle of this problem. He told me during the summer that even if I tried to disappear, he could always find me. I care about the people I stayed with and I plan to be back in Vegas after Covid-Quarantine, to work with them and for another job.  I just don’t know what to do or how to get him out of my life for good. And advice is welcome. Should I tell the band and how much should I tell them? How should I got about further trips? 

TLDR; my dad burned his bridge with me, but he also has the ability to find me even if I disappeared off the earth and he found out I was in the town he lived recently and knows I didn’t stay in town and keeps contacting my mom to get a hold of me. What should I do?",23Mar2020,1
294," 

I have met a new guy (he lives in another state) and we've grown quite fond of each other, he's an AMAZING man. Just recently he went away for about a week, and I wasn't sure why. He messaged me last night and told me he has depression. I messaged him last night saying ""I'm very sorry you're going through this. I'm here for you if you ever need anything, I'll be here to listen &lt;3"" He did say ""It's hard for me to reach out again when I get like this""

Now I don't have experience with someone who has depression, so I'm asking:

How can I be there for him?

Should I let him come to me?

Should I text him to check in every day? (or is that smothering?)

What should I text him?

I shared a silly picture of myself that I’m not like scared about getting out that much, I was able to laugh and joke about it but the way that my friends banded with him and didn’t stick up for me after he said so many hateful things about me and turned all of my jokes and anything I said against me to make my friends dislike me, they all fell for it. 

They are almost blaming me for it, what else can I do when someone is saying so many downright hateful things about me for no reason, when I asked him why he is doing this he says because I started it, and I have no recollection of myself ever being rude to him since I met him.


I talked to my female friend the one that likes him, and she’s upset we are always fighting even though I asked her to tell him to stop and now she’s upset with me; but I’m just getting a bad vibe from her all together she told me about the server but said “I promised not to tell” like if she didn’t want me to know she shouldn’t have told me and I wouldn’t have lost friends or gotten upset.

Then another male who we were all friends with didn’t tell me about it and actually laughed about this dude putting me down I said I was removing him and he said if I did he’d be bored, I said to him I’m not your source of entertainment how lonely do you think I feel? and he said very lonely, they realize it’s wrong they just don’t care because it is not their picture or them getting hurt; and normally I’d laugh if it was like light humour not like absolute bashing everything I have to say, I unfriended everyone except the girl but I’m not speaking to her until she realizes what he’s like considering he even treats her poorly.

It’s ridiculous, so ridiculous that I just decided it’s not worth my time or my tears, I got rid of the two guys and I’m going to take a little break away from social media because I just don’t need this.

fast forward about a month. lot has happened, i found out two days ago that she likes A. from her. at 2am. it hurt, i felt numb hearing her say the words. i essentially decided to distance myself a little to see what would happen. i felt i was being clingy. turns out i wasn’t being clingy, and in that time her and A got closer. :(

anyway. i asked her if she likes him. she said yeah. (all my feelings are on the table btw). i asked if he knew. she said she thinks he has a pretty good idea. it hurt so much to hear this. she said she doesn’t want me to drift from her, but idk what to do bc: 

-1: i still have feelings for her, and to see her and A get together would kill me

-2: is there any chance of her liking me again if i stick around?

I have always been a PC gamer. I have a tendency to worry I'll fuck things up if I mess with them so I've avoided my dad's PS4 until now. 

My SO reminded me that GTA V is a thing, and I never got around to getting it on my PC as it would light it on fire. He said that we should play together, so I bought it on Amazon for PS4.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the problem begins. My family are very religious and don't think of GTA as a game I should spend time on. I just turned 20 last week, and I figured it would be fine. I approached them about it and it came down to my dad's decision as it's his console. He said maybe. For him, it might as well be yes, but we're still talking about it.

This is where the problem gets more complicated. My family already has a bad feeling about this game, and I want to show them that its' really based on the players' choices. However, I have never really talked about the other games I play since I have only really played by myself on my computer. I don't mind friends or my SO asking what I'm up to. However, I get anxious when people watch me, but its specifically regarding my family. I guess you can say that I worry about being judged or being criticized for the things that I do. I don't have much interest in the bad stuff, really, I'm just looking to play with my SO. I have a younger sister, too, so it's not like I'll be doing anything too bad in the first place. I don't really know how to explain it. I don't now exactly why I feel this way? I guess its' the old christian in me saying not to do it or just the idea of my family not approving. I don't know. Any advice to deal with the anxiety would be nice. Thanks Xx

306,"So, earlier today I had my weekly dnd session with my friends. Today felt particularly like almost everyone was against what I was doing. I play a sweet southern bell of a druid (married to a mob boss) who doesn't believe in senseless killing. Our second session of the campaign she befriended a cyclops who only knew giant (and my character knew it as well), and convinced the rest of the party not to kill him (they still exchange letters frequently).
Well, today, one of the mercenaries we were fighting was rolling crit fail after crit fail, was stuck in her entanglement spell, then another one of my party members (a wizard) cast fireball on the entanglement, and he was burning alive. My character hated watching someone suffer like that, so she set him free if he promised to rethink his life choices, and where they got him. After that, literally everyone in my group (except the DM and one of my other friends) were yelling at me, telling me not to spare him. I said, straight up ""but she wouldn't want him to suffer. Besides, you guys constantly make decisions based on what your characters would do. Why am I any different?""
My best friend (the DM) saw the predicament I was in, and had the guy run away, telling the party many times there wasn't any ""backup"" he could get anyways, and he genuinely just wanted to live. Then everyone was like ""but our characters don't know that! Murder him!"" And so one of my friends ( a barbarian) dashed over to him immediately on their turn, but couldn't attack. My next turn, I asked if there was anything I could throw. The DM said ""there's a jar of jam."" 
So, my character up 25 feet on this wall throws a jar of jam 65 feet at the back of the barbarian screaming ""leave him alone! He just wants to live like everyone else!"" One of the wizard rolled to see how well they heard her, got a 19, but still chose to help other party members kill this poor guy. I was so angry. Especially when that same party member later said ""yeah, I heard you were yelling, but to me it was just incoherent."" Excuse me! You rolled a 19!
I shrugged it off, and just hoped as the guy hid in a bunker (that lead nowhere, mind you), that the party wouldn't kill him. The barbarian broke the door to the bunker down, went in to kill him, but I convinced him (out of character) to look around the room first to see if there was anywhere for the mercenary to run. I then said ""would you really kill a man who has nowhere to run, and just wants to live?"" 
I somehow appealed to his better nature, and he even planned on breaking the guys legs just in case, but instead tied him up. I then went inside to deal with the person we were actually meant to deal with (and I ended up being the first person to get to the bad guy), distracted him long enough for our npc helping the group to knock him out, and save the two kidnapped children our bad guy had. Others got there before the npc, and all we really did was distract him (and my character not only calmed him down, but asked the healer to heal the wizard who fell and got a broken nose).
Then after all of that, while everyone chose to loot, I went to find the mercenary, gave him a 1/6 of my gold, told him to take care of himself, and try to find some more respectable work. Then we took him home, and she now also sends letters to him (and occasionally gifts). 
She also apologized to the barbarian for throwing a jar of jam at him. He forgave her since she said ""my morals don't allow me to let anyone be senselessly murdered if they can be saved."" Later when sorting the loot, the barbarian suggested she take the talisman of pure good. So clearly, he doesn't think ill of her.
Now, after the party got back to her mob boss husband's mansion (only her in game best friend knows they're married), the only other female in the party was looking for her. She's the cleric, and, well, no one in the party trusts her. So when she was looking for my character, everyone freaked out. Eventually when my character was told to go meet the cleric, she happily went (carrying her corgi named Biscuit). The friend who plays the wizard said ""she's waaaaaay too trusting."" 
I shrugged it off, and had her go right up to the cleric's door. The cleric told her a story that related to something that happened with the bad guy earlier, and asked her to keep a secret. The person everyone told me to be wary of told my character a secret, asked her to keep it, and that was it. 
When my character believes in someone, she does it wholeheartedly because she thinks everyone deserves to be believed in. I had 2 people who didn't push me in the beginning, and it ended up being 3 in the end.
Although the friend who decided to change what his barbarian was doing didn't end up talking to me much after the session. They typically don't like it when I get so into my characters, but I don't see how I could stop. I think being more passionate is a good thing, especially if it's ""what your character would do."" 
I understand that when people were playing it by ""yeah, but my character doesn't know that."" However, that wasn't the real issue. The issue was everyone agreeing that in a scenario the guy would find help, they would kill him, and even if he didn't, they still would kill him. Then continued to treat me horribly because my character would try to save him anyways, and they knew that! They saw her help a cyclops, yet her throwing a jar of jam was apparently traitorous (yes, it was at a party member, but the barbarian of all people forgave her).
They aren't always like this, but practically any time I really get into character, and make decisions like that, someone gets mad at me. This time it was 3 people, and not just 1. I'm really starting to feel like maybe I should just quit altogether so my best friend doesn't have to deal with more than she bargained for.
I don't know. Maybe I'm simply being too overbearing, and getting way too into it (even though it's what the DM wanted). But no one else verbally berates anyone in the group when they act true to their character. I'm worried I'm the problem, and if I am, then I'm not sure what to do. It's just hard seeing how much everyone else kept out of character getting mad at me, even after I ended up saving someone anyways. 

TL;DR my end character tried to save a random mercenary, and I out of character got yelled at for it, even though I managed to pull it off.",23Mar2020,1

She and I spat back and forth but at the end of the day we do care about one another. We are also polar opposites to add to the bickering.

I have not talked to her since her birthday (aka christmas). But in the fall she was frustrated with me as i would be emailing her and she was trying to work. 

I have been monitoring the virus in Italy but over the past 2 weeks seen it get worse. On the home front, my life in 2 weeks have been turned upside down as my state has shut down almost every industry even though we are not one of the hardest hit.

I am now getting scared about friend and this situation in Italy. I am however nervous considering everything else going on, how to message her. She has not posted anything on social media since January and with the growing cases of the virus feel she may have been infected.

315,"Well, umm I doubt this will be all that much coherent as I am just puking my thoughts on to the screen.

I am one of those smart kids or whatever you call them, got good grades from the start never had to study all that much all of the normal stuff.

And now I am an 8th-grader where kids in my country first get rounded up into places depending on their prospects, I thought I was used to studying my ass off(started cram-school from 7th grade) but no I get stressed and sad as much as I used to it's just that I've gotten really good at bottling it up so much so that even I do not notice it. I just recently figured out I have been worn-down mentally a week or so ago when I had a stress-induced migraine, nothing major headaches and some puking actually is it? I dunno. So to continue, after all that I figured I should calm down in general and try to do things at my pace, sunshine and rainbows right? Right?

&amp;#x200B;

It kind of is and kind of not, for some more backstory until the middle of the first semester I was in cram school but then the private school of the same company said they would take me in with a scholarship so after a bit of thinking I figured this would be better for and went to the private school and so far it has, the teachers both have more time and are much more understanding stuff is going good classmates are fun everything should be fine but then I start thinking to myself ""I want to be remembered"" ""I want to be someone"" etc. oh, by all means, I believe these are good principles to hold but I got really attached to that for a while as in I would criticize myself for it ""You should have improved your math skills(extracurricular stuff I like maths) You had the time for it but decided not to because ""I have other stuff to do "", ""Three hours of free time is too little for me to be relaxed and also improve myself"" Excuses!""

&amp;#x200B;

And after a few weeks of this spiralling out of control, I got the migraine and it changed how I and my family act about the whole studying thing we decided to take it easy and it's been going well in that regard for a while now, the thing that's not going well are my comparisons and anxieties

My parents have always been really against all that ""The neighbour's kid has better grades than you! REPENT!"" Shit for as long as I've known but when you are by yourself in your thoughts you do that by yourself and it isn't all ""X has better results than me"" it's more ""X works harder than me, X is better than you at taking control over their life"" ""You solve 70 questions but hey solve 300"" etc. and you know when I said I have amazing teachers yeah, in fact, they are so amazing that when I tell them about this they tell me ""That's enough for you, you have enough of a foundation"", ""Just make sure that you don't over-do it"" and as you know I got in with a scholarship so I feel a kind of weird guilt for a damned corporation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should be really happy and relaxed right now so why am I not? I have everything I need to be happy, or maybe there's something missing? I don't know. 

If anyone's gone through a similar experience please tell me how you got through it.

Thank you already.",23Mar2020,1

317,"So I guess the title says it all, my life is falling apart more and more, and I don’t know what to do. I’m crying as I type this, and I’m just so tired. 

Let’s start with the senior in high school, I was in a very bad accident last year, so I missed a lot of school. Meaning next year I’m being held back and I’m repeating a year, and it will take me 5 years to finish high school. I’m not graduating with my class, and due to my failing grades last year, this year my school has blocked me from going to prom, senior grad night, etc. 

My family has so much money, they think that it’s the solution to everything, but it’s not. I turned 18 a few months ago, and I received a trust, a very large amount of money, that I genuinely don’t want. The amount of money my family has amassed has caused me nothing but problems. From people using me to me having to deal with issues no kid should have to. I’ve been stuck on a private jet and sent to various American school in Europe, but it’s always for like 1-3 weeks, just to scare me... it’s understandable why suicide is more common among people who have high net worths. 

My uncle just passed away, who was the only family member I was close to and liked. 

Just recently, like last week recently. They wanted to send me to a boarding school in Switzerland to do my 5th year of high school, being 18, I refused... as of June 1st I am now getting kicked out since I am a “failure and disappointment who can’t even graduate high school” I refused to go because the girl I love is here, and that leads to the below. 

I’m in love with this girl, we have been together for about 2 years now. And I mean deeply in love, we both are. We have plans of getting married and starting a family together and traveling the world. I hear non stop from people that I should leave her, and we are to young to be in love... and by people I mean my parents, teachers, school counselors, even the principal... One dilemma is, I just turned 18 and she just turned 17, she’s almost exactly a year behind me. Her and I come from her different families. She doesn’t have a lot of money, while I on the other hand have flown in countless private jets. She only recently found out the family I come from a few months ago. Well, her family is very bad, to be honest. Like her mom is clinically psychotic and her dad has hit her before. About 2 hours ago, she was visiting her mom, all the way across the country. Her mom lost it, and police where involved. According to court agreements, her dad was never suppose to let her be around her mom. Now she’s being taken from her dad and in a foster home across the country... I want to adopt her or something, but there is nothing I can do.  

I’m beyond unhappy, I’m stressed, and I’m just so tired. I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Tl;dr: My family is horrible and the girl I love has been taken away by CPS for at least the foreseeable year. I’m not graduating high school and my life is just falling apart...",23Mar2020,1

Slowly it became their new normal to be out of their tiny room. They were really energetic, and soon showed how affectionate they can be. 

They soon came to live at my mother and I’s house, and later we moved in with the guy so obviously the dogs came with. I was the person who fed them, made sure their water dish was full, let them outside, took them for walks, gave them attention and love. I even let them sleep in my bed, even though they kind of smell.

I dont have anywhere to turn to and I think I need advice. Im 27m and about 2 years ago i started a business, which hasnt been easy on me. I was also dating my girlfriend and we had an awesome relationship at the time. It was all good and easy until I started my business. I went all in and i have tried to persist no matter what. It has been two hard years trying to make it work and I was very close to making it work. These two years have also been hard on my girlfriend. I changed a lot due to the amount of stresss Ive subjected myself into and my attitude and personalitiy has also changed in a way im not happy about. I know this has also affected my relationship and i havnt been the best partner and even though i put everything on the side, my friends, fun, hobbies, gaming, etc. I tried to keep my priorities, which were my business and my relationship.  i  feel i have failed miserably at both. The worse thing is that i was about to close a big deal for my business and it would bring me cash flow positive and then the whole CORONA situation arises and probabbly costs me my deal i was working with and my business (Im a franchise consultant, which basically means i help people start businesses and buy franchises). I was so close to closing that deal and then it all goes to shit. No one wants to invest in franchise right now (more when no one lnow whats going to happen). For my business a deal takes about 4-5 months to close, so basically this deal was also 5 months of work already invested in. So now my client is pausing everything and maybe even canceling the process. Also i was counting on this deal so badly. I forogt to mention I have -$200 in my bank account and i have maxed all my cards. I have been so stressed the past months for being so broke and so frustrated with myself. I have had so much aniexity these past 2 years that idk how i havent gone crazy yet. Even though it was all going to shit I thought i had my SO to fall on and she was always great support. Yesterday she confessed to me basically she doesnt want to be in the relationship and that she has feelings for her best friend who i always trusted them together. I always gave her my full trust and never questioned her or got in the way of the friendship. If anything i was always supportive of them being friends. She told me he has always been there for her and that i wouldent understand. I know she was so scared of telling me and also very torn about the whole situation. Im so heartbroken, dissapointed, angry about it. I blame myself mostly because i have not been a good partner. I also understand her feeling the way she feels. I have been so torn i havent been able to sleep, every time i want to eat i want to throw up. Im so sad and depressed that i dont know what to do. Ive never been a depressed person, but i dont know how to handle so much pain, anexity, being broke, etc. Im so tired of life i just want to throw the towel on the business. I pretty much want to throw the towel on everything. Im so torn with everything and being stuck in my house is also not helping. I have to much pride to ask for help and i dont know who to talk to. Im so emberrased to be in this situation, that i dont have the guts to talk to someone or ask for help. I dont know what to do with my relationship, my business, and i dont know how to deal with my emotions. I feel so broken with life. I told my girlfriend that ide be willing to work on our relationship and im willing to fight to be a better partner. Im sorry if this post is full of so much self pitty. Im just so tired of failing in my business, dealing with life, being broke, and now my failed relationship. Also forgot to mention we were already in the talks of getting married, etc. Like it wasnt a whatever relationship.

328," I’m sad for so many reasons. I am someone who borders on neutral to  permanently content, but I’ve always relied on the happiness of “my two  friends” (my dogs). They supplied me with the endless happiness that  fuels my being. One passed, then the other. Both within the last four  weeks. Without them I have no energy to draw from. The light that was  responsible for me to exude life is gone. On top of that, my brother who  I used to draw strength from is either mentally sick or physically sick  with either scenario being a major weight on my shoulders. This back  and forth horror has been a nightmare for six months. His situation  caused me to quit my job (which was a huge step up in my career) as I  had to help him virtually every hour of the day. Suicide attempts and  the possible physical implications have not only drained me completely,  but possibly made me sick myself. With me trying to hold on to any  resemblance of a normal life,  I started to resume my competitive track  career at the ripe old age of 30, along with playing recreational  volleyball, both of which are halted by the Corona virus for who knows  how long. So since I’ve moved back home, I have no friends, no  girlfriend, a troubled family, no job, and no athletic aspirations  (track and field is not only a venture that requires time but commitment  to be successful and with everything that has gone on, it’s likely I  will never return the times I’ve once achieved).

330,"Hey r/Advice,


So, I posted this earlier in another sub, specifically r/Crushes. I’ve since come to the conclusion that pursuing anything with this girl isn’t a good idea. I’m not doing it of sound mind, and she seems uninterested in me anyway.

Here’s the post, verbatim:


“Hey,

So, I’ve been crushing on this one girl at my high school. She’s a junior, and I’m a sophomore. We didn’t know each other until very recently (I’d say around January-February). We at first talked quite a bit, although inconsistently. Some days I’d send a text and she wouldn’t reply for a few days, some days we’d exchange rapid fire texts in conversation for hours. She has a job, so perhaps that affects her schedule and availability. Whenever we talked, we discussed a lot of stuff that related to politics, music, and like, philosophy, I guess. I think it peaked around a month ago. That’s when I really started to like her, because I had gotten a hint that maybe she liked me. 

The hint I’m referring to came in the form of a conversation we were having about music. We were exchanging song recommendations and playlists. She commented on how similar we are, and proceeded to quote a lyric from a song we both like, one that was...uh, to put it simply, quite sexual (I sound like such a neckbeard don’t I? Ahhhh frick). We proceeded to exchange texts.

Around a week or two after, our relationship kinda went south a bit. I asked her about her opinion on something I had made, and she disapproved of it. In a moment of blatant egotistical fervor, I rushed to “defend” myself, without regarding her opinion, and I’ve regretted it since. Like, really badly. Things seemed fine in the one class we had together, and I tried talking to her a bit more in person, which didn’t seem to bother her much. However, later, when texting abt some political stuff, she told me that her past statements were “satirical”. I probably sound super paranoid, but I didn’t feel like I could trust what she said anymore. In addition, I had run into significant problems with depression and anxiety. I was hospitalized and put on medication. But it was too late to avert what happened next. As a result of all that, I decided not only to isolate myself from her, but effectively everyone in my life. I didn’t talk to anyone for about a week.

Things got better very recently,, I started talking to my friends again around a week and a half ago, and the medication really started kicking in.  I started to feel a lot more motivated to pursue things outside of school, particularly my passion of making music. I’m a bassist of two years but have been struggling up until very recently to write stuff. However, in this past week alone I’ve seen an explosion in progress, as it pertains to basically everything.

...and that’s where we are today. In that explosion, I mustered up the will to reopen communication with her. I sent her a song recommendation late one night, she replied the next morning with one, and I proceeded to send another. I then told her about my musical progress, which at the time I perceived as a struggle, and she kinda poked a bit of fun at it, which I found amusing and kinda cute (it wasn’t mean, just sort of funny). Ever since, communication has been slow, but better than none, I suppose. I sent her the progress on one of my songs and she liked it, she gave me some recommendations on how to improve it (good ones too). Last night, I went on a tangent about why I love music and what it means to me, why I find it powerful and everything, I sent her some clips of me playing so I could get opinions (even if this all doesn’t pan out, I still think her opinions on music are pretty solid. Despite the fact she isn’t a musician, I think she has a natural knack for it), and I also asked about some philosophical viewpoints. She hasn’t seen anything from then though, so I’m waiting.


Anyway, that’s where everything is currently. I know it sounds like word vomit, admittedly it is. I just don’t really know what to say.

I guess I feel as if we initially had some chemistry, but I’m confused now. I want to think we do, but there’s an amount of evidence for both sides of the coin. I don’t know if she feels the same way about me as I do her. I personally doubt it, I’m not attractive by any means. And that leads me to another point. I don’t know if I like her because I’m attracted to her looks, or if I find her personality (what little I’ve seen of it) to be...the one? Idk. I just know I don’t want a relationship that’s overtly materialistic. I don’t want to be with someone because I lust for them, I want to be with someone because we connect and I find their physical presence a comforting way of manifesting their emotional presence in my life, y’know? I don’t want a relationship in which sex is the only object, in fact I don’t really want sex to be valued as its own standalone perk. I personally find that I value intimate physical interaction of any kind, from cuddling to intercourse, not as love, but as the manifestation of it; the physical representation of a much stronger metaphysical thing. And I just don’t want to get dragged into a situation in which I lust for the physical tangible thing alone. I often fantasize about what a relationship in my future would look like. My friends and I often joke about stuff like sex, but in all seriousness, what I truly believe I want is a relationship in which I can find total harmony and peace by just sharing a blanket on the couch with my SO, and watching a movie or something while cuddling. Something about that image seems so warm and inviting, so peaceful and tranquil. It’s love, without the pollution of primal urge to reproduce. It just sounds perfect.

And I don’t know if what I value is being represented here. I don’t know her well enough. I want to get to know her, I want to know if we can have that. But I don’t know if, right now, I want to be with her because I see her as physically attractive, or personally beautiful. It’s so f*cking confusing. I don’t know if we have the chemistry I desire, and it’s driving me insane. 

Anyway, sorry for ranting y’all. I just want to get this off my chest, I don’t have a clue what’s going on.”


So yeah. I don’t want to pursue it. I want to give up on it, there’s no future in it. But I find trouble in doing so. I already tried it, by trying to stop talking to her, but I couldn’t keep it up. How can I do it differently this time?",23Mar2020,1

So for a couple years now I’ve had pain every once in a while while bending over, it’s like a Charlie horse in my stomach and almost feels “stuck”. I have to massage it to make it go away. 
I’ve also always had issues with swallowing, food gets stuck and I’ve had to have surgery to remove steak. Along with feeling like I can’t take a deep breath. 


I’ve had 2 “keyhole” surgeries. One for my gallbladder and one to check for a tubal pregnancy (it wasn’t, he’s now 18 months) 

I’ve had a lump under my belly button and it’s always been sore. My son accidentally pushed on it tonight and now it hurts like cramping and if I touch inside my belly button It gets worse. But no bulging! 

I’m not sure if it could be scar tissue from surgery 2 years ago and it’s just sensitive or I have a hernia that’s strangled!

I have 2 other roommates living with me, and there are about 70 other people living here my age. The first month was great with my my roommate (F24) we got along and connected....now I’m starting to see her true colors. She has depression and anxiety, which is something I understand. She is constantly talking about her anxiety 24/7, whether it’s a small thing someone said or just the way someone looked at her. She is constantly being negative. Another thing that has started to bug both me and my other roommate is that she always talks about her self and doesn’t bother listening to what we have to say. I can be telling something about my self and she will interrupt and tell a whole story about her self....or when I’m talking about something and she will just not pay attention. Another issue I have been having is her desperation for male attention. Most guys that I’ve been talking to here she will flirt with them. I hooked up with a guy a couple weeks ago which she knew about and then also hooked up with him and seemed very happy with that and saw how uncomfortable it made me. I also have a friend who comes and watches movies with me and when I’m cuddling with him she has to also lie on his chest or hold his hand.

we were never close and we only ever have small / casual talk. i know he’s gotten drunk one night &amp; called me beautiful but he was sweet  about it and not obnoxious if u get what i mean. those drinks made him bold.

the last time i got into a situation like this, it was with my best friend who also developed strong feelings towards me. except he became possessive of me and not accepting of the way i felt. the friendship turned toxic and abusive so i’m just genuinely fucked up and scared. i need to be honest but i don’t want to hurt this guy i’ve known since junior year.

352,"I met my friend in July 2019. We instantly clicked when we met. We were hanging out about 2 or 3 times a month and texting each other periodically. Then, in October 2019, I was sexually assaulted. My friend went above and beyond to be there for me. She would insist on calling me every day to “check-in on me”, she began texting me frequently, and she wanted to hang out with me every few days. At first, I thought she was wonderful for caring so much about me, and we had a lot of fun together. However, as the months have gone by, I have noticed that she is increasingly controlling and refuses to respect my boundaries. She calls me at least once or twice a day, often late in the evening. If we talk on the phone, she wants to talk for hours at a time. She also texts me constantly, from the early morning to the late evening. She wants to hang out with me regularly and invites herself over to my place. 

She gives me tons of unsolicited advice and has harshly criticized me for not “punishing” the man who assaulted me, despite the situation being very complicated. She gets very jealous if I mention my other friends. I have asked her in very gentle ways to please give me some space, and she always says “okay”, but then she continues to violate my boundaries. Sometimes she yells when she is angry or frustrated. I finally confronted her in early December about her behavior. She sent me several scathing texts and did not speak to me again until late January. She eventually acted very apologetic and said she would change. I accepted her apology because I feel grateful to her for being supportive after I was assaulted. Unfortunately, the bad behavior is starting all over again. I am very concerned, and I am not sure what I should do because she does have redeeming qualities. I just wish she would stop being so clinging and controlling because it is putting strain on our friendship.  I appreciate any advice.

I asked her to respect my boundaries, we had a short falling out, she apologized, we are friends again, but the controlling behavior is starting again.

360,"Okay, well here it goes. I am part of a tumblr community that caters to a specific group of people. And it is not unusual for people in this community to role play. And, I have enjoyed doing that. But, usually both parties agree to the role play and they both know what they are getting into.

So, I had the brilliant idea to start roleplaying from the start, with a random person. I thought it would be fun to pretend to be a little bit different. 

So, I start talking to this guy, (I'm a guy also and he knows that) and we start talking about ""our"" lives. We bond over ""similar"" experiences. All was going good. But then he started talking about personal ""baggage."" And then I created personal baggage of my own to match his. I should have stopped before it got to that point. But now, I was in to deep.

By the next day when he messaged me again, that's when I realized what I had gotten myself into. I didn't really expect him to write again. So, I started talking back. Then it hit me I was catfishing this guy. 

This had been going on for three days and we both have been messaging each other literally for hours of the day. For the first two days he was getting real dark about the pain and self hate he has been going through. And, I been comforting him with my fake experiences. But, today I was able to twist the situation and able to get him to look at his situation with a positive light.

He told me today was the first day he has been happy for a long time and that he gald he meet me. Except for the fake experiences, I'm not acting different then I normally would. So, on both sides it feel like a good friendship. Our personalities match too well. But, I feel like shit knowing he told me about all his pain while I told him lies, even if it was to comfort him and create a sense of empathy.

So now, I'm stuck. If I tell him that I lied about these experiences he will definitely resent me and ignore the bits of truth I did tell him. But, I could deal with that. The thing I can't deal with is the pain he might return to. Ignoring him, blocking him, or deleting my account would probably be even worst, in terms of the pain it would cause.

I could keep up the act and try to wean him off this strange close friendship we have developed in 3 days. Or maybe it will just naturally die down by itself. Heck, I had many conversations with people online and they all eventually end the same way; we just never talk to each other again, for one reason or another.

My biggest fear is if he wants to get closer. (Although I could try to give excuses why I don't want to give him this information) like if he want to exchange phone numbers, become Facebook friends, or facetime with each other. I didn't lie about my appearance, so that not what I'm scared of. I'm just scared he will find out I didn't have those similar experiences. And, then he would get pissed off for opening up to person that was lying to him.

364,"Hello good people of reddit. My apologies as this is very long. 

A bit of background.

 I'm a junior in high school and I have a history of intense anxiety, really bad depression, and suicide attempts. and I struggle ask for help for a couple of reasons. Anyway, I had feelings for this girl (lets call her J) and we ended up becoming decent friends. I tried to talk to J about my problems when I could but occasionally i would tend to try to change the subject away from my problems or say that i would talk about it later (i almost never did). She never really said much about it tho. She did help me stop cutting myself and i went back into therapy which i greatly needed. we were alright.

The Issue

In between the months of December and January, my therapist was out on vacation and I said that i would be okay on my own and i wouldn't need to see his stand in (I've met her before and she is delightful) because i thought I would be alright. I was apparently wrong. my anxiety was getting really bad. I would have awful nightmares/couldn't sleep, long terrifying panic attacks, and i couldn't focus on my school work because my mind was always racing. Since i wouldn't ask for help i started to isolate myself so no would would see me like that. i guess the isolation triggered memories of loneliness so i started getting depressed. It got really bad. Eventually I started getting random suicidal thoughts seeing death as a way to get out of the stress. I didn't do anything because at the time, they were just thoughts. Unfortunately, one night while my parents were asleep, I was making some food like the fat ass I am and while i was looking for a fork i grabbed a sharp knife. i looked at it and really thought about doing it for a second. I almost cut my throat before i realized what I was doing, panicked, and dropped it. I ran to the basement/ my room and started to pace around trying to catch my breath and calm down. I went into the washroom to put some water on my face but i started looking at my cleaning supplies and the thought of drinking bleach crossed my mind. This didn't help at all.  Needless to say I didn't get much sleep that night. I struggled to stay focused in school that day and many of my teachers pulled  me aside to ask if I was okay and said i looked visibly distressed. I of course that i was fine and just a bit tired. J said that I looked pretty out of it and asked if I was okay. I didn't want to lie to her and I even wanted to ask for help. Me being the way I am though, I couldn't bring myself to say anything. I told her I was sorry. she seemed confused but we both had to get to class so she didn't have time to say anything. I walk a lot faster than J does so, after class, I was able get to my locker and leave without her seeing me. I knew what I did was pretty shitty so I turned around to see if I could find J before she left. I did find her in the hallway and I wanted to explain but she was with a group of our mutual friends so I acted fine. We left and J texted me asking me to explain.  Admittedly, I was being vague and kind of dancing around the answer. After working up the nerve I said that I was thinking about killing myself the night before but at the same time she snapped and said that she was frustrated with me constantly not talking about my problems (I don't think she saw what I said). I apologized and said in my defense she never mentioned it and if she did then I would've made more of an effort to communicate more. J said ""BS"" and said she didn't care anymore and didn't want know. At one point we just stopped texting. After I had a few minutes to calm down i texted her taking full responsibility for causing the argument and making her upset and said that i was sorry and that i wanted to resolve the problem. I really liked J and had every intention to tell her whatever she asked for and try to fix my problem of not asking for help. She opened the message but didn't reply when we went back to school that Monday she wouldn't talk to me or look at me. I tried to change anyway. I started to slowly reach out more and i was able to tell people that sometimes i wasn't okay or needed something. After a little more than a week I told J about this progress. Once again, she opened it but didn't reply. Eventually she blocked me. I thought that my issues were just too much for her and she didn't want me in her life stressing her out anymore. After telling that to one of our mutual friends (mf), mf told me that J told her there was another reason why she blocked me. Honestly this whole ordeal broke my heart but knowing that there was a different reason made my head spin. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's about two or three months since the argument. I've gotten my anxiety back under control and I'm better at talking about things. I still don't know what J's real reason is and since we have the same friend group we end up around each other a lot. whenever that happens I try to keep my distance because she seems happy without me and whenever I try to talk to her or even get near her she gets visibly upset. I still really care about her and she seems happier without me so i figured i'd try to move on. BUT I FUCKING CAN'T. I tried talking to new people but I don't feel the same way I felt when I was talking with J. And now every time i think about her i get super depressed and i feel like a failure and a shitty ass human . I know I can probably never date her but I want to at least be friends and maybe if we're friends i can move on. So here's where I need advice:

1. I know everyone will say no but is there any hope of dating her again?
2. Should I try to be friends with her again or just let her be?

365,"So, recently i post here in reddit that was my first ever post actually. It was abt me, my boyfriend and my ex bf. So, let's just make the story short, i came back to my ex bf, I don't know but it feels like, whatever i do he's just keep coming back to my life, and i don't know if it's meant to be. He knows that i have already bf and keep on finding me anywhere ( cos i already blocked him in everything) He also saying that everytime he was thinking about me and thinking that when i wil com back to him. 

Then finally end up getting back together again, i am so soft hearted girl and i admit that how many times we broke up we just end up coming back, but this last was different because there is no long breakup msgs came from me and just i blocked him. And just don't talk to him, though TBH i am so in love with him. So in-love. But i keep myself away because i am so tired. I am tired of him, I am so tired of the relationship cycle just repeatedly everytime. Again and again.  That i wouldn't know if we will end up into marriage.

He triggered more when i told him ( my ex ) that me and my current bf will planning to get married after the corona virus. He get even more likely to win me back. 

So, last night after a long time not seeing each other finally i allowed him to see me, he was so excited ofcourse, also me i can't deny it. But the weird part is the moment he enter the door, we both noticed that we both wearing an apple green color. He's cap and shorts were green and my shirt and phone case was also green.

&amp;#x200B;

This was not the first time we encounter this thing. Because the last time also that we broke up and we getting back when he came to visit and see me again, we have the same color of T-shirt.

I don't know but whatever it is, if it is connections or something we both know that he got my heart forever and there is always a space for him in my heart. Just a little weird thing.",23Mar2020,1

367,"Hi, I hope every one is doing well. Sorry if this post is really akward, it's my first one. I never knew my dad because he died two months before I was born, and I've always considered my step-dad my main father figure (even if he has been emotionally abusive to both me and my mom in the past) Around three months ago I (F 15) came home, and my mom told me that she was leaving my step-dad for one of her ex's (my miscarried half brothers dad) and that wr where going to leave with him. I've never been happy in the house with him before because of the way he's treated us. But anyway, the man ended up going back on his word and we had to stay here. Things have been more tense than usual, nothing has resorted to physical violence but my step-dad has been more mean and hateful than ever before. Now it is around three months later, and my mom comes into the room and tells me that we will be leaving to go live with one of her ex's again (not the same one as before) but she doesn't know when do to Covid-19. Her and I have discussed this and as long as she's happy, I'm happy. As we got further into discussing the details about it, she told me that I would have to leave my dog Norman behind. Norman bas been my best friend since I was three and has been there for me when I was depressed, no one cared for me, and my life was just miserable. I'm ready to start a new life, and I'm going to give Norman to one of my friends whose mom is a vet. I'm sorry, at this point my post is just a rant... but I'm asking if any one knows any good methods for coping with having to let go of a loved one, how to leave your entire life behind, and how to move on from a crappy life. I am open and thankful for all advice!",23Mar2020,1

Sometimes when we argue and I admit later and say “I’m sorry I was wrong.” He just scoffs and says “yeah, I knew I was always right.” And he’s legitimately serious, not joking. (He does this for other people too)

How am I supposed to react to this and address this? I feel like he is being too cocky and others do too.

He just know what to tell me when im upset and his advices always saved and helped me a lot. We never met each other irl and because of my situation I think never gonna meet (at least in the next 5 years) and we never been into an online relationship or something like that as well (because i didn’t want to destroy the things between us). I truly love him but I never get jealous or upset when he gets a new girlfriend (sometimes I’d be even happy). Sometimes I just don’t understand why he is so nice to me, why would he want to chat with someone in other side of the world every single day for 5 years when he dates beautiful models and can spend all of his time with them (while im not even beautiful). His personality and these things made me so dependent on him and I can’t imagine my life without talking to him. Ive tried to leave him a hundred times bud I just couldn’t and after one or two month we started chatting again

372,"Hi everyone, 

For the longest time, my closest friends (2 of them) always joke about how I'm good at a lot of things but I'm not great at anything particular. I'm average at everything I do, be it video games or school or just about anything. Anytime I try to excel in any particular aspect of my life, I'm constantly put down, reminded that I can't do it past average anyways.

I've been friends with them since the third grade, so it's been a good 13 years, and it's become so normal now that it's almost part of our lives. But lately it's been weighing down on me, and I know they're just joking around but I think I'm starting to believe it and I don't know how to fight my own self doubt.

Not only do they have loud sex regularly, but they fight regularly and yell at each other and cause very loud banging sounds during the dead of the night. Several of us in the complex have called the cops on them before because we were worried about domestic violence going on, only for them to not care and go back at it a week later. 

They seem like people that are not grounded in reality, on one night that they had the cops called on them they ran their vacuum cleaner at 3 am after they left. These people are completely inconsiderate of others and I’m pissed off beyond belief. Thank god my boyfriend is sleeping through it because he starts a new job tomorrow.

376,"Sorry for the length, I tried to add details to paint a good picture of my situation so I can get advice.

So my neighbor, as kids, would have me over at her house every once in a while to play. She had tons of toys, way more than me, and I was always excited when I got to play with her.

She had a big box of barbies that were always naked. She would demonstrate sex acts with them to me. I didn’t understand this was bad at the time so I never mentioned it to anyone because I didn’t even know what sex was.

She told me how babies were made before my mom could. She asked if I wanted to know, and I said not if it’s gross, but she insisted that it was really cool and awesome. She made me promise not to tell anyone I knew about what she told me.

Once when she came to my house, I was all excited to show her my dollhouse. My dolls had the clothes painted on them, except for one girl doll that wasn’t with the set. She took off its clothes and told me to pretend the boy doll was naked as well and had them do oral sex on each other and made me watch.

One time, she told me we would play dress up and I was really excited because I’d never played before. She showed me all her colorful, sparkly gymnastics uniforms and said I could try them on. She told me to take off my clothes. I was reluctant to do so, but did it anyway. She never turned away, just kept looking at me. I stripped down to my underwear when she said they had to go, too. I refused, but she said I couldn’t wear her uniforms with underwear on. She even tried to compromise and went behind the curtain that went around the bottom of her loft bed to undress as well. She kept urging me to take off my underwear but I just stood there, not doing anything. Suddenly, her Mom came in and the first thing she saw was her daughters friend stripped almost naked while her daughter hid in the corner, undressing. “She told me to get naked,” I blurted out, or something like that. Josie’s Mom told me to put my clothes back on and took Josie outta the room. She sent me home after that.

One time, Josie had a sleepover party with herself, me, and a bunch of friends her own age from school. I was like the sixth or seventh wheel, the little kid no one wanted to play with. I was fine with that though, because I always preferred being on my own. After I painted my nails a million different colors and removed all of it because I wasn’t allowed to wear nail polish and the girls finished the movie cars 2, they decided to get ready for bed. They all took turns changing behind the curtain, but Josie and her mom told me to change in the open bedroom. The other girls also told me to change in the open bedroom. I didn’t understand why I didn’t get any privacy, but pretended to be fine with it as I changed. Everyone stared at me as I did it. They just stopped and watched. I still feel embarrassed and ashamed when I change in front of other people in the locker room, though since I’ve been in high school it’s been a bit better because people tend not to stare as much as they do in middle school. But it’s still hard and I always feel like everyone’s watching me.

This one time, Josie clipped some magnets to the back pocket of my jeans and attached it too some kind of string of something or a toy leash and made me crawl around the room while she spanked me very hard. I don’t know what that was about.

We went into Josie’s brother’s bedroom one time to see his new cash register toy. It had one of those little price scanner things where you just pressed the button, it beeped and told you a random price. “You can scan anything. Even your butt,” Josie said with a laugh. I laughed too because I was just a kid after all. 

Josie scanned her butt and we laughed as it gave us a price. Josie said it was my turn next, and had me sit on the foot of her brother’s bed. She stuck the scanner between my legs and rubbed it against my privates. I didn’t like it, but I happened so fast I didn’t know what to do. Then she quickly moved the scanner to scan my butt and laughed.

Right after the scanner incident, we went back to Josie’s bedroom and to play a new game. Josie took out a pencil and paper and said the “game” was called butt punch. You know the position you’re in when you’re crab walking, kinda of like an inverted crawling position? That’s the position I was in, holding myself up with my hands and feet, stomach facing upwards.

Josie spread my legs apart and began the “game”. It consisted of her grabbing, pulling on, pinching, punching, and slapping my private area while she documented on the piece of paper everything she was doing. I hated everything about this freaking “game”, I was in so much pain, but Josie was my friend (I thought) and I didn’t want to disappoint her by not seeming into the game, so I acted like it was fun or something but I was dying inside.

The next time I came over she told me that she told her mom about the game and that we couldn’t play it anymore, and I was so glad but I acted disappointed. It was hellish.

Everything she did to me, I knew somehow it was wrong, but I thought I would get in trouble somehow so I never told anyone. The mere thought of what would happen in Josie’s house made me feel physically sick and guilty as heck (though I know now that I had no reason to be) so I repressed the memories until they were forgotten. Over thanksgiving break last year, the memories came back shortly after my Mom showed me a photo of Josie now. She looks different but the same, and I guess seeing her triggered the floodgates for the memories to come flooding back into my thoughts.

I was in first grade at the time, around seven years old probably, and Josie was in the grade above me.

Would what she did to be count as molestation? I’m not sure because she was a kid as well. I think she might’ve been messed with by someone to know how to do all that stuff to me, another theory is she stumbled across some kinda pornography and copied what she saw? I have heard that children tend to experiment and do stuff like touch each other to feel the different things there are to feel, not to the level that Josie did, but would it still count as that?

It’s been good for me to write about all this. This is all I can remember for now, the memories just kind come and go at this point.

TLDR: due to Covid-19 both my sister and my boyfriend have moved in with me I definitely. I don’t know whether to charge them contributions. 

Due to the current requirement for social distancing and isolation of high risk people, my youngest sister and boyfriend are staying in my house definitely. Usually I (28F) live alone. 

My youngest sister H (19) usually lives with Dad and other sister. She’s a nursing student and will be on placements come next month, currently studying from home. My other younger sister is immune-suppressed so in the high risk category, so it isn’t a good idea to have H coming and going from the house and risking infecting her. If she stays with me she doesn’t have to worry about infecting someone high risk. Despite being a student H has quite a bit of cash as she got the full student loan and bursary and her part time job is still paying her even though she doesn’t have to go in. 


My boyfriend D (38) usually lives with his mother full time and visits here on weekends. His mother is also in the high risk category so is self isolating at home. D has had to go out to work some days so didn’t want to go back to risk infecting her, it’s safer for his lovely Mum if he stays here. We discussed considering this him moving in (we had been talking about that anyway) so he would share the costs of bills with me going forwards. However he’s unhappy as H is apparently staying here for free now whereas he will have to pay. D has lost allot of work due to the Covid-19 restrictions and it is true that my sis probably has more money than him. 

Do you guys think I should ask them both to contribute and to what level? Or should I just support them? Though I love them I have to admit I feel like I’m running a hostel at the moment. 

My intuition is my bf and I should share the bill and rent costs (reduced operation for him as his income has dropped) and my sister can cook for us all twice a week or something to say thanks for room and board (she’s a great cook).

387,"Very long story, I'm sorry. 

I had a very bad and now traumatizing sexual experience eight months ago and I'm not sure if I was sexually assaulted or if I am to blame for what happened.

For context: I matched with someone on a dating app (P1). They had a partner (P2) who I knew through same work industry. P2 and I also have mutual friends/acquaintances. P2 was okay with P1 and I having a sex as they were out of area for the time being. P1 and I had oral sex once before while I was tipsy. During that time, I used a safe work many times as things became painful. They wouldn’t stop very often in between me calling these safe words (general red flag). But there were still a lot of moments of pleasure so we continued. After that time we had sex, we exchanged messages and nudes that progressively became very aggressive (what seemed like a dom/sub dynamic) but I was encouraging and took part.

The last time that P1 and I had sex they texted me one day and said they were free at night. I immediately made myself available as soon as I could. The texting started differently when P1'S partner also got involved in the messaging. P2 told P1 to tell me that if I wanted to fuck P1 I had to pay 50 dollars. I told P1 that I wasn’t interested in that and if that’s what they were wanting and I would have to pass for the night. They told me that P2 meant I need to pay 50 dollars for plan b. I didn’t want to have to use Plan B. I asked them if they could just not cum in me and use a condom. I told P1 I was sorry and that I was starting to feel a little anxious now. P1 asked me where they could cum and I told them different body parts where they could do that. I told them again that I had no issue of using condoms. P1 told me to bring my weed if I liked fucking high (I had previously told them that I got horny while I was high). They told me that their room was a little messy but that they were hoping to make it messier when I got there. I told P1 that I’d bring my pen and that I was excited. P1 told me to bring beer if I wanted. I told them that I was thinking about bringing beer but I was a little tight on money but if they wanted some (bc they bought it last time) I could swing it. They said I should buy some. P1 also shared messages that P2 had for me, calling me derogatory names.

I got ready and went to the store. I bought condoms and beer and I brought my pen. I drove about thirty to forty minutes to their place. While they were walking me from my car to their room, P1 told me that P2 said I wasn’t allowed to pet their cat.

Things were a little awkward as we hadn’t seen each other in awhile. P1 smoked a cigarette and then after that we sat on the bed and kinda of asked each other how we should start. I told P1 I brought condoms and that they were in my bag. At this point they had already cracked open a beer for me and I took a few hits of my weed pen. P1 would encourage my drinking and kinda move the bottle to my lips. We started kissing and clothes came off very quickly. P1 ate me out again and I remember them fingering me much harder than the first time we had sex. It was quite painful but I think I was having such a rush of adrenaline and general drunkenness that I didn't even care to make it stop.

Then we started having penetrative sex and right before that moment I remember realizing that there was no condom and that I wanted to use a condom.

But I didn’t say anything and I just let it happen.

I don’t know why I just let it happen. I didn’t want to let it happen but I did. My brain told me to say something but I didn’t. I continued having sex with them and things became a lot more rough than I wanted it to. I couldn’t remember the safe word we used the 1st time we had sex. We didn’t talk about using it this time either. I regret not opening my stupid fucking mouth and saying I was uncomfortable.

A lot of our conversation before this encounter was very aggressive in intention so I think this might have also been why it was so rough. There were certain moments where I was encouraging of acts but other times I wasn’t. One of which was when my face was pushed hard into the bed. Almost as if to not look at my face. Thinking about that has been very difficult for me. My breast were also hit very hard.

After this I gave P1 head and they messaged their partner while I did this. P1 asked if I was okay with it and I said yes because I figured it was more pleasurable for them this way. The way P1 was holding their phone makes me very nervous that they were taking a video of me. I don’t know why I didn’t say anything but I'm fucking terrified that a video of me like that might exist. After they came, they needed a minute so they went outside to smoke. I lied on the bed and when P1 came back I said we could give ourselves 20 minutes of a break and then go again. They said something like they didn’t think so. I was surprised as on invitation they said they wanted me to stay all night. I told P1 okay and in that case I needed 20 minutes to just drink some water and sober up. P1 told me, ‘no, more like 10 min’. I think this is where most of my fear rushed in. I said okay and got up to get dressed. I think P1 could tell I was hurt and asked if I was mad. I told them that I wasn’t because I was now trying very hard to not cry. They kept asking me if I was upset so I admitted that I was a little because I thought I would be staying longer. I feel so disgusting for assuming something like that.

This is where a lot of my regret and shame in myself and my actions lie. I have NEVER been the type of person to assume that ANY of my partners SHOULD or need to have sex or take part in ANY sexual action with me. I know very well what that kind of guilt or pressure feels like and I cannot believe how I handled that situation in that moment. I hate myself every fucking day for this.

P1 walked me out and asked if they could give me a hug so that things weren’t awkward. I gave them a hug and they left.

I then sat in my car for over an hour, crying because I was still drunk, high, and in my car, unsure of how I was going to drive 30 to 40 minutes to get back home. I don't even know how I drove home.

In the morning I had a lot of bruises on my breast and thighs. I felt disgusting looking at my body. I still feel disgusting looking at my body in the mirror. I couldn’t touch myself for a very long time and still have a difficult time doing so. The first time I masturbated after this experience I just fucking cried out of pain. Out of shame for what I put myself through and what I could have potentially put P1 and P2 through.

Two weeks later I messaged P1 apologizing. I told them that it was never my intention to make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe and that I was truly so sorry if I made them feel that way. I told them that the apology wasn’t in hopes of having sex again but that I felt bad about the situation and wanted to check in with them to understand if my behavior was toxic and to apologize if they were feeling uncomfortable or anything.

P1 saved the messaged but never replied back. This was 8 months ago and I still have not heard anything from P1 or his P2. They both still have me added on various social media accounts.

I've been going to therapy now for about two months because of the trauma I've been dealing with since this. I don't know whether it's just the shame from rejection or what my therapist has told me is sexual assault. But I feel like an abuser. Especially after the message was saved with no response. I'm terrified they're going to take me to court. If the message I sent them would be enough to confirm me as an abuser. If I actually abused them. I hate myself so much I can't fucking take it. I want to message them again but am scared and don't even know if they would want to speak to me ever again. I'm so fucking confused. Someone please help me. Give me advice. I don't know what to make of the situation. I don't know what I am supposed to make of what happened to me or them. I can't fucking take this shame anymore. Its affecting my everyday life.

If anyone wants to dm me about it please do.",23Mar2020,1
388,"About two years ago I did shrooms and had an incredibly bad trip. I felt like I was gonna die for 3-4 hours. I had done a lot of psychedelics before so it surprised me when it came out of what seemed to be no where, it makes sense now cause I had not been in the best place mentally. I attempted suicide a while back (failed obviously) and had been doing good at getting better. I say that but I was mostly just putting it under the rug and I am paying for that deerly.

But the bad trip opened my eyes to some of the things I was doing to myself, made me very self aware of my mental state. But It made me way to aware as I think constantly about it. In the beginning it made me feel very uncomfortable 24/7. It's like being buzzed, or a tiny bit hi. It makes me feel distant or like I'm living life in third person. I've read that this can happen and it will take time for your brain to get better but I don't feel like that is happening, or that this is a side affect of a bad trip but rather an awakening of my mental state that I had done a very good job at ignoring. It's gotten to be more bearable with time, at my current state I don't feel like I'm buzzed all the time and the feeling is less noticable but still on the back of my mind. But I don't feel it going away soon and it's getting hard to live with as sometimes it affects all aspects of my life. My motivation, my creativity, my mood, my job, and most importantly my relationship. I feel like if I don't don't something to help soon it will stay the same or get worse again. For the most part I can distract myself and feel great but the times I can't it can affect the aspects of my life in powerful ways.

I realize I should get help and I'm working on that, but I'm currently unemployed due to the Corona virus temporarily and I'm not gonna be able to afford help at the moment. I am more asking to see if anyone has anything similar experiences that could help motivate me to think more positive. I also don't really understand what is wrong. I do not know what my dissociation is as it's hard for me to explain.",23Mar2020,1
389,"Hey. Currently my (23F) country is on lockdown due to the coronavirus. This means that if your business is not essential during this time you are not allowed to open it.
So supermarkets, pharmacies, repairs, banks and certain government offices. 
Well, there's an AC repair service in the building right in front of me on the ground floor. My bedroom window overlooks their some sort of small garage (from which they work) that is open whenever they're here (which is everyday from about 6-7am to 5-6pm).
I've been living in this building for 12 years, they're here for about 5-6.
I say they and what I really mean is a group of loud obnoxious men who partake in these activities: yelling, screaming, cursing, laughing loudly, talking on their phones on speakers (in their car's speakerphone or just phone), I spotted them peeing on my and several other buildings in the neighborhood and it goes without saying that (besides the current situation) we have small kids walking around at 7am-6pm.
There's no way of knowing when they'll start making noise each day but usually they start at the early hours of the morning and it's on and off until they leave.
I have tried the following:

1. Asking them to be quiet, nicely- didn't work.
2. Telling them to shut up, not nicely- didn't work.
3. I have called the city's complaint department, they didn't help, they said that the rules regarding noise complaints are only from 11pm, or if there are specific disturbances (like homeless people making a lot of noise and drug addicts and so on) and that there's nothing they can do if these people are just doing their job.
4. So I got mad, even though I get that they're not a danger to society but my living quality is reduced by their noise, and I pay to live here while they are getting paid to be here. I called the police, the first woman I talked to was totally apathetic and couldn't care less so I started crying in which point she handed the phone over to a male police officer and he said that I shouldn't be crying and while the restrictions about noise are not in these hours, there's no reason for these men to making so much noise, it's not like they're rebuilding a building apartment and they have to scream in order to hear each other, they work really closely to one another and that he is willing to send a police car to take care of it. I stupidly told him that I'd hate to waist the police's time and that I only called since the city complaint department didn't do anything about that and that if it escalates I will call back. 
5. In the meantime I bought some earplugs, sometimes they help a little but most of the time they don't. They're really good quality it's just that I have really good and sensitive hearing.


Well, now I'm home all day long being forced to listen to these men and I know that the police has better things to do than come here and tell a few men children to be quiet so I really feel like there's nothing I can do but tolerate it for another who knows how long.

I'm not sure if this belongs here, I might try to copy this to r/legaladvice. It's just that I live in Israel and I don't know if there's a representation of the law in Israel in r/legaladvice. So if this is not the right sub for this let me.know and I will delete it. Thank you.",23Mar2020,1

397,"Hey guys, 

So my whole life my dad has struggled with drinking. Him and my mum have always had explosive arguments about it, and I can remember so many times as a child where I was left to look after my younger brother and sister as my parents were SCREAMING at each other about his drinking problems. 

In the past 12 months my Mum has given him the ultimatum that either he stops drinking, or she leaves. She’s warned about this before but she truly meant it this time, and he has stepped up. He’s started seeing a therapist and going to Alcoholics Anonymous. And I’m really proud of him, the fighting for the first time in my life has lessened - it’s basically gone! 

However he does sometimes slip off the bandwagon, like he has many times before, and drinks too much. He gets angry and very defensive when drunk, and often takes it out on my mum especially, but also me. 

Although it’s far less often, when we does drink I have this hell-fire hatred towards him. Only if he has one drink like a normal person over dinner. 

If I know he has drunk I am instantly angry at him, often before I even see him. 

I don’t know how to let go of thus anger after years of seeing him mentally hurt my mum, all their fighting and him getting drunk so much. 

I’m at a loss, and don’t want to be mad at him for no reason, but I am even when he is sober now.

402,"I need help with my housemate. To put it bluntly he’s a 20 year old with some sort of learning disability or something and he’s been babied his whole life by his mother and now as a result he can’t take care of himself which is putting additional stress on my partner and I.

The 3 of us (partner (20m), housemate (20m), and I (25f)), moved into a new place together at the start of feb this year. This housemate is my partner’s childhood friend, and my partner spent his whole school life sticking up for this guy as he was severely bullied due to his learning disability. 
I call it a learning disability however I’m just assuming that’s what it is (possibly ignorantly so - my apologies) because no one actually knows for sure what’s wrong with him as he was never diagnosed. His parents never took him to see anyone as they never wanted to admit that something might not be right with their child. He’s just an incredibly slow learner, and struggles with the most simple tasks (eg. he can’t do dishes and he can’t beat eggs). He’s also incredibly immature and has the mentality of a 15 year old if not younger.

This is making home life extremely frustrating and stressful. We have a system at home where we share out chores and cooking dinners for everyone, and we do a weekly shop for all our shared groceries including those we’ll need for dinners and split the costs. His only chores are to cook dinner for everyone 2 nights a week, and do the dishes twice a week. Everything else, all cleaning and other cooking falls onto us.

He can’t cook. He doesn’t know how. When I ask him what he wants from the shops for groceries (because he refuses to come to the shops), he’ll not ask for anything. He doesn’t think to look up recipes or anything. The one time he actually has cooked for us and not given us his mum’s frozen meals my partner had to teach him how to cook French toast. He couldn’t even beat the eggs after my partner just showed him.
My partner has repeatedly said that he’ll teach housemate to cook but housemate puts no effort into anything as in he never asks, never gives ideas for dinners and gives the impression that he just doesn’t want to.

He can’t do dishes. He’ll leave them for days on end until I’m practically begging him to do them and then he’ll do them very half-arsedly. Half the dishes will still have food in them, sauce all over the cooking utensils, glasses covered in grease, all that crap. He stacks them so that they never even dry. I point it out to him and he just has this “whatever” attitude. 

Apart from these two chores that he barely does in the first place, his only other responsibilities are to take care of his own shit. Like do his own washing and whatever. But he literally can’t even take care of himself. In the nearly 2 months that we’ve been here he’s only done 2 loads of washing. And one of them didn’t make it onto a line to dry. Despite me telling him he needs to get his clothes out of the washer, they stayed in there for nearly a week, damp, until I took them out and put them back into his basket and into his room.
While I was taking his clothes out of the washer, I noticed his underwear were covered in shit stains. And just yesterday I noticed that the back of his pants that he was wearing had a brown stain on the area where his crack is. So this boy doesn’t even know how to wipe his own arse properly. What the fuck.

He has 2 minute showers twice a day, but doesn’t hang up his towel. He leaves it in a pile in the bathroom, so he showers, and then dries(?) himself with a mouldy and reeking towel. I told him that he needs to hang his towel up because not only is it gross but it’s super unhygienic and he flung it over the shower (but still in a way that it won’t dry) for a couple days and then went back to his old way. He’s only changed towels once while he’s lived here because we practically forced him to. I can only suspect that he’s been wearing dirty clothes the majority of the time he’s been living here.

I don’t think he brushes his teeth very often. Most days I walk past the bathroom his toothbrush is on the floor. None of this bathroom shit would fly if we were sharing but my partner and I have our own bathroom.

His overall attitude is just plain shitty and extremely childish. It was a struggle to get him to agree to helping with dinner and dishes because as he has said, he’s the only one that works full time so in his mind that means he doesn’t have to do anything at all around the house. While I do agree that he works a lot more than we do, so we should do a bit more around the house, at the end of the day we are all adults and we are all paying equal amounts in rent and bills so I think we are being more than fair with him.

He comes from a very toxic household and he was in a very bad place mentally. We offered for him to move with us as an opportunity to mature and grow as a person, to learn actual life skills, and to get out of his toxic home and in with us where we can actually support him. 
When we said that though we did not mean we’d be his parents. I guess I meant it as a way to guide him into being an independent person.

But it’s been nearly 2 months. He still hasn’t put sheets on his bed. He’s sleeping on the bare mattress. He hasn’t set up his room. His furniture is sprawled throughout the room and his boxes of stuff are spread throughout the house. His room reeks and you can’t even see the floor it’s just covered in clothes. 
He just gets home, showers, and then plays league for a few hours while screaming at the screen, then goes to bed. Day in day out. He’s already broken one computer screen. 

I’ve tried talking to him before. I’ve tried talking to him with my partner, which I think accidentally ended up more like us ganging up on him so that didn’t work. The time with the towel we kind of shamed him into hanging it up for a couple days but obviously that didn’t work either. I’ve tried being passive aggressive and I’ve tried being direct. Nothing. 
He just grunts in response. Trying to have a conversation with him about anything important is like pulling teeth. If he gets frustrated he has a tantrum. He’ll literally go to his room and not talk to us for a few hours, and then act like nothing ever happened.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to deal with him but I’m so sick of putting up with his crap.",23Mar2020,1
403,"I’m an 18 yo dude 175 pounds and people keep staring at me (mainly girls and women) 

It’s getting increasingly uncomfortable and it agitates me to no end when I find people / girls staring at me. 
Before you guys are quick to judge, just hear me out a little. 

2 years ago I was a fat, obese 16 yo kid. Now I’ve lost weight and gained muscle etc and I look better and I like the way I look. Regardless of whatever reason why people stare at me, I built my body on my own and it’s for myself, I didn’t build it for people to stare and look at me. As someone who was afraid of everyone and had low self esteem, to now having staring at you just makes me feel very uncomfortable. 

This usually happens on the train, train platforms, sometimes at Starbucks, an area near the gym, basically almost everywhere I go, there’s at least 1 person staring at me. I don’t look at people. I listen to my music, look at my phone or just rest my eyes on the train. When I wake up or look up from my phone, I catch girls or even sometimes a group of girls looking at me. 

Yes. I have anger management issues as you can tell, but I feel staring at someone is highly disrespectful (unless you’re dazing off) but this happens on a daily basis. I feel like approaching people and asking them why they are staring at me. I’m only a few steps away from beating the hell outta someone for staring at me. It’s annoying.

Insane right? And its so crazy I can't ask and be like ""hey are you putting sleeping medication in my coffee?"" I used to openly question my absurd thoughts but than I learn other ppl will see how crazy I am if I do this.

I cant tell my doctor about it cause I'm afraid. I'm on meds for anxiety, and depression. But I always worry my meds will slow my brain down and I need my brain to work to study my computers. 

Im also always obsessed with women and sex, but I think sex is wrong. So I dont want to think about sex or women anymore and I feel so guilty for it. I never had sex, why do I think about it. 

I get constantly scared of my looks, ill spend days comparing pics of myself together, these are times when my mental health really falls apart, ill cry for 3 days doing drugs and staring at pics and comparing them. I feel to ugly to go outside and I won't. Ill call into work, wont go to class, won't go for food. Nothing. 

Is this all normal? 

Fuck sometimes I swear I always get this idea ppl can hear my thoughts, like hear me thinking, or ill fear what I'm thinking is being broadcast some how. To other people. 

These thoughts Jesus some of them are violent and sometimes they yell in my head I swear and they talk about women, sex, ppl thinking im ugly, they say ill be alone forever, they'll call me names, but I know its in my head. Is there any truth to what they say at all? Is it intuition maybe? A warning? Guidance or some shit?

410,"Hey everyone.

I'm looking for any sort of advice because I think my emotions are getting the better of me and hoping someone can tell me what the best thing to do is.

I used to hang around with a bunch of girls, I'm female as well, about 5 of them. One of them and myself had an argument over something completely petty and instead of making up, she decides to remove me from the group chat. This caused me to realise that not any of the other girls cared enough, or respected me enough, to add me back in, check on me or even take my side. I simply went a couple of days not talking to anyone, despite the argument only happening with one of the girls.

I end up texting one of the others and she said she didn't want to take sides. But told me the rest were all still chatting in said group chat. I asked to be added back in, and she said she didn't want to upset the girl I argued with. 

This was a small argument between me and one person and I ended up being isolated from the whole group, which made me question my friendships. No one talked to me and when I reached out the girl I had the argument with to end all of this, she said they'd all talked it over and were having a good time with me not in the chat and they just brushed it off as if it was nothing.

So I realised I had no friends and was absolutely baffled by this. Literally one second I was friends with them and the next they weren't. 

Now, tbe problem is, they've been telling people lies about me. Saying I caused a big drama, swore at them, insulted their families. Used my mental health against them. All of which is not true. This is because people have been asking where I am at gatherings and I've spoken to a couple people outside our group who tell me they've been painting me out to be a bully.

When actually, I feel they've bullied me. There are a bunch of people who have now unfollowed me on social media and no longer support me. They constantly do posts about mental health and supporting it and people lap them up as if they're such good people, and I look like such a bad guy as I havent denfed myself either online or in person because I dont have any friends and dont hang out with anyone.

Unless I move cities, I don't know what to do. It feels like everyone has believed them and just are settling to get on their side as its easier. But it's the constant posts on social media that are annoying me. they constantly post about getting rid of toxic people for your mental health and how they are always there if people need them, yet they isolated me and left me with no friends and no one to talk to.

I feel like I'm in the minority as they have each other and I cant stick up for myself. Even people I was sort of close with have removed me from social media after going to parties with them.

414,"It sounds stupid I know. But prior to this year, my nose has always been very sensitive, I sneeze when there's dust and when it gets too cold. But now, I realize I barely sneeze even when I'm cleaning really dusty parts of my house.

She dated me when I was underage and years over 18, threatened and blackmailed me after we broke up. 

My friend insist on keeping her in his contact, because she can help him with his projects, he never told me about this and only just now, and he said he wanted to hide this from me for months bc he knows I'll get angry if I know.

I told him my friend how uncomfortable I am (alot of times) and yet he said I'm being disrespectful, all he wanted was to keep in contact w her and so he can finish his project, bc my ex can do it for free and he can't find anyone else to do it, they will charge alot. I doubt he will block/cut her off when she finish helping his projects.

Also, according to everyone else he never spent that much time with anyone else other than me. However I knew this wasn't a good idea since I didn't hear all this from him. But then something happened and I stopped talking to him and he told me how he was hurt by that. I felt so bad but I was left speechless.

I just can't talk to him anymore now without being all nervous and uncomfortable cause of these rumors and I feel bad cause he's so damn nice. Should I honestly just speak to him and tell him why I stopped talking to him?

422,Long story short I work in compliance at a large real estate company. Administrative staff were all given a letter stating that we are essential to the health and safety of our residents to carry with us during our commute to work lest we are stopped by law enforcement. That’s all well and good however the letter states this is the case because without us they cannot properly clean and sanitize the buildings. We are not porters and per another email our direct manager sent we will not be performing those duties. We will be “taking this time without resident interruptions to work on filing”. I have spoken with many folks about this and they all seem to be in agreement that this is morally reprehensible and probably also illegal. I need a job in these uncertain times but am not sure what to do or how to broach the subject without being fired. I do not feel safe going to work because they ALSO want us to do financial interviews with residents which is so so irresponsible. Any and all advice is welcome.

I don't want to risk my health, I'm young (22) and I know chances are I'd be right if I got it, but why would I want to risk it? 
I have money and resources to support us through however long this could be, so that is not an issue. 

Also she is not a pharmacist, but the assistant to the pharmacist so in my eyes she is not entirely essential right now. And her wage is below average.

She lives with me in my house, but if this gets worse here where we are and it's time to quarantine and she makes the decision not to, we would likely get it.

425,"Back in November, my girlfriend and I broke up after nearly 2 years of being together, baring in mind I'm only 16, that was a long time, we met when I was 14 so I was with her through a lot of my development, and we were really really close. We broke up because I changed a lot, I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I didn't know this back then, and it was expressed through drug use and being a shitty person, and the relationship slowly crumbled. The nail in the coffin was when I started talking to someone else, I knew that my relationship probably wasn't going to recover so I had to break things off.

It's been ages since we broke up now, and she's got a new boyfriend, who she met literally 1 or 2 months after we broke up, which kind of upset me because she seemed to move on so quick, whereas even now I get upset if I see something that reminds me of her. I would say I'm mostly over her, but I still sometimes feel weird about her, like I half miss her and just half regret leaving her even though I know it was for the best. 

I know nobody can easily answer my question as it's probably different for everyone, but will I ever just not care? Or will there always be a part of me that's attatched to her?",23Mar2020,1

 Im gonna try to keep this as short as i can, cause it's a long story. So i had been seeing this girl, everything went great, up until she told me she still lived with her ex, cause she got raped as a kid, her father got murdered and she got kicked out of the house, so she lived with her then-bf who she claimed both fell out of love for each other. She said she slept apart in another room, barely had sex etc.. and since he mentally and physically abused her, she was just waiting for a job so she could move out. I was already invested in her, but was very hesitant cause of this. But she then looked me in the eyes, swore on her murdered father that she was being serious with me and would leave him and the house to be with me when she could. Since she said that, i decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and continue.

Fastforward 2 weeks later, she started to ignore me, probably also lie etc... she chose him over me so after a painful week, i decided to give up. Didn't talk for 3-4 weeks, then i texted her again, she was being rude, so i cut it off, then she added me on snap, but since she then said she needed time and we didn't talk for a month, i deleted her again. After a few days (yesterday) she texted me saying

'pure hypothetically speaking, if a girl friend wanted to earn money giving out bj's an sex, where and how would she best start, do you think?'

I thought to myself 'wtf? Why ask me? The fuck are you trying to do?' but i ignored it cause i figured she wanted to rub salt in my wounds so i just blocked her... this morning, she called me on the phone, which i ignored, but then it got to me, she just started living on her own, and had to pay for rent and her car... now im thinking she just can't pay for all of it and is being desperate for help...

What am i supposed to do here? Should i contact her, see what's up and maybe help, or should i let her be and maybe let her become a prostitute?

434,"I'm a 16F , I have grown up as an only child . Heres a little back story about my parents before I continue...

My mum is a very smart hardworker. She litteraly works so much, that sometimes she even loses sleep. She is my bestfriend, shes litteraly more like my sister. We gossip about everyone, shes the first person I go to when something has happened. She knows basically everything about my life &amp; has never judged me at all. She is the most caring person ever, if something is up - she will always get to the bottom of it, no matter how difficult it is. She put me in home school as she knew I had anxiety at normal school. She wants nothing but for me to be happy &amp; words can't even explain the things she would do for me.

My dad is more of the chill type, he is extremley goofy &amp; is known as the class clown at work. He hardly takes things seriously &amp; he is very opinionated. My dad is obsessed with fasion, weight loss &amp; he is extremley confident - maybe a bit too confident. He loves to show off to people that we are a happy family, and I'm not saying we aren't, but I guess I grew up with that badge of having ""such a great family"" that I kinda didn't realise anything that happened. My dad gets angry really easily, he would never hurt or hit us at all, but he shows his anger by going quiet, being sarcastic or just giving us 'that face.'

My dad has been getting a bit too much recentley, he has lost a lot of weight &amp; he sort of makes me feel bad that I haven't lost any at all. He tries to force veganism on me &amp; hardly ever cooks meals with dairy or meat for my mum &amp; I . He knows I have paranoia and he says things to me like ""Meat rots your body inside out."" He would never say that to my mum though. He kinda gets angry whenever I speak to him, he either dosn't listen or his body language &amp; face shows me that he is irritated that I'm talking. He only likes to talk to me if it's something he is interested in. 

I've had a boyfriend, hes 19M and we were dating for a year before we split up &amp; eventually got back together. My dad had nothing against him at all, in fact he really liked him but just didn't really like the fact that I was always at his house. I do home school, I am home every single day - going to his house is the only time I ever leave the house. I understand that he missed me being home, but whenever I am home it's like he dosn't want me there. We got back together, my mum knows... But not my dad. I stay at my boyfriends every Friday &amp; Saturday &amp; I just tell him that we are staying with a big group of friends. He seems to be okay with that.

My boyfriend is looking at moving out to an apartment 10 minutes away from my house. I never even dreamed of moving out at 16 but honestly, things at home have been pretty crazy. Every day when I leave my room, my dad is telling me to lose weight or to go vegan which really upsets me. He even judges me every single time I eat , so I guess I stopped eating around him. My mum &amp; I have brought this up to him so many times, but it's been going on for years now &amp; I have truly had enough.

I don't feel any happiness whatsoever being home anymore, the only happiness I ever feel is when he goes to sleep &amp; I spend time with my mum - otherwise I'm in my room the whole day, probably crying or starving myself. 

My mum has tried her absolute best to make him go easy on me, but he never does . I want to move out because home is completley draining me, but the only thing thats stopping me is leaving my mum behind. I don't know what to do. How can I work with this? What should I do?",23Mar2020,1

440,"**TL;DR:** Female friend broke up and we got intimate and now everything is bad.

**Background**  
I'm a male, late thirties, been alone most of my life, but I do have a few good friends. I'm not very social in that I hardly ever reach out to anyone, and I only talk when I'm drunk, in which case I don't stop talking. :-)

For several years I've had a female friend I really like, as a friend, because she just makes the world brighter. Everyone enjoys her company because she's so cheerful, funny, and occasionally a bit weird.

Recently she broke up with her bf, and I started to get feelings for her. I thought about her, and enjoyed her company when we hung out. I didn't make any moves because she just broke up and I don't want to make things awkward or worse, ruin a good friendship.

**The event**  
My female friend visited, and we had a great time. She brought booze and an overnight bag so she could spend the night, since last time we talked until the sun came up.

I drank way too much and things got serious. We got intimate, but I failed, miserably. I guess the booze turned my hard drive into a floppy. Again. Not long after that she went home. She didn't feel good.

Later she told me she felt really awkward, and it's too soon, since she only just broke up.  
I respect that, want to stay friends, and give her space if she needs it, but I don't want to lose her. She wants to stay friends too, and wants to be single for a while.

I really don't want to lose her.

**Back to the present**  
Her messages since last time have been short and missing that positive vibe they always had.  
I'm guessing she's not feeling well, obviously. I suppose in a way that's a good sign, but I don't want us to be awkward, and I don't want her to be sad.

So today I keep going over the events again and again and again. I keep thinking of what an idiot I was, and how I've completely messed it up. I shouldn't have touched her, I shouldn't have drunk that much, and I really shouldn't have gotten intimate with her.  
Maybe if I didn't do those things it would be alright. I would still be waiting, hoping to be with her, but at least I wouldn't have made her feel bad.  
Or maybe it would still be bad. Maybe we would have fallen in love the non-intimate way, which then once again would have made it awkward. I don't know. I can't change it anymore, it's too late.

Working from home, not being able to visit friends or family, and being the only one here doesn't help at all. Also, I don't want to talk about this with family; my mom is already really worried about the whole Corona thing.

I must admit though that writing this does feel a little bit better.

How should I handle this? Is there anything I can do to make it better?",23Mar2020,1
441,"I'm 15 (f) and I'm bisexual, I go to a catholic School which friend, we'll call her Sarah, also attends, ever since I came out in school a few of the people in my friend group also came out as big, the difference is i have only ever dated one person and the other bisexuals have dated most in our grade.

Me and Sarah dont know eachother very well but i have gone to her house before, she never really touched me as I'm pretty firm with people, i dont like being touched and that's pretty well known. The problem lies with the fact that she believes it's okay to touch me.

I had gone to a party and spent time with a boy (now ex), word got around so I think that's what made Sarah think im 'easy', I went to her house a few months after this, aka Saturday and she was acting a little weird.

We talked for a bit before I suggested that we watch a horror movie like we usually do, she agreed and put one on, not even five minutes later she was curled up to my side and holding onto me, I moved a boy and asked her to stop bit she still insisted on holding onto me. Eventually she suggested we go out onto the town and so we did, on the way back she insisted on holding my hand, she did despite my protest and at the time I was uncomfortable and her knew it, I had been uncomfortable the entire day.

I made up a crappy excuse to go home cause I was shaking, this virus going around also making my not wanting to be touched far more apparent. I got picked up and went home. When I got home I explained why I had to be picked up so quick and my dad told me I was in the wrong and that Sarah had every right to do what she done.

442,"Hello

Not so quick issue here. About two years ago I hit it off with a girl while working in the food industry and we quickly became good friends. There were a lot of red flags like volitility, manipulative behavior, etc. but as many of us do, I ignored them.

I feel like 99% of our bonding was because of molly. :/

She got me a job working for her father. I've worked there over a year, but only 11 months have been full time. I'm underqualified but still learning. My resentment with my friend has been building steadily this whole time due to the loud fights in the middle of the night she's had with her gf, and eventually giving me silent treatment and, upon me asking what happened, saying I'm the one acting strange. I've always been quiet and stayed in my room to avoid confrontation. 

Getting her to pay her portion of the bills was like pulling teeth.

Cut to yesterday, after we've lived together a year, she and her gf won't pay their portion of electric and demand I pay for internet. 

I am working in computer science under her dad, full time, remotely quarantined thanks to ole corona. Luckily I've moved out of the apartment we shared... Just have some outstanding bills to pay.

She said them not paying their 2/3rds was a cheap fee for cleaning the trashed apartment and room when I was the last to leave and cleaned out everything? They also stole a bunch of my dishes, swiffer, and hand vac.

 I have not declined to pay internet or anything, I've just ignored it. Thinking I'll take care of th electric with the gvt stipend. I told her nicely that I think we're better off not being friends. She said I may regret that choice, that she's moved on and forgiven me for ""throwing her away so easily.""

I can attach screenshots of our texts if y'all want. 

Sorry if this post is a mess. I'm anxious as hell about it, I feel like she might try to get me fired. I also know her dad recognizes she's been a problem child, though.... Barely any of her family willingly speaks to her except him, occasionally.

I feel like a moron for falling into this trap.

444,"I live in London with a girl, she’s just a flat mate nothing more. I told her I was going to start being in quarantine for prevention because I don’t want to get sick. While she understands and shares my worries, she doesn’t act on them.

In my isolation period, which has been 10 days now and counting, she went out repeatedly with her boyfriend, sometimes coming home at 7am.
She also went to France twice. 

She took a flight about a 10 days ago a came back the day after, and I was already not happy about it but overlooked the thing since I had just started quarantine.

About 4 days ago she took another flight to France and I was actually happy. Because at least she wasn’t putting me at risk anymore.

But I just received a message “Coming back”.

So now after spending 5 days in a country in lockdown (I don’t even know how she keeps coming and going, do they even enforce a lockdown in France or is it just a word?) she is just going to take a bus full of people, stand in line in an airport full of people, take a flight full of people, land here in London take train, bus, tube and whatever’s necessary and then what? 

What should I do? 

I told her a couple days ago that, if she were to come back, I would have to stay in isolation in my room for 2 weeks to be sure she doesn’t have symptoms.

I had made all of these birthday plans for this person's birthday which was going to be a three day thing, but after they had hurt my feelings, I cancelled everything. While at work, on the day of the first thing I'd planned, I was really upset and I was going to apologize to this person and tell them I hoped they had a good birthday even though all this had happened between us, but when the person approached me, I was talking to someone else and they turned this speaker on with blasting music. After this person walked away, I turned the music down a little so I could hear the person I was speaking to (we were doing a task and couldn't really walk away) and the person walked back over and turned her music back up even louder... I couldn't really believe it and I decided not to apologize and not to say happy birthday.. I was fairly upset by all of this and just left. Anyway, today is this person's birthday and I still stupidly miss this person even though they've treated me this way and I can't decide whether or not I should send them a text saying happy birthday or not...

446,"So. Yeah. My girlfriend walked out on us a month ago. She literally packed her shit and went while I was at work, just left behind a note saying she'd been cheating for a year and had moved across the country to be with the new dude. The relationship wasn't perfect and we certainly had some major problems but I didn't see this coming at all. I mostly blame myself. 

Our kid is 4. Thus far I've been telling him that mummy has just gone away to stay with a friend for a little while. But he keeps asking when she's coming back, or talking about things we can do when she gets back. He has nightmares 1-2 times a week and always wakes up crying for her. He rejects me on those nights because he wants mummy and her special song to soothe him and it isn't the same when I sing it. Twice he has gotten so worked up following a nightmare and asking for her that he's thrown up. There are days where he will literally sit for hours in our window watching our building's car park waiting for her to pull in. It's absolutely destroying me. 

I don't know how to tell him she isn't coming back without absolutely destroying his entire world.

She says she isn't ready to give up her dreams yet in the way having a kid forces her to, that she's too young for this (even though I'm 4 years younger than her) and that she hates how she ruined her life and wants a clean slate. She and her new guy are moving to the States once the travel restrictions are lifted. There's no chance she's coming back for either of us. I can't let my kid going on hoping she is.

450,"I broke the tenancy contract for my current property in the UK due to severe building issues and the letting office had agreed to do, and I was happy to finally find a property in the building that I’ve been looking at for a while.

However, I have been informed that we may possibly get evacuated within a few weeks due to COVID-19 back to my home country. 

It would be unfortunate to sign a new contract with the newer property but then get evacuated to my home country, and I’d pay upfront payments as well as the rents. On the other hand, it would also be unfortunate to wait a few weeks but then they may not evacuate us and the newer property could be reserved by someone else and I may have a hard time looking for a different one.

I can’t afford not to, and even if I was told to stay home, or if I got sick, they wouldn’t pay me for any lost time so I would be screwed.

I’ve been locking myself in my apartment if I’m not at work, but I’m starting to get frustrated and wondering what is the point?

Why not go to my favorite places to read or write in my journals? Their isolated from most people anyway because I’m an introvert with anxiety so I’m good at avoiding people anyway.

 The problem is he is very ""rough"" with everything in the house. He's always throwing his toys around/into things and the sofa which is also only a year old is looking really worse for wears with him always jumping on it and accidentally scratching it. I've used throws but he damages them as well when playing and usually digs on them (which is actually worse) to get down to the sofa underneath (I'm sure just to rub his hairy body all over). 
 Any advice appreciated, I'm afraid banning him from the sofa isn't really an option as not only would it be impossible to enforce but he sleeps in the lounge by himself at night and stays in there when I'm out and I'd much rather him sit on the sofa than find other less desirable activities to busy himself with.
 I've tried having a google but I'm just getting information on destructive dog behaviour with chewing/anxiety and not just general boisterous large dog advice.

459,"I met my girlfriend on the internet 2 months ago. We live 500 kms apart, but at least I study a little bit closer to her (320 kms). 

Yesterday, she told me about the things she hadn't told me before (or at least not the full version of them).

She was with this guy for 10 months. He's a criminal and this is how he makes a living, although she does not want to tell me what exactly what he was and is doing. She told me he has connections and is dangerous.

She loved him deeply, but he did something...horrible to her. I don't want to think about that. It's...horrifying...I can't get it out of my head...

She...Didn't break up with him. The only reason they separated a month after he...did that to her, was because he had to flee the country. He pissed off the people who have more power than him. 

It was two years ago. She didn't contact him. He even deleted all of his internet profiles. He kept sending her letters but she would just throw them away. But the thing that...devastates me is that...she missed him. She fucking missed him. This sadist, this psychopath, this subhuman piece of garbage who did that to her. For two years. Until she met me. Then she realized that she had been stupid and is now embarassed about her past. But make no mistake...I don't blame her in any way. Although it hurts me that she loved someone like that and that she kept loving him, I don't blame her. 

After he fled the country, there were two men following my girlfriend. He made sure he knew everything she was doing. If she went to a party and a guy hit up on her, those two would beat him up.

He kept doing his thing abroad.

A week ago, she got the tenth letter from him. Instead of throwing it away, she actually opened it and read it. He wrote that he knows where she lives, where she studies, where she works. That's how he knew where to send the letter, he knew that she was at her family's  home. He wrote that although he had heard that she doesn't want to be with him, it's not going to stop him and that he wants to have her again. The last sentence reads: ""I'm coming back.""

She said the she's terrified. No, not about herself, but about me. He doesn't know that I'm with her yet. But when he comes back and learns about me...

I told her that even if I will have something to defend myself with, it's not going to be of much use aganist two or more of his men. She said something that appalled me. She said that when it comes to more serious 'issues', he deals with them on his own. He's 6'4 and muscular. Everyone is scared of him. First, he sends people to ask around and get information. When he knows where to find someone, he does it on his own. No one has managed to resist him yet. I'm only 5'10 and not really well-built...I stand no chance aganist him.

She said that she will do everything to protect me. She said that she has an idea on how to do it, but it will put her at risk. 

I asked her about it. It was the first time she refused to tell me about something, even though I pressured her really hard. She didn't want to tell me about his 'business' and all of those things - she said it's for the sake of my safety. I tried to get her to talk about it but she didn't. The reason she gave was that all of that is still ongoing and that's why I cannot know about that. I think it might be about drugs.

But she let it slip that, apparently, the way she wants to protect me is by turning him in to the people who want to get him. 

I asked: 'What about the police?', even though I knew the answer. She said that it's not an option and she didn't tell me what she thought about it.

I told her to ask her friends for his number and call him. To make things clear to him, to tell him that she will never be with him again. She said she would do it.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared for her and myself.",23Mar2020,1

I kept apologizing, she didn't want to hear any of it and wanted us to either stay as just friends or not talk at all...she said ""i'm incredibly mad at you right now, you can't even imagine""...Me being the idiot that i am kept pressing her to accept my apology, and didn't really give her some space even though she literally told me ""I don't wanna talk right now maybe tomorrow when I'll be calm""...I kept making jokes trying to cheer her up to no avail, I eventually gave her the space she wanted, and we started talking the following day which was today and we started talking again like normal. You'd think everything is good now right? Nah, I can't get over the fact that I was so stupid to hurt her with my words, I can't get over the fact that that situation was totally avoidable, and I can't stop wondering whether we'd have gotten even closer if if weren't for what I did. I mean during the ""fight/argument"" she said ""i treated you in a very special way just like you and you hurt me so bad""...I mean even though we're back to talking normally now I can't get over the guilt, the fact that I hurt her makes me so fucking disgusting and worthless, literally considered hurting myself last night and couldn't sleep because of what I did.

464,"I have been seeing this guy for almost a year and frankly from the start things have been tricky as he was ending a divorce.

We met by chance and although he had not been with his wife for a couple years, the paperwork side of the divorce was dragging. At times this has caused difficulty between us as his stress has resulted in collateral damage for our relationship. He tries hard to separate stress, but it at times is unavoidable.

As I mentioned we met by chance and things are mostly wonderful. There are some things however I find difficult to understand and his lack of conversation, assurance and frankly inability to converse about feelings makes my understanding regarding matters more challenging.

I wont go into the varying things on my mind in this post, but I suppose I wonder:

how do I get him to be honest with me?

To recieve answers to questions I ask, without being dismissed 

To have my feelings dismissed?

It appears his past relationship was not the most joyous, however not only am I a different individual, from what he says I am the kindest person he has met! This of cors is lovely to hear, but there is still a level of mistrust I feel and the lack of communication at times, makes me feel shit about myself and as though he is hiding things....I obviously dont want to think negatively, but I say how I feel and he says he doesnt know how to react. 

I explain communication and openness is key and that even if embarrassing, as a unit we should be able to aid one another and rely on one another...but again this can be dismissed and or unheard or...meh I dunno.

The divorce is finalised and we tend to be ok...but when shit....fuck me - its mega shit.

Shame in a way we met during his difficult time, but I am also glad we met as I adore him. 

I just want to feel like we can talk openly and I have tried looking at TED talk videos even 🤷‍♀️ sad perhaps but I am seeking advice on how to make him open up with things I ask. Or open up to understanding my feelings 😒

472,"I wouldn't say my sister and I are super close, but we can share some private stuff with each other. Relationships isn't one of these things.

Mid last year, I met this guy on a dating app. We had a fwb relationship for a few months, then I found out he lied about his age and we went our separate ways. Fast forward to today, she finally brought (to what our family knows) her first boyfriend home. 

Yeah, it's the same guy. 

Apparently they had been dating for the past 4 months (would have been about 2 months after ""he and I"" ended). He's a genuinely nice guy. When I found out he was older, he told me he was really into me but was worried I thought he was too old, so he lied. 

I should probably make it clear that I've never had romantic interest in him, and I still don't. Also, he knew I had an older sister, but he didn't know her name or face since I don't have my family on social media, so I trust that it's all a coincidence that he happens to be dating my sister now lol. 

I'm not really comfortable with telling my sister that I've hooked up with her bf before since that's a topic we don't ever talk about, so it'd be super uncomfortable, but it's really bothering me that it's him. 

I'm uncomfortable knowing that he and I have had that type of relationship, but it's more the fact that he lied over something like his age to me, that makes me a bit wary of him.

I don't think I can exactly be like ""breka up with your boyfriend"". Unless I tell her the whole truth, she definitely isn't going to appreciate my words. Would it be better to just pretend nothing happened and let them be? Or should I risk causing tension between us, and them?",23Mar2020,1

474,"There is a full on argument right now between my mom and dad in the next room,
Background: last year I saw some texts exchanged between mom and a guy that mom works with outside her job , he's a good guy he works as a furniture tailor and overall a good character.
The texts were not what you would flag as cheating but they were flirt-ish I read it and panicked I was downed the whole day and I was conflicted to confront her.
I did confront her , she wasn't defensive she was ""shocked"" I ran through with the texts and said that I just didn't have the context for them and that she would never do something like that and if I feel bothered that she talks with him like that with one word of mine she would end any relation with him right here and then.
Well I told her not to,but for them to be more professional with how they communicate.
It ended there but that's what I thought.
Next day she told me that she wiped all of the texts off of her phone and I was furious and confused, my argument with her is that if she has nothing to worry about why wipe them. Her response was : if you're dad sees it, he's gonna get the wrong idea and it's gonna be a huge problem. *Not so sutile foreshadowing*.
As the days pass I see her talk in the phone alone and away from any of use ,she won't let me any closer that 5 feet away from her phone without blocking my view of what she's doing.
so on and so forth, I didn't mind cause I like privacy myself,but part of me screaming OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES. and I respond with it's my mom she assured me it was nothing I trust her. Looking back there was nothing I can do anyway.....
The main event:
So here we are today 30 mins ago my dad sees her alone talking on the phone with ""someone"" and he just can't take it anymore. So he asks her what,who and why. And she gives the a generic answer like nobody and it's business...so my dad rages and brings up all of the above points.so my mom gets defensive until dad says : show me the phone and I think ohh s*** while I am in the other room listening, next Thing I see is her running form dad and falling at my room's door and above her trying to grab the phone from her so I jump to help asking wtf is going on trying to separate them but too scared to do anything. So he takes the phone and tries to open it, he knows the password to open it but apparently she has put another password to what's app. I don't know it he doesn't know it and oh boy.
Here is the painful part........
I sat down back at my computer in my room and trying to get away from all of this.
Dad calls my mom's cousin which is the elder of her family currently and basically the my top figure of what a man should be he's an amazing old guy and I love him, he tells him to come over because something came up and to bring my uncle too......
All of this chaos all of this mess I can't take it.....
Mom comes to me panicked and scared shitless and looks at me and asks: is there any way to delete the phone's data, I look at her speechless:why would you want to delete the data, mom : can you do it?
Well I am gonna need the phone and--- cuts me of 
Mom:no can you delete it from her *points at my phone at the table.
.......
......
Mom: I know the locator thing you did it on my phone right.. you can do delete it using that app right?
.........
.......
Mom: I am begging you please do it
.......
.....
I was never this conflicted in my life 
And I mark this day as my crossroad, the day I had to choose between my mom and dad 
I ask what's the name of the app and she tells me.
I download it on my phone and enter her Gmail and password
The phone shows up and 3 options
Make a sound
Erase all data 
Shake the phone I think
I hover above the option with my finger and........I see my hand shaking and I look at mom and just tear up...
Mom:did you do it...
I look into her eyes and say why, what did you do
What did I do to deserve such thing how could you....
I push the phone at her direction and tell her don't make me choose between you and him... And I leave 
I went to the bathroom and just started crying....
She knocks and tells me that it didn't work and I am like
Wtf wtf wtf.........
I was ready to scream but no he would hear me so I go back to my phone and because it's in English they didn't know which option so I push it and it says are you sure
Well this is where I questioned my existence, my life and whether this is my actual mom I don't know who's she anymore I push the button and run to the living room
My dad asks me about something on the phone when I look the phone goes black in his hands and it starts a factory reset....

I'm a 16 year old kid and lost my father 3 months ago  on the 14th of December 2019 due to a industrial accident.

Backstory: My father and I don't live in the same state cause he has work. So I came back from a camp and got a call from him telling his usual stuff and we talked for a long time. Then the next day i woke up to my mom and sister crying that he died in a industrial accident. 

What's on my mind right now : To be honest, I don't feel like he is dead. Theres 5 stages to accepting something and i think after so long im still in that denial stage. I think i am in a denial stage cause i don't feel like he is dead and he is still working and just not at home. I am constantly reminded that he is dead but I don't feel anything cause i don't feel like he is dead. When i put my mind to try to comprehend i would just cry and cry for hours as the memories flow back and after that im back to denial. I don't know if this is normal but when i think about him i feel like he is a hallicination i have and he was never real. All the love he gave was just like a dream making me feel very distant from him. Also i feel guilty for not being a good son while he was alive , not saying i love you as much as i should to him and wasting alot of his money making him feel pressured by my spending. Does that affect my feelings staying in the denial stage? Should i stay in the denial stage and is it okay to? If not how should i go to the acceptance stage?

476,"I have never had any self esteem. I mean, ever. I cried very often as a child because I would see my older sister as better and prettier than me. 

My mom didn't fucking think much of it, I guess. Since I never got therapy till I did something drastic.

It's been about 3 years, and my therapists gave up on me. My first one said I'd do better with a trauma therapist.

The trauma therapist gave up after a while. I'm not even in therapy anymore, and I am doing very, very badly.

My mom wouldn't know that though. She sees me for about 5 minutes per week. Actually, that's about how much my siblings see me as well. 

To be clear, I live in the same house. I just hate leaving my room. This is my safe space. Anyways, I game constantly. I'm either gaming or sleeping. I call with my boyfriend almost all day, we're both best friends and partners. He's very sweet and kind, never made me upset purposefully. He's very supportive of me, says I'm his favorite person ever, calls me sweet names, and always tries to lift my spirits when I'm feeling down.

In the game we play, female characters are very, accentuated. Not to impossible proportions, but they all have perfect hourglass figures, and well-shaped ""other"" proportions. Sometimes he mentions how this one character is annoying as fuck because only simps play her, and when you play her she's constantly moving her ass right in your face, and it's ""distracting"". He also sometimes mentioned how the other characters had thicc thighs, and I just get so depressed when he says that. It's not a problem on his behalf, he's a good person. He compliments me much more, and says I have a beautiful body. 

But I'm just, garbage compared to women's standards... 
Sometimes I feel like blacking my profile on everything, and messaging him ""You can find someone better than I could ever be"" and just completely change my identity on the internet. That's the best thing about the internet honestly. 

Maybe I don't need friends, or a boyfriend. Maybe I don't need those 5 minutes per week of real human interaction. Maybe all I need is to block my doors, force the curtains to block every speck of light, and just sit in the corner for the rest of my life, waiting for the inevitable. 

I know I don't deserve them..

483,"I live in a basement apartment and my neighbours upstairs are truly a nightmare. They have a five-year-old with behavioural problems who is homeschooled (even before the pandemic) and a newborn that they neglected to tell the landlord about when submitting their application. Besides that, they are constantly stomping, yelling, slamming doors, and generally being so loud it rattles everything in my house. 

They’re also ridiculously selfish and inconsiderate. They take what is meant to be shared between us and hoard it as their own, they dumped garbage at my front door when I accidentally put a bag in their bin but continue to fill up my bins with their junk, they stole my parking spot when I was out of town for a funeral, and the list goes on and on. 

Needless to say, I’m going a bit crazy being trapped at home. I am this close to losing my mind and yelling at them, but I have to act polite. I will be slipping a note under their door today asking them to be mindful of noise while I write midterms/exams, and if I tell them off, I doubt they’ll be cooperative. 

 I’ve already spoken to my landlord about this and she has asked them to be more considerate, but if anything it’s gotten worse. I’m moving out in a month, but until then, any advice on how to put up with this while being polite?",23Mar2020,1

However, recently he has been having a lot of people coming by his house at each hour of the day and also I have come across people sleeping in the common hallway. The general vibe is very suspicious and some of my worries have been justified due to the fact that I had to call the police in the middle of the night a couple of weeks ago since he sounded like he was being attacked by one of his visitors.

488,"G’morning, here’s a head scratcher for you; so I had my boyfriend of 4 months over yesterday. We were going to lay around the house, watch TV, drink and make dinner. Perfect Sunday plans. We’re laying in bed watching a documentary, and I get a text message from a number that I don’t recognize. (I live in PGH, and this number is from over near Philly). It boiled down to this person telling me to stay away from my boyfriend because he is a liar, cheater, manipulator, etc and that I’m going to get hurt. I obviously show it to my boyfriend, and ask if he knows the number. He doesn’t. I asked if he has an ex that is mad, or if he made someone else mad recently. He said that he has not. Neither one of us know anyone from that side of the state. We tried tracing the number, and concluded that it’s one of those fake numbers you can make online to be anonymous. I texted the number back, and said that I believed they had the wrong number. All they said back was that they hope I take their advice, to which I asked what his name is, and they told me my boyfriends first name. Which spooked us out, rightfully. We have been low key about our relationship. I’m not on social media (other than reddit, which...does that even count? Lol). I don’t have FB, Twitter... anything. He doesn’t post pictures of me on his media, and only his family and close friends know about me right now. Same with me. I mainly just told my family and close friends. So we have no idea who this could be, how they know about me, or how they even got my number. I don’t believe the messages that I’ve been sent (rose glasses off...) because they won’t say who they are, or provide any story/evidence to back up their claim. I’ve also been seeing this man for 4 months now, and he doesn’t ask me for anything. All he wants to do is spend time together, and make dinner with me. He doesn’t ask me for favors, money, anything. I’d be a little more skeptical if he asked me to marry him, and took out a huge life insurance policy on me... but that hasn’t happened. So I have nothing to put this to. I’m going to stay in my relationship, but wasn’t sure if anyone had something similar happen? What did you do with it? And where do you think these strange messages are coming from?",23Mar2020,1

495,"I’m 16 and my parents are neglectful and sometimes abusive. Too many bad things have happened to me in my life including some really bad bullying. I’ve been bullied for 13 years over my name because it’s really different to names that are perceived as “normal” where I’m from and it’s also pronounced very strangely. My name is Letitia but people will call me Letisha, Letissue-Paper, Lettuce, T-shirt etc and I’m sick of it.

I was talking to my best friend last night and we had the idea that I start using a different name so I can distance myself from all of the negative things I associate with my given name. I’ve always thought of other names I’d rather have and they’re all very nature based. So my boyfriend suggested Skye because it’s “naturey” and he had also wanted to go to the Isle of Skye in Scotland because he thinks it’s a beautiful place and thinks I’m beautiful too.

When he called me Skye it made me cry out of happiness that finally someone would be so understanding and kind to me. But now I’m faced with the problem that my parents would be so mad at me if they found out I hate the name they chose for me although they spent no time looking through baby names, they just picked a name from the credits of whatever show they were watching at the time. 

I also want my friends to start calling me Skye too and I have asked my close friends to do so but idrk how some people at school will react if they hear people calling me Skye instead of my name. And I absolutely want to minimise the amount of times I have to hear my given name but how do I do that when I still have to go to school where I’ll be called my given name so much?",23Mar2020,1

501,"A little backstory. 

We’ve been together for about 4 years and we relocated cities together for a new start on our careers. Over the last four years it’s been pretty good, no major issues really. A lack of intimacy and sex started to develop probably midway through - I was open with him about it and said that I’ve experienced a loss of sexual drive within my relationships previously. 

About a month ago, we sat down and talked about moving to an open relationship because I knew I wasn’t giving him everything he needed. We agreed and it wasn’t really mentioned since. 

Fast forward to last week and I was on his laptop and I popped open Instagram and went to direct messages, I was expecting it to be my login because I used it earlier in the day but it was logged into his account. The top message thread was from some guy, local in the area. I couldn’t help myself so I started to read... and read.. and read.

They met over a year ago, they’ve had sex more than a handful of times, they have nicknames for each other, they talk almost every day. It broke me. 

He came home from work, I confronted him about it and how long it’s been going on 

He got upset and passive and said a few months. I asked him to try again. Finally the real number came out. He constantly told me that it was just sex and not romantic. 

I really wanted to leave that night but he begged me to stay, so I did... 

Now the last week I’ve been juggling in my head on what I can do. I have no real friends or family here in this city. My money situation is quite bad and due to coronavirus, it will be for some time .

I honestly have no idea what I can do right now. I’m not sure I can ever forgive him, he’s been very apologetic and visibly upset at seeing me so broken. 

The idea of leaving hurts me so much. But I feel like I can’t stay - can I give another chance or am I an idiot for even thinking that?",23Mar2020,1

In 4th and 5th, I remember touching and rubbing the thighs of the girls sitting next to me, thinking they wouldn't mind cuz we were friends and classmates. It would be on their skirt mostly, but this one time I even touched the skin and got till her vagina. With that girl, I remember trying to talk her sometimes into spreading her legs wider so I could touch it more. She did it for the first few times and then it eventually stopped.

517,"My dad has been acting like he has given up on life for a really long time now, but it disturbs and depresses me even more now as my mum is currently living in another city for work purposes.  
I want to start by talking about his unhealthy weight and habits that lead to that. His weight is 120 kilograms (which means about 240 pounds?) and it is a serious health issue (his BMI indicates that he is extremely obese and doctors say the same thing). Yet, he does nothing to lose weight. When my mum was here, we took him to different dieticians but he listened to none of them except one, who was pretty strict and made my dad lose a considerable amount of weight. He became enthusiastic about losing more weight and was suddenly more active, but he still didn't like her attitude (probably because she used to get angry with my dad when he didn't make any progress, which worked). The dietician soon transferred to another hospital, meaning we have no way of contacting her now, not even mentioning the impossibility of convincing my dad to do so. We thought that my dad was at least a bit more careful after becoming her patient, but he quickly gained back the kilograms he had lost. He never lost them again. Even before going to any dietician we used to speak really seriously with him about his excessive eating habits but he has always continued them. It isn't something we can prevent ourselves either, as he seems to be eating normally while we are eating a meal together (although he eats in large pieces and fastly) but he secretly eats in the kitchen. The fact that he is doing the cooking doesn't help, as it gives him more opportunities to eat. I really can't stress enough how many times we have talked about his obesity and how much importance we have given to it; we emphasised his insulin resistance, his inaction (he eats and sleeps most of the time and doesn't go upstairs even once in a day, except to go to sleep, since he is too lazy to climb the stairs), how it reduces his life quality (he also has problems in his feet probably related to his weight) etc. I am going to talk in detail about this in my next point but he keeps saying the same stuff (refusing the correlation between his weight and health problems), acts like he is finding us funny (laughing while we are totally serious), resorts to silence and seems to become sad when my mum gets seriously angry with him, sometimes gets angry himself and shouts, and often makes promises to lose weight and not eat much. Ofc, he is a liar and I have never seen him keeping his promises. He even denies that he is secretly eating unless you catch him red-handed. For instance, I was upstairs for a while and I couldn't see the loaf of bread, which was on the table before I went upstairs, when I came back. He vehemently refused to admit that he ate it and got quiet once I told my observation to him in detail. Sometimes, out of nowhere, he speaks really wisely and talks about how he is going to lose weight, how his weight is a problem to him etc. but he never manages to take action. He has no willpower whatsoever. I neither know nor have the time to cook, but I do my best to prevent him from eating much, although it is not efficient. I talked with my aunt to stop gifting us desserts (as I realised one day in horror that my dad has eaten a whole packet of pişmaniye, basically refined sugar, in a single night) and I tell my dad not to buy me ice cream or any such food (he is using me as an excuse to buy them to the house but ends up eating some, usually all of what he ""bought for me""). I also tell my dad not to buy more than a loaf of bread; he says ""OK"" to me but returns home with 2, usually 3 loaves of bread and tells me that ""we"" consume so much bread and one is not enough, tries to make me think I eat that much. However, when I am home alone, I barely eat a single loaf of bread in a week! As you can guess, he eats them, and they rarely last more than two days. I put the bread back in its place and clear the table to at least discourage him from eating, but I don't think it works that much either. I don't know how I can change a fully grown adult's habits if he doesn't have the will to do so anyway. My mum believes that we can still prevent him from eating excessively and talks with him every fucking time about this, ignoring the fact that he doesn't even act like he is listening.

Well that paragraph was certainly a long one, but I believe his eating habits are very influential on his general attitude. He is only 52 years old but acts like he is 65+. He keeps blaming people (usually me or my mum) for things that he does wrong or things that no one is even responsible of (such as dropping something, cats pooping in the garden etc.). He doesn't like his job because he didn't get the promotion he deserved and despises everyone in his office. He complains about it a lot. In general, he complains about everything. What makes them even more boring is that my father states them with the exact same words, every fucking time. Even when he discovers something, or has an idea, he keeps repeating it as if we have never heard it before. For example, he talks about how Germans will invent the vaccine for coronavirus, as if he didn't share the same opinion with me for the thousandth time. Or even more annoyingly, he frequently starts talking to me about my university plans when we already made a list months ago! I wouldn't have a problem with this if he had something new to contribute, but no. He tells me what I already know, what we already talked about. I sometimes correct something he says, but he even states that thing the same way he did the first time. Sometimes I tell him something, he seems like he is listening, but then sees what I said on the Internet and tells me about it as if I didn't know it already and I didn't tell it to him before. You get the point. He is careless about illnesses; he carelessly washes his hands (and rarely) and doesn't think he can become sick. But he usually gets sick each winter (even simple flu affects him heavily) and then he proceeds to complain about his sickness and blame whoever might have transmitted it to him. Even then, he is not concerned about transmitting it to me or my mum. It is the same with the coronavirus pandemic; he makes the same baseless claims about the government not sharing the full picture with the public (coincidentally true or not, he makes it up), complains about how his office is a great environment for the virus to flourish and thus should be closed temporarily but doesn't actually care about contracting the virus. He got a doctors' report to not go to work so he was home with me for the past week. He went to the market 5 times in the past 4 days, paying for it at least a minimum wage in total (I don't even know what he is buying, he is clearly not hoarding), ignoring what I keep saying him (he even gets angry if I insist). He also thinks Europeans and Americans are exaggerating the whole thing and doesn't even wash his hands unless I force him to, in which case he only allocates 2 seconds to! He keeps buying cologne and hand disinfectants to me and himself wherever he finds them, but he doesn't use them. Both me and my mum (on the phone) tried to convey the seriousness of the situation, but I am sure it is futile. I really don't know how we can convince him when he doesn't even care about everyone in the country taking the matter seriously. He becomes especially unbearable during quarrels; whatever you say, he keeps making the exact same ridiculous straw man arguments which portray himself as the victim or says things you heard before. You can tell what his next sentence will be, even the one he will utter once you point out how often he keeps repeating stuff.

This whole situation of my dad is making both me and my mum sad and depressed. We have cried together many times, thought of ways to change him, but never managed to achieve anything. Now that my mum is somewhere else, I have to witness my dad's lies and deal with him. I used to tell what my dad has secretly eaten or done to my mum, hoping her to find a solution, but she just calls my dad, quarrels with him and makes me seem like an arsehole who snitched. Yeah, those quarrels are fruitless too and only serve to make my dad sad, which is one of the reasons why I stopped telling my mum. But I can't do anything either, since it feels like I am talking to a wall whenever I start arguing with him. So I am usually trying to ignore what he has secretly eaten, his new habit of masturbating in the living room downstairs (he doesn't know I am hearing it), I am just nodding my head when he repeats something to me etc. but it feels like a heavy burden and I just want to get out of this house as soon as possible. Seriously, this is one of the reasons why I am looking into universities abroad and in other cities. My mum already has a stressful job and gets super-sad when she sees my dad like this; so I also try to downplay his problems when my mum asks me.

Don't get me wrong, we love my father and my father loves both of us. He shows his love with small gestures and those are the only moments I feel like he is alive and dynamic. We try to make him happy in his birthdays; occasionally take him to his favourite restaurants; spend time with him etc. He is happy when he is talking or meeting up with his close friends; he gets vigorous and seems to be self-controlled on those days, which is why we encourage him to do so. Nevertheless, with us, his actions often become intolerable. I think I am handling it relatively better than my mum, who still has hopes for my dad whereas I view him more or less as a lost cause. 

Sorry for the long post. What can I do to improve my father's life standards and make him fully aware of the consequences of his actions? How can I bring him back to life?",23Mar2020,1
518,"Please forgive me if this is in the wrong place. This is my first post on reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need help.

My wife is currently 36 weeks pregnant. She works full time as a registered nurse. She is concerned about working in the hospital while being pregnant. She has voiced her concerns to her supervisors and her OB doctor. They are not allowing her time off or the ability to work in an environment with different tasks that would limit her exposure with patients. If she wants time off she'll have to burn her PTO bank which she has been building to supplement her income while on maternity leave. I must also add that we have a daughter that isn't quite a year old at home as well. We are both nervous because so little is known about how this affects unborn children and what affects could be long lasting. The CDC guidelines basically say 'we don't know'.

Please help us figure out a path to take. It seems crazy to me that a hospital would have a pregnant RN working full time in this current global situation.",23Mar2020,1

I live with a high risk person, my grandma, and I am worried that coming to work I’ll pick it up from someone asymptomatic and bring it home and kill her. I have 6 vacation days, and 0 sick days.

They’ve done stuff like rearrange our cafe tables or station HR reps at the doors to take everybody’s temp and send them home if they have a fever but half the time the thermometers don’t even work as they just scan skin temp and they usually error out since it’s cold in the morning and it’ll make our foreheads cold.

522,"So I have been best friends with someone for about 14 years. We’ve had ups and downs but have remained friends through it all. Within the last 2 years or so we both have had falling outs with other friends and we’re down to just having each other to vent to, hang out with, support each other (minus our significant others). My problem is that she is constantly in a negative mindset. Any time we hang out she ends up venting for hours on end about all the bad things in her life. And how much she has no one and that I’m all she has and that she needs more. That no one understands her or gives an effort to try to understand her. Mind you I always drop every thing  for her and do everything I can to please her, because if I don’t she guilts me about it. Recently she was “diagnosed” with PMDD (I say it like this because she has been unwilling to do the tracking to truly diagnose it, and refuses to do either of the treatment options) . It basically means she has severe PMS symptoms along with anxiety and depression for the majority of each month. Ever since she blames everything on her PMDD. She thinks everyone and everything should stop to support her with her PMDD. No one can do anything differently than how she would do it without setting her off. And she is very hypocritical about most things in life. She will go up to 8 hours without messaging me back, but continues to use social media, but if I go more than 45 minutes without replying I get bombarded with texts to me and my husband, or comments on social media blasting me for using media when I’m not replying to her. But when she does it I get the “thought I replied” text. She is my only friend and I don’t want to lose her.. but I also don’t want to feel like I’m in a one sided friendship. And I know if I bring it up, we will fall out of friendship because of the way she handles things. What should I do? Am I being too critical? Or is my friendship with her toxic? Help!",23Mar2020,1
523,"  

So the backstory is that we are good friends, and have been for about two months. About a month into it she tells me she is not interested in me, but in a very respectful and kindhearted way. I tell her that is fine, as it was out of the blue. I had no interest in her, as I was getting over a recent break-up myself and was not looking for anything in particular. I notice that the rejection, if you could call it that, kept progressively popping up on my mind. I thought it was potentially just an effect of my childhood or abandonment issues. 

So after we hang out a few more times without group of friends, it is loud and clear that I really do like her romantically. This sucks, because I do not have a lot of friends. Worse than that, I have not had a lot of friends in my lifetime who have not taken advantage of my good nature and just wanted my company. She has helped me realize a lot of personal issues I have, as she has them as well. She listens and has been pretty cool about letting me tell her things, and vice versa.

This being said, I am not sure how to emotionally distance the romantic feelings from friendship. I do not want to lose her friendship because it is very important to me. If I am being quite honest about it, I am upset with myself for liking her after the point was established of there being no interest as well, even though I am aware that is a silly reaction.

525,"I saw this massage place just after Christmas last year, and the worker at the time was a bit gruff.

I had hurt my shoulder lifting some stuff in university, and she was just (as I thought) trying to fuck around with me.

As she was starting the massage, she asked me if I had Aspergers since I ""didn't talk to her"". I was silent a moment as I was entering the massage room, So then she was trying to scope me out and say that. I don't have autism, but then she has an issue with autistic people seemingly. Did she tell anybody else that, or did/does she select which ""seemingly autistic"" people warrant empathy? Surely all do, and those who select it should be punished? it seems fair.

She then went on some tirade saying that I should be open to change and forgiving. It was all random, and it was clear she just wanted to fuck with me.

So I left her a scathing review on her site, saying that she was just trying to mess with me as the ""dopey client"". I also posted on some other forums, and she saw the posts and then offered to call me to discuss it.

it turned out to be a misunderstanding - she said she didn't mean any offence at all. and I said she thought she was trying to fuck with me. so that's that. She said the review I left damaged her, so I feel guilty.

but I don't feel guilty in the sense that who is anybody to apportion sympathy for those who have autism? I'm pretty confident I will fail an autism test, but that's by the by. it was her intent. It's just she wouldn't do that to anybody else, so yeah...

526,"So about 3 years ago I started seeing this guy I met off a dating site. We got on well went on a few dates then my grandfather died and I went silent. I contacted him, apologised, we went out a few more times. Then a few weeks later my other grandfather died I went silent for a few days again contacted him apologised and was hit with “you told me that last month etc etc etc” got in an argument with him being in the vulnerable state I was in I blocked his number, changed my number, found all his social media’s and blocked him there too. He made a new account on different socials and tried to contact me but I blocked him there too. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, after suffering from a hard to diagnose autoimmune disease and finally getting into remission with it I signed up for another dating site to give myself a confidence boost. I get a message from a guy who looks suspiciously like this guy from 3 years ago but with a completely different name saying he liked me when we met up a few years ago and we should talk again. I reply and we start talking however his replies are sparse and he doesn’t appear to log on for a while then comes back. I add him on snapchat and he replies better on that whilst I pretend to vaguely remember him. He shares some information that confirms to me he was the guy from 3 years ago. I decide to unblock the guy from 3 years ago on Facebook and compare the photo from his dating profile to this Facebook page and lo and behold it’s the same person. The Facebook page has him as being engaged to someone well call her Miss X. I look at Miss X’s Facebook page and there’s posts from a few days ago wishing someone a happy birthday from Miss X and the guy from the dating site. Heck his Datsun profile pic is one with this girl cropped out of it. After discovering this I casually make a joke that it’s weird that I thought his name was something else. He brushed it off and says it must be someone else I’m thinking of. He’s barely talked since Saturday which i find strange considering he told me he was self isolating and not working and home alone. 

What can I do? Do I send his girlfriend a message on facebook to let her know he’s doing this? Do I try to confront him? Do I block him again and forget about it leaving his gf to be forever cheated on?",23Mar2020,1

529,"I honestly dont even know where to began so I guess I'll just start by saying that I'm a 21 yr old male that suffers from depression and it has been ruining my life so far. I started having it from the age of 15 and ever since, things hv just gone wrong for me. Because of it, I'm unable to focus , I tend to overthink and I lose myself, i become someone entirely else. I hv performed poorly in my exams during high school which causes my family to think less of me. I get taunted  every now and then about my failure in making them happy. They are a loving bunch dont get me wrong but I just hate how they blame me for something that isnt even my fault. I'm a bright person tbh, and I know damn well, I would hv aced it if I was just able to focus. This has been going on for almost 5 yrs now. Because of my bad results,I'm currently pursuing a degree in human resource, I was unable to be an engineer like they wanted to. Im doing well in hr so far, scoring 3.6 in my diploma but it wasnt enough to make them happy at all. I didnt get a "" congrats"" from anyone.They taunt me about the engineer stuff time to time too. Besides the family issue, I hv also lost a fuck ton of friends . I used to be the fun one in the group, but not anymore so I guess they all kept their distance from me since I'm not ""cool"" no more. I try my absolute best to fix things , to fix my relationship with my family and yet I dont see it ending up the way I want it to. I hv lost so much, friends, opportunities, respect. Idk what to do anymore. Also incase you're wondering, no , they dont know about my suffering.  I tried telling my mom about it but she didnt listen. I tried numerous times. I dont hv any sort of professional help either or meds, I deal with it myself. I see my life leading to a dead end and I truly feel scared for my future.

However, my girlfriend is insisting I fly to Switzerland and be with her before the country potentially shuts its borders entirely.   


Now, judging by the sharp increase in new confirmed cases and deaths in the UK it looks like we're definitely headed where Italy is now. So my instinct is telling me to get out while I can.

537,"Me and my wife recently separated (2 weeks ago) and we have 2 children (3 years &amp; 3 months old).  I have moved out to live in a flat that is geographically located very near to the family home.  

This flat is not an appropriate place for my children to visit or call any kind of home (no space for them, drug-using neighbors etc).  The big advantage of the flat though is that I can live there rent/bill free which allows me to continue to contribute a larger financial amount to the mortgage on the family home, where my wife and children plan to stay for the long term.  I'm supportive of this and would like to see them remain in that house but they are currently reliant on my financial contributions for this to be a possibility.  I'm happy to stay in the flat in the short/medium term whilst the dust settles on the split of our marriage, my wife gets back to work (she is currently on reduced pay during maternity leave) and I get a promotion (/pay rise) from work into a role that I am due to start in the next few weeks.   I would like to find a suitable place for my children to stay with me ASAP though. 

I accept that I will pay, in the longer term, an increased % of my income than child maintenance services will legally require me to if I would like the 3 of them to continue living in that house (which I do).

My real concern though is the potential damage I am doing to my relationship  with the children over the shorter term (or if not damage, the improvements I could miss out on) if I am not having regular overnight stays with them.   I am separately looking for a solution that will allow me to have a regular 1 night stay with my 3 year old daughter each week at a family members house and then introduce my son to this equation at a point where he isn't so reliant on breastfeeding - until can get viable long term accommodation. 

My current contact arrangement is:

Monday - 16:30 - 18:00 - see both after work - in the family home

Tuesday - no contact

Wednesday 16:30 - 18:30 - see both after work and do bedtime - in the family home

Thursday - no contact

Friday - 16:30-18:30 - see both after work and do bedtime - in the family home

Saturday - no contact - wife has agreed to get the children to video call me 1 time each Saturday, at a time that is convenient for whatever plans she has for that day

Sunday - 08:30 - 10:30 - see both in the family home - 10:30-16:30 - my time with my daughter to do with as I like. My son will join this time in the coming weeks/months.

The bit I would like advice about is what can I do on Sunday's with my daughter, given the whole Coronavirus situation?  Last week I took her for a hot chocolate, to play at the park, bowling, meal out  but all of those things are going to be difficult/impossible as the lock-down in the UK progresses.  Bringing her back to the flat for playing / films or whatever is a potential last resort option but I'm keen to make my time with her as engaging as possible (and to avoid taking her there if it can be helped).  My lack of options here is exacerbated by the fact that I don't drive so I am reliant on activities that are on a decent public transport route.  Staying in the family home all day is not a realistic option - this is difficult enough during my 3 visits each week to see the kids after work. 

I'm hoping that I can organise a regular day with a family member to allow me and my daughter to stay there each Sunday (and this will help the situation if it is possible) but in the meantime, or in the case that this is not possible, what ideas do you have to make this time with my daughter (and eventually son) as special as possible?

I don't know it's been going from bad to worse for a minute now and my dad doesn't do anything about it he just let her be and I feel like she's one bad day away from going really crazy and being the type of person she is, who denied me therapy when I asked she wouldn't self admit so I don't know sometimes she make me feel unsafe? my dad isn't any better as a parent but at least he's not crazy",23Mar2020,1
543,"So, I currently work two jobs, one full time and one part time. Both of these are considered essential businesses during the pandemic and I would agree. The full time I have no issue with continuing working at this time. The part time however is another story.

I currently work as a bagger at a grocery store and as everyone knows, grocery stores are being hit hard right now. I have worked this job for over 3 years and I honestly love my store, my coworkers and the majority of my managers and even the customers. They’ve been really good to me.

However, I feel health-wise unsafe interacting with the public so closely during this time. While I love my store and everything with it, I do think we have a horrendous sick time policy even with the help of our union. As such, I cannot really be excused to stay home for social distancing purposes without it counting against me.

I do not want to leave this job. I enjoy it so much that I kept it without needing to once I recently got this full time job. But I feel like maybe I should quit for my safety? I do not feel sick but that doesn’t really mean anything. Either I have it and it doesn’t affect me and I spread it to others without realizing, or I don’t and I could get infected still.

I also want to give them a 2 week notice if I leave because I feel like they deserve it, and I want to be rehireable as well as have a good reference on my resume. But I really do not want to go in and deal with an infected public during a pandemic. What should I do?",23Mar2020,1
544,"I work at a craft store in Indiana

We recently got a new store manager and ever since he started running our store he has not been giving me hours (even before the pandemic). I would say I have the best track record with customers being that I have almost 10 awards from how good of customer service I provide and in my entire year working with this company I have only ever gotten one singular complaint and it was even not my fault (thanks Karen.) My store manager has told me that if I don't show up at least 5 minutes before my shift to be ready to work then I will get my hours cut and he told me that I'm not the only person who doesn't have hours on the schedule and honestly it's not true when I look at all of the schedules and compare them I'm the only one who isn't there who should be on the schedule and I've heard him talking about how he knows who he wants in the store and he doesn't and I feel like there is some sort of rule or law against this I just would like to know would emailing my district manager be the appropriate thing to do and address this issue or am I over reacting?",23Mar2020,1

547,"My mom and I have a very complicated relationship. Sometimes, we can be the best of friends. She is really a fun, charming funny person. But i went through a period with her where she was very emotionally abusive. From when i was about 12-16  or so. She would tell me to my face things like ""im gonna break your spirit. This is a battle of the wits that i will win. If you dont respect me, you will FEAR me."" 

Well I've always been headstrong and so those plans didnt exactly work out for her. I never bowed to it or showed weakness and she felt that it was disrespectful that i never submitted to that. Even as a kid, i knew that it was fucked up, backwards and the wrong way to be handling your kid, even if they actually were unruly. In the same token, i was suicidal because of the way she incessantly bullied me because i couldnt think of another way out. Which she says is a lie now that I've openedup about it, i was just crazy and didnt want help and now want to blame her and make her sound evil because its convenient. 

Im 27 now, and pregnant with my first child. My boyfriend and i have been living with her until we can find a place (hard to find housing around here). This is my first time living with my mom since age 16 and the abuse has been more apparent than ever. 
  She played a big part in breaking up a marriage i had a few years ago because she could not keep her nose out of it, she and my ex husband used to call each other to discuss me, then after, she would call and berate me about how i need to be a better wife. I asked them both several times to stop and they didnt, so i left him and didnt speak to her for a long time after.

She attempted to get in the middle of things with my current s/o, but i had already warned him about it. And basically whenever he does right by me, she accuses me of bullying him into it. For example, she suggested a name for my daughter that i openly disliked. She kept pushing it on my s/o and when i annouced what we are going to name her, she told me that i must have twisted my s/o's arm because HE liked the name SHE picked (he didnt). She is already questioning me about my s/o's religious beliefs (me and my s/o aren't Christian) and the way we plan to raise our child because she thinks its wrong. I finally told her that it is exactly zero her concern and to stop asking him about his beliefs if she didnt like the answer.
  
So i already see where things are headed. 
Ive also tried to talk to her about the abuse from when i was younger and she gets beside herself yelling, being physically aggressive, calling me a liar and telling me all of the drugs and partying i did in my 20s must have put memories in my head that dont exist.. its important to note here that my mom knows me to be very honest. I was that kid who would tell the truth knowing i would get into trouble. She trusts everything i say, except when it pertains to her.

  Now my concern is for my daughter. My mother has consistently disrespected my boundaries and tried to play people against me, so im giving my mom an ultimatum. Either go to therapy with me and let me talk, respect my boundaries and my sanity (i am NOT crazy and will not have someone telling my child that) or never know her granddaughter. I know she'll try to play that against me too, and i feel guilty because I know that my mom will love her. But i refuse to have someone sabotaging my relationship with my kid with their own toxicity. Im at such a loss here.",23Mar2020,1
548,"So my dad’s girlfriend and her two kids live with my father and since the Covid-19 outbreak her and her teenagers are ignoring all the necessary precautions to avoid contracting it and passing it along. 

Just last week she was going to allow her children to travel out of state for a week to go on a vacation with their father. My father was against this and said if they must go that they should quarantine at their father’s house for a few weeks upon their return from travel. Fair enough right? He voiced his concern to my sister and I and we intervened; letting her know that this needs to be taken more seriously and the kids shouldn’t be traveling and then come back to my dad’s house and possibly transmit the virus to him. We are concerned because my dad is 62 with asthma and a chronic cough he’s had for years. She got upset when we got on her about it, but ultimately told her kids they weren’t allowed to go. Yay

Since then though she hasn’t been taking this seriously and is still leaving the house for more than just grocery shopping/medical visits - as our area has been advised to do. Just this morning she wanted to take her daughter and look for a new car for her (the daughter already has a car). She is also still allowing her daughter to interact with her boyfriend who works at the grocery store in town. My dad put his foot down today and told his girlfriend that she shouldn’t be going out to do unnecessary things at this time and that he is worried about her daughter transmitting the virus through contact with her boyfriend who’s being exposed every day at work.  Her response was that she didn’t want to change her life and that maybe her and the kids would go move in with her parents for the time being. Her parents are 70+ so that’d be putting them at a higher risk too...smh.

I’m just looking for positive ways to address this issue with her to make her “see the light”. She has watched the news and knows the horror stories, but it hasn’t seemed to phase her yet and I certainly don’t want her wake up call to be if/when her, the kids, or my dad contract it at which point I fear it will be too late.",23Mar2020,1

550,"Hello all!

I hope everyone's doing well in these trying times. This is actually my first post to Reddit, and I'm coming right out the gate with tons of vulnerability. I am failing my first year of college, and not because I'm not capable. I don't care, and I have a lot of really bad habits. I am coming to the conclusion that I am not ready for formal study, considering my insomnia and poor lifestyle.

I want to form a plan, and I could use all the help I can get. The health class I took in high school says to approach everything from simplicity, to avoid overwhelming myself. My loose goals entail, writing reflectively, researching my interests to take my education into my own hands, establishing a healthy diet and sleeping routine, and most likely pursuing a job in the trades.

I figure a good place to start is to turn to family and ask to be mentored. Before I apply for any apprenticeships and double down on my career, I want to establish a connection with the youth. My baby cousins are bastions of wonder and awe, and the best students I know. I think I have a lot to learn from them, and to teach as well. Their perspective should help me build a framework for my research.

I am a skinny, but healthy 18 year old male. The basic framework for my diet in macronutrients look like 50% carbs, 25% protein, and 25% fats. I weigh 70 kilograms, so I'm aiming to consume 3,500-4,500 kcals to maintain a caloric overload. I want a training regimen that is functionally focused and that does not require equipment. Any educational resources would be appreciated.

I have a lot of books to busy myself with, and when I was a little I read like 20 minutes every hour. My memory isn't as good as then, so I think coupling reading on my downtime with summaries in my journal should help me retain the info. I want to read historical narrative, short stories, poetry, mythology, and folktales for pleasure. I could use academic readings about childhood development and the brain. I have a bunch of anatomy and physiology resources to reference as well.

Reflection is very important to me right now, because I have a lot of anxiety about my memory and ability to learn right now. I don't think there's anything wrong with me, but sometimes I obsess over details and never manage to understand the big picture. I feel that classical conditioning exercises could help a lot with the anxiety. Learning about the memory acquisition process might help put things into perspective as well. Anyways, to reflect I would like to take 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening to journal. I would love to hear some prompts, or advice in the area.

Unfortunately, I am interested in a lot of things. I think I have a lifetimes worth of study ahead of me. It will be impossible to realize if I never get a hold on my sleeping habits. 11pm to 7am is my goal, but I will have to work up to it.  That leaves 16 hours of wakefulness to balance all of this stuff with a full time job to pay for food and housing. I'm not sure about jobs, but I might apply for an internship on a farm with 8-10 hour work days. The other appealing option is to work as an apprentice with a carpenter/welder. 

My career interest right now is Environmental Engineering, and Data Science. My dream of dreams would be to build an environmentally friendly farm and analyze water systems in relation to ecology and agriculture. I know, it's lofty. But, 16 hours a day is quite a lot of time.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, any and all help will be appreciated!",23Mar2020,1

552,"I decided to go down to my home city because my boyfriend wanted to bring me down (he currently lives in my home town) and i was still away at university hours away. My parents told my that if I let him drive up and get me and I stay with him, that they would cut off all financial support, and most importantly, stop paying my rent for my apartment so that I can attend university. However, I do have a full scholarship for university and they do not cover tuition whatsoever. I told my boyfriend he could spend time up in my apartment instead and I’d cover the shifts he’d be missing at work. My dad ended up calling me and told me that if my boyfriend stayed at my apartment during the pandemic, he’d do the same thing and cut me off. I called my boyfriend and panicking, told him to turn around. He told me that if I didn’t come down with him, which is what he believes is best for me, that he’d break up with me for not taking care of myself. He told me my parents were bluffing and I decided to just say f it and go down home with him. His mom drove us home and my parents lost their minds and cut my credit cards, all streaming services, my phone service, and told me they would no longer pay my rent. I hoped it would blow over and only came to my hometown to not have my boyfriend break up with me. I spent almost a week there and was texting my parents a bit, trying to convince them to not cut my rent. 

My dad gave me an ultimatum that in order to go back to my parents place and fix this situation (have my rent paid at university so I can attend school) that id to break up with my boyfriend and quarantine for 14 days because I may have been exposed. He says that because he still supports me in college, he has the right. They have always disliked my boyfriend because I tended to push their rules and limits, but I’m 19 and think that while they may not agree with me coming to our city, I have the right to make my own decisions as an adult. He says I can, but he will disown me. I agreed to his conditions and left my boyfriends place last night. My dad told me that if I brought up my boyfriend and tried to convince them to not make me cut him off, they’d bring me back to his place and disown me. I agreed to come to their home only so I could try to convince them. When I tried, they started driving me back and I begged them to keep my apartment and not move my things out. They gave me another chance, but my boyfriend is going to break up with me and block my number if I don’t get in the car when he comes to pick me up today. He thinks that they are abusive and are forcing me to do what they want and he says that he will pay for our own place in the university’s city and take care of me. He is extremely poor and I have doubts. My parents have no financial difficulty in taking care of me and covering my rent and food. I don’t want to lose my parents and a secure feeling that I can attend school, but I can’t lose the love of my life. I’m absolutely devastated and am forcing to choose between my parents and my boyfriend. I will get love and support from my boyfriend, but my parents will give me financial stability and security. And my parents have health insurance and can cover anything Incase I get ill or get into an accident. My boyfriend unfortunately lives with his family paycheck to paycheck, and while I love his mom, I don’t know if I can get in that car and turn my back on my parents and all they can provide me with. I worked very hard to get a full scholarship for university and deserve to attend, and I don’t want to struggle for the rest of my life and be forced to work through school just to keep a roof over my head. My parents will also remove all my belongings from my current apartment and move me out so that I can not retrieve them or ever enter again. I don’t know what to do.",23Mar2020,1

555,"A podcaster hit me up a few months ago, wanting to do a podcast about me and the sport I practice. At first, I did not want to and told him that I did not have time.  

Fast forward to today, and I thought to myself that I could go through with it in order to overcome my fear of being interviewed and recorded.

Unfortunately the podcast turned out to be really awkward, for me at least, and I deeply regret it. The interviewer told me that he will edit the podcast and it should be out next week. 

Knowing that quite a lot of my friends will listen to it, I’m now considering coming up with an excuse to not let the podcast be uploaded. 

I desperately need advice from you guys! 
What excuses could I come up with, which the interviewer would not immediately doubt?

(the podcast was quite short, about 30 minutes, that is why I would not feel bad if it would not get uploaded)

557,"Hi so 21F also living with a 21F in apt. So I brought my TV from my apt last year and put it in the living room and then also bought the couch for the living room by myself. This wasn’t an issue at first but my roommate spends ALL. DAY. Sitting on the couch with TV on in the background doing HW. and I literally NEVER get to use it. When my bf comes over for a date night (I see him like one weekend a month bc long distance) we can’t even sit to watch a movie or have dinner sometimes and have to spend our time holed up in my room with a laptop. It used to be just mildly annoying but now with quarantine when I actually want to use the TV for at home workouts or to watch a movie on the TV and take notes on my laptop for my Film Class but for example yesterday from the time she woke up 11am she was using both until she went to bed at 3am. I’m also in a PE and dance class which now require us to log workouts/stretches so I literally have to use the living room bc my room is too small. I’m someone who also separates sleep from study so I need an area I can work in/do classes outside of my bedroom to keep me sane during this time but with the TV running all day....To too it off, when she takes naps she doesn’t go to her room, she stays on the couch so then I feel like I have to tiptoe around when I do leave my bedroom or come home. she’s literally on it 24/7. I don’t know how to bring it up without it becoming like an issue or her thinking I’m overreacting over nothing but if this lockdown gets any worse to where I can’t go outside etc I’m going to lose it feeling like the only place I can work, eat, workout, is my bedroom. I’m a super shy and non-confrontational person so this is superrrr nerve wracking for me. I don’t even need a lot of time it’s just more of a “hey maybe when you’re napping or you’re just sitting on your phone or shopping or whatever can u do it in ur room so maybe I have a chance to use the tv and couch”",23Mar2020,1

559,"Alrighty folks need some more advice. Not sure where exactly to post this, so it’s going multiple places. 

Backstory, I’m a 20 year old female, just started my first job (8.50 an hour) the people are so nice and fun to work with. It was a serious fight to get my parents to let me get that job, they still won’t allow me to go anywhere alone, date my boyfriend, and they monitor and restrict my phone. They’re very conservative Christians, and while I am a Christian too, the control is an issue. 

I have a boyfriend who she can’t stand, she doesn’t know we’re together. He’s an amazing guy, treats me so well, had stuck with me through so much. He’s a Christian, I won’t go into details, he is not perfect but nobody is. We screwed up over a year ago and they won’t give us another chance. It’s super complicated, but they don’t want me to be able to talk to him other than imessages (which they have my phone paired so they can see). No calling, facetime anything like that. I see him once a week at church, and now that this quarantine stuff is happening, it’s been 2 weeks. They think everything I do is for him, that he is brainwashing me and while that’s not true, it’s what they think.

I want to get access to my bank account. I have some (around 2,000) in savings, but I don’t have the info to access it. I worry that if I ask for it, my parents will get angry and try to ask why I need it and stop me from getting to it (when I was begging for a job, my mom said that she provides all I need so there’s no reason, I think the same will happen with the bank account). 

I want a car, not an expensive one but something that runs that I can be safe in. My parents drive me to work and church and to hang out with my friends, so I don’t have a valid need for one (other than trying to get one so I can leave). I don’t have my license yet, the insurance is expensive for our car, so maybe if I bought my own car that could be my excuse?

The phone thing is a big deal with my mom. No social media at all. I want to buy my own phone, but know it will be a deal breaker with her. She calls it “accountability” but it’s just another way of saying “I want to know everything you do”. 

I’m so lost on what to work on or what to fight her on, I’m tired of living here like this. I’m treated like I’m 15. If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it so very much. I can give details if you have questions.

My parents are controlling and I need advice on how to bring these things up with them and get more control over my life.",23Mar2020,1
560,"[20M] I’m taking a gap year from college at the moment, because I stopped having the drive doing the things I used to enjoy. I’ve never had a life, because I lived in a hoarder’s home and was never allowed to step foot outside of it unless I went to school. 

I spent a lot of my childhood killing free time on a lot of random hobbies. Since I lived in a hoarded space and had people always screaming in my home, I felt limited from reaching the potential I wanted to achieve as a kid. 

Nowadays, I wished I had pushed myself more, because I’m stuck in a rut at the moment and have barely scratched the surface of all my hobbies. I want to pursue a career with them, but I don’t know which one I want to pick up from where I left off. Also, all of my hobbies are very competitive and I don’t even know how to make a career out of them. 

——————————————————

Here are a few of my interests: 

- Filmmaking/Editing: 

I used to watch a lot of old movies my dad rented from the local library, and we’d watch them together. I also wanted to make YouTube videos when the website first started out, so I would use my sister’s camera and make terrible comedy skits. I taught myself how to edit footage in a lot of programs that are considered outdated by the film industry. 

Even though it’s tiresome, I love the process of working on film projects endlessly until I’m satisfied with the final product. The problem is, I know next to nothing about good screenwriting/direction, the technical aspect of making movies, and have connections at all. I’m also broke, so I don’t have a proper camera to begin with. 

- Music Production/Composing/DJing: 

I started playing piano when I was 6, and violin in my high school orchestra. I spent a lot of my free time learning classical pieces without a proper foundation in theory or technique. I took a music theory and piano/violin performance class in college, which made me realize just how little I knew about it compared to others. I know how to read music notation better than I did before, and have a better understanding of basic chord structure/progressions, but there’s just so much to take in. Everything was just too difficult for me to understand, because I was so conditioned to just using my ears. 

The only I thing I knew how to do was produce hip-hop. I spend all of my free time nowadays e-digging for samples and making beats/DJ mixes. They’re not very good, and I feel stuck in a rut knowing that I’ll never be as good as my favorite artists. I feel like I’m just making boring loops with no actual feeling or substance.

One of my dreams is to compose for movies/video games, but I don’t think I can ever fulfill it if I don’t have the proper training/education. If I ever had the opportunity to make a movie, I would want my hands all over the music direction. 

- Martial Arts/Dancing/Skateboarding/Drawing/Gaming: 

These are just random hobbies that I don’t think I would ever pursue in a career, but they all took up a huge part of my childhood that I spent alone doing in my room. 

I was obsessed with skateboarding from ages 9-13. My dream of becoming a pro skater was crushed after everyone I knew told me I sucked. I just couldn’t progress because I wasn’t allowed to go outside, and would have to practice in private in the kitchen. Giving up skating forced me to pursue another outlet to jump around, so I took up martial arts instead. 

I loved practicing martial arts, and would spend hours watching and trying to replicate the choreography/stunts of my favorite martial arts movies. Martial arts also introduced me into dancing, specifically b-boying (breakdancing). I spent a lot of my free time in high school learning powermoves and doing flips. I gave up when I was 16, because I became bored of it and learned everything that I wanted to. I became very depressed around this time and spent most of my time sleeping. 

I also draw a lot, but I’m not very good at it. I played a lot of video games too and considered taking up game design as a hobby, but it seems way too stressful and demanding. 

——————————————————

Those are pretty much most of the hobbies I was interested in. At the moment, I’m struggling with severe procrastination and laziness. All I do is sleep and I don’t really have motivation to learn. Even if I did, I don’t know where to start. I had so many hobbies that it’s impossible for me to just pick one. I feel like a jack of all trades but a master of none. 

I was planning on getting a full-time job to make money for something I want to pursue in the future, but the coronavirus pandemic put that idea on hold, and I just don’t know what I want to do in the future. Realistically, I believe that I don’t have a good work ethic and am not intelligent enough to make it far anywhere. Apart from making beats, I spend most of my time in bed sleeping. I’m trying to fight the depression, but it’s getting the best out of me. I don’t have any friends and am living with my parents at the moment. I don’t have any money of my own, I have no social skills, no goals etc. I’ve felt very low for years, but now I want to fight back. There’s just a big problem though. 

I’m just confused with what I want to do with my future. 

TL;DR - I have a lot of hobbies but don’t know which to pursue for my future. I’m also pretty depressed and just sleep all day. I’m very confused at what I want to do in life.",23Mar2020,1

How do I go about asking for a raise during this time? Do I even bother? I can provide more information if needed.",23Mar2020,1
562,"TL;DR: For years I've built up this disdain for how men are. I tried going online to find good friends. I found guys who more or less have problems with women. Our friendships never end well, and I think I'm starting to associate these feelings with hatred.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I hate to say it, honestly. For years I looked at incels and feminazis and went ""How is that possible? How could you hate someone on the basis of their gender?"" I thought it was absolutely insane.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think for years now, I've just been building up this disdain for men. The first feeling of disdain would have to be my deadbeat father. My family values boys and treats them like kings, and they let *everything* slide when it comes to them. (For example, pedophilia, hygiene, murder threats, etc. But the women can't even think imperfectly. They just have to be housewives and be submissive.) So that's yet another reason. And those two alone have so much involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I've started to venture, I guess you could say. Many of my friends are online, and most of those friends are males. I don't exactly know why. I feel that the lack of men in my life caused me to pursue them more. Unfortunately, it appears that I've found men who've been broken. Many of them were past incels, still have some hatred for women when it comes to dating, or just grew up in a household where women were considered weak and unimportant. I feel like you can change in those circumstances, but there will always be a tinge of those past ideas, if that makes sense.

I think I did stuff that was above my paygrade. I tried to become a beacon for these guys to talk to. When it comes to most of my friends, I tell them ""I want to support you unconditionally"". I always tell them that I'm there for them to talk. And they do. And I'm fine with that. I think that we're friends. I do anything and everything for them.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's it, it seems. More often than not, after I listen to some guys for days, weeks, months, they discard me. Sometimes they'll be extremely nice to me for a bit, and then it just dies. It feels like they hate me. I've had a few friends who've literally told me that I should die, or tell me that I'm annoying and they're sick of me. Its always under the guise of a joke, but that's all they tell me. They never want to listen to me. They'll openly support other women, other people, but when it comes to me, they outright tell me that they don't care about what I have to say.

Just yesterday this happened. I don't want to get into details exactly, but I've realized that to some of these men, I'm just some.... crackhead therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

And that is what gets me so angry. I'm being selfish, I feel. I'm getting mad that these people don't feel the same way I do. This is what has happened in most of my friendships. I put in all of my energy, and people just love it, and then all of a sudden I'm garbage. Have I set myself up for failure? Am I just a coddler?

&amp;#x200B;

But in short, I think I've started to associate these feelings with just men as a whole. I've been grumbling to myself about it lately. I know men aren't all the same. I know there are good people out there. I know the people I talk to are just as broken as I am. But I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of sullen, cocky men stepping on me. My dad just takes and takes and takes. Most of the men in my family just take and take. And now, my male friends are just taking from me. I don't want to hate men, but all of this? I just am sick of it at this point.

What am I supposed to do? I don't want to throw away my friends, even though they don't care about me.",23Mar2020,1

I would like to be in Boston because I live downtown and I think the healthcare is better here (though expensive but I am insured). I’d love to start a garden and continue going to the beach (alone of course). My roommate is annoying though and doesn’t get boundaries. I’ve lived here months but that issue was ignored because I stayed out all the time. With the quarantine, she’s around all the time.

565,"So last week my AC was out and it was getting pretty warm, so I finally put in a maintenance request for it on Friday afternoon. The maintenance guy comes around 5:30 PM on Friday (to my surprise), and he makes a comment implying he's somewhat annoyed I put the request in so late? Anyways, the AC gets fixed, only to go out the next day where I put in another AC request and now they're saying they'll only come if the temperature outside warrants it (for reference, I put in this request on Saturday, and it still hasn't been fixed as of Monday noon). In addition, they claim how the maintenance guy claimed the place was messy (which was true, I was getting a lot of supplies due to the outbreak and there was stuff everywhere), but he also claimed he had to move some trash to do the repairs he did (highly unlikely, the only thing around that area was a box of peligrinos).

I'm in my first year, second semester of college. Around last week or so, I kind of... mentally checked out on account of stress, some of which on part of my own personal stuff, and partly on all the coronavirus stuff.   


Integrating all of my classes into an online format is unappealing at best to me. In reality, I can't keep up with the constant bombarding of my non-tech-savvy professors' emails who get confused with the online format, and I have trouble keeping up with the material without physically being in class for lectures (we haven't had online lectures either).  


And, on account of my mental health taking a dive, I lost sight of coursework that was due last week. I missed two essays, some coursework, multiple pages of reading, and today I have a midterm essay due that I completely lost track of. On a few occasions, I tried to open my work and ended up staring blankly at the screen. I was too overcome with anxiety and stress to begin to even focus on anything.  


I've just started to become ""normal"" again after my breakdown. Today I checked the work I had. *Then* with the added stress of having late work, I became extremely mad at myself for checking out and missing said work, and then checked out *again* because I was mad at myself for checking out (lmao).   


So, what should I do to get back on the saddle?",23Mar2020,1

582,"My girlfriend and I recently just had a beach trip. Our stay had been very pleasant with no inconveniences. It was pet friendly. We brought along my girlfriend's dog, payed the pet fee, and notified the host exactly that.

As we checked out, we went through the check out list provided by the host in a booklet and made sure we did everything that was asked. One of the requests was to not wash any linens in the washer/dryer that was present in the unit. They would take care of that themselves and instead to just place all the linens in the bathtub. Check.

By the next day my girlfriend got a notice through Airbnb that the host is requesting $100 for ""eight bath towels were completely destroyed !!!"" The host provided a picture of the bath towels laid out on the floor with a further description ""stains were not removed by washing with bleach"".

Now to describe the towels. Right off the top of my head before seeing the picture I thought, yes we did have a few dirty towels, but destroyed? The first was, we laid a towel down outside the shower tub for us to step on as we got out. Her dog also liked to come walk in the bathroom as we showered and walked on the towel where he provided paw prints consisting of dirt/sand that would have probably been tracked in from the backyard.

The second, we came back to the condo to realize that water was leaking from the freezer. Fridge is split vertically. Its probable we didn't shut the freezer all the way on accident. I grabbed a towel to wipe up all the water on the floor and placed it under the freezer door to collect any more water that would leak out. After some time the freezer was back to normal and no more leaking.

The third is simply my girlfriend used one of the smaller towels to assist her in removing makeup. The same as she does at home and has no problem getting them clean again.

These towels are apparent in the picture alongside other towels that I have trouble distinguishing what the issue is. NONE of the towels show any tears, rips, or any other changes to the integrity of the towels. Which there wasn't! The dog never got a hold of them to do any damage. Should note also, the provided picture looks like they had not even attempted to wash the towels yet. If we had known this would have been an issue, we would have washed them ourselves but didn't because of the aforementioned request.

So now we are here pondering how to proceed forward with this claim. We want to reject the request. We are not exactly in the position to shell out another $100 especially with what's going on in the world currently and the effect it has with our jobs. It may be a modest amount in other cases, but they were obviously not expensive towels, and it's almost the amount for another night at the place!

Are we right in our argument? How do we respond to the matter?

Any advice or personal accounts and how it was handled are appreciated! TIA",23Mar2020,1

598,"He was a boy, I was a boy. Can I make it anymore obvious?

---

So, here is the thing. I will explain our relationship from the start.
On 10th grade, he was homophobic, and I am gay. So that resumes 10th grade. He would not talk to me, or treat me with respect like he would with everyone else. I would never mistreat him for that, because it was his opinion and point of view. I never, I guess, came back with rude replies or told him to leave me alone.
Then, summer came and he talked with a priest. He stopped being SO homophobic, still there were still some traces, but it was cool.
11th came and we were fine, we started talking and walking together more. Every tuesday we would make our way to his Rugby training, so I would buy us stuff to eat, or else he would do a ton of exercise without some extra energy. But then I feel in love with him, what can I say, love sucks. So we kept some distance. However, this was true love, and first love, he was the guy that I fricking loved so hard. It was pure, it was good and sad, because he could never respond to it. After this love ""died"", not that it died, but that it changed. It's another feeling. I love him, but is that type of love where you just want to be 101% sure that they are fine and have everything they need. Thanks to this love I would forgive him for everytime he'd tell me to f*ck off or hurt me/my feelings.
Even though I would save my birthday money to buy something for him for his birthday.
But still, he would never start a conversation with me.
12th grade was... a huge shock, we started talking back, but then we had one long week of holidays and we started chatting through text message. Tho, he would never text me first. He probably sent me a message first, once, but I don't remember very well. I got to know way better his self-esteem problems (I knew about them since 11th grade, but we wouldn't talk so much about it). So once again I helped him and still am doing so. He even sent to me photos of him in the bathroom with only his towel covering his genitals, legs and even made me a video of him flexing his muscles. I liked it, because well... I love his body, but it just showed how intimate we were.
Still I would buy everything he wanted without questioning it.
But then, on this quarentine we wouldn't speak as much as we would on school. I'd send a message, he would either ignore it or take a long time to answer, and we would talk for about 5 minutes and done.
Then, yesterday, 22nd of March, he told me the truth. He would only stick to me, because I would buy everything he wanted. Only because I'd buy him stuff... Tho, he said we had some moments that would resemble friendship. That felt like we were friends, there were some friendship. And he admited he screwed up a lot of times, and how he was dragging down our friendship and if this relationship could depend only on one person and if that person would be me, then we'd be best friends.
He told me this through phone call since we wouldn't see each other in a long time, thanks to the quarentine.


I know what to do, but I am not sure if it is the right choice.
There are two sides of my heart. The sad part is telling me to not to talk to him for a long time, like some months. However the other side that has this special love is saying to give him another chance, even tho this guy had a lot of chances.

What I want to do is to give him another chance, but to restart this relation by giving eachother sometime. It hurts me to not talk to him, because... this love is dragging me, and this love is never dying that's since he is/was special for me.",23Mar2020,1

I would feel bad for canceling last minute, but I also feel just as guilty for going. Also, because I know a couple people going but I don’t know how MANY people are actually going to be there.

603,"Hey everyone, I am 23 years old, graduated with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and currently interning at a job where I am no longer learning anything new and the market is a shit show soo not really getting any new prospectives for a new job.

To introspect and really evaluate how I currently am, I ended up making a list of my strengths vs my weaknesses. Now the weaknesses list is considerably larger than the strengths one and it ranges right from being unhealthy mentally, spiritually and physically to now weak engineering skills and lack of knowledge in reading books and knowing key financial and other critical life skills.

Very overwhelmed with how much I need to catch up on so I am asking, has anyone experienced this and how did you go about solving it till you felt like you made good progress?

I'd love to get some insight into this and how you made sure you cut out critical procrastination time and kept accountability on just how your list of strengths and weaknesses are at that point. What tools did you use and what kind of routine did you follow to get there?

Thank you so much in advance for your feedback.",23Mar2020,1

609,"3 days ago, I moved into this new house shared by 5 people. Right next door to my room is a couple (Mid-40s male, early 30s female) and every night at 10 pm on the dot, the guy starts yelling at the top of his lungs at his wife.

The first night, it was just a lot of loud yelling and door slamming. The night after was even louder yelling and door slamming. Last night was actually scary though.

He was yelling ""COME OUT. IM GOING TO F\*CKING KILL YOU."" and was loudly pacing around the house. Sounded like he walked into the kitchen and opened some drawers. Maybe I was being a bit paranoid but i was scared he pulled out a knife or something. Anyways. I'm obviously scared out of my mind for his wife so i locked my room door and stayed silent.

After about 15 minutes of ""F\*CK YOU. F\*CK YOUR MOM. I'll F\*CKNG KILL YOU, COME OUT HERE YOU B\*CH etc."" i decided to call 911. Whispering into the phone, i told the dispatcher what was happening but requested to remain anonymous. Apparently 911 has been called on previous occasions since the dispatcher immediately asked if he was a mid-late forties male and described his appearance perfectly.

Cops showed up. had a short conversation with the guy and left. It was then quiet for the rest of the night.

This morning, as i was making breakfast, he comes out of his room, casually says hello. I say good morning and we go on doing our thing. I go back to my room after eating. About 10 minutes later, I hear a raised voices outside my room from the kitchen and lo and behold, the dude is yelling at the top of his lungs at one of our other late 40's woman roommate. She's pretty frail and about 100lbs so i felt a bit scared for her safety. He was accusing her of calling the cops (which she didnt do) and was threatening her saying ""I told you last time don't call the cops. mind your own business. I'll make you regret it if you do it again. No more warnings.""

I open the door and he looks at me. Yells ""go back in. mind your own business"" and then storms off.

Anyways, i'm a little afraid for everyone's safety right now. Not sure exactly what to do. I thought calling the cops might of let the guy know ""hey theres other people in the house, maybe don't be so open about your domestic abuse"" but apparently its made all of us potential targets for him.

Now the wife is on his side (i'm not surprised) and she just keeps saying thats how they normally have a ""conversation.""

I'm tempted to ""stay out of it"" for all the other roommates' safety but at the same time, its emotionally tiring to hear yelling and death threats every night before I attempt to go to sleep.

613,"Hey first time poster. (F)

My roommate's (M) girlfriend has spent a lot of time in our apartment recently. The country we live in is about to go into a lockdown pretty soon and we've all been working from home since last Friday (We all work for the same company).  This means all of us brought home our computers/equipment and set up in our respective homes. She was at her parent's (my roommate and I are expats in this country) up until the weekend.

She arrived on Saturday morning after he finished his last night shift and started to work in our kitchen/living area for the day, leaving me with no real option but to stay in my room, bearing in mind this is 'on the side' work, not actual company related work. This continued on Sunday as my roommate slept. This morning I set up on the couch and about two hours in noticed that she had once again set up working in our kitchen and didn't say a word to me all day.

My roommate won't be working until Thursday and I am really frustrated by the fact that she continues to set up without asking if it is okay - and for that matter frustrated at my roommate for not asking me if this was okay beforehand. Our apartment is pretty tiny but we pay quite a bit for it, and I really do not want her around if the country goes into lockdown. Especially seeing as she does not pay rent and there relationship is tumultuous at best.

On a more safety related note, I don't think they have made a responsible decision to hang out when she has older parents and is coming and going from their house to our apartment .

My roommate and I are very good friends so I don't want to make a big deal out of this, but how do I tell my him that she can't work in our apartment or stay any longer with a lockdown soon approaching while she is around constantly and is likely to make a big deal about it? Or am I just being a massive bitch?

TLDR; Roommate's girlfriend has been working in my kitchen for the last 3 days just as country is about to go into lockdown, leaving me feeling very frustrated and uncomfortable as I am also working in this space. How do I tell him to tell her that she can't stay and work here any longer with minimum damage?",23Mar2020,1

I live with this guy and he is also my good friend. He gets angry for the stupidest things. Today I went out to take the garbage and to buy myself something to eat. I came home and while I was eating he entered my room and when he saw that I was in grocery store without his knowledge he basically got angry and said That I was an asshole , etc.. this isnt the first time he
got Angry because I went out without letting him know that I was going to fucking store 5 min away
Normally I ask him if he needs anything but sometimes I just leave the house ( like today when I wanted to take out the garbage) 
Now he is angry and he doesnt speak to me, he is just quiet and he went outside ... just because I didnt told him I was going out. 
And this happened couple of times and it is always for this specific reason. I would never get angry with him for stupid things like this, and this is starting to piss me off. I find his behavior very immature for a 22 yo guy, and I dont like the fact that he expects me to ask him if he needs something every single time I leave the house.

616,"Title pretty much says it all. Obligatory on mobile warning. I never really post so please excuse any errors I make. 

I live about 3 hours away from the Dallas area and want to move up there with my family (fiancé, 2 kids, and 2 furbabies). We decided to let our oldest finish the school year in second grade and move during the last weekend of May. We’ve been anticipating this move for a really long time but now what? Are realtors even working right now? What about job interviews? I’ve recently seen that a lot of grocery stores, amazon, and even domino’s is going to be hiring more now to deal with the sudden rise in deliveries and stuff but I don’t know how to go about this, or to even do anything at all and just wait it out where we live now. We want to rent, not buy, a house and we were hoping to let me continue to stay as a SAHM mom with our baby to avoid daycare costs if we could swing it, if that makes any difference. 

Where we live isn’t horrible but my fiancé’s job is horrible and he can’t find anything much better in our small town, which is why we’re moving to the city. We also have family there. Long story short, he’s constantly working from 7AM to 1-3AM and is always getting fake promises from his company like a raise or bonus but it never happens. He told me he is still working right now because his company counts as a construction company apparently (they make cabinets).

Sad to say but kind of glad he’s still working because we still gotta pay our full rent. As crappy as his job is—it still pays the bills, especially right now. But if we move, could he find a job that would? Who knows how it’d go trying to find a job in May during this. Or how it’s go checking out potential houses to live in. I know that those places I mentioned earlier are hiring right now but I’m not sure it’d be enough with just one of us working there.

Further, she would be traveling through 2-3 airports (1 leaving Mexico and 1 arriving at LAX and maybe one in between if there is a layover). My fear is that Mexico is severely under reporting their numbers and maybe the border between MX and USA will close as shit hits the fan.

So my mother is a respiratory nurse for the NHS, she has been asked to go on the ‘front line’ for this coronavirus outbreak - so basically working ridiculous overtime with lots of sick people. 

this will put her at high risk for getting coronavirus. she already has anxiety and was literally just about to leave her job before this outbreak. Now she is reconsidering and most likely going to accept going on the front line.

I am really worried about her because she falls under the age group where people don’t always make it, and i think her mental health combined with this virus could kill her.

With all this being said, someone has to do this job, and she seems to want to do this. the advice i already gave was ‘just get yourself in perfect health (diet, exercise, stress reduction), and i think you will be fine.

She kept reminding me that I’m not a bad person and while that’s great and stuff, I couldn’t help but think that maybe I really am still a bad person. 

You see, prior to that we only started being friends again summer last year. Before that we hadn’t talked in 2 years because of something that was my fault. Before THAT we were really close friends and she is arguably one of my earliest real friends. I talked to her again promising that I’ll do my best to become a better person.

This isn’t the first time one of my closest friends left me. It is the first time though that someone was straight up and honest with me about it before we ended it. 

I thanked her for the memories and left the discord group. After that I started trying to move on but that’s the hardest part for me. 

The thing is, I’m used to people leaving me because I know I’m not necessarily a good person or someone worth liking. People have left and rejected me left and right to the point where it’s just normal to me now.

T has massive relationship problems with their boyfriend and invites him over constantly and they argue and treat each other like garbage. In my house, in my room, in my kitchen, in my living room. My friend's boyfriend, D, is easily angered and refuses to talk. 

T is very pushy and rude and keeps doing things when D tells them to stop.

T does the same thing to me. 
T walks into my room in the morning and wakes me up because they are awake and won't leave.
I make a small bit of food for myself, T says they don't want any, then eat all of it.
T keeps me up until 3 am sitting in my room and playing a game on my TV.

I do not get my room to myself. 
It was okay at first but now I get no alone time with my boyfriend because T likes to sit in my room for hours.

I haven't gotten any silence. I'm so frustrated. I can't even breathe without them right there.

T and D have so many problems that T can't stay at D's house and T can't go home so I have no damn choice and I feel like every time they talk to me I'm going to snap.

I want to be left alone. I want silence. I want time with my boyfriend. I want my room to myself. I want my food and my kitchen to myself. I want my TV and my game system to myself. I do not want to constantly be asked questions or what I want to do today. I want to live and breathe in my own house.

If T doesn't seem that bad, here's some of the things that have gone on during their stay: 

D came over and said he was feeling sick. My boyfriend works at a nursing home so I told him he should go back home. T begged him to stay and told me he was lying about feeling sick and jumped all over him and ignored what he was saying and argued with him in the bathroom and then also on the back porch when he was trying to leave. He ended up not leaving for hours.

I decided to make myself a small batch of fries last night, cut up a few potatoes for myself. T has already eaten. so I dried them, was about to put them in olive oil and some seasoning but I had to pee. Used the bathroom, came back, T had taken it upon himself to season them with some stuff I'd taken out and a LOT of pepper and then put them in the oven. (I usually make fries with sazon and pepper always always makes me sneeze) but I was like ok. you can't be mean, they just helped you! 

but then they helped themself to over half the fries that were originally supposed to be for me that they literally told me they wouldn't eat because they already had dinner.

T also has a habit of talking over me when I am talking to my boyfriend or someone else in the house or interupting me but whenever there's something I tell them specifically they just tune it out.

My dad's card is linked to my nintendo account and I wanted to start a realm on minecraft but it costs money. T advised me to purchase it and steal from my dad who bought me the switch and the game to begin with.

Whenever I am trying to do online schoolwork in my room and be focused and quiet, T invites themself into my room and won't leave. I'm trying to sleep right now and they are playing music from an ipad they brought up here.

T also made D sneak out and come to my house and D said he needed to be back by 5 am so he wouldn't get in trouble. They woke me up at 9am. D never left, T MADE HIM stay and he is in massive trouble right now. He's literally 19 and his parents confiscated his phone and will not let him outside.

A prime example imo of their unwillingness to listen is when I was making cookies from scratch last week. I was mixing everything together and T said it looked a little dry. It did not look dry. T grabbed milk from my fridge and poured milk in the cap and said ""I'm putting milk in."" I said No. I said please do not do that. T thought it was funny and kept tilting the cap over the bowl. I was dead seriously asking them to stop. T poured milk in anyway and didn't seem to care or notice that it frustrated me.

I'm literally waking up angry at this point and T doesn't understand boundaries. I can't kick them out so I don't know what to do. I literally have no idea what to do but I am going to lose it. 

please help me

638,"I don't know what to do. My mom and I used to be really close, but ever since I got out of an abusive relationship and into a healthy one, things have been kind of.. strange. 

She seems to hold everything against me. She'll tell me she trusts me and then tells me I'm constantly bullshitting her and lying to her when things go opposite to what she expected. I'm (20f) working and I still have to ask for permission to go out and do things people my age have the choice of making their own decision to do. 

She masks control as care- and I tested this by going out and doing something I wanting to do without giving too much away (small over night thing with the possibility of camping). She acted fine with it as long as I kept her updated, so I did. I sent her a text every 2 hours just saying ""I was okay"" or ""safe and sound, no worries."". She seemed fine, but when I got back and told her that I went hiking and instead of camping and being out and about 3 hours away, I went to spend the night at my girlfriends 5 mins away bc I didn't feel safe with this Corona thing + stress. My mom went absolutely crazy, she's acting like I just stole a car or something. I asked her for help and she goes ""I would help you, I just don't know how. Or maybe I just don't want to."" I know I probably should have let her know I was closer to home, but usually I hear parents react with ""well I'm glad your safe, I just wish you'd told me.. etc etc"".. not ""well I keep getting bullshitted, I wish you could just admit that you lied and you're a liar."" 

We used to be so close and now she's acting like she hates me. I can't help but feel like the reason we were so close was because I was in an abusive relationship and I'd go to her for help and comfort. Now that I'm out of that and in a healthy relationship with independence, she's loosing control and lashing out.. what do I do?",23Mar2020,1
640,"I’m really really starting to hate my job. I’ve worked here a little over 6 years. I’ve always gotten praise but the way higher ups talk to me it seems the opposite. They’re very passive aggressive. It used to be real nice when things ran smooth and we weren’t overloaded with new tasks to complete and no extra help to get it done. Now I’m always struggling to finish the job, always dealing with attitudes from at least 3 different people each week, including higher management. The company itself has always had a problem with management and the way they talk to employees. It’s gotten so bad that apparently they can’t even get people to show up for interviews. People apply and then just ghost the company, as well as people just quitting mid shift. 

So I guess my question is this:
Do I stay at this job and hope that things will change for the better? 
Or do I try and find a new job and put my two weeks in ASAP? 

I don’t know why I’m having such a hard time making a decision and would appreciate someone’s else’s opinion on the matter.",23Mar2020,1

644,"My father is a horrible person to begin with. He is enraged all the time, and I have no way to talk to him about anything, because if I make one slip up he's screaming and yelling at me. I'm tired of it. Today him and mom went to walmart, and they got two cases of water. One for us, and one for the church we go to. (My grandpa is the owner of the church, and we're doing ""supply runs"" for the church itself.) They got into a fight, and now he's gone, ran out of the house and sped off out of the driveway.

He is a mass of anger, and I have no idea how to deal with it. I think he's bipolar, or something. Everything could be fine, and alright, and one single thing will tip him off, and he will ERUPT like a fucking volcano. He refuses to go to any sort help, therapy of the sort. He is such a shitty person, and I have no way of making it better. I want to love my dad. He has been with me, been there for me my entire life. But he's so livid all the time, and I want to help him. I want to love him, but I can't.

646,"This is a weird one, and a long one. I'm sorry.

My father was always distant. Him and my mom were never married, and when she got pregnant he moved to a different state to take on an incredible job offer. We're talking a lot of $$$. My mom and dad are very different people: he is a civil engineer, while she never got to finish high school. My mom is incredibly hardworking and successful, and now has her own business with a few employees; however, growing up we were not in a great place financially. I was never hungry or anything like that, but she worked from 7am till 11pm just to make ends meet, and I only go to go to a great school because I had a scholarship. Despite of that, my dad hardly helped us with more than the bare minimum required by law, and never missed a chance to humiliate my mom and voice his outrage when it came to me choosing to live with her, an ""uneducated, uncultured"" person (his words, of course) versus living with him. He only got me nice things in order to make her feel bad, but never helped with school or anything that actually mattered. 

When I was about 13, he said to have lost his job, gotten divorced, and fallen ill with cancer all within the same year. My mom is just too good of a person and to an extent will always love this POS, so she accepted and understood when he said he couldn't pay child support anymore. Things got harder, and I had to leave the great school I was in to attend public school instead (I am not from the US, and I am from a country were public school = no future). Since then, he said he couldnt find any jobs that would hire someone as old as him (he was 48 at the time) and that he didnt want to take a job that would be a ""step down.""

In 2013 I got a scholarship to complete my high school education abroad, and as a consequence of that a full ride to a US college. It wasn't easy, but I have recently graduated and scored an incredible job. This job only came about because of an unpaid internship I took at the same institution this past summer. It was a gamble, and it paid off, but it meant wrecking my credit and carrying credit card debt for a while. 

For my first two years of college, my dad contributed $1000 a year, which covered very little and left no room for emergencies. My freshman year all my wisdom teeth decided to make their debut, and I reluctantly called my mom in pain. It was halfway through the semester and I didnt know what to do. She said she would call my dad and they would go halfsies on getting them removed so I could continue the semester in peace. However, she soon called back saying he didnt have the money and she couldnt swing that alone. She was devastated, and honestly, so was I. I waited out the rest of the semester and got them removed back in my home country. Within the same break I got them removed, my dad came by for a visit to make sure I understood that the $1000 was everything he could contribute with and that I should have my mom ask for more. He went ahead to say that ""if you get hurt, I dont have more money, if you die and we have to fly your body back, I dont have more money."" Seemed very mean and totally unprompted of an example. Needless to say, I havent spoken to him since. He has my email, but has never reached out either.

This is all to say, he kinda sucks and this isnt even the tip of the iceberg. He is violent and sexist and elitist and I cant think of a single thing I like about this man.

Recently, for job related reasons, I had to provide the government with the contact information of all my immediate family. My mom has a large family, so she took on helping me out and gathering that information as long as I took care of my father's side of the family. I decided to try to google them first, maybe I'd be lucky and find their info and not have to contact them. That's where this story starts. When I googled my father's name (he is not John Smith and has a VERY weird name. No one else has the same name and last name combination). I was shocked to find an article citing that he had passed the equivalent of my country's bar exam in 2013. THIS WHOLE TIME, THIS MAN WENT TO A PRIVATE LAW SCHOOL AND PASSED THE BAR, AND HAS BEEN WORKING AS A LAWYER, on top of you know, already being an engineer. Instead of paying child support, he was putting himself through a second, private university (in my country the best colleges are actually public, so if you work your ass off you can get your college degree for free) while my mom and I worked our asses off to make ends meet. 

I was speechless and my heart dropped when I found this out, and honestly dont know what to do or think. At first I found it funny, but talking to all of my friends, I cant picture a single one of their parents doing something like this. I am a smart kid and an easy one to have, and my mom has always acknowledged that and dreamed of how much more I could have done in college and in life if we had more money or I didnt have to work. I would understand if my mom, who sacrificed herself her whole life and never got to go to college pursued that. That would have been more than fair. But my dad had all the opportunities in the world, lived his youth to the best (they were not young when they had me, 33 and 35) and has TWO kids. I have a younger brother from a different mom, and he is also very smart. My dad lucked out big and doesnt see that at all.

Today i spoke to him for about half and hour about what tv shows and games we like.

Trust me i would not date a colleague"". I laughed it off and went to walk away until he handed me his phone. I looked at it for a second then took it out his hand and typed my number.

And even now when there are numerous cases in our area she still thinks it's nothing more than a ""government scare tactic"".

658,"With the recent COVID19 outbreak, my parents have been increasingly anxious, and as a result, we have been under self-quarantine for more than a week now. I was scared to be stuck in the apartment with them for a long period of time, and as expected, we've already experienced numerous conflicts. My dad is one to avoid conflict, so much of the arguments are initiated by my mom who is more short-tempered. And they all seem to share a similar root: she's not happy with how I'm handling things. It usually starts with small things that I did (unknowingly) that pile on top of each other, and finally, the explosion. 

I just had a fight with her today. There was a lot of one-sided yelling since I usually stay silent because I feel like me talking often just makes things worse. The cause is because I woke up a bit later today and I forgot to sweep the floor after breakfast. My mom said that me waking up late causes problems for her since she makes breakfast, and me forgetting to sweep the floor just adds oil to the fire. She thinks that I'm selfish, and wishes that I would think from her perspective, and love our home, and contribute. 

This may sound like a simple situation to solve; I should just do what she wants me to do, and that should resolve the conflict. But the problem is that even after thinking about it all, I don't feel sorry for some reason. I understand what she's saying, and I am willing to change, but I think it's not because I feel like what I did was wrong, but because then I can avoid these conflicts. Then I asked myself, why can't I just love our house more as my mom said? That led to me thinking whether or not I actually loved my parents. What if I don't? I felt horrified thinking about this possibility because they have done so much for me and it would break their hearts if that were true. So my question is, how do you know? Or maybe me even questioning this means that I don't love them...?

I wanted to type this out due to two reasons: one is to sort my thoughts, and the other is in hopes that maybe I can get some advice or just even some thoughts on my situation. Similar experiences would be great to hear in the comments, but I feel like my situation is a bit uncommon. Thanks for reading till the end. &lt;:)",23Mar2020,1
659,"I’ve been living with my mom my entire life. She has been the one to take care of me and provide food and shelter for the past 17 years of my life. I turn 18 on the 27th of this month and I’m moving out. I’ve had my ups and downs with my life considering my dad was never in he picture and I could only rely on my mom or when my siblings came to visit me. 

2 years ago, we moved in with my moms boyfriend (We’ll call him John) John is a meth user and has been for a very long time. He is in his mid 30s and works as a mechanic for old cars. My mom knew about his addiction and didn’t like it at all. She and I have been against drugs our entire lives but I have been more free on the use of marijuana. I don’t smoke myself but my friends do with which I’m okay with. My mom met John about 3 years ago when my sister was in the hospital. My sister had overdosed on meth and heroin apparently and she was living with John at that time and were together. My mom and I stayed in the hospital for 2 months watching over my sister, watching her make up stories about shadow people living in the sewers who were out to get her or that she had a pacemaker in his chest and it would explode if she got a CAT scan. I was maybe 14 or 15 when this was happening and I didn’t understand much of it. I loved my sister so much because she had been there for me when I needed her the most while my brother doesn’t really care about me much. 

Back to topic, my mom met John when he visited my sister in the hospital. I knew that he was a drug user and I hated for the fact that him and my sister were using drugs. My mom didn’t like him either but she kept her cool and talked with him about what was going on. To shorten the story, my sister finally was healthy enough to leave the hospital on her own, from what the doctors were saying. My mom disagreed with it but there wasn’t much she could do because my sister checked herself out and that was the last time I saw her. My mom was devastated and tried to convince her that she needed help but my sister didn’t trust us. Last I heard, she is in Las Vegas right now doing who knows what. 

My mom fell into a rough patch and so was John. They found an interest which was lost nag someone they loved and at the time, they felt a bond between one another. I found this odd and actually really gross since he dated my sister and my Mom was 45 at the time I believe. They started hanging out more and more and one day, he showed me that he cleaned one of the spare bedrooms for me to sleep in. That’s when I found out they loved each other. When we moved in, my mom tried to help him with his addiction, throwing away meth pipes she’d find or make him do it in front of her along with assigning him rehab sessions 2 times a week. During that period, he didn’t go to many of the sessions even though he said he did. My mom followed him one day and found out he wasn’t actually going. They fought and fought and every night was the same thing. I defended her the best I could when they argued but as a young teenager, I shouldn’t even be involved in this. It affected my mentally and physically. I felt down and lazy most of the days and didn’t do much. I wanted to get out as soon as I graduated highschool. To skip a few months, they made their way with arguing almost every night and finally, my mom fell to depression. She quit her job and didn’t know what to do. She has carpal tunnel on her wrists so doing her job as a hairdresser was starting to take a toll. She stayed home most days and I went to school while John went to work. It was like this for a year. 

December of 2019, I was playing games with my friends and decided I needed to shower and go to bed. I don’t have a shower head in my bathroom so I have to use their shower which is okay with me. I walk into the bathroom and find the cabinet to grab a towel and there it was. A meth pipe. It was sitting where all my moms makeup was and I was so scared and confused. I thought about it for a moment, wondering if it was my mom’s pipe but I knew she wouldn’t do drugs so it had to be Johns. I do more looking in the makeup cabinet and find another one, hidden in a rag amongst her necklaces. She must have given up trying to help him and he just has them wherever he pleases now. That had to be it. I confront my mom about what I found and was crying. She told me it wasn’t hers and tried to blame it on John which I couldn’t believe because of the 2nd one I found. She had to be using drugs because the past year, she had been acting strange, accusing him of thing that weren’t happening and hearing people talking. Back to me confronting her, I broke the pipes and threw them away. I was so shocked with what I found. The past couple months have been horrible. My mom is much worse and shows signs of meth psychosis. I have been aggressive with my tactics to getting the truth and answers. John won’t do anything and he knows why she’s acting like this. There is so much to cover but I don’t know how much I can type so to keep this shorter, I got my mom to confess. She admitted that she was depressed and John had gotten her to do it with him and his friend. I was heart broken but with every coming day, I get more and more frightened for what is happening. She hears things and thinks he’s hacking into her phone.

663,"Hello users, I’m kind of struggling to find help regarding my girlfriends parents. Here’s the back story to help.

I started dating my girlfriend in the beginning of October and it was a different love that I experienced. I couldn’t be away from her, I wanted to spend all my time with her, I just wanted to be with her all the time, not creepily attached. But I had found someone who was cool! And I loved talking for hours with her. I met her parents around December after my girlfriend and I decided we wanted to stay with them for 4 days. It was a great time I enjoyed it but I noticed they would get super drunk every night.

Fast forward a few months later in March, her mother starts to bring up her political views and how she hates Mexicans, and ,” those stupid beaners are ruining my neighborhood .” I come from a line of Spanish sailors who immigrated to Mexico, so that’s my family. I was extremely taken back by that and kind of hurt. So I thought to myself, it’s all good. I don’t really care that much by her saying that, just a bit shocked. After her racist spiel about Mexicans and why she hates them and how THEY’RE ALL on welfare and driving brand new Escalades, she dipped towards me on politics. Now I’m not one to talk about politics with somebody I barely know. It’s not good, and there’s three things I don’t talk about to my girlfriends family about. Religion ( they’re super religious ) politics ( they’re extremely far right ) and money ( unless I absolutely have to ). I like to consider myself a libertarian and she started to bash my ideologies without even knowing what my political preference was, yet again I moved on and said ,” ehh she’s probably just drunk again.” 

My girlfriend up until August was still being supported by her parents because where we live is quite expensive, and when we decided we wanted to move together, her mom threatened to take her rent money away because she didn’t want me living with her daughter, it’s quite clear now that they don’t want me to be at that level yet with their daughter but oh well. 
My girlfriend and I ignored their requests and it was the best decision we’ve ever made. We couldn’t be happier. But along this time of hardship with the coronavirus my girlfriend was asked by her parents to come home with them and visit. So we did.

Her mom is somebody who doesn’t listen to the news, and doesn’t listen to the media. Yet here she is freaking out about the coronavirus and wear gloves and wear masks, and wash your hands. Blah blah blah. She’s just a scared boomer. 
I didn’t enjoy being around her mom again this time because of her inability to have an intellectual conversation. All she did was make small talk and bash other people. She’s extremely racist, and I legitimately think she’s fucked up in the head.  She and I had gotten into an EXTREMELY heated argument about whether or not vaccines cause autism. I’ve had family in the medical field for the majority of my life so I know what the answers are. In short you can’t inject autism into somebody and she couldn’t take that I was saying that. She has been an anti-Vaxxer since god knows how long. It hurt my girlfriend to see her arguing with me like that, and I stopped because I don’t want to hurt my girl. Her mom couldn’t take that I stood up to her and said ,” I’m done having this conversation with you, we are not talking about this anymore.” My girlfriend said nobody has ever talked to her mom like that.

So to summarize
My girlfriends mom has homeschooled all of her kids because she thinks the American public education system is terrible, yet she did most of the work for her kids on tests and exams. 
She is an anti Vaxxer and believes vaccines cause autism and make you sick. 
Extremely racist 
Borderline psychotic( plays the victim thinks the whole world revolves around her and makes other people feel bad for things that are her fault. ) 
And I have told myself I’m not going to see her mom again until she gets better, I know my worth and I know what I deserve, and to be talked down to at 22 by a woman who’s not my mother is not it.

673,"Note: Sorry for the over reliance on the word ""sibling"". Just trying to refer to them as anonymously as possible.

My sibling (a student in college) fell for one of those nigerian prince-type of scams where the scammer sends them ""too much money"" and then they ask to send some of it elsewhere. My sibling provided their bank ID and password. Obviously, the deposit the scammer made was fraudulent so my sibling never got that money, and my sibling sent a check to them using funds that weren't available, resulting in their checkings account now having a negative balance.

The bank closed my sibling's checkings and savings accounts, barred them from opening an account with them again, and my sibling has now incurred a debt with the bank since they want those funds back.

I doubt there's anything we can do to get the debt forgiven, but that's honestly not the main thing I'm concerned about (I'll figure out a way to pay it). 

I'm concerned about identity theft and other possible consequences from this scam. It doesn't seem like my sibling's credit card was affected. Does this affect my sibling's credit score at all?

Long story; if you read it, thank you. If anyone could give me advice on what to do, please do.

My husband and I have had a very toxic relationship for about 2-3 years now. He has cheated on me for years and struggles with alcohol/drug abuse. When I met him, he wasn’t like this. He was clean from drugs. Looking back now, I realize he had a serious alcohol problem from the beginning but I guess I chose to ignore it? Idk. About 3 years ago, I found out he had an affair with his boss at work for almost the first two years we were together. I had no idea. I was pregnant with our daughter and even got married while he was doing this. I should have recognized the signs but I never went through his phone and I was just just so happy with him that I never second guessed anything he said to me. Anyways, here we are 3 years in and he’s been hanging out with shady people and I have a rule of no drugs or alcohol in the house due to his past and he got a DUI a couple of years ago and that’s what really prompted me feeling that way about his drinking. He always promises me he will never bring it in the house and breaks that promise about a week later. I found a meth pipe and empty little baggies with what looked like white/clearish residue in our house about 4-5 times in the last six months and I know he got it from our shady neighbors which he always denies but he couldn’t have gotten it anywhere else because he got laid off from work right before Christmas and hasn’t found any work since. A couple weeks ago he promised he wouldn’t go over there anymore and he keeps breaking that promise. Yesterday he went over there 3 times and I went to grab something out of our vehicle and he had some White Claw in there. I was livid. Like seeing red pissed. We got in a huge fight and I told him to either stop going over there and stop drinking and doing drugs or leave and don’t come back. He said he would leave because im too controlling. He left and I was absolutely devastated, sad, and angry. In an absolutely childish moment, I threw his clothes outside in the fire pit and dumped gas on them and then and poked holes in his vintage speakers. He came back and started crying and I’ve never felt so bad in my life. I have a temper but I’ve never acted out physically. I’ve never broken anything out of anger, I’ve never done anything so horrible in my life and I’m so filled with guilt and shame. I’m getting the gas out of his clothes right now and I’m going to replace his speakers or give him the money to buy whatever new speakers he wants. But I don’t know how to deal with the guilt and shame. If you have read this far, thank you. I just need help in what to do about my marriage. I apologized profusely to him and I will replace everything I ruined. I just don’t know what else to do to make it up to him and for me to stop hating myself.

In a post on r/relationship_advice I spoke about finding out about my parent's divorce in October. I've contemplated writing again due to the developments but something has happened and I need some advice (not just relationship for those wondering)

So let me update you:

The reason my dad wanted a divorce was not because the marriage we breaking down, it was because he had found a rich girlfriend while he was working in London. (For this we'll call her Bit... I mean Witch (W) for obvious reasons). W is religious (not sure which religion she follows, I'm sorry) but something she follows (?) is that you can't go off with someone who's married.

The reason she got my dad to file for divorce was because she didn't want her holy name tarnished. When they told her children that they were together, they didn't explain that my parents weren't actually divorced. Because of these she has created a huge rift in mine and my father's relationship. 

After speaking to him a few times he said that they had split up (I was talking to him and I managed to get him to understand that I'd barely seen him for 6 months and she was creating this), he came home saying that they'd split up (I call BS). He's moved out because of a new job in a different city, and I haven't heard from him much. He usually responds quickly to texts and has been taking whole days to respond. 

What I'm saying is a lot has been building up to this moment. So I decided to send an email to both of them.

I sent an email explaining how much they had hurt me, and how much of a hypocrite W was. (You can imagine). And I got responses from both my dad and W.

My dad didn't really help that much, but W attached a letter saying a lot of things. In the email I sent I asked for an apology (which I did not get) and I basically got a load of reasons why she isn't in the wrong. Including trying to make out that my MUM (who has been so badly hurt in all of this) was the bad guy.

Like WHAT!?

Not only did she say that, she added the letter as an attachment, and it was named as ""Letter for ithinkiamgoth - changes"". My dad and W say they aren't in contact with each other but that just doesn't feel right...

She also attached a picture of an email my mum sent her for some reason which I thought was odd... I think it was her way of saying my mum was making a fuss over nothing.

Idk what advice I need. I want to reply but I don't know how and yes, my mum has seen the email.

I work in Tustin California and currently under a state wide order to stay home. 

My employer doesn’t want to shut down business citing they fall under the essential businesses that must operate under the statewide stay at home order.

My job is Digital Marketing (social media marketing) and because they’re not prepared to work from home, they gave us the option to come into work or stay home, not work, no penalty and no pay.

I refuse to go into work because:
1 I live with my friend (weak immune system) and her grandparents (both 70+ years old), meaning they all are at high risk
2 the office is very unsanitary with no cleaning crew so it’s up to our office staff to keep the office sanitary. Except the men never clean, it’s only the women who clean up. Sexist much?? 
Is this legal? No janitor or cleaning crew has ever cleaned the office. To be clear, when the office does get clean, it’s done while we are on the clock and stepping away from our job description. For ex: me, I do digital marketing, I will sweep and mop, wipe surfaces, I’m fine with doing this but it stops me from doing my normal job tasks, and I can’t possibly clean the entire office so the office stays dirty and filthy.

I'll try to be short - problem is my father, he has many problems without quarantine, temper and anger problems, has no friends, talks to no-one etc. Now I am stuck home with him and mom because of corona, I can't leave anywhere, police and the army are on the streets, my job and classes are online now so I have very little free time. I unfortunately can't leave, not until the virus situation is over, I plan to leave and because of the job I now have the money, but just can't do it now.

The problem - he talks to himself 24/7. Literally. Screaming, clicking his tongue, having fights with the TV, making undefined noises, just spreading his anger everywhere. Our rooms share a wall and I have to work online, have meetings, attend online classes and everything with him in the background. 

My question is - how to survive this quarantine situation and stay sane? When I hear him I have a very strong reaction, don't know how to describe it, like the rage overflows me and I just want to hurt myself, which I have done in the past, but am trying not to these days. I unfortunately had to cancel my therapy so no help there. I am trying to stay calm and breathe, but then he speaks again and the feeling reappears. 

It's very hard for me to do all my daily tasks I have to do, and stay sane. I have no outlet, right now I tried to read a book but not a minute has passed without him talking to himself and being angry at the world. And my schedule is very tight, I was almost loosing it even without this quarantine situation, and everything that has helped me is now gone.

696,"For context: We used to date and broke up half a year ago. We both were put out of work on Monday by orders to shut down bars, restaurants, and gyms. Ohio is going into a stay-at-home order at midnight tonight. 

I started showing symptoms of COVID-19 on Friday. I told him and explained that this would suggest he also self-quarantine. He then asked if I would mind if his friend/FWB (off and on thing) could come over because, “I’m pretty sure we’re all sick anyway.” I said no because I didn’t know what else to do and I was too tired to function. 

Today we were discussing logistics of getting rent to our landlady. Since my symptoms have only gotten worse (no fever, still able to function), I asked him to handle it and told him the steps he should take to minimize any possible transference of COVID to her.

That’s when he noted he couldn’t believe it was only the 23rd. I jokingly said that he was looking forward to two weeks of being my best buddy, but from a safe distance. 

He then said he was still going to go for walks (allowed) and “take care of friends.” “Take care of friends,” because that’s technically allowed under the order but really he’s just using it as an excuse to socialize. 

He argues that we all likely already have it and that he will only be hanging out with the same four people he’s already been hanging out with. He’s completely ignoring general probability, attempts to limit the spread, and the possibility that I don’t have COVID-19 or any of his other friends are immunocompromised and therefore he’s risking compounding a potential illness with a highly deadly one. 

I’m so angry and at a loss for words. He’s staunchly arguing that he’s not going to leave his friends without any sort of companionship.

When I started my job, I was put on Josh's team. Midway through my first year at the company, the teams were reshuffled and I was placed on Nick's team. I had never done the kind of work that Nick was doing before. I started turning in work for Nick, and he never complained about it or asked me to re-do anything.

This past August, I was moved to Melissa's team, where I was doing essentially the same work I'd been doing for Nick. Melissa was condescending and micromanaging, and we had a very difficult time working together. 

I had my employee review recently, and I learned that Nick had not been happy with the quality of my work. For lack of a better word, my work had been shoddy and riddled with mistakes. Nick had just quietly corrected them without letting me know that there was a problem. 

I've essentially been at my job for three years and am now discovering that I don't know how to do it correctly. Our quotas are increasing and our deadlines are not flexible. Melissa has been telling me to work faster. I've been putting in hours on nights and weekends to try and make these deadlines, but I have a baby. I'm exhausted and feel like I'm on the verge of burnout.

Prior to COVID-19, I had begun to look for a new job. I am hoping that I can resume my search soon.

My question here is about Nick. Do I confront him about this? I feel like his actions (or in this case, lack thereof) have damaged my career at this particular company. Melissa says that I need to ""accept responsibility"" for Nick not training me properly, that I need to buckle down and immerse myself in work (her exact phrase was, ""put down the novels""). I don't want to rock the boat, but I also don't want this to happen to anyone else. Do I confront Nick? If so, how?

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",23Mar2020,1
698,"**Let me give you an example of a conversation I'd have with a person of authority :**

I'd often thank them a lot and end my mails with ""Respectfully yours,\_\_"" , I'd offer all my help if they needed so and I would reassure them if they were doubting something. I'd thank them again, and treat them with a lot of respect.

I don't think I'm doing it in the obnoxious manner, people either don't reply on mail but express their relief and smile at me and treat me very well when I see them , or they'll thank me back via mail and compliment me --- So I don't think they're taking it wrongly or anything. 

I'm sincere about my compliments and gratitude, and I genuinely want to show my gratitude and appreciation for them taking part in my life, somewhat.

My parents , however , often tell me that I will disappoint others by doing so. That I have to be ferm and cold and not go too far. Their thoughts often daunt me regarding this.

707,"My mother and father owned a small machine shop.  My mother was the owner on paper only and really had little to no role with the company at all. My father ran the business for years until he developed health issues.  My mother, an elementary school teacher took a leave of absence during my father's illness to help keep the business afloat.

I was living across the country when my father became ill and moved back home with my partner to be closer to family.  My father passed away in February 2017 and despite uprooting my life, I knew I had made the right decision to be here during my dad's final moments and to help the family deal with his affairs.

My mother was left with the decision to either: a) close the shop entirely, b) hire someone to handle business operations and remain owner on paper or c) leave her job and try her hand at this.

She decided to leave teaching and run the business, but quickly realized that she knew nothing about this industry, either the technical side or the business side.  She asked me to leave if I would consider leaving my career to join her in running this business, she as President and me as Vice President.  I had gone to graduate school and worked hard to get where I was in my career, but made the decision to leave my job and help her.  We have never had the best of relationships, but she is my mother and I felt an obligation to the family during a difficult time.

I have worked here since May 2017 and have taken the company from a floundering shop (my dad was a talented machinist and great with people, but he was not a very good businessman) to a shop with a strong reputation in the regional industry.  I am proud of what has been done with the shop - we have increased employee salaries and benefits, added staff, increased infrastructure and shop equipment, modernized pretty much everything, added policies and procedures to give this place some structure, increased revenue on top of all of that, and have even completed an ISO certification.  I even went back to school to learn manufacturing so that I could be a more valuable resource to the company.

My mother, however, has done very little to help make this shop what it is today.  She is rarely at work before 11am (we open at 6), has a very laissez-faire attitude towards workplace safety and employee satisfaction, snaps at customers, sends rude emails to vendors and customers alike, makes no effort to learn the actual technical part of what we do (even to the slightest degree so that she can sound knowledgeable when communicating with customers), contradicts me/goes over my head during staff conflict or when holding staff accountable, and decisions are made on a whim and can go in any direction depending on her mood at the time.  I have learned to manage my manager to a certain degree, but this has strained our already strained relationship.  I resent that she is paid significantly more than me, despite rarely being present here and having little to do with the shop's improvements and successes.  I resent the way she conducts business.  I resent the way she consistently takes credit for our success and deflects responsibility to others when it is hers to take.  Ultimately the buck stops with her, but I have figured out a way to get things done without her interference.

However, this COVID-19 thing has been a huge strain.  We are a very small shop - if one person gets sick, there is almost no way for everyone to not get sick.  Her attitude towards this has been to downplay it.  I have done everything I could to continually clean our workplace, put in procedures to temporarily ban visitors and limit all contact with delivery drivers.  Our shop is in a state that has enacted a shelter-in-place mandate for all non-essential businesses.  The state considers us essential so we are working.  I have an older work force, many with pre-existing health issues.  On one hand, we are very lucky to be working when so many have uncertain futures in that regard.  On the other hand, I have employees that are scared to be working right now.  When I bring up concerns to my mother, she calls me an alarmist.  It has gotten to the point that I am being yelled at any time I bring up Corona concerns and today was told ""if you don't want to work, then just leave.""  Which is very funny to me since it is like pulling teeth sometimes to get her to come to work.  Today, we called a staff meeting and she told the staff they are lucky to have this job and that if they leave because of their concerns for their safety that they will not be able to collect unemployment.

Anyways, my request for advice is two-fold.  1) The immediate: how do I reason with a stubborn boss who sees this pandemic as a media concoction?  How do you reason with this boss when she is your mother?  I feel we are best to close for 2 weeks (work is slow anyways right now), allow our staff to collect unemployment in the meantime, do our part to flatten the curve, and hope that in 2 weeks this whole thing evens out and our staff is less afraid to be here, and less resentful that they have to work when they feel their safety is on the line.  I will fully admit that sometimes difficult things need to be done, and working through this may be one of them.  But I try to be cognizant of the vibe of the staff and how people are feeling about certain decisions.

And 2) I have felt undervalued, not listened to, and generally unhappy with the stress this place has put on me.  I don't feel like the same person I was before I started here.  I go to therapy to deal with the stress and learn coping techniques, but in general I am not the happy person I once was.  Most days, I want to drive home and never come back here.  Yet the next morning, I find myself back here, as always.  I am really proud of what I've done and could totally see this being my life's work if it weren't for having to share this career with my mother.  I left my last career, and while I wasn't rich or successful, I enjoyed it and the work/life balance it afforded me.  I really want that work/life balance back.  On the other hand, I make more money now than I did before and leaving this job would certainly result in a pretty large salary decrease.

Should I leave my job, knowing it would probably permanently end my relationship with my mother or at least sour it to a pretty unstable point?  Knowing it would be a pretty big lifestyle change (financially)?  Knowing it would put my mother's livelihood in jeopardy because she could not run this place on her own?  Or should I suck it up, wait it out until she's retired (although let's face it, with the economy where it is right now, who knows when that will be) and hope her being gone drastically changes the environment here?

Thank you if you had the patience to read this far.  There's obviously many other details to this story.  I'm happy to fill in any gaps if I'm missing something.

TL;DR: my boss is my mom and we do not see eye to eye on anything.  She creates a toxic work environment for me and our staff, yet reaps the benefits of owning this business.  Do I quit for my well being and mental health, knowing it comes at significant consequence to me and her?",23Mar2020,1

I don’t expect for all my questions to be answered and most of not all of you won’t read this for how long it is. But I felt I had to write this and get some of this off my chest. I’m just looking for advice. I’ve included a lot and probably even forgot to include some things but yeah I gave it my best shot. Also my grammar is really bad sorry.

Alright so here it goes. So to start off I’m a 19 year old 

In high school I always hanged out with this group but they always seemed like fake friends to me. They would always make plans with each other without me and have inside jokes I never understood. I only really talked to them in lunch and outside of school they just forgot about me despite my efforts to message them. They never would reply back. Except for this one guy but I always felt he was just cool to me out of pity. We would sometimes hang out but we don’t have much in common. He likes to drink smoke weed (sometimes), and party and it’s hard for me to relate to him. Lately we have been communicating less and less. After I graduated I have not been able to communicate with any of my “high school friends” despite my best efforts again. I would message them and ask if they would want to hang out. They would say for sure but then come up with a excuse that they couldn’t only for me to see them hang out on social media with each other. Even the one that hanged out with due to pity would not tell me anything probably because he knew I would feel bad. I guess I was the odd one out in the group despite some other members of the group I hanged out with being weirder and edgier in my opinion. I have since gave up in trying to reconnect with them and decided to try and move on especially as time went on because I want to avoid a awkward situation/conversation. 

Also I would like to add that my high school was very small with a few students. In theory this is better to connect with your peers but eventually I wasn’t able to get to know others despite seeing them everyday because friendship groups closed off once they were established and I would be labeled as the loner kid. It’s like people saw through me despite me sitting at a table with others during lunch. Probably because everyone had each other on social media due to my school being small and never saw me hanging out with any of those people. Put Two and two together and they knew. And no thankfully I was not bullied and people treated me kindled. However I was still labeled. It’s just human nature to label others which I understand, especially at out young age where our lack of experiences in life cause us to lack understanding in others therefore lacking empathy. Anyways this label caused people to not really want to talk to me (now people didn’t avoid me they just didn’t put the effort to get to know me like they did with others because they were not interested. Besides who would be interested in getting to know someone with almost no social experience. When getting to know people it seems that people want to hear stories about that person which unfortunately I don’t really have. Therefore conversations would be one sided with me trying to get to know that person and that never works out based on my experience)because our survival instincts make it so that we stay away from people with labels that have negative connotations which is why people tend to gossip I guess. Now this is understandable and I don’t hate any of the people I went to high school with

Now I’ve tried sports such as mixed martial arts but unfortunately I lost interest and didn’t stay in them. I’m not good at sports at all and I know Joining a spirts team is a good way to make friends but how could a 19 year old who has never played a sport competitively join a sport and keep up with everyone else. I feel like I would be cast out of a sports social group because I don’t watch sports, know much about sports and I don’t play sports and am not good at them. If I were to join a sport i believe I would have needed to join one from when I was young so that I could improve along the rest of my piers. Also I recently joined the gym but have not yet felt improvement in my mood from working out. Feeling good while working out is temporary for me. And I’m also constantly overthinking of what others think of me when I work out which discourages me a little which I know I shouldn’t think about since most people are too into their workout to care. And now it sucks that gyms are closed since the corona virus outbreak so now I need to find alternatives to stay healthy and workout. I also looked for outside social communities but all the ones I found have people ages 30 and up around my area and I really don’t want to chill with older strangers. I could join online communities but it doesn’t help fill that void Within me.

Anyways fast forward to college. My first semester was the worst. I tried making friends and it was very difficult. The atmosphere was different from high school which is normal to experience. However I was able to make a few acquaintances from there but I never really hit it off with anyone. I would see everyone in the college talking to one another and I would feel like I was the only one who was alone and friendless. A very bad feeling. Then the beginning of my second semester came I met this group of people. Now they seemed nice and we actually had a same class from the first semester but was unable to talk to them because they happened to sit on the other side of the classroom. They already made friends with another in the first semester but I joined late to the group. But in the second semester although not having much in common from what I know so far, we seemed to get along. I think I could safely say that we are beyond acquaintances but not necessarily good friends. We are just friends or if there’s a level in between acquaintance and friend then we are probably there. Still for some reason sometimes I think they use me since I’m really good at my classes(what I mean by this is that I pay attention and do all my work. People consider me smart but I honestly don’t agree with them. I think I have pretty average intelligence. I’m smart for some things but for others I am not). Not all the time but they ask me a lot about questions for the class which I don’t mind to answer because I like helping others (and get annoyed with myself sometimes when I don’t know how to help them despite being good at a particular class) but at times it can get annoying. Now it works out I guess because I ask them questions sometimes. What I’m trying to say is that they like me as a friend but I don’t feel they respect me as a friend which I struggled to find throughout my entire life. I want to be friends with people but I don’t want them to be friends with me just to use me for a particular period of my life and vice versa with me unconsciously using them. Anyways I was taking the friendship slow and didn’t want to rush it in any way. I didn’t want to mess it up. Also they have there own lives, work have girlfriends etc. which is fine. I’m not complaining about this and am not trying to control people. They also knew each other longer so they invite each other out to places which is also fine because unlike my high school “friends” We only just met a couple of weeks ago. I knew the people in high school for longer and it felt more crappy for them to leave me out despite my efforts. But then guess what. This stupid corona virus stuff happened, classes were canceled and it’s hard to take a friendship anywhere when you don’t see the people. Now we do communicate from time to time when it comes to online classes. We haven’t lost our friendship but I see that we soon will. It’s inevitable which I know is fine. It’s also hard for me to meet new people outside this group. 

Anyways I’m not sure but I think my loneliness has caused me to develop depression. Although I never was diagnosed by a medical professional. I just get these stages where I’m really sad which is the reason I started to write this (which makes me feel better slightly). There’s also other reason for my depression (again I wasn’t diagnosed by a psychiatrist I just have a good feeling I have it) such as not finding a passion or purpose in my life yet that gives me a clear goal/idea/road/direction in my life (I am working on this by taking baby steps and making short term goals. For example I recently made the small goal of getting my drivers license and was able to achieve that). I also get anxiety when thinking about my future. It’s hard for me to live in the present . I’m either thinking about the past wishing I was younger again and could do things over differently or I’m either overthinking the future or current problems if this I wrote isn’t evidence enough(what I wrote here could be classified as a memoir at this point). I do tend to overthink a lot and pace back and forth when I do. Pacing helps me think when I’m angry, frustrated, sad etc. I noticed I’m pacing while I write this to help my mind flow and not to get my mind blocked which happens if I stand still. Weird I know lol. I hate to admit but at times I cry myself to sleep and begin to hate myself for feeling sorry for myself which adds to it. My loneliness and being a loner especially doesn’t help when I’m technically a only child with no people my age really to talk to. My sibling are 8 to 11 years apart and are much older. Nothing against talking to adults, I quite enjoy it sometimes. I learn a few things or two from those who are older sometimes. It’s just that I want to be able to talk more to those my age as-well for a change so that I could act my age and enjoy my youth (what’s left of it) while I still can. I never had experiences with friends like the majority of people in around me had. I never even gotten into a little trouble when I was young which is a blessing but it’s also makes me think “damn, I never truly lived, I kind of just existed.” It’s hard to be lonely especially when you are stuck in a room(this world) where everyone is social, getting notifications on there phone from their friends messaging them. I can’t remember the last time I got a message from a friend just to talk and not to discuss class work, homework and school projects. It’s come to the point where I began to envy and resent people who have human connection that I don’t, which I know isn’t a good emotion to have. I’m trying to work on that like I’m trying to work on literally every aspect about myself. It’s the best I could do honestly. I play video games and love watching movies, which helps me to escape these thoughts. Video games is kind of my hobby(which I know isn’t the best hobby to have when it comes to being active but it is extremely common. I personally think it’s considered a passerby because should a hobby be something you enjoy doing that productive. Video games aren’t that productive but yeah I enjoy the hell out of them. Especially when they tell a good story which is why I like watching movies. And actually I’ve slowly began to get into books for this reason. But also I like to play video games competitively. Now I do play a lot but I’ve recently decided to limit the amount of time I play so that I don’t play for hours on end anymore and can do other things with my life). Another one of my “hobbies” is watching YouTube content which also helps me to escape. However I feel like I’m using these things more as a crutch for my loneliness and depression and it’s slowly making it worse, while Turning my brain into mush. 

Now all of this is mostly my fault, I know. I have no one to blame but my self and take full responsibility despite many factors leading me to this moment of my life where I’m writing this here (interesting how life works. If you think about it every decision of your life has lead you to reading this comment if you read it. If one of your decisions no matter how minor may have been different there’s a chance where you wouldn’t be reading this at all. Or I wouldn’t have mustered the courage to write this). In high school I could have done more. I could have joined clubs, tried out more sports to see if I was interesting instead of just soccer,  basketball and mix martial arts. I could have not argued with one of my friends in highschool (we were both wrong for arguing with each other looking back at it. He was being a asshole to me and I lost my temper and lashed out on him. Now when I think about it it happened multiple times. I hate when people decide to be assholes for no reason. It really hurts me in the inside and I guess I don’t know how to show this and instead show it with anger. ) which cause me to be more distant with the rest of friends because they obviously took his side before listening to both sides of the story :(. Also what doesn’t help is that I tend to hide my emotions. I don’t like to show them or open up to others and be vulnerable which is partly why I’m using this reddit to write anonymously. This is probably a common human struggle to express emotions especially for men. Men are required to suck it up and keep it moving according to societal standards anyway since we are supposed to be strong both physically and psychologically (which is partly the way it should be in my opinion but it also isn’t healthy when it becomes excessive). When I do turn to people such as my mother about me feeling like I may be depressed, she tells me to suck it up and gets a little angry at me. Now my mother isn’t abusive or a mean person. She is very nice actually and I really love her. I understand where she’s coming from. She feels like there is no reason for me to be depressed. To understand this way of thinking you need to understand where she is coming from and put yourself in her shoes. I proabably expressed my personal frustration with my self in the wrong way which I regret because I probably made her feel like crap. My mother grew up and busted her a** to get where she’s at now. My mother is now a single hard working mother who makes a lot of sacrifices for me and my siblings (especially when they were also around my age and younger). This may be cliche to say since many people say it but my mother is really tough and has brought herself from being poor to being middle class and living very comfortably. She always taught me that I had to work for what I wanted which I completely agree with. I don’t think anything comes for free in this world. Anyways I basically get everything I could have possibly needed and wanted when I was younger. I grew up with a strong foundation for me to mainly focus on my education and become whatever I want if I put my mind into it with sweat and tears if need be. I even have my older siblings as good role models as they have led successful careers. Unfortunately other people my age can’t say the same and for those people I am sorry, especially if your reading this thread with my small first world problems . I really shouldn’t have any right to complained. I am basically spoiled. I am completely grateful for everything I had leading you to this point in my life even though it may not sound like I am at times. However I don’t think mental illness discriminates against anyone no matter who you may be or what you may achieve in life. Unfortunately I think my mental illness has been keeping me from achieving my full potential in life. Perhaps I’m focusing on the wrong things on life. This has added to my depression due to me feeling depressed. Imagine getting all the tools you need to lead a successful life and then you still feel depressed. Like shame on me for feeling depressed. I shouldn’t feel depressed. Me feeling depressed under these circumstances makes me feel more depressed for feeling depressed and so I and so on. It’s like a endless unhealthy loop I seem like I can’t get out of. Since I have no one to really turn to now because of me not feeling comfortable explaining this to those who love me I’m turning to reddit (I know I’m a genius for this idea. Reddit! Yeah; I’m saying this sarcastically). I would like to add here that my father seems to be proud of me seemingly for no reason, telling others about my accomplishments and what a great son I am due to how dedicated I am in school and getting a education. I think that my accomplishments are no big deal. I hate praise because I don’t like to be put up in a pedi stool and make others look up to me or feel ashamed with there selves because they are comparing theirselves. Like how I compare my self to others and feel ashamed at where I’m at when I know we are all running our own race. It also places a burden on me if I don’t live up to his expectations. It adds to my depression. I want to make both of my parents and my parents proud which means being the best I could be which isn’t always easy. It’s not easy to give 110 percent everyday and I look in awe at how my parents do it. I really look up to them but I have admittedly been falling short of expectations maybe due to my depression and loneliness. And yet my father still praising me. Dad pls stop I know you love me and no matter what happens you’ll feel proud but man is life hard sometimes. 

Also what I would like to add is that throughout my childhood it was hard for me to make human connections with my piers because my mother was very overprotective of me (especially since I’m her only boy and am the youngest.) which meant that she wouldn’t really allow me to hang out with friends and it would be a miracle if she did. This causes my friends that I had to naturally think it was me making excuses and not wanting to hang out with them which caused them to distance themselves from me and eventually end the friendship. She thankfully had stopped doing this as often but the damage had already been done. My situation with my mother reminds me of the myth of Baldur specifically the one from the game god of war. Baldur is a Norse (Aesir) God and is the god of light, joy, purity and the summer sun. He is the son of Odin the Norse (Aesir) king of gods and The goddess Frigg. Anyways Frigg saw a prophecy that her son was going to die and his death was going to cause ragnorok(the Norse term for Armageddon or what we know it as the apocalypse). Frigg like most mothers loved her child so much so she decided to protect her child even if it meant going to extreme measures to do so. This led her to thinking selfishly so she cast a spell on her son and took away the ability for him to feel anything at all. He became completely numb. This spell also made it so that no object in the universe could harm her son. However she forgot to ask one object and forgot to place it under the spell. The mistletoe. The mistle toe essentially became the one object that could possibly kill baldur and break the spell. One would think wow wouldn’t it be great to not feel pain and to live a life with little fear of dying but no it wouldn’t. See like immortality(like how in other popular stories immortality makes one see all there loved ones pass away and everyone they get close to eventually pass away while they are forced to keep living), being robbed of ones feeling of anything also robs them of some of the pleasures life has to give. I think that this in this myth is used as a metaphor and a cautionary tale that reflects reality. In the story Baldur although still loving his mother resented this action by her. Eventually he began to very deeply associate this action with his mother and not only resented this action but his mother. He couldn’t stand the side of her as it reminded him of what she had done to him. Frigg would also Boast throughout Asgard and all the realms that nothing could harm her son. Everyone would try to kill her son to no avail. At the end of all versions of the myth, he ends up being killed by the god of mischief, Loki, who knew Frigg was cocky and had forgotten the mistletoe. By trying to protect her son, Frigg only drove her so away and ended up being the main cause for his downfall/death fulfilling the prophecy. Her need to overprotect her son is what kickstarted and fulfilled the prophecy in the first place and if she hadn’t done this spell on Baldur perhaps he would have lived a happier life and appreciated his mother more. I’m not saying I resent my mother. I don’t. I love her and hope that in the future I don’t begin to resent her but in the story my character would be Balder, my mother would be Frigg and life would be Loki. My believe my mother is overprotective because she doesn’t want me to experience the hardships she had growing up which mistakenly causes her to rob some of the pleasures from my life. Again my situation is mostly my fault I just chose to explain this portion like this so that those reading this would understand. I also say it a cautionary tale in my opinion because it’s like saying to let your kids go a little especially as they get older. They may begin to resent you if you continue to hold their hand everywhere they go in life instead of teaching them how to become independent. Also boasting about your children to others isn’t a good thing. No ones is perfect even your children no matter if your a parent and see that none of your child’s actions could make him a bad person. If you boast to the wrong person, those who hate you will look for a weakness in your success and take it away from you and tear you down peace by peace. It’s mostly human nature for others to do so in this world. After all a baby bird does stay in the nest for its entire life. 

Back on topic of me asking for advice. I feel like I’m socially dumb. I don’t know how to initiate conversations, how to make convos flow or find ways to relate to others. I feel like I was a caged up bird my whole life and now that I’m older and am being released into the world I’m put at a sever disadvantage. This is probably the cause of my depression because I know I’m behind everyone else when it comes socially. I’m a nice person but I’m not perfect. I could work on things such as being a good friend to others if I want good friends. Believe me I try but it’s definitely not easy trying to be a good friend. I’m too hard on myself. I am a person who doesn’t like getting into problems with others and I’m slow to anger. But man when you get me angry I cannot control my temper because I bottle up my emotions and release them all at once which could potentially make dangerous if I don’t learn how to control it. I’m also not that funny of a person so it’s hard to make others laugh. I often look around me and look in awe how people start conversations and seemingly make bonds easily while I struggle. I also try to learn from these people but I also don’t want to be nosy. Now i can be considered a shy person with a slightly low self esteem but once I get to know a person it’s easy for me to talk to talk to them. It’s just that initial icebreaker. Even then connections with other people don’t last with me. I am a person who tries to be positive but when I’m angry or frustrated I think negatively and automatically assume the worst in myself I tend to laugh a lot too but deep down I’m hurting on the inside and don’t know necessarily why. My depression gets so bad sometimes I physically feel it in my chest.

People seem to think I’m weird or get uncomfortable if there’s a pause in a conversation leading to awkward silences. Especially the ladies it seems. It’s like women expect men to keep the conversation flowing and be funny, witty and charming. It’s like they unconsciously want men to be leaders despite wanting equality (or do people want equity. It seems like many people including myself get the definition of equity and equality mixed up with each other despite them meaning two different things). It seems that a lot of women look up to men and this translates to little and simple things as well such as regular conversations. Well most of the time from what I observe. People also seem to be weird when I do talk and talk about some of the topics I’m interested in such as talking about certain movies. For some reason I almost always have different opinions from the rest of society or it seems like this from those around me which causes people to further dislike me. People now and days seem to get really upset when there a difference in opinion from one person to the next. Especially with all these social movements going around now. It’s like I don’t fit it with my generation or time and was born by mistake and in the wrong time. I don’t think people’s opinions should define whether or not you like a person. I thinks it’s healthier to develop relationships with those who have opinions that don’t only align with yours. Also It’s like in conversations I have I feel like I’m being tested in a testing room. People like to judge and yes I’m guilty of this to a certain extent as well but I don’t like to judge others. 

Not to get all religious here but I have turned to religion. I consider myself a Christian and I do pray to god for answers. Although I feel he is silent or that I don’t know how to understand him when he communicates to me. Maybe this is his way of telling me that I need to get closer to him by reading the Bible (which I find extremely boring) maybe he just gets angry because he feels I only pray to him when I’m sad or need something and not just to talk to him. I believe in god but my faith and relationship with him isn’t as strong as it should be therefore my love for him isn’t as strong as it should be because I don’t realize how much he loves me. And I do feel like he has blessed me and continues to send me blessing
Despite me continuing to sin. Maybe he’s waiting for me to realize that he is the best possible friend I could ever have. Maybe I’ll get so desperate for answers that he turn me into his tool to save others. Who knows.

Anyways...

Here are my actual questions (keep in mind after writing all of this I don’t really know what the right question to ask is): How do I make friends and connect with people? How do I find happiness within myself? How do I continue to improve my self to be the best I could be? What are healthy distractions one could use to escape their mind and negative thoughts? Is all of this happening because a lack of male role models in my life(my father is around but I rarely see him. But when i do, I do learn good life lessons from him)? Am I possibly depressed not because my social situation but because of physical reasons such as chemical imbalances? How do I keep friendships going? How do I date girls without being dependent on them for happiness since I’m a loner (also if I do get a girlfriend which isn’t a goal for me right now since I want to work on myself first, I want to give a girl I like or maybe possibly live the best of me that I could possibly give. This questions though is the least of my problems and on the bottom of my bucket list but I along with 99 percent of the men out there would be lying if i said it wasn’t on my bucket list)? Is there no hope for me since I had very little social development growing up, making me socially crippled? Should I see a therapist/psychiatrist, and how do I do so without letting my family know (and if I have to let anyone know how would I go about doing it? What if I don’t have the money to see one often? Are there any books that I could read that could give me therapy?)? Am I a weak man for thinking this way? If i’m a weak person how do I become mentally stronger? More specifically how to I continue to build friendships after the corona virus issue? How do I make friends without seeming desperate to others (which is a turn off to people in many ways)? How do I make my parents proud even if I have been falling short of greatness? Is there any other advice you would give me? How do I not get anxiety and not feel nervous about various things all the time? I know that most of you are not professionals in dealing with this thus it would be hard to give advice. 

Thank you in advance for reading this if you did and thanks you in advance for your help/advice and/or just listening as most of this is just me venting at this point. Stay safe out there people and don’t get sick. Appreciate it. Goodbye",23Mar2020,1
718,My cousin was in town and we were hanging out but since there is a quarantine almost everything is closed so we decided to drink. Please dont lecture me about underage drinking I know it's not a good idea but we were safe I promise. The problem was that I got on my phone and text this girl that I loved her about 100 times. She forgave me the next day saying it was kind of funny but we drank that night too and I did it again. She won't answer my messages now and just leaves me on read. I really messed up but I dont know what I should say or do to show her I'm sorry. Any advice is appreciated.,23Mar2020,1
720,Hi everybody. I need some advice. My husband approached me about a month ago and told me he had feelings for his coworker. He said that he in a moment of weakness expressed these feelings to her a few days before. She said she felt the same way but that her and her husband have an open relationship so as long as she is open with her husband she can likely proceed with some type of relationship. Since that time my husband and I have gone back and forth he is unwilling to give up the relationship he has with her and it keeps progressing. They were snap chatting and he admitted to also deleting text messages shared between the two of them. They are talking about their feelings. He is adamant that nothing physical has happened including sexting and I believe him. He said that he would be open with me and text her and not delete anything and he has been true to that. He wants to be polyamorous now (we’ve been monogamous since we got married 6 years ago) but only date this other woman. I have told him I don’t want that and it makes me sick to think about. He keeps insisting that he loves me and doesn’t want to end our marriage and that I fulfill him in every way but I don’t think I do if he feels he needs this relationship so badly in his life. We’re at a standstill and don’t know how to proceed. I fee so sick and jealous and have been tried to be open minded but I’m so hurt and I can’t get past the pain it is causing me. Should I be more open minded and let him proceed with this affair because it’s something he wants knowing that it would be really really painful for me or do I stick to my guns and ask him to end the relationship or divorce me?,23Mar2020,1
721,"I’m afraid to be judged, and I don’t want to ruin this person’s life, as I do love them very much, and in a way I’ve already forgiven them. But with that being said I don’t know who to tell this to or if I even should, but lately it’s been eating me up inside.

I don’t know if I should go into detail, but I think writing it out would help. I don’t even want to say who it was who did this to me on here, even here I dont fully feel anonymous. I’ll just say someone close to me, whom everyone in my life knows, and who I see very often, left me with this memory I can’t shake as of recent. 

I dont remember how old I was, but I was a child. (I am 26 now) Whenever I wanted to play video games while this person was playing, they wouldn’t let me but instead would sit me on their lap and say if I gave them a “weenie rub” then I could play when it was over. I vaguely remember it happening more than once. I remember not wanting to do it, but it was the only way I’d be allowed to play, so I’d do it. I also remember a separate occasion being shown their privates and poking it with my finger, and I know it’s weird but I specifically remember saying that it felt like a noodle. Every once in a while throughout my life I would remember these moments and feel sick to my stomach, but I try to tell myself it was a long time ago, it wasn’t that serious, we were kids, it was a mistake and that it has never happened again since so why should I give it any thought? 

 I want to say more but I dont know how, and I want to tell someone but I dont know who. I don’t want this person to get in trouble because it will ruin both our lives. But I will always have this shred of resentment towards them. I tell myself I’ve forgiven this person and try to forget but like I said, this book I read recently set my anxiety circuits on high and I think I need to anonymously share this bit of information. With anyone at this point.

I want to truly be able to forgive this person and just move on from it. But maybe I should just see a therapist...",23Mar2020,1
722,"Hey there, 
So I guess I’ll just get right to it...

I met an amazing guy a few months ago, due to hectic schedules and of course this pandemic we haven’t been able to see one another. We’ve been keeping in touch pretty much every day via texts/phone calls/FaceTime. We have great conversations that last past 2am, I feel like I’m in high school all over again lol 

Last night he mentioned how he’s waiting for me to open up, and I think it’s been so many years that I’m used to it. I’m always the one to listen &amp; be there for everyone. I know that’s a part of meeting someone who could potentially become my SO. I honestly don’t know where to start with opening up, idk why I’m having this issue, granted my past relationships they never noticed and clearly that’s a great reason why they’re past relationships! 

This guy has goals, followed his dreams &amp; is doing his dream job everyday. He’s into family &amp; is God fearing. He understands the dynamics of relationships &amp; wants to be married &amp; start his own family one day. He has such a great sense of humor &amp; is affectionate without hesitation. These are all of the things I’ve looked for and now it’s finally here.... I don’t want to blow it. 

I’ll say this, I am an open book to a certain point. I’ll answer any question honestly &amp; idk what to do to get beyond this road block.",23Mar2020,1

731,"Hi everyone. 
Keeping it short, my ex and I were together for 3 years. We broke up around 4 months ago. 
During our relationship, he purchased a king size bed for my room because he wasn’t happy with my double bed. This was completely his idea as the bed was massive and I wasn’t particularly happy with it taking up 90% of my room. Anyway he went ahead and bought it. 
Getting to breaking up. Wasn’t a good breakup. But regarding the bed.. I contacted him multiple times about it since it was his property. Contacted him about it on 6 occasions to be exact and every time he told me to “just scrap it” because he wanted the situation over and done with. I even offered to arrange delivery for him to have it dropped off at his. He refused. My last text to him was “I’m going to scrap the bed within the next week so if you do want it, you need to tell me now” .  He replied with “No. Just stop contacting me” . 
So a few weeks later.. I scrapped it.  
He then contacted me out the blue a week or so after this saying “I want my bed back” and then proceeded to go on a massive raging rant at how the bed was his property and how dare I scrap it.. I had no right to and how he’s going to proceed with legal action if I don’t refund him the money for the bed. 
I mean... I contacted him 6 times over it !! 

Does anyone have any advice what I should do ? Can he take legal action against me for this ? 

Thanks guys.",23Mar2020,1

734,"Sooo this is probably gonna be a long text, I apologize to all grammar-nazis as English isn't my first language.

A little bit of a backstory first:
It was October when I met this wonderful girl, she was fricking beautiful in every aspect.
So a few weeks passed and we already have a great friendship.

A few more days pass and she begins to do things like put her head on my shoulder, give kisses on my cheek and hug me throughout the whole D&amp;D session.

I was already at the peak of happiness, as I liked her and I thought she liked me at this point, and a few more ""hints"" manifest, as she begins to hold my hand a lot of times and without esitation.

At this point I think i should tell her how I feel, but she doesn't feel the same and it's OK, because we can still be friends.

End of the backstory.

We then continued as normal (apart that I was obviously bad because I thought it was gonna be an happy ending) until she began to step away from all of us. Now it's been 2 months, she doesn't text any of us, not even her great female friend, I don't know if I'm the cause of this in any possible way or if something bad cound have happened, but I thought this would have been the best sub to post this.

So, how can I fix this? I didn't text her much as she doesn't seem to answer often, and if she does, she stops the same day, but I miss her so much and I don't know what to do, she was one of the best persons I've ever met.

I am 19, I live in Italy so I've been in quarantine for more than two weeks now. Just before the start of this thing me and my girlfriend broke up, and these days have been very difficult for me.

I don't have many friends, so I feel like I have no one to talk to, I even tried reaching out to an old ex, just to have someone I kinda knew, but that didn't really work out.

I waste my days on reddit or YouTube, I sometimes try to listen to music or watch some movies but it's hard as I feel very depressed. The highlight of my routine is the shower in the evening, in which I usually stay more than 30/40 minutes to ""escape"" from the rest of my daily life.

740,"hi there. my pa is 73 years old, and has a severe amazon addiction. he is also stubborn as all hell, and honestly is a little self absorbed. he works at home and loves menards and home depot. 
to clarify how bad his addiction has gotten: we call our basement macys. we have a fairly large house and his stuff consumes over half of the basement, two sheds, his office and the garage. minor spaces include his couch table, the coat closet and their walk in closet. if he isnt working, he is on facebook, watching sports or at home depot. this is no exaggeration. despite all of this, i love him and want him to be okay. now, my ma is 64 and honestly inside is 20. she is the best woman you’d ever meet, though she has her issues too. my ma and pa have argued forever. they get really bad and, by my mas request, recorded some of them. (note: my pa is actually my step-pa and my ma is not my birthmom, she is technically my grandma). 

anyways, onto what im asking advice for. we know of most of his amazon shenanigans, but something odd has been happening. our chevy cruze is very good on gas. my ma took me out to practice driving and after an hour and a half, it had zero atfect on the full tank. a one hour trip barely eats about an eighth. however, after we’ve come home after a day out (we have two cars, of course because of his addiction), the cruze’s gas tank is empty. we took our other car that day, and as we know he either went to pick something up real quick or just stayed home. we have no idea where he’s going, but its somewhere. 
im searching for an app desperately that i can put on his phone as an “antivirus” that is actually one of those teenager-tracking apps. i would like to track his location, but browsing/purchase history would be good too. this is my ma’s idea, btw. the reason we are so concerned about his purchase history is because of debt. so much debt. he wont tell us how much debt he’s in, but its well over 10k. my ma refuses to marry him until hes gone of this debt (jonestly their relationship is a whole other story). i know why he’s doing it, and what his stressor is, but that, again, is a whole different story. we’re frugal as all hell, so i prefer it to be free or cheap. thank you all in advance.",23Mar2020,1

742,"I moved to California before the crisis, because I left my crystal ball at home. I got a call midway through Arizona about the truck and, somehow we got to talking, and I scored a job at uhaul. I pulled over to submit my applicaton and resume. They seemed like pretty nice people and I was strapped for cash. I got the job, but I knew I could do better. 

I spent my few months here between establishing residency, uhaul, and touring the cities with my SO. We had just come back from a wedding when we heard about that one of the hospitals accidentally released a patient with a certain virus. It was just a joke when I said, ""I'm pretty sure that's how 28 Weeks later started.""

I'm now an essential staff member on the front lines of uhaul. My manager laid it all out right after Newsom closed CA that we're remaining open to help college students find storage and get home to their originating countries and hand out trucks to responders and other essentials. Hours are cut. No hazard pay. If we're sick, we have to find a replacement and stay home without pay. We're constantly running out of sanitary supplies, because the move in/out rate is on high. Joe Shoen is sending us videos from his home saying things like ""we must all band together..."" and ""thank you for your service"".

I haven't gotten any callbacks from any applications I put in a couple days after the wedding. I've been applying everything that pops up as 'work from home' since then. I keep feeling like I'm not doing something right, but I keep reminding myself that I'm not the only one looking for a job. I'm asking other 'essentials' that swing by if they have openings, but it's either no dice or they're personally not sure if they're going to have their own job.

I just want to keep the lights on and food on the table. I've called everyone that sends a bill to work out some lienancy and it has worked to some effect. My SO applied for EDD a week ago for emergency unemployment, but they haven't called her back. 

NGL I'm nervous as shit. I've in worked retail, pharmaceutical, construction, and education. I've updated my resume thousands of times. I'm either getting overlooked or they're not open. It's either work until I get the virus or starve. I'm looking for advice, because I feel so lost. Clearly, I'm not the best with luck, so I don't know how to take 'just stick it out'.

I personally don't want to move. I know it's all about starting fresh or whatever, but I don't really want to leave my life here behind. My boyfriend (23) who lives a state away has generously offered for me to live with him. I've been dating him for 8 months, but I've known him for 3 years. He has a job at a hospital with health benefits, a house already paid off, and a mother that's planning to move out soon. If I moved in i'd work part time jobs until I could community college. Only problem is that my parents, particularly my mother, doesn't approve. She gets absolutely offended that I would ask her; she says I'm not ready to live with someone and that I have to think about my future, but eventually trails off and gets frustrated with our current situation, so it's hard for me to take her seriously. I haven't talked to my father about it cause the reaction with my mom is so bad, and I think he wants me to help paying rent if I move to the east coast.

I don't really have a plan with my life atm. I was majoring in Chemical Engineering but I realized I just wasn't cut out for the stem career. I do want to go to a community college and get a degree, but I haven't got a clue in what. Because of this, I feel like my parents feel the need to take control of my life and make decisions for me. To me, I think moving to the east coast would be very expensive and wouldn't leave me much time to figure out what I want to do. 

If I'm honest, a major reason I don't want to move with my family is my relationship with my boyfriend. We both agreed that if I did move, the distance would be too much for us. I currently live 6 hours away, and it's already hard. I know it's not a great reason to make a big life decision, but I can't imagine him not being in my life. He has given me more emotional support than my parents through all of this, and I know if I wasn't moving our relationship would be just fine.

My friends say I'm an adult and I should make my own decisions, but I'm really unsure if i'm ready. If I moved in with my boyfriend, I know there would be many new challenges regarding our relationship and I would have to take on many responsibilities I'm not used to, on top of the fact that I wont have any support from my family.  If I move to California, I know that I would be very unhappy and I would have to take on my family's financial burden. How do I know what's right for me?

TLDR: Family is moving across the country because of financial issues. I want to live with my boyfriend, but parents don't approve. I don't know what to make of my future.",23Mar2020,1

746,"So me and this girl have been crushing over each other for awhile now. She didn’t know I had this huge crush on her, but I kinda knew she was interested in me. She suddenly gives me her number, I text her back and we hit it off. We talk for about two weeks and she hints that we should date. So I ask her out and we start dating. I’m in college with a year left she has a kid, no high school diploma, and not the best job, but it’s whatever because I really like her. As we’re dating she always brings up the fact that I have so much to look forward too in life and that I’m an amazing person and that she doesn’t know why I like her. I always tell her why I like her and how she’s just as amazing and wonderful etc. We had sex the first couple of days we’re together. We’re both pretty open about everything so everything seems perfectly normal. A week goes on and I pick her up from work we have sex. Each time we had sex she was the one that always initiated it. We both hangout, talk, laugh and joke around for the rest of the night. I drop her off we kiss we say our goodbyes. It was a great night. We’re texting each other for about 5-10 mins we’re joking still and we both said goodnight we’ll talk tomorrow. An hour later she sends a long text talking about how she’s been in bed thinking a lot and she thinks we rushed too soon and that she’s not ready for it. She says I’m this great wonderful person again with so much potential who can do way better and wants me to live my life how I want too. Then says we should just be friends. I wake up to this in shock because it was so sudden, unexpected, and completely out of left field. I was really disappointed she sent it over text especially a little over an hour after I dropped her off after hanging out all night. Before we got together I said I wanted to take it slow and I don’t know I’m just confused about the whole thing. I texted her back my response and she hasn’t responded in 24 hours so I’m just feeling really betrayed and heartbroken right now.",23Mar2020,1

756,"I am 23 and recently moved in with my Grandmother after 5 years of being on my own so I could save some money to pay off my debt. This Lockdown may be the end of me...

I often hear my grandmother's phone conversations (as she likes to sit by the door next to my bed and yell into the phone loud enough to wake me up). She fabricates stories about me and loves to make me out to seem evil. On Christmas Eve, she announced I was the the Spawn of Satan to the entire family, but my sister was an angel. 

Until recently, she would call my mom to talk s*** about me (examples: that I'm sleeping with the entire town, that I call her horrible names, that I abuse my cat, and so much more- anything she can think of). My mom and I are very close so she knows these things aren't true (most obvious- I'm gay, so no, I'm not sleeping with these men). Since my mom stopped putting up with the lies AND with the Lockdown in place, my grandma has started calling every single relative (anyone she can, really) and smearing my name. I even hear her calling random people on Craigslist to talk about me, keeping them on the phone by pretending to buy a large ticket item (although she has no money to buy these things).

I woke up this morning to my grandmother on the phone slandering again. She was saying I was trying to kill her with covid-19. That I have been going out all night, every night, and intentionally dragging in the virus, hoping that she will get it. I assume the person on the phone asked how I was going out all night with the Lockdown in place because she responds with a finely spun tale about secret bars staying open all over the place and how only certain people can go in- me being one of those people and that I'm out until 4am every night... Yet, I haven't left the property except to grocery shop WITH HER in over a week (since my job took early precautions, it closed a week before the Lockdown). How do I stay sane while being super-trapped in this abusive environment? How can I get her to stop all the slander? 


TLDR: My grandma wont stop smearing my name (now saying I'm intentionally trying to kill her with covid-19). I stay there and have nowhere else to stay- especially during the lockdown...how do I stay sane? How do I get her to stop?",23Mar2020,1

Everytime I get on the phone with my girlfriend she's always getting distracted watching YouTube or something on her xbox one that I bought her and  she never says anything to much when we video call on duo and then she wonders why I don't say anything sometimes because even when I do the conversation never keeps going and not only that but everytime I ask her about future things we can do together such as activities on our anniversary or  a day where we can hangout or what we should do she always says she doesn't know and its really annoying because it's like she's just drifting in life and  has a short attention span and when we first got together she was never like this! She's even easily distracted at times while were together and im trying to talk to her.in addition her family always seems to have a problem if were alone like for example we cant sit in the back of the car together or if I'm at her house her mom comes downstairs and literally sits in the back on her phone(watching us) everytime and when I talk to her about me being lonely and depressed at times because she barely text me or she's always going on trips thus ruining what I had planned for us in spring, or summer.  I'm honestly sick of this relationship and  april will make a year and although I talked to her about this I haven't seen improvements yet and she seems sad.honestly I cant wait until we go back to school and in addition to that when we are out of school it's hard to see her just like now because either her parents are assholes at times or she keeps putting it off to ask them until I keep asking her and I've reached the point where I'm done trying.what should I do?

On the plus side, my dad promised that if senior trip doesnt happen he will take her and some of her friends to Disney over summer break using the money that was refunded.

However, we cant really do anything about the rest of this sucky situation. I just want her to feel better but I dont know what to say or do to give her any hope. I wish I could tell her that she'll get to go back to school but I dont know and ik she wont believe me anyways.

I graduated college in December, so I barely missed this pandemic and can't relate in the same way. However, I still feel sick to my stomach over my sister that I find myself crying over what she is missing when I'm alone.

764,"Hi, hope this isn't a dumb question. I just feel really conflicted about it and could use an outside perspective. I'm 22 and live at home with my parents and younger sister who has been sent home from college because of the pandemic (we are in the US). Mine and my sister's bathroom is above a home office and for the past few months, water from the bathroom has leaked down into the office. The ceiling was starting to rot initially, at this point, pieces are starting to fall off. My parents did a bunch of assessment things and basically we have to get the whole bathroom renovated to stop the issue and then later go in and fix the ceiling, I don't know what it is specifically, it might have something to do with the pipes? We've tried shutting the water off and using other bathrooms but that hasn't really helped in the past.

The problem is this renovation was supposed to start today, the company has called my family and asked whether we would like to go through with it starting Wednesday or reschedule. If we say yes, there will be 2-3 people in our house for 4-10 days. The company is in a state where nonessential business has closed, and they have been deemed essential and are apparently taking precautions with regards to cleanliness and staying 6 feet apart and whatnot. On our side, my family has been social distancing for a week now, some of us longer, and everyone working has been working from home as long as possible. 

My dad wants to go through with things, my sister doesn't care, and my mom and I are on the fence about it. At the speed things have been going with our house my dad is worried about the ceiling collapsing, especially if some sort of quarantine continues indefinitely, and thinks everyone involved is at a lower risk of having the virus now as opposed to 2-3 months from now. I can see his point but am not sure if I agree 100% (or know if his logic is sound ... I am by no means an expert in virology or carpentry).

770,"     So I was with this girl for about a month, right? Well, we’re both females (and bisexual). Her parents are pretty homophobic, but they didn’t know about us, so we were able to pass as just friends so we could spend the night with each other every once in a while. I’m going to call her Anna. 
     Well Anna was upset one day and she told me it was because her mom found out about us, and she wasn’t happy about it. I took that as Anna was breaking up with me so I shut down all of my feelings in fear of being hurt. Spoiler alert: she wasn’t breaking up with me. 
I couldn’t get out of this feeling of not feeling anything, though. So I told her what was going on and then she decided to end things between us. She realized she had made a mistake but I wouldn’t let her back in, I was upset and angry for a while. But after a few weeks, we got back together. But it was different, I was still so shaken up about everything and I didn’t feel the same towards her, I was scared, and resilient. 
We broke up again only about 3 weeks after that. We haven’t spoken for months at this point.
     I got a boyfriend in the time we were apart, except were long distance. I’m going to call him Jackson. We got super close and we’ve really grown to love each other. He’s super sweet, and amazing, and just all around an amazing person. He means so much to me. 
     Things between Jackson and me were going perfect, until Anna came back. And not in the sense that she started talking to me, but that she wouldn’t leave my mind. I caught myself thinking about her nonstop. I’d get so nervous when I’d see her in the hallways at school or see posts on social media she had made. 
     I’ve been talking to a really close friend and family member of mine, Julia is what we’ll say her name is. She loves Jackson, and thinks he’s great; but she thinks I still have feelings for Anna, and thinks we’d be better together. 
     I gave in and decided to try to be friends with Anna again. I told myself and Julia I’m only going to be friends with Anna as of now. I want to be actual friends as try to build a non-romantic relationship with her first before anything happens. I know that I love Jackson, but I also have to accept that I’ve been noticing Anna a lot.
     I know that she likes me a lot. Neither Jackson nor Anna know my dilemma, and I don’t know what to do. I spent all yesterday in my room with my tarot cards trying to see if they could give me any sort of answer, and all they seem to do is just tell me about my situation, which I already know that I’m in and aware that it’s a tough spot to be in. 
 Incase it helps, here’s what I wrote in my notes a few days ago just to get it all out:
 
 “I keep think about Anna. She likes me and I can’t stop thinking about her and us and what we could be and what we were.
I’m in a relationship where I’m happy. I really really care about him and I wouldn’t want to hurt him in a million years. We love each other.
I keep thinking how easy it would be to have her though. How nice it would be to have her here to hold, to kiss, to cuddle. I keep seeing flashbacks of her asleep in my arms. I was watching Futurama and she was cuddled up to me with my arms around her. I was stroking her hair and kissing her forehead and then I realized she was sleeping. I keep seeing that over and over again in my head, and I don’t know if that means I want her, or I want that with him. 
My brain could be pulling me through these delusions because it’s what I want with Jackson, but Anna’s the only person I’ve ever experienced something real like that with. 
Or it could be telling me that I want her, and I could be with her. But it doesn’t feel right. 
Not having her doesn’t feel right either. But it’s more tolerable than the thought of being wrong, and hurting someone else, and ruining something good over just a feeling.”
     
     If anyone has any thoughts or ideas or advice for me, please let me know in either the comments of this post or DM me. Or any tarot readers that would be interested in doing a quick reading for me to see what I should do in this situation.",23Mar2020,1

Her grades have started slipping in school, she’s become depressed and has severe anxiety. She’s started having sex with her 18 year old boyfriend. I had to by her a plan b pill a couple of weeks ago because they had sex without any protection while they were both wasted. 

She’s been going to parties with her boyfriend where they both get drunk and drive home. Someone slipped her friend a date rape drug and tried to have sexual with her when she eventually passed out. 

I don’t want to be a snitch, but I want her to be safe. Maybe if she was older, I wouldn’t be so worried, but she’s only 14, and I’ve been around alcoholics my whole life, and I don’t want her to turn out like that. When she was younger, she always talked about her aspirations and what she wanted to do when she finished school. I’ve practically helped raised her (I’m 4 years older, she’s a close family friend) and I love her to death. She’s not the person she used to be at all, and it would make me sick if something happened to her that I could’ve stopped.

I don’t want her to know that I snitched either, as she knows that I’m bisexual, and i don’t want my whole family to find out. I know that’s a selfish reason to not tell, but I don’t know what I would do, I’m not ready to tell anyone.

Story time...

I'm 24(m) trying to learn how to handle the end of a nearly decade long relationship. I supported her as she supported me. We shared interests and view points. We got along way better than what you see in ""most relationships"". Fast forward to this passed September, the weekend of our 7th anniversary, I came home after having spent a few days in Louisville, Kentucky visiting distant friends and obtaining a bottle of bourbon I had engraved for the benefit my mom works every year. I walk in the door and I'm immediately hit with this conversation of breaking up. For those passed couple of weeks I had felt something in the back of my mind telling me this was going to happen, but for whatever reason I never tried to dig deeper. She had been talking to two Male friends of hers online over the weekend, which I can't shake the feeling that she was manipulated in a vulnerable moment, and she is now currently dating one of them. I could tell she wanted to split up, she wanted to go to therapy but I couldn't afford it, she wanted to try having an open relationship, which I was fine with, but I told her that I saw no interest in anyone else, and would just wait for her to determine what she really wanted. She said she couldn't deal with that because it wasn't fair. We tried to stay friends over the next several weeks, but it was just too hard. I love her to much to see her come around and know she wouldn't stay. We talked about it a hand full of times to try and better understand one another, and we both thought it worked. But, I really just wanted to know why. The only answer I could get from her was one that I had simply guessed and she halfheartedly agreed to, that she didn't love me anymore. She told me I didn't support her enough emotionally, that she needed more than a shoulder to cry on, or someone to tell her she wasn't the person her depression made her feel she was. I told her that I didn't want her to leave, but there was nothing I could do to keep her from going. That's her choice, and If she wanted to go, that would be up to her. Not to be anymore sentimental or whatever, but I believe in the whole ""If you love them let them go"". I ""listened to my heart hoping that maybe some day I'd have another chance. She may have been right saying that we were so young and everything was going so fast, but it seemed like we were right where we wanted up until now. Now that she's dating someone new she seems so happy, and I love it. I'm glad to see her thriving and loving herself again, but. I want to die. What was I missing that couldn't give her this kind of happiness, was it just a seasonal depression? I always tried to support her to do things she loved, or to continue her education, or god forbid get her drivers license. I'm having a really difficult time with this even 7 months after its ended. What do I do with myself other than waste away like my body tells me?",23Mar2020,1

780,"Alright, so a while back I discovered that I have a secret admirer, and I admit that I spend a lot of time thinking about who it could possibly be. I constantly wonder about what they will be like if I ever get to meet them, and just thinking about them makes me feel happy. I find myself thinking about them often, and due to this, no other person seems as appealing to me as this mystery person. Yes, this sounds ridiculous, that's why I'm looking for advice. I know a few people who would be great for a relationship and possess many admirable traits, but I always have this irrational inside feeling that there may be someone even better out there. I feel like if I get in a relationship, I still might not stop thinking about this secret admirer, and I know that would be unfair for the person I am with. I want to be in a relationship, I want someone who I can love.

787,"Asking this for a friend because one of the people in question is big into Reddit:

Friend is in college and has been given a group to work with in a class for the whole semester.  They have 4 projects to do (now 3).  Friend never met any of the people in this group before this class (same applies to them).

The first project they did together, Friend constantly reached out to them asking to get started and already started working on it.  They didn't bother agreeing to meet up as a group till the day before the project was due and as a result, the project was very last minute.  They barely managed to get a decent grade (think B).

Second project got cancelled due to the virus and the college shutting down.

Now we are at the third project.  The third project requires a lot of work and a presentation (to be done via an online conferencing).  Project is due in a week and the group has had 3 weeks to work on it and they have done nothing.  Friend has managed to do about **75%** of the work.  The remaining amounts Friend is unable to do without consulting the group and getting their help.  Group mates have done nothing.

Friend doesn't want to go to the professor because the last time they did (different class with different group of procrastinators) it resulted in the professor talking to the whole group which made the procrastinators hostile to Friend for the rest of the semester (and still procrastinated) and caused Friend's anxiety to go up to the point they would stress vomit.  Friend doesn't want to repeat this for projects 3 and 4 in this class.

I say Friend should drop the rope and not do anymore work, but this makes Friend anxious (has bad anxiety about school, grades, and deadlines).  On the other hand, at the rate Friend is going, they'll finish the project on their own which will be done on time and probably get a good grade, but Friend hates the feeling of being used and the idea that these group mates are getting a good grade for doing nothing.

So (with Friend's permission), I posted this here and wanted to see what Reddit thinks Friend should do.

Also, do not suggest therapy for Friend.  They quit last time due to the last therapist being very religious and trying to convert them.  They are not interested in going to therapy again for a good while.",23Mar2020,1
788,"Well, last week I finally talked about issues in our friendship. She has been for years talking about herself and her ex boyfriend, not giving attention to me even though I was the one who listened to her talking about herself for two hours, she would ignore me when I wanted to talk about my feeling or would delay to give me responses. Last but not least, she said to me give a chance to a boy who is our friend (she had a thing with him a couple years ago) and I did. Realized that I was not into him and we had a terrible break up. I didn’t want to see him. She talked with him and said that he bought a raffle ticket and that I needed to get the money from him cause we study on the same school. I said that I would not get and saw him and didn’t get. I talked with her and she said that I needed to pay for his part and then I started the fight - I’m really patient generally. 

Now, after the fight she apologized and said that she will be better and recognizer her errors and said to me to give her a second chance.

(Even though I am extremely damaged by her neglect and the abuse my stepfather put me through, I still wanted to reach out to make sure she was healthy right now).

Well, I called her yesterday and asked if we could talk about the abuse once more. Without hesitation she said “Do not call me again, I don’t want to have a relationship with a son who can’t let go”. She said I was lying to make her look bad and then hung up the phone. 

I just sat on my bed crying for a little. She lives 2 hours away from me and doesn’t want a relationship with me because she is delusional about the abuse that happened to me as a kid.

I had been over at their house during this time. Today the New York Times released that a loss of senses is now a symptom of covid-19! Throughout all of this doctors have informed the public that if you are experiencing any signs of sickness that you should self quarantine and let others know that you have been in contact with. With this in mind I’m extremely frustrated because his mom knew that she was feeling under the weather despite knowing that it was a covid-19 symptom and she continued to be around other people freely WITHOUT letting anyone know until today!!! What makes things worse is that when my boyfriend first asked her if she might have been feeling under the weather she stated no, her husband told my boyfriend that she has a cold during the last week.

I am a locum doctor in the UK and work part time picking up shifts as and when I want. I am on a career break before starting speciality training next year. Since the epidemic became more and more serious I have become more and more anxious about catching Covid-19 given the numerous stroies about doctors being admitted to ICU and dying from the disease.

I'm very privileged to have enough savings to live through the next 6-12 months so I am one of the few people who can take a step back and self-isolate for the entirety of the crisis. I have recieved a lot of criticism from a few family members but my partner has been encouraging me to self-isolate even though we are both young with no known health problems.

I'm concerned about a lack of proper PPE in NHS hospitals and how high viral loads have been giving severe disease to frontline healthcare workers. I really enjoy my job but if I'm honest I never thought I'd be exposed to life-threatening risk in the line of duty.

Please help me process this. I feel really guilty.",23Mar2020,1
806,"Long story short, my ex and I were broken up for roughly a year and during that year, we would still hookup here and there. I would ask him if he was hooking up with anyone else, he would tell me no. He would still treat me like I was special and I kinda fell for it but oh well. What happened, happened. Months later he told me that I wasn’t the only person he was hooking up with and he told me one of the people he slept with was a close friend of his. 

For some reason not only did I feel betrayed by him, but by her too. She wasn’t my friend, but I trusted her so much and I trusted that their relationship was just strictly a friendship and that it would never cross that boundary. When I was told that, I immediately thought did they have feelings for each other all along?? My ex told me that sex is just sex and they did it because they were “bored” but my view of sex is completely different and maybe that’s why I view this situation so much more worse than what it is. He told me that she wanted to take it further and have an intimate relationship but he wasn’t interested in that. 

So not only was I angry at my ex, but I was angry at his friend. I felt as though she just watched from a distance and waited for my relationship to crumble so that she could get this opportunity (this may not be true but this was just my perspective after learning about this). 

It’s really triggering when I think about it. It’s actually been roughly 1.5 years since it happened and it still fucks with me. I don’t want to think about what happened between them two, but the thought pops up into my mind randomly and I get so upset. Ever since then, I’ve had trust issues and issues with self worth. I understand he was single, but he was still dealing with me and I was left feeling betrayed. I can’t seem to let go of the past even though I really want to just forget about it and never think about it again. Any advice?",23Mar2020,1
807,"I am a 23 year old female, my boyfriend is a 26 year old male. We have been together since May 2019. We met at his work in April, I was a customer. We hit it off right away and begin dating in May. We were very close and spent everyday together, the relationship honestly couldn't be more perfect. I was swept off my feet, and given so much love and affection.  Everything was perfect. Come October, his work location closed and he chose to relocate to a different state and keep the same job title as a salary manager which he recently got promoted too, instead of staying in the same state at a different location and going down a job title back to hourly. He left in November to be five hours away in a different state. I felt abandoned. I had done LDR before and was hurt, I was scared of being hurt again. Even before the big move for him, we did argue, even before he left. We started arguing as soon as he told me that he was leaving to a different state for work, but that he still said he wanted to be with me and wanted a lifetime with me. Now, I've done LDR before and didn't want to do it again, but was willing for him. I told him everything about my past relationships, heartbreaks, and that cheating was my #1 dealbreaker and the 1 thing I fear most in a relationship, especially long distance. So from November until now, things have been okay, we do argue. Before he left we never argued. We mainly argue about the distance, how stressful it is, about correlating schedules and days off. We do see eachother about every 1-2 weeks because I am a nurse and work 3 12 hour shifts, so I have more off time versus his 5 10 hour shifts per week, so I frequently drive there to see him. I have neglected all of my family and friends for this man. I prioritize him and the relationship. But, deep down I've had a feeling something was off about him- for example he was secretive about his phone. Had no pictures of us on facebook (But when I asked to be in a relationship on facebook he happily agreed), his notifications on his phone would not say WHO was messaging him. Yesterday I woke up with a bad gut feeling, I snooped through his phone for the first time. I found multiple girls he was sexting, with their nudes saved on snapchat. Naked videos, pictures, you name it. I saw it all. I didn't see his responses though because they weren't saved but I saw some. I saw him messaging former flames about them coming over to his apartment, I saw him messaging former flames that he missed them, and he thought about them first thing when he woke up. I saw him messaging women asking them to come over. I felt sick. I went to his internet history. Porn. Every single day. Atleast 20+ different websites and videos he went on. I understand men have needs, but this is excessive. Every.Single.Day. so many videos. I saw videos of personalized web cam websites. I was sick. I saw google searches about ""how to meet hot cougars"". I instantly woke him up, and told him I am leaving him. I began to pack my stuff and throw it all into my suitcase, him begging and pleading for me to stay. Him crying about how sorry he was. I don't understand how he could do this to me, while looking at me, kissing me, hugging me and telling me he loved me.  It was all lies. I left. He admitted to me this started when he had to move for work, and our relationship was under a ton of stress, and we did argue frequently. But, I was always faithful. I saw this guy as someone I wanted to marry. I saw him as a future husband. I've been in shitty relationships before and I've been hurt but never been hurt this bad.  I wish he would have broken up with me long ago instead of emotionally cheating and sexting many women for MONTHS. He told me because of the stress and arguments, it made him not feel good. So he would reach out to these women because it made him feel good. He admitted getting off to their pictures and videos, which he has saved by the way. He admitted when I would come to visit him, he would be sexting them so I wouldn't see. While I was with him. He's saying he is willing to do anything to make this work, including moving back home to our home state, quitting his current salary job and going back to a lesser job making less money. He is saying he will go to therapy, and seek help because he knows he has a problem. His rationale for doing this is because of our relationship stress with LDR and he says he didn't think I could do an LDR and that I would leave him. He says it was ""all just talk"" and he didn't mean to act on any of his sexts with girls, inviting them over, saying dirty things to them, etc. He claims it was never physical. 


Reddit, please help. I am just asking if you think this guy is full of shit, or I should give him a chance? I love him so much and I want to be with him. But what he did sickens me. Even if we argued, even with long distance, with all the stress, he was the only one for me and I loved him deeply. I thought he was perfect. Yes I did think his phone and facebook behaviors were odd, but I let it go. I did question him about other girls due to my relationship anxiety and he did lie and told me I was crazy for even asking, and that I Have to learn to trust him, because of course hes faithful to me. That was all lies. Please help.

EDIT- I forgot to mention I did break up with him when I packed my stuff and left his apartment. But I don't know if I should get back with him, or give him a chance with moving back to our home state, or therapy. Thank you",23Mar2020,1
808,"So basically I have a new team lead appointed at my job and she tries to give me life pro tips, tries to educate me, give advice that has not been asked for and tries to be a mentor that I don't need. She also tries to 'teach' me how to communicate with my clients that I have successfully worked with ever since I started working here. 

She herself believes that she has a great grasp of psychology (she has no education in this and that is not needed in her job position) and is trying to prove it in every conversation we are having. 

I feel like with this type of communication she is denying my experience, my work ethics and my intentions, this feels belittling and I am frustrated since day 1 of her taking the position as team lead.  
I have once asked her to not do that, because it frustrates me and makes me feel as if shes not taking into consideration that I am a grown person with appropriate work experience and somewhat complicated life behind me and I don't need her to act like she knows it all.

I know I have to set boundaries but she is all the time analyzing and commenting her views on what my reaction, communication and boundaries should be.

My friend who owns the account mentioned that he has a girlfriend, and he said it’s another account no one will know. Then my friend just encouraged him and told him to “get that pussy” 🗿. I don’t know if he ever did, but it just disgusted me. I don’t have a right to confront them about it, but I’m wondering if I should let the girl know for her own sake in case she’s still keeping up these conversations. But she doesn’t know me, and I’m selfishly scared of her confronting them directly and then no longer talking to me. Even though I just saw what happened.",23Mar2020,1

You no longer have the time for a new puppy or kitten, dog or cat? What happens then? You return the pet to the shelter? Re-home or abandon this pet?

815,"Context: I live with 4 people, my dad, my mom, and my 2 sisters (11 years old), I’m 13, and my sisters like doing stuff with me, we like playing games, playing with our dog, and doing other stuff.


The one thing we like the most is making 30-40 minute movies, and posting them on YouTube, but the thing is, our mom makes us wear sunglasses whenever we show our face, currently we’re making a movie about COVID-19, and for 75% of the movie we wear masks, but our mom still makes us wear sunglasses, and when I ask her why, she says “OP! Why the F*ck are you so dumb?! Don’t you know people can find you based on shit like your face?!”. 


Which I think is stupid, because: 
1. How the hell would anybody figure out your address, based on facial details. 
2. Why the hell would you assume people see our face and think “Ah yes, these would be the perfect people to kidnap, now let me get out my top of the line facial recognition software so I can go and hold them for ransom.”. 
3.I took martial arts for 5 years, so let’s pretend someone does something to get our address and tries kidnapping us, I could hand their ass to them in 10 seconds flat.


She has made me do this for going on 1.5 years now (I started showing my face 1.5 years ago), and in my opinion it’s stupid, if we wear sunglasses and masks for half the movie, we might as well wear a damn cardboard box with an air hole on the top, with a smiley face drawn on it. So it’s stupid, doesn’t do anything to protect me, and ruins my favorite thing to do. Please help me convince my mom to let me show my actual face.",23Mar2020,1

817,"My girlfriend and I are separate at the moment due to quarantine. I’m in Nevada, she’s in California. We’ve been apart for almost a month now, but we’ve been calling and texting a lot. Her parents are ok with us calling, but not video calling for whatever reason. 
For both her and I, school has been an escape from home for both of us, and due to her grades, is basically the only place we can see each other. Thanks to her grades, we haven’t been able to go out since February, which was in Valentine’s Day. 

Currently, our school has us SWAMPED with ISP (independent study packets) due to the fact that they need the attendance, because our school is a charter. My gf has been falling a little bit behind on her ISP, as have I, and she especially was today.

Today, I learned about how the governor of CA is threatening to close down all schools for the school year, and over the phone about an hour ago, I told her about it (since she kinda lives under a rock). I told her about the possibility, and that that would most likely mean that the spring show (for our drama club, which we are both very passionate about, even though we are both not very important characters), would likely be shut down. She went silent for a good minute, her breathing become erratic. I made sure to tell her that I’d be able to visit her a lot over the summer. Still silence. I ask if she’s ok, silence. She then says in a cold tone that she needs to call me back.

About 10 minutes pass, and I had been worried, as I know my girlfriend and was worried she was crying. She calls me back, I ask if she’s ok, and she responds with “I’m FINE,” in a bitter tone. 

I asked her why she had to call me back, and in an angry tone talked about how she’s behind in ISP. I ask her if that’s all, and she says she doesn’t want to burden me with her problems. This is a common problem between us, is that we both care about each other so much, that we don’t talk about our problems to each other, as that the other already has enough problems on their plate.

I’m usually the better one at talking to her, and I usually have to push her to talk to me. I ask her again if she can just talk to me about it and she refuses. I push a little more, and she says she has to work on her ISP, and has to go. Frustrated I say, “OK. Fine. Bye.” And hang up.

I have anxiety issues, and my anxiety is burning at me that something is up. I’m worried I might’ve gone too far, and I’m worried I said something wrong. Can someone help me out here? I’m probably in the wrong, and I want to know that it’s not just my anxiety telling me that.",23Mar2020,1

823,"So I’m 14, and I know that’s young to some of you, but also that’s the only reason I’m here instead of at a therapist. I’ve tried to talk to my parents about it, but my mom always says “oh you’re so much like your father,” and my dad always tells me to talk to my mom.

Anyway, there’s a problem in my life, namely being that I feel like I’m always being watched. I never let my guard down completely even when I’m alone. I’m 14, so this should be the horniest time in my life or whatever, but I can’t shake the thought that someone’s watching me or knows what I’m doing. That is to say I haven’t even watched porn once for the fear someone will yell at me.

There’s things I’d like to do, but I just can’t. The other day I was thinking of watching some YouTube, but didn’t want to just because some invisible entity might judge me for it.

Even typing this is making my hands sweat profusely and my face is now really red, despite the fact I’m alone in my room, not doing anything bad, and everyone else in my family is upstairs while I’m downstairs. I just cannot bear to go and do anything.

In my heart I know there’s nothing going on. I don’t feel watched the way one does when someone is staring at you from across the room, but I just have this terrible itch in my head telling me to be cautious, people are watching. Watch your step, watch your smile, don’t cry alone in your room, even if no one can judge you.

I can’t watch shows anymore, because after watching Deathnote I kinda got the part where L watches the other guy in his house stuck in my mind, as though anyone would be interested in watching me.

The original thought I had was that I must be guilty. But then I realized that was stupid. The last thing I did that I would feel guilty about was when I made fun of my sister when I was like 8. Not something to give you psychological damage I think.

I also think it might be more like something that happened in my childhood. Growing up in my “good” christian family, I saw a lot of people telling me God saw everything I did. Every sin I committed, every lie I told. That didn’t make me less likely to sin, rather more likely to pretend like everything is normal when I’ve done something bad.

On top of that, my family is a musical one, and from a young age I’ve been expected to naturally perform in front of large crowds. I can do fine in front of a crowd, but with this problem, there’s no down time, which can turn into a bigger problem.

And finally, to add insult to injury, I’m doing sports. This might be seen as a good thing, and I enjoy playing all the sports my parents force me to play. Until it’s game time. In my school we do football/volleyball, basketball, and then track, and for the first two seasons I can handle everything, because I have a good team, no one’s watching me (I’ll be the first to admit I’m not the best at sports,) and if I mess up, people just mention the ways other people did good. But not track. Oh no, with track it’s like I’m in this two-hour long production where I’m the only performer. I can do fine, and no one will rub my mistakes in my face, but in the end, track leaves an empty, hollow feeling inside that eats me up and makes me cry for what may be the first time in months.

Again, talking to my parents about this, they just brush it off as nerves, or me being lazy, but I really just can’t stand track and the constant strain and turmoil it causes. But even track isn’t the worst part about it. I could go on about that, but not today.

My dad calls me names whenever I ask, no plead to not do track, and my mom just says that my siblings would be angry if they had to and I didn’t. When I tell them how it makes me feel, they just tell me I’m weak and lazy. Or at least that’s how I interpret it.

I read somewhere that this may be due to people watching you too much when you were young, which may be just some internet thing, or maybe it’s real. They said it can be a cause for trauma, which can be serious and affect someone their whole life, but I live in a 572 person town in the midwest, so I can’t exactly go see a therapist about all this. 

This sounds super angsty, I know, but I really would take any advice on how to make myself feel less watched all the time. I wanna be able to hum a tune without worrying about someone judging my song choice. I wanna watch the YouTubers I like without worrying about someone wondering why I’m doing it. I really just wanna be myself without worrying.

TL;DR

Does anyone have any advice about how I (M14) could stop feeling like I’m being watched all the time, or does anyone have any idea why that is. I can’t see a therapist at the time being, so really anything to help me survive the next four or so years of my life.

Thanks.",23Mar2020,1
824,"I never got over the Nietzsche shit. I am gravitating towards authoritarianism. My life is good but nothing happens. I consume meaningless television and porn and see no future. There is nothing I want. There are no major challenges to face. My apathy has slowly increased for years. I loathe myself for being weak and I lack a conception of evil, forcing me to continue to be stricken with suffering at the absurdity of life. The obvious fact of my incomprehensibly good fortune makes little impact on my alienation and hopelessness.


My ambition is quite low. I am not integrated with my family nor my community and feel but a sickly sense of nationalism. I don’t have any plans for marriage or children or a career, although I am honestly good with women and could definitely achieve the first two. 


The world is immoral and all actions in my life essentially fall into two categories: learning impotently about this fact or hiding desperately from it. I feel ready for a revolution. All I need is a charismatic leader, a Tyler Durden, and I’d be out there setting fires. It could be inequality, it could be the climate, it could be a bunch of things.

I accidentally got my girlfriend pregnant and she had a miscarry so I thought we were all done with it. Today (after my attempt to break up with her two days ago) she texted me telling me that the miscarriage was only one expected baby of the twins that were in her but planned parenthood only gave her enough for one baby. She insists on keeping the baby as she believes that she can't go through the emotional pain of losing another baby. However neither one of us is physically, emotionally, or monetarily ready for a child and I don't know what to tell her to get that through to her, as if we keep this child even after trying to break up the life of the child will not be a good one as it will either grow up barely knowing it's father, or it will grow up with mom and dad in the next room fighting every night and that is not what I want for my child and I don't believe it is healthy. Also however, if she carries it all the way to completion then she will guaranteed get attached enough to not want to put the baby up for adoption and I'm at the point where I don't know what to do.

The point of this novel isn’t to sell, or to make me a famous author. The point of this is solely so that I can have something creative with my name on it. While I  would try to sell the final product, the novel is more of a hobby than a career. I have a lot of questions and I’m only about 30% through the story, but the main issue is: 

I can’t draw. Like, at all..

849,"BF's birthday is coming up soonish and I wanted to do something meaningful for him. In the past I've gotten him gifts and so on but this year I want to do something a little more personal for him.

His dad passed away back in 2009 while BF was deployed in a work accident. I didn't know my BF back then but by his mother and sister, I was told he hasn't really spoken about his dad since his funeral. Even to this day, he hardly speaks about him. I also have never seen him cry.

The few things *I did* hear about his dad were directly from BF--like the time they ate out at said place, saw that movie, or that time BF got said present for Xmas as a kid from his dad, ect. Of course those stories are few, far, and in between over the span of 3 years. Him and his dad were close so I think not really talking about him that often is his way of dealing with it? I don't know. Both of my parents are gone and I still cry years later and think of them often. Maybe I'm a just a baby? 

Anyway, my BF has a nice picture of his dad but it doesn't have a frame at all. When I was cleaning out our bedroom closet I found it and decided to slip it into a hardcover book to ""protect"" it until I can figure out what to do with it. I don't know if it was in there because BF purposely put it there for reasons of not wanting to be sad or grieve or because he had no where else ""safe"" and forgot about it. 

I want to take my time finding a nice frame for it but at the same time I don't know if I should. BF and I have been together for 3 years now so I would like to think he would be comfortable with subject of his dad with me to some extent but if he isnt, I completely understand. 

Tl;dr Found a picture of BF's deceased dad in a closet whom he was really close to. BF's bday is soonish and want to frame it for him as a gesture of respect for his dad and a meaningful gift for BF. Not sure If its morally ok or just weird.

Also, would it be really tacky?",23Mar2020,1

So when we were going to Write the skiss Down we got a paper each and i felt like Albert Einstein, My whole paper was filled with Big brain stuff like math and all that shit, I felt like the smartest person alive, so, ok the other guys were only talking when I was playing smart so I was the only one with a full paper, so we decided to go with that paper (we were going to turn one in) so long story short, turns out I counted wrong on like 1000 dollars. And now the whole group thinks I know how we are going to do the bridge, but i do not know a shit Cause i suck at math and stuff like that. So basicly theyre counting on me to do the whole project.

852,"Someone involved in this browses Reddit, but I can’t exactly talk to my family about this, so here goes possibly being discovered.
I made a friend earlier this month (March). We have a lot in common and have hung out twice. Overall, I really like her and we made a genuine connection.
A few days ago, I met a guy on here for no strings attached purposes. Once we met up and talked for a bit, and things were getting heavy, he was struggling to perform. He finally gave up after about 30 seconds and we did foreplay stuff. So we didn’t have full on sex, but we mostly talked about things we liked for a few hours before I left. He wanted to continue a FWB thing, and I didn’t want to embarrass him by saying no, so I said yes in hopes I wouldn’t hear from him again. 
Flash forward two days, and he messages me, asking how I knew the friend I mentioned at the beginning. I told him how I met her, also online, and how I thought she was cool. He then tells me that’s his ex girlfriend, and they were together for 5 years before breaking up before I met her. My friend texts me not long after wanting to talk, and I told her I already knew what was going on. They were in talks of getting back together, which is fine, I’m not interested in him like that, and am already emotionally attached to someone else. But this news is weighing heavy on my mind. I showed my screenshots of him telling me the news, and how much I was freaking out. I apologized, and of course giving her space. But I just... this coincidence is so shocking and insane.
I’ve cried a lot over this situation, and it’s all I can think about. I’d like to continue being friends with her, but I don’t know if I can ever be around her again knowing what happened. No one’s at fault in my opinion; he didn’t know she was my friend, and he was some anonymous guy I met online. It’s just the fact that I’ve done sexual things with my friend’s ex, no matter how accidental it was. She seems to believe that I’m being open and honest with her, and I am. I’ve offered screenshots if she feels the need to read through my conversation with the guy. No exes were brought up, we never mentioned friends by name, nothing. 
So my question is: Do I fight for my friendship with her, or is this too big of a mistake to be able to mend?",23Mar2020,1

857,"I'm a retail worker who worked in a busy supermarket during the opening week of the Coronavirus pandemic.  


I ended up falling ill over a week ago, with the usual symptoms; sore throat, cough, fatigue, so I called out of work, letting my boss know that I might have corona and would let them know when I saw a doctor. When I tried to call my local hospital to schedule an appointment, they told me that I should stay home until symptoms subside, and to come in after for a checkup where they could give me the all clear. Eventually my symptoms developed into fever, and my boss removed me from the work schedule for the next 2 weeks.  


Myself (and by extension, my 2 roommates, a couple) have been home quarantining ourselves; I've been locked in my bedroom in order to avoid infecting my housemates, and my roommates deliver me food from the fridge. I've already paid my monthly bills so that isn't a concern either. I supplemented our food stocks with ordering delivery a couple of days as my way of apologizing to them (via contact-less delivery Grubhub). However, all three of us are missing work due to my illness and it looks as if we'll be entering Week 2 of this home quarantine which might hit us very hard on next month's bills, and while the three of us mostly get along I can tell it is straining on my two roommates to be locked inside because of me.  


My job called me a couple of days ago letting me know that due to my extensive absence I will need a doctors note in order to return to work. The problem is, every hospital I've called in my area is not offering Corona Virus testing, and there is no way to know otherwise if I am still infectious or even HAD the Corona virus, or if I""m clean now if I cannot get tested. I do not have insurance or a primary care physician. There is an Urgent Care close by, however they do not offer tests, and when I called them they told me that they can't offer me a note about Quarantine because they do not offer testing.  


My illness lasted the last 8 days, and it has now been 24 hours since I've felt properly ill. I have about 4 days left until I will be placed on next week's schedule and I do not know what do to in order to get seen by a doctor and get a proper note. I'm worried I will lose my job.",23Mar2020,1

861,"before i was born my parents got really close to another mexican couple who lives on our block. it resulted in me considering them like family and their children like cousins even if we aren’t related. we’ll call the children s and c. on the same block lives another couple who are actually related to my parents’ friends and their son is my cousins’ actual cousin. we’ll call him n.  i’m writing this post because of n, there is nothing wrong with s and c as we’re still in each other’s lives.

we all grew up together, we were always hanging out together, we were always at one another’s houses, we were all considering ourselves like cousins and they were making no difference with me who wasn’t blood related to them. as time passed we became more able to be together like we became teens and our parents were letting us hang around the block at night during summer or keeping in touch on facebook/ through texts. the peak of our “squad” was summer 2011 when we were always together at one of our houses and when we weren’t i was talking with n on facebook we’d live comment shows together or texting each other when one of us wasn’t home.

things were still going well after summer ended, me and n would text each other during classes and keep each other entertained and we’ll get together with the squad on the weekends. around november n was being weird, he would barely answer me and he would barely meet up with us, if not at all. he started hanging out with guys who do drugs. around christmas break he stopped talking to me and i found out he unfriended me on fb. when i mentioned it to s and c they were like don’t sweat it he unfriended all the fam members even us. i knew damn well he was turning out like his new friends but i was still willing to keep him in my life. he decided otherwise.

the fact that he was walking past me in the streets as if i was a stranger hurt me. however i was telling myself it might be a him problem since he also cut s and c out. spoiler alert: he didn’t. he wasn’t hanging out with them like before but when he saw them he would talk to them. i never dared to ask him or them what was wrong with me. sometimes he would talk to me and joke like before but that was because i happened to be with s and/or c. he was doing this in the first years but around 2014 he stopped faking it and started treating me like a complete stranger.

i got used to it, that’s what i thought. today i went out to take out the trash and i bumped into c with n. c and i greeted each other and threw around some jokes but n didn’t even look at me. he was really like when you wait your friend to finish their convo with someone you don’t know. it all came back to me, the way they’re hanging out together like nothing changed but i don’t even get a glance like i’m nothing",23Mar2020,1

Starting when I was nine years old, I would cry about my size and my mom would scold me for ""having a pity party"" and ""trying to make her sad"". They both never thought for a minute that I was genuinely sad, they just assumed I was trying to get something from them. This is likely the root of my trust issues. They began to just brush off my ""attempts for attention"" when I was twelve. They did the same with my anxiety. They let me go to therapy, but whenever I had a panic attack, they'd comfort me for about ten seconds and then tell me to stop milking it. They actually thought I was trying to gain sympathy when I freaked out. Did anyone here's parents do this? I'm concerned.",23Mar2020,1

867,"This school year has been completely awful for me. I go to a religious private school. But, the people at the school act like anything but what the religion is about. In fact, they are acting racist. Seen as I am in high school in my private school, there are only around 90-100 students. So you can see that I don't have much company. Let me give you a few examples of racism in my school.

One example is one kid calling the 2 somalian boys in my class ""Somalian pirates"" because they are from Somalia. The kid who said that is white as well. You would think they hate him now, right? Well, half yes and half no. One of the somalian kids is one of my best friends and he hated him after he said that. But, the other somalian kid acted like it didn't even happen and was meat riding him all of a sudden. Another example of racism in my school is when a black kid said I looked like humpty dumpty because I was white! The crazy thing is no one said anything about it.

Now, let me tell you about the stupid trends people follow in my school. Around this year in January, the juniors started using the phrase ""God forgive you"" very often when someone did even the smallest thing wrong. All of a sudden, everyone started using it. Well, almost all the boys at least. Even the kid who made that racist joke was using it and it was so annoying.

The worst thing that happened to me this year, was a few days ago. So, we have elearning now seen as our school closed for the coronavirus. Me and 5 other boys in my class (we have 7 boys) got in a discord call. The owner of the discord call was, unfortunately, the kid who made that racist statement. He made himself the owner, one of his meat riding friends owner, and his other meat riding friend owner. The one he said the racist statement to. I just let it happen and the discord was going normal at 1st. But, this is where all the bad things happened. The racist kid started making my discord name a name that he and the juniors called me in real life that I have told them countless times to stop. I kept changing it, but his followers kept changing it to the name I didn't like. My friend told them to stop, and they wouldn't stop. So, me and him just left the discord and were frustrated. A couple days later, one of my other friends left the discord because the racist kid and his followers were acting like jerks to him. He told us that they wouldn't stop annoying him.

Finally, there was this kid who wanted to fight me even though I did nothing wrong. They were trying to bully me and make fun of me in front of others. When I stood up for myself, for some reason, he all of a sudden wanted to fight me. It was completely ridiculous. There are barely any people who I truly like at my school.

The collage which handles our course allowed the staff of this place to have students in to carry on working as normal as from what Ive heard the place I go to requested it or something I don’t really know.

877,"(Before I begin, I like to apoloise for my bad English).So my parents always beg for openess especially on issues and concerns,  but when I try to open up, its no use because its dismissed  everytime. One year ago, I had depressive symptoms and it was very evident. I usually excerise and i was always happy but i have been sleeping alot more, I always think more negatively, I am always tired and my muscles would randomly ache. When I told my parents about this, they told me that i do not have depression and you are fine. A few days later, I tried to tell them again and they said ""in the name of Jesus, you do not have depression."" At that point, I told myself to never open up again. It was no point doing so anyway. (Also, when they tell me to open up, I figured they just meant to talk more, because everything else would be dismissed. This is the same mother that would rather profit off hand sanitizers because money; I asked her whether its good to do so or if its morally wrong to profit off of peoples desperation.) Everytime the relationship gets stronger, my parents always does something that throws all that development out of the window. Sometimes, yes, its my fault, but they always exaggerate everything. For example, very recently, I usually had a bible study. I always have one every sunday and I forgot to tell my parents because of the whole coronavirus. I should have told them but they just meantioned on how ik always so secretive, that I hate my parents for not opening up and that they will tell my teachers everything. I remember getting heavily insulted because I threw away dirty water that my mom wanted to use, being called a satan in her life and being called autistic because I didnt understand why I would throw away dirty water. I also, remember getting beaten when I was younger because I dropped a pencil. I wish I was exaggerating but this is all very real experiences from me. I do not know what to do. I can recall most examples, like being insulted for throwing away expired milk or bread because they would happily consume it, or this issue that happened yesterday: after using contents from the fridge, I guess i didnt close it properly. When I look at the freezer, it seemed closed but it wasnt sealed closed. The width was extremely small. The top part of the inside of the fridge was also hard to completely close so thats why the freezer is hard to close completely. And my mom just insulted me for the rest of the day.

884,"The title pretty much explains it... My girlfriend and I had sex for the first time (we were both virgins) and her period is now almost a week late. 

We did everything right... We practiced safe sex (used a condom) and beforehand we sat down and made sure this was what we both wanted. She is not on birth control.

She is now very freaked out and hesitant to approach her family about this issue because in the case of her being pregnant, her family is VERY pro-life. She is really scared about her family and what they will think of her following this, and I’m pretty nervous too. Neither of us know what to do. Any help/ideas would be welcome.

885,"I am almost tempted to say I have imposter syndrome, but I don't want to, because I think that you have to have a certain amount of success/reputation to feel like an imposter, right? I've accomplished nothing. 

I always feel like I'm a failure of an artist, and don't really deserve to call myself an artist. Especially because I'm 20, and my drawings still look like a kid drew them. But actual kids draw way better than me. I always see beautiful art on Instagram and Tumblr, and when I go to their profile, the artist is like 13 or some shit!! How can they already have such good art, and so many followers!? I feel like there's no hope for me, since I'm older, I draw everyday, and I'm still not at that level. But then I feel guilty for being jealous of them. 
I don't think my drawings are improving at all. I look at my drawings from when I first started, and they don't look that much different from now. 
I feel so insecure and upset about my drawings that I have genuinely wanted to quit art at some points, but I can't. I think I should stop and just focus on something that would actually make me money, but I can't. I can't focus on anything else. I don't like doing anything else. I have tried to get a different hobby, but I end up hating anything else. 
I think I might have autism and drawing is my ""special interest""? But I'm not diagnosed so idk. 
I feel stupid for even getting so upset about it, because it's just drawing. Idk why I care so much. I know people will say ""art is subjective!!"" And yeah, kinda. But some people have more artistic skills than others. 

Part of me kinda wonders if I have something wrong with me. Like, I can't understand how someone could practice something so much and not improve. 
I wonder if I have trouble recognizing faces, as weird as that sounds. I mostly draw people, and I wonder if maybe the faces are what makes my art so unbearable. 
I have noticed that I don't remember people's faces very well, and I can't look people in the eyes when I talk to them. I hate eye contact. I have known more than one person who has a twin, and I can never tell twins apart, even though everyone else said they could tell them apart easily. 
Sometimes I see pictures of celebrities and I can't tell who it is, because a lot of them look similar to me. 

Idk why I typed so much, I can never be concise for some reason, smh. Anyways, the point is that my opinion of myself is ruining my drawings and I am hurting my own feelings. Any advice on how to stop mentally fucking myself over? Sorry if this is more suited towards a different sub, idk where to talk about this. :(",23Mar2020,1
886,"I'm an Indian woman who came to France to do a Masters. I ended up getting an internship here (which is GREAT) but I'm sad and frightened at the same time.

Since then mystery bills keep showing up to their house in my name from State Farm insurance and other legitimate companies.

I have to admit that I drank too much and I don't remember much from that night. But I clearly remember when it happened then. I had to go to the bathroom and he insisted to accompany me. I didn't refused since I had trouble walking. So he followed me in and after saying that he wanted to kiss me and I just said yes, not really thinking about it, he kissed me. It was short, just a quick peck on the lips. We went back home shortly after that.
I know that he told another friend of mine that we kissed but when this other friend told me I said I didn't know anything about it. When I talked about it with my best friend I lied, telling him that I didn't remember a thing about that night (I don't even know why), and he said that nothing happened, that we didn't kissed or anything.

Hes able to communicate, and reason, but it's obvious hes autistic when you talk to him. She pics him up on friday, and takes him home Saturday morning. Well, a couple times my mom was drunk when she had to drive him home, and asked me if I could drive him home (which I did) another time she was about to drive him home, was getting ready to pull out of the driveway, when I realized she was obviously buzzed. I ended up driving him home. I had a talk with her about it, and I said I shouldnt have to be responsible to do your job, when you're too drunk to do it properly. She seemed genuaregretfull. She said she didnt know what she was thinking. She hasnt done it since (to my knowledge). She said she didnt want to take care of him anymore, so she wanted to know if I wanted to take her job. I dont drink or anything, but I have some autism myself, and I'm just not comfortable for being responsible for someone else. If I dont take the job, then my mom will keep taking him, but I'd feel bad, because shes obviously irresponsible, if she was willing to drive drunk with him.

898,"Okay, so my situation starts off with me of last year living at home late spring to early summer. I had actually just come out of 2 semesters of steadily dwindling work at college, and all but flunked out, at which point I decided I wasn’t ready and I needed some better executive functioning skills and better living habits. So, upon my mom’ suggesting I do Job Corps, which for those of you who don’t know is a government-run job/career furthering program basically for badly behaved young people (16-24), I went forward with serious, bold intent to actually try to get my shit together, and took the trade Office Administration which I finished in 7 months. It was a really good experience for me, I ended up not only getting better at being steadfast in my work ethic and consistently following a balanced lifestyle, I also inadvertently opened my Third Eye from smoking weed oil cartridges and exploring and writing down my thoughts. On February 15, I got a 2 bedroom apartment I’m sharing with a 30-y.o. epileptic stoner (who’s super cool and gives  me bong hits😁) in  town in MA called Gardner. So yay, I had gained some independence for myself with actually now some decent life skills to show for it. The hope was that I was going to attend the local community college and take a few classes to appease my still somehow skeptical mom into believing I can handle stuff on my own without explicit structure, so that she’ll pay for my full-time school for the major I want to take, progressive psychology.
But now unfortunately that plan is kind of spoiled because the schools are being shut down what with virus and the frickin’ hysteria it’s causing all over the world. And a job that I just got at D’Angelos has to be postponed since I gotta go through the training session and they won’t do that yet until at least a few weeks when the Coronavirus starts to fade away.
Everything else that I have going on in my life is either boring, drab, dull or unproductive, and I don’t wanna sit around all day watching TV alone and wasting oxygen. My mind can’t sit still these days when I’m alone so often— which is practically all my time nowadays, which has caused me not to see the benefit in leisure time anymore since I started associating it with passivity and laziness. I’ve been trying to look for other jobs in the meantime, tho it’s not easy as most of my online filled-out applications don’t even get a call back, and I want to be able to accomplish something that can give me some purpose and gratified feeling, now. However, it’s worth mentioning my emotional health, or rather lack thereof, as I basically haven’t had much genuine personal connections over the years, had sparse communities I ever had any feeling for, or had any intimate human contact ever- I’ve just failed to build that along the way, but still take comfort in any social interactions I can take part in.
I want to start upon things anew with something that’ll bring about a big change in the lookout of my life, with of course a big creative writing escapade. I aim to write a big anecdote or short story to eventually publish to kill all the time, but I need the best focus and mental space possible. This brings me to the next question, here. I was wondering where do y’all think I should reside based on all of this— my mom’s house, which has her, her bf, and my shy-introverted brother, or my own apartment? I feel like maybe I was starting to get used to the perpetual isolation at my apartment, and I mean I was fine for a while just staying by myself even though I sometimes cry at night cuz I’m 😭

Among other things it took a while to figure out my gender identity, and now I am a bit more mature and I have understood many important things about myself... The problem is: I want to live the life more typical of a young man by dancing at the club and taking dance lessons, dressing hot, playing ball games at the park or going to the beach, and more importantly dating. However when I see other guys living this life I realise that I will be mocked because even if I look a good deal younger than my age I'll still have to reveal the truth, not to mention the difficulties of being the wrong sex. Even if I gain a good masculine body and take care of my skin and keep my youthful looks I will be still someone with a dirty secret: being a wannabe who is actually older. It is also very important to me to date while having the kind of attractiveness that a young, fresh, androgynous man have, because I want a partner who is attracted to that. And yet my body is going in the wrong direction, and I panic. I am ashamed of enjoying skateboarding, I don't dare to sign up for ballet or hop hop, and after 13 years of being single I fear it will be just too much of a burden on a guy, all this explaining about age and lost time.

My parents are elderly and my recently ill father keeps wanting me to move back in with them. They have the means to have a visiting nurse for their health problems. They have been smart with money and don’t need to worry much about that stuff. I’m not sure what advantage he sees in my returning. I work full time. There is nothing additional that I could do for them while living there. I am not a healthcare professional. 

Part of it is that he’s worried about what will happen to my mother when he is gone. We’ve all reassured him that we will make sure she is taken care of.

My siblings are married and have their own homes and families - one of them lives closer to our parents than I do. I am being “chosen” because I don’t have my own spouse or children, and it feels very unfair. He says that I would have “my own life,” and I know he means it, but in reality - I wouldn’t. I’d be giving up all sense of independence and freedom. I have a very different lifestyle from my parents, and I know myself - I would be the one who’d feel obligated to change, not them. 

It seems deeply unfair that there would be this expectation that I basically give up what will likely be the next 10-15 years of my life. I am the oldest and was by far the last to leave home. I don’t want to go back. I don’t want to move out of the home I’ve created. My life with them was so confining - I didn’t realize just how much so until I finally broke free. 

I also love my parents and don’t want to feel guilty about this choice, make my parents think I find them a “burden,” or have my siblings resent me since I am the “logical” choice.

She started talking to me and started sitting next to me: she sounded welcoming, cheerful, enthusiastic and cool. I slowly started liking her and my feelings were going stronger day after day. Even though we only met 3 times after summer school and i spent her 18th birthday with her ( we hanged up together the whole day where she asked me if i ever tried to pursue a relationship with a girl and her only experience), we slowly became close and started opening up to each other about everything, we even promised each other to talk about any stupid acts that could bother us since we both overthink a lot and fix them while not intending any drama, she even texts only me during her dark days etc.. The thing that marked me is that she sees everything in a bad way, she's very pessimistic, she's extremely afraid of taking any exam and failure which leads her to not study at home and her fear growing bigger and bigger, and she has a very low self esteem.I find her breath-taking: she's mature/grown-up af, she literally discusses everything instead of acting childish and is very honest, a bit moody but it's okay but she doesn't realise how amazing is she.The first time i talked to her about my feelings, she told me not to rush things up, she was not expecting herself to be my crush(since she got a low self-esteem) and i was totally okay with it until last week when we talked again about the same topic and she said yes after confessing to me about how she cheated on her ex and that was not totally her fault to make things clear, about how i never saw her as a sexual objects(since i'm living in a third word country, 99% of the boys will try to pursue a relationship with a girl to satisfy their sexual desires or to feel proud in front of their friends) how i made her feel that she wasn't useless and important and had a role in this life etc.. I've always tried since day one to help her get over her excessive fear of exams and tried to boost her self-confidence by complimenting her more often since i personally went through the same and know how devastating could it be sometimes especially when i see the potential she has and how far she could go if she reached even a small part of it and every time she was like:""OH THAT'S ME ?, IS THAT REALLY ME ? etc.."" We're sitting for a major national exam this year where we have some subjects in common and she barely studies for it which makes the situation even worse but it might get delayed because of the COVID-19 (luckily for her). Everyday, I ask her if she ever needs anything in the subjects we have in common and that i'm always there for her if she needs everything and she keeps telling me that she doesn't wanna bother me and thanks me: she always thinks that she's bothering me and making my life way harder lol and i'm trying my best to prove her wrong day after day. How can i tell help her get over this, boost her self-esteem, prevent her from thinking that she ever bothered me and reach her potential since she could achieve miracles ?

Stay Safe,Thanks in advence.

PS: English is my third language so excuse any grammar/spelling mistake.

Tl;Dr: My girlfriend couldn't stop thinking of failure since we're taking a major national exam which leads her to not study and having a very low self-esteem even though she has a huge potential and i feel like i couldn't help enough especially with her permanently thinking that she bothers me when asking for help.",23Mar2020,1
927,"My mom, age 60, is planning a move from her residence in Florida to my house (in the Midwest). It is a unique situation where she is simultaneously leaving a toxic relationship and coming here to help support my family and watch the kids so I can start work- I am a single parent and work in food production as an upper level employee so my job is considered “life sustaining” and thus is essential. I am getting increasingly nervous about the “shelter in place” guidelines and what it may mean for her interstate travel.

929,"****TRIGGER WARNING****

I never normally do these sort of warnings but this post does contain a lot of bad stuff including:

Child Abuse
Sexual Abuse




To start off, I'm not 100% sure if this post will fall under r/legaladvice or r/advice so if this post feels like it doesn't belong, feel free to report and have it removed, I won't be bitter.

I want to clarify that I don't live with my parents anymore and have been officially estranged from them meaning that any form of application I make to things like government welfare or college finding cannot take their income into account, and that I live in Scotland.

My parents are very abusive and have been for a number of years. When I was 4 years old, my dad sexually assaulted me and ended up in prison and on the sex offenders register for it. Because of this my mum ended up moving back Scotland and took myself and my younger brother with her. As time passed, she became more physically abusive to myself and my brother, along with her newborn daughter, and we all ended up in foster care. 

Years have passed since then and things never really improved with us ending up in care multiple times, the birth of my second younger brother and an abusive stepdad, who is the father of my sister and youngest brother and a whole new breed of asshole stepdad. Social workers have been a very common thing for us but of course stopped when my younger brother and I turned 16. 

Now, I live in my own place and so does my first brother but my second brother and my sister still live with my mum and their dad. I've been in touch with my sister recently and she has basically told me that they are constantly smoking weed, which, yes is kind of trivial, but they regularly spend money for food on weed and end up having to go a day or two without proper meals, physically abusing them and that my dad is the one selling them the weed and hanging around the house, meaning that a convicted paedophile is regularly around them.

My brother and sister have a social worker who is basically trying to do her best to ensure that they are either staying at home with their physically abusive parents or have myself or my first brother adopt them, even though neither of us are in any way financially fit to do so. I'm a college student and I barely have enough money to make the rent and have to go some days without food just to get by, I can deal with this, but my brother and sister who are minors, cannot.

What other sort of alternatives can I look into that I'd have some sort of ability to implement. Since I'm estranged, I know I don't have certain legal rights involving them, but this isn't something I can really sit back and wait out. If I was financially stable, I'd be more than happy to take them both in but as it stands, I'd be taking them out of one bad situation but putting them into another, that isn't as bad, but still is bad. Any sort of advice is greatly appreciated because any sort of searching I do turns up fruitless.",23Mar2020,1
930,"I changed my username on discord to: you stopped caring. And I did this because my friend , it’s about this very friend. And he texted me today “who is your username about?” And my other friend who also happens to be his friend texted me a similar message at the same time asking me the same thing. It’s funny because whenever I’d change my name to “attention whore” or something he would be the first to reply asking me who my username was about. He said “is it about me?” And I said “No.” too afraid to say it was him. I’m sure he knew it was him. He said “even tho it’s not about me it till like to know if it was about me” and he said “I care about you a lot ok. And I just want you to know that”.

932,"I know there have been many textposts about this topic so you're all probably very tired of hearing the same regurgitated story over and over - but hear me out.

So before we get started I just want to tell you a few things about my mother. Although she is a very nice woman sometimes, and she is very funny when she wants to be, I can't stand her. She has a good few mental issues that she is supposed to take medication for (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc) she refuses to take them and so putting up with her can be a real struggle sometimes - and I know that you can't blame somebody for their mental issues but it heavily impacts my relationship with her). I also can't help but feel like more than an acquaintance to her at times, that she treats her younger female friend more like a daughter than I and that she is very abusive and manipulative. She also abused my father heavily during their marriage, as well as myself. Nonetheless, she is my mother, and I wanted to see her for a week or two.

This is where the problem arises. See, if my mother lived closer to my dad then I could simply take public transport to see her for the day, or ride my bike to hers, but she lives in Wales while my dad lives 2 hours away in Birmingham. Because of this I often find myself having to take the train down to see her, and that seeing her is a commitment of a week at the very least. I came down hers to see her before my apprenticeship started (which has now been delayed anyway, yay) and because I needed advice after I had been r\*ped not too long before. However, Boris Johnson just announced live on the TV that we had extreme travel restrictions running across the UK, meaning that I can't go back home on Thursday as I had originally planned. This means I may go months without seeing my father and brother, and I really want to go back home. Is there any way this would be possible? Would it be ok for my mom to drive me down to my dad's and back? Please, someone, tell me what to do, I'm only 16 and I really need advice about this. Any help is very much appreciated - thanks in advance.",23Mar2020,1

934,"Long story short, I met this girl, we had lunch and she friend zoned me and offered to be friends.

935,"Hello--currently in a bit of a dilemma as noted in the title and was hoping to get some extra perspective (using a throwaway account for privacy). 

My current situation is that I have been working very hard at my job for four years, but have also been wanting to leave for some time now (with a very long list of MAJOR reasons that I need to get out; I like the people and want to do right by them but I really cannot stay) so I have spent a lot of time and energy interviewing with a government-adjacent public benefit agency (which has better benefits, management that is more my style, and more potential for growth/a satisfying career path than my current job) over the past six weeks. 

Last Monday 3/16/20  I was sent a conditional offer (pending background check and education verification) and as of last Wednesday 3/18/20, I was verbally offered a position with the agency after everything had cleared. 

My current employment contract that I signed back in the day says that I must give 30 days notice if I intend to leave my position (I hadn't realized how abnormal this was for my position at the time). Since I would really like to part on good terms with my employer of four years (who I may need for a reference in the future...and because I haven't used any vacation days in forever and would like to be paid for those if possible; don't really want to use them since I can't go anywhere/do anything right now) I asked the agency if there was any way I would be able to give the 30 days notice--they agreed (probably at least partially due to the current situation) and we set an anticipated start date of April 27th. I was told that they still plan to draft the contract and get it over to me (though I have not received it yet so I will be following up soon).

My industry is fairly stable even with the COVID-19 pandemic (and thankfully I have been able to work from home, though I can technically be considered essential and required to go in if needed), but due to recent moves by my current company (e.g. having certain workers stay home without pay, mysteriously getting rid of a very important contractor suddenly, and because they suddenly let multiple longtime employees go earlier this year \[though there were complications there\]) I am afraid that if I give notice, I will be told to pack my bags immediately and I won't have enough income to survive for the coming weeks (especially if I have to pay for interim health insurance). 

At the same time: I am the only one at my company with certain types of knowledge/certifications, I know finding a replacement right now will not be easy, and my position requires a lot of training so I feel like that would happen, but you never know. I also really do not want to leave my employer (or coworkers) in a bad position, so I would like to give them enough time to prepare. Another argument for trying to give the 30 days is that I am a very ""by the book"" person and further: it's hurting my soul to think about losing all of those vacation days (which I may lose anyway, but I feel like if I give less notice than my contract requires, there's even less hope of being paid for them). 

Assuming the contract/offer from the agency comes through (I will not even think about giving any kind of notice until I at least have something official in writing) what is the best way to handle this without burning bridges or landing myself in a terrible position given the current state of things? How much notice should I give assuming the offer is still on the table? 

I was finally ready to improve my current professional situation but now Coronavirus has been changing the landscape of life in dramatic ways more and more each day. I'm completely confused and panicking (I normally have anxiety about this stuff but now it's next level and even the ""real adults"" in my life have not had clear answers about what to do in my current situation). 

All of this said, I know there are so many other people out there who are worried about their (and their loved ones') health, job security, and making ends meet so it helps to know that no matter what happens, we're not alone in this crazy time. Hope you are all doing well and getting by one day at a time! 

TL;DR: My current contract requires a ridiculous amount of notice (30 days) before quitting; I think my current job is secure but have my doubts, especially with everything going on right now. I have a job offer lined up--how much notice can I give without putting myself at risk or burning bridges?",23Mar2020,1
936,"Hello! My boyfriend and I recently adopted a 1 year old Australian Shepherd. He was in a not so good environment, with a family who kept him outside on a 5ft chain for most of the day and then only brought him in to put him in a dog crate for the night. They also have not neutered him.
Cosmo likes to jump up on people quite a bit. Along with this, he likes to jump up on almost anything, including the couch, counter, table, etc. when he jumps on us we have started to turn our back to him and ignore him until he stops jumping, which seems to help some of the time but doesn’t seem to decrease the amount of jumping.
Cosmo does not seem to understand how to walk on a leash. He will constantly try to jump on you, weave from side to side, and bite the leash.
Along with biting the leash, he will rough play/try to bite when we start trying to play with toys and/or are trying to get him to not jump up on furniture. We have tried making a high pitch “ouch!” When he does this, but it seems to only stop him momentarily before he begins again. 
He also seems to be quite skittish when it comes to going in the crate. We leave it open all day and praise when he goes in it, but he currently will not go in without some kind of reward being involved. 
He has the instinct to run at/try to chase cars when they pass by, and if he sees a dog he also will just bark at it and pull towards it.
Of course we completely understand Cosmo does not know much better, he’s had a sad start to his life and needs much more exercise, love, and training. We are playing with him quite a bit with toys, giving lots of belly scratches, and taking him on multiple long walks through the day. We are just hoping to get some training tips to help him be a great behaved doggo.",23Mar2020,1

938,"I am an only child and my mum has always been overly protective over me. She didn't allow me to go out on the street until I was in high school and I only started going out in my 4th year of highschool. The only time I managed to have fun was when I would run away to other town while lying to my parents that I'm at my friends place. I have no memories of my high school nor did I go anywhere with my friends and I never go anywhere with my boyfriend and our town is so small that we barely have anything to do so I rather spend my time gaming. 

All of my friends live in other countries and they constantly invite me to visit them but my parents won't let me. They always have some dumb excuses. They didn't let me go to the lake cuz I might drown even if I can swim? When I was young I had lots of opportunities to travel because I wanted to apply for competitions but my parents wouldn't even let me get tested because it was in another town. 
 
They won't let me travel alone and even if I  tell them I'll go with my bf they tell me that I can't travel with a man I'm not married to. I am just sick of living like this and I am still in college and I live in a poor country where you can't get your own place unless you are married because it is too expensive for one person.  It's hard getting a job here for both of us. I feel like I wasted my life not being able to travel anywhere and go anywhere with the people I care about. I feel like that it affected my confidence a lot in trying new things and I am too old now for the opportunities we get in our country. Our country is collapsing. It is ruled by people who only have elementary school diploma and college diplomas are not worth anything even outside the country. People are getting married at 16 and leaving the country to their relatives. 

I tried earning money by applying to transcription sites but I never get accepted. I don't know which jobs to apply for anymore online. Should I just save up and run away to my trips but I'm afraid they'll get mad and kick me out. 

How do I convince my parents to let me travel while I have the chance? I might not be ble to move on in years judging by my country's situation. Hard work doesn't pay off here.

944,"I am a single mum to a boy who is circumcised (the hospital told us it was a standard procedure and for health and cleanliness purposes). So my experience with changing diapers and cleaning boys is related to just my own.

I moved in with my sister in law and brother some months ago because I lost my job. 

Now today I offered to change my nephew because his mum was busy and his father is an essential worker (police officer).

To make a long story short, I have never changed an uncircumcised boy’s diaper and well, I accidentally retracted his foreskin while cleaning. I wanted to make sure that no brown matter got stuck ya know under the skin (which is why I got my own son circumcised to avoid). 

My nephew screamed when I did it an his mum ran in saying what’s going on. She saw what I had done and immediately began cursing me out and told me I have to love the fuck out ASAP. Apparently I wasn’t supposed to pull his foreskin back like I do with my own circumcised sons’s skin to clean it.

When my brother came home from his shift he helped convince my sister in law not to kick me out of the house. He said I can stay but no more contact with my nephew.

I think this is a bit harsh? I made an honest mistake and meant no harm and get they’re treating me like I did some kind of permanent damage to him! I think it’s ridiculous especially because I was just trying to help! And honestly this would have been avoidable if my nephew were just circumcised as is normal? 

I don’t know what I should do and if I should apologize for what as a mistake. I mean I said “sorry” right away but it was more like the kind of sorry when you bump into someone rather than like a heartfelt apology.

Is this something that they should have flown off the handle about or is it borderline abusive towards me? (And like I said I was just trying to help!)

950,"I need advice on restoring my relationship with my mother-in-law. Basically, I made a parenting mistake, and I'm not sure she'll ever forgive me for it.

This is what happened. This week, MIL came over to hang out with my wife and I, and our two kids. I was working remotely on a project, and I felt some pressure to finish it while she was over. MIL's job was basically cancelled for a couple months because of COVID-19. So my wife was visiting with her in another room.

My wife asked me to pause my work and put our toddler down for a nap, so that she could spend time with MIL. This should have been no problem. But for some reason, our toddler started acting up, and wouldn't even set foot in his doorway. He likes his room and doesn't usually fight naps, so this was super unusual. I knew I probably wouldn't be able to finish my work on time at this point. I warned him that he was disobeying, and that he'd be getting some privileges taken away. Long story short, I ended up spanking him with one quick rap on the bottom (with my hand). He cried a little bit and fussed some more, but eventually went into his bed to sleep. I almost never spank, but in the moment I felt I had no other option (please withhold judgement).

Turns out, MIL heard the whole thing, and unbeknownst to me, she DESPISES corporal punishment. She told me she was ""shocked and appalled"" and was debating with herself whether to call the police. She ended up leaving our house and mentioned that she may never come back, unless she saw ""drastic change"" in our home and ""evidence of a more nurturing environment"".

She's not speaking to me now. But I've heard through the grapevine that she wants me to 1) swear never to use spanking again 2) read two of her books 3) implement XY and Z change in our parenting.

Now, I have known MIL for many years, almost 15 years. I know that she works with a lot of teenagers as a teacher, but I never would have guessed that she would be ""shocked"" over hearing a spanking, since it is still a thing that some people do.

Personally I do feel bad about what I did. I know there are always many options for discipline and not just one. Normally we would only spank for ""life-and-limb"" dangerous behavior if there were no other consequences that could serve as a learning experience.

So I want to apologize to her and make amends, but at the same time... I don't want her to dictate the way that we parent. I would like her to know that I'm not an abusive person, and we won't ever become abusive people, even if we don't agree with all her criteria.

So we're at a stalemate and she won't budge.

My wife doesn't care whether I stand up for myself or comply with her wishes... my wife just wants the problem resolved.

What would you recommend?

TLDR: MIL caught me spanking our child (we rarely spank). Now she wants us to change a lot of things about how we parent, and she won't speak to me until we do. I want to apologize but I don't want to implement the changes she wants for our parenting—I think that's crossing our own family boundary.",23Mar2020,1

My mom still has savings that will get us through the next few months, even more so if our landlord decides to freeze rent payments for the time being. And I also have a good chunk of money saved up with my only bills every month being 130 for my phone, and 300 to my mom for rent.

With that said, I'm now going to be the only person going out to a high risk job every day, and coming back to a quarantined family that consists of my diabetic mom in her early 50s, a decently overweight but otherwise healthy 25 year old brother, and a teenage asthmatic brother. All of them are more at risk than me for those reasons, and I worry about bringing that virus back to them.

So what should I do? Should I quit my job so my family and I can effectively quarantine ourselves through this thing and manage what we have saved on top of the little money they will be bringing in, or should I go out take this huge risk every day for some job security and the paycheck? I also worry about all of our abilities to find a job once this is over and the economy is in the toilet.

I'm at a loss and it's driving my anxiety crazy. I don't know what to do.",23Mar2020,1
959,"Our soon to be 5 year old girl had to cancel her birthday party due to Covid, and we are struggling to think of ways to make it something that is not depressing (for both her and us). We are thinking about hosting a video call with her friends via Zoom, but I'm concerned it's going to be unorganized chaos (at best) without any games/activities. Anyone have ideas for activities for a dozen or so 5 year old girls to participate in for this virtual birthday party?  An example of something that might be fun is guessing how many balls are in our ball pit, and having our daughter count them out and give some sort of virtual prize to the winner. I'm not very creative with stuff like this. Any ideas on a platform, or games that we can plan would be greatly appreciated!",23Mar2020,1

964,"To give context, I have spoken very little to anyone at the residential boarding school I attend. Like, no one in my class knows who I am expect for a few people. However, I feel after we return back to school I am going to finally break out of my shell and talk. Even if I struggle to talk to other students, I’m going to make a strong effort to be engaged in class.  To get back on topic, the question that I’m asking is how do I form social connections after 4 months of not talking to most people , and people also probably having a negative option of me due to my lack of social interaction? The school is only juniors and seniors, and I’m a junior; most social groups I feel have solidified at this point.

965,"I had a friend I knew for a few years, I met him while playing call or duty on Xbox and we instantly clicked. He was a freshman in high school at the time and I was just l finishing up 8th grade. We stayed friends all the way up until we got older and then it seems our friendship started to fade away, we wouldn’t talk much but would still play Xbox here and there but once I moved away from Xbox it seems we have lost communication for good. 

I tried keeping in contact with him but it just seems he wasn’t really interested in hearing from me, every time I try to reach out and send my regards I usually just get a simple “thanks you too” and then that’s it, dude straight up acts as if I’m some random stranger now and it’s sad because he was like my brother I was able to tell him anything and trust him, I’m guessing with how much time has passed since we were friends he just doesn’t wanna be bothered. Should I keep trying to reach out or just leave him alone &amp; move on with life? He was like my brother, please help",23Mar2020,1

968,"Our downstairs neighbors are OBSESSED with their bathroom fan. We live in an older building and would feel silly making it a “big” deal and going to management about this. They have had their loud bathroom fan on since this late am.... as in they shut it off for literally like 3 min and then they turn it back on again and leave it on for hours. 

Today it’s been on for pretty much 6-7 hours and It’s really loud and uncomfortable up here to hear this loud hummm for hours and hours and hours. We live above them on the 3rd floor. It’s this dull roar that grates on the nerves and doesn’t provide peace of mind. And we can’t leave because of the whole Coronavirus/ Shelter in Place thing!!! 

Should I leave them a nice note? Keep on ignoring it? They’re generally good neighbors and don’t want to piss them off but their fan is so loud.... we try our best to overlook it all the time and have never brought it up to them.",23Mar2020,1
969,I’m currently in 9th grade. I failed one class and that is English honors because I forgot to turn in an essay that made up our entire grade due to being sick the day it was due( I know I still could’ve turned it in but I kept stupidly procrastinating on turning it in because I was scared of what I would receive as an overall grade). So my grade went from an A to an F just this quarter. Besides that all of my other classes are all 93% and above including my AP courses. There are 4 quarters and 3rd quarter was cut short because of COVID-19 that was in my city a week before finals week. Does this mean I have to retake this class next year in as a 10th grader even though all of my English grades the past quarters was an A? And do universities care about having just one F in freshmen year?,23Mar2020,1
970,"My mom has lupus, myasthenia gravis and rheumatoid arthritis. So there is an increased chance that I have a auto immune disease as well. 

However, I’ve never been tested. I know for sure I have some form of arthritis. I have problems with my knees, hands, and feet, and can feel them grinding. 

I’ve also always had swollen lymph nodes, but my doctors have always ignored it. And I learned recently that swollen lymph nodes are signs that something isn’t right in your body.

Given all of this, I’m worried that I might have a disease or something. Which then means that I have a much greater chance of dying from coronavirus. What can I do to ease this anxiety? I’m feeling doomed.",23Mar2020,1

973,"i joined a friend group back in like november. i was good friends with one of the girls (let’s call her Amy) in around 2016, but she went to a different school so we didn’t talk anymore. now we go to the same school and she is part of this friend group. immediately i realized how self centered Amy had become over that time. she only ever talked about herself, and if someone did something she didn’t like she would get mad at them, but then like a week later she would do the same thing like it’s suddenly justified. every subject would evolve into Amy bragging about herself, and if you shared an interest or talent she would belittle you. keep in mind, she was never like this when i knew her before. of course, i didn’t agree with Amy being like this, which led to us arguing a lot, which led to her recently blocking me on every platform. yesterday, my other friend (who has known both me and Amy for years, let’s call her Jen), confronted me over snapchat saying i’ve been mean to Amy. Jen kept talking about how Amy came to her saying i’ve been acting nasty towards her for no reason. of course, Jen believed Amy because they’ve known each other a bit longer and i’m a guy, making it easier to blame me for being a horrible person. luckily, i convinced Jen that i wasn’t being a dick and that Amy was in the wrong.  so last night, i was on a group facetime (amy finally unblocked me on text) with a few of my friends. all throughout the facetime amy kept insulting everyone and talking about herself, as usual. of course, everyone just laughed it off for some reason. then, out of nowhere, she calls me a pussy and says even she’s more of a man than me. for once, i didn’t know how to respond to that, so i didn’t. 

i don’t want to be friends with amy anymore, but i don’t want to break away from the friend group. it doesn’t look like amy will any time soon, either. so what should i do?",23Mar2020,1
974,"Yes I'm still putting a lot of what I'll say behind a spoiler, that's how uncomfortable I am about all of this.

To preface, I'm FTM transgender, aroace and sex repulsed. I'm also neurodivergent, but I dunno if it applies here; if it does I'll state it. I was born and raised in the Mormon church up until a little over a year ago when I voluntarily resigned for mental health reasons. Now in the Mormon church, sexual anything outside of marriage is strictly forbidden, so besides the obvious this includes looking at porn and masturbating. Another thing is some pretty intense shame conditioning, where simple human mistakes are framed as something that will bar you from heaven, and that's taught at the earliest possible age (I'm not joking, it's taught to 4-5 year olds). You can probably take a good guess on what I *didn't* do as a teenager. Not that I thought I needed it, I never liked the idea of anything sexual, ever. Now that I'm not constantly being barraged by the idea that I should be ashamed of feeling this way, it's coming to the surface. But even thought I'm no longer part of that shame conditioning, one can't just whisk away 20 or so years of it. More in the spoiler, if you're ok to read that part.

&gt;!I've figured out and known I have a transformation thing for years now. I just like seeing people turn into animals or monsters. I mean, I like monsters a lot, especially werewolves and shapeshifters and mutants. I just think it's a cool superpower, and a good horror trope, seeing your own humanity peel away right before your eyes. It's only partially a fetish thing, or rather a low grade fetish. (There's also a trans part that fits here, but it's hard to articulate well.) But that's not the issue here.!&lt;

&gt;!I've also known for a while that I like vore too, but I've been less willing to accept that, so I buried that deeper, made worse by the fact that I accidentally stumbled across it many years ago. And now after so many years being locked away it suddenly came out full force. A couple days ago I was looking up Arbok art on DeviantArt, because Arbok is a cool Pokemon and I like them. And well, guess what I stumbled upon. I then spent the next five hours looking up more and more vore stuff, and then spent the entire next day doing that, and then next, and the next. And every time I felt disgusting and awful afterwards. I despise feeling horny, but I kept going back, and all those years of shame conditioning gets to me.!&lt;

&gt;!That first day I was close to crying I felt so gross, but now it's less so due to not being so jarring anymore. But I still struggle with it, being one who doesn't like feeling that way and being so shame conditioned about it, all against years and years of a repressed side of me that suddenly burst forth and is now spilling out like a broken faucet. I never masturbated during it, but I still wanted to feel that... excitement.!&lt;

I don't know what to do about it. Give it up and pretend I never figured it out? Or give up on fighting it and continue on like there's no problem? Then how do I confront the ashamed part of me? Logically I know the large majority of people masturbate and look at porn, and that there's no harm in taking care of yourself sexually (in fact, it's even beneficial), but I doubt this is an issue that can be solved with logic. I'm fucking losing sleep over this, and I'm too afraid to ask anyone I know IRL since they're all either Mormon, abusive, both of those, someone I can only see every now and again, or it's just flat out inappropriate to ask them such things.",23Mar2020,1
975,"I'm 16 and I live with my sister and my mother, but for the last month or so, my older brother (in 30s) has been sleeping on the couch. He has a history of drugs, and excessive drinking, and quite recently has been lashing out and breaking property in the house. The last time he had done it was a couple weeks ago, but, because he is very hot headed, this behaviour can resurface at any time. We had to call the police, to remove him from the house. It scares me a lot when he is like this, and I have always been very distant of him because of it. 

The worse possible situation is occurring, as I am stuck in a household with him, for what seems like could be months. I rarely leave my room, and when I do, I try to avoid contact with him completely. It is very difficult pushing myself to go downstairs. Even to get food, or speak to my other family members.

Also, for whatever reason, his girlfriend is sleeping on the couch aswell. I know for a fact me and my sister have complained to my mother about this, but she says there is nothing she can do. She is Ok, a lot better than my brother, but it feels like a stranger is crashing on the sofa, and eating the food. To my knowledge, they both dont pay rent.

I enjoy playing video games, mainly at night, but even this has been slowed down, because I get complaints of noise all the time. (for some reason in my house, noise from upstairs to downstairs is amplified a lot, so even swiveling, or moving around on my chair, makes a lot of noise apparently)

I dread the thought of staying in a house with these people, and it looks like I will be forced to for months. It's horrible. It makes me feel depressed. And whenever I bring it up to my mum, she normally says how there is nothing she can do because it Is her son, or more recently, how the virus, is stopping everyone from doing anything, so he cant even find his own place.

Any help is appreciated, thanks.",23Mar2020,1
976,"My best friend, who we'll call Amy, has recently started dating a guy. She has asked me to give her an honest opinion on him, I've met him once and spent a few hours together, I see some red flags but they seem so happy together. 

I see the red flags, but I don't know if that's my subconscious trying to get me to get them to break up, or it's actual red flags. It's hard to even say anything because I'm afraid I'm going to say something manipulative because I'm in love with her.

There is another problem aswell, I have never dated anyone before, I have gone on dates, but not since high school (a little over a year ago). I don't know what dating is really supposed to feel or look like, yet she wants me to give her some advice.

Some of the red flags I see (don't read them unless it's relevant to your reply, I am trying to remove any biases)
&gt;! They have different personalities!&lt;
&gt;! Now, I make some jokes pointed at her or myself, but when he does it, I feel like he's taking it to far!&lt;
&gt;! He never, ever talks about his exes in any way, not even acknowledging they existed!&lt;

What should I do?",23Mar2020,1
