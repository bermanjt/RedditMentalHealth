3,"Soon to be divorced here. Have an almost 3 year old daughter. STBX was abusive physically and emotionally and sometimes sexually towards me only. I left him and started life over again in massachusetts, leaving our old state. When I went to pick up my daughter over my mother in law's house, I overheard that they were planning to frame me as a physical/sexual/emotional abuser (None of this is true) to, I quote ""make sure one sticks"" and so he'll get custody. I never and would never hurt my daughter. STBX has straight up told me on multiple occasions that he'll convince our daughter, to say I did something to her teacher or whatever other authority figure when she's older. I'm terrified of loosing my daughter or going to prison for something I would never do.  Would her word, coached by him, be enough to put me in jail or him to win custody? Please help",01Sep2020,1
5,"I want to be happy, but I'm not sure how. Most of the things that I remember from my life is me being yelled at and smacked by my parents, or ignored and shunned by my classmates. But, honestly when I talk to them, they say my life wasn't that bad, that I was a really happy kid. I'm probably just over-reacting tho haha. I mean, if you think about it, so many people have it worse than me, so why do I still feel so sad? Is there something wrong with me?

I used to get so scared of being left by people, that I made myself act so unbearable that no one would talk to me, and push away those who would. At first I did it all on purpose, but after a while it started to become second nature to me. I'm so scared I won't be able to change and fix myself from this, and I don't know what to do. I keep trying to remind myself that so so many other people have it worse, but I don't know why it's not working. It used to make me re-evaluate situations and what I was doing when I was a kid, so I'm just confused how it's not working now.

I'm terrified of being alone, and I'm so so scared I'll never find someone that cares about me. I know this is alot to ask of you, but please, I just need a little help and advice on how to fix myself.",01Sep2020,1

Hi I’m me. I want to hypothetically sell a small bit of my hair to someone  because I’m broke as fuck. It’s about two inches long and brown and pretty soft. It’s not long enough to sell for a wig or something but maybe someone would want it for sentimental purposes?",01Sep2020,1
8,So a while back my sister accidentally sexted me a message meant for her boyfriend at the time. It was hot as hell and talked about how she loved his cum on her titties and in her pussy with some hot pics and a video of playing with herself. To be honest I jerked off to quite a bit. She never said anything and I never said anything and I have not had that number for a while now. Since then I have stolen and came in some of her panties and seen/stolen some nudes since then. Yesterday she almost caught me red handed. I want to either tell her or I want her to catch me jerking it to her pics. What should I do I need advice it keep eating away at me and I NEED to do something before I go crazy. She has the most amazing tits and pussy I have ever seen and need to do something. I casual have hit on her and she plays along with it. Comment some help getting to at least see her tits or hopefully get some head and pussy.,01Sep2020,1

Damn though man I’ve just came to the realization that I suck lmao i don’t really know what to do I’m applying for jobs after my masters but I’m so nervous I’m not going to get them and I always think what am I going to do if I don’t get the jobs I want.

11,"I live in England, 15 almost 16. So basically I’ve just moved into year 11 and this is my final year in school. Next year I have to decide whether I wanna go college full time or get an apprenticeship or something, I honestly have no idea how any of this works. The past 4 years I haven’t left my house properly, I’ve been on walks and to doctors appointments but that’s it. I don’t go to school as I’m homeschooled. I have Autism, Gender Dysphoria, Anxiety, Depression, Attachment Disorder, Social Anxiety and sooo many more things I’ve genuinely lost track.. Anyway I struggle to leave my house and I was told you can’t do college from home and I’m honestly freaking out. I have no idea how to talk to a human, I have no idea how to, let’s say, “do life.” I don’t know what to do. I freak out when someone tries to talk to me because I don’t know how to respond and I can’t look people in the eyes so it just gets extremely awkward and then I start to panic. I don’t currently have any friends and I’ve never had real life friends before. Not proper friends anyway. I don’t even know what I want to do in life, I was kinda hoping I could stay in my room forever. I never thought about it because the more I thought about it the realer it became. I don’t know what I’m good at because I’ve never been out to try stuff, I don’t know what I enjoy because I’ve not really done anything. The only thing I’m passionate about is gaming which is why I’m trying streaming/social media stuff basically.. but in reality there’s such a low chance of succeeding in that industry. I am just stuck. I don’t know what to do, especially when it comes to the day where I actually have to go outside and go to college. I was practicing going out and then corona started and well I’m back to square one now. I don’t know what to do or what I enjoy, I don’t know what job I want, I don’t know how I’m gonna go outside to college, I just need some advice or help on what to do.

14,"I’ve always told them that I would never kill myself. And I still don’t think I ever will. 

But it’s scaring me that their starting to pop up now. I’ve never had them before mostly because I’ve had fun things to distract myself like music, video games, and youtube.

. I’ve had them while I’ve been doing this new job. I started two weeks ago and my life has just gotten more stressful since. It happens when I’m doing outside maintenance or dish washing when I’m alone and just hating life. I get stuck in these thoughts and it takes me a lot of effort to hold in tears when I’m there at work.

I still don’t think I’d ever kill myself. They’re only “what if” types of questions. But I’m scared that it will only get worse and I have absolutely no idea how to tell them considering that I’ve always said that I don’t have these thoughts.

I’ve felt an attraction to men, but I also admit a lot of those interactions were forced and i usually wasn’t into it. Sometimes I can’t tell if I like them or the idea of them.

17,"I've posted this on another subreddit, but haven't really gotten much help. So I'll post it here too, sorry for the inconvenience.

First of all, I am a girl from South America so English is not my first language. Sorry in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.

I had a serious medical problem when I was very young and my parents did their best to take care of me. I really appreciate it, but for as long as I can remember our relationship has been an emotional roller coaster.

there was physical abuse (which is quite normalized here) as well as emotional and verbal abuse (my mother used to call me a leech and sewer rat when she got mad at me, in addition to threatening to abandon me and get another child to replace me). I also had a gruff and quite unpleasant behavior in early middle school as a result of bullying in elementary school.

There is a long list here to talk about but I will say that all this led to a suicide attempt when I was 12-13 years old which I survived because I regretted it at the last second. the only reason I didn't try again is that my parents gave us a kitten. for me she is my daughter whom I have to protect and several years later she has become a kind of emotional support animal for me. so I never wanted to try again for her, so she saved my life. However, my cat has not solved my family problems, recently the physical abuse has returned, although only as a failed attempt. A few weeks ago my mother was about to break my head with a broomstick because I told her that I would place my curtains after my online classes and not now as she wanted. She literally freaked out, she approached me like a beast and was close to hitting me when I threatened to hit her with my shoe if she approached me. I saw how terror filled her face, it seemed that she never thought that I would defend myself, I did not let her tie the dots and locked myself in the room on the side saying that if she touched me again she would take photos and publish them everywhere, ruining her reputation ( her business is largely based on that).

she responded by locking the door to my room, locking my cat in, and cursing me. She ended up going to her room and I started crying silently trying to calm myself while shaking. Hours passed and I was feeling a little better, but she had mentioned that she would only open it after my apologies for wanting to ""attack"" her (I did not even touch her). I didn't feel like I owed her anything so I didn't plan on doing it. I really wouldn't have minded staying in the next room for the rest of my life but my cat had been trapped inside. she's the ""I'm better than you"" type and she's very focused, but she actually hates being alone. Not to mention that she follows me everywhere and she really doesn't like that I'm not with her 24/7.

Above my door there is a large space there, it took me a while but I managed to climb on my own and pass a ladder on the other side to go down. She was very worried and sad but everything ended well (although my mother and I treated each other very coldly for the next few days my mother now treats me with more ""respect"" but I honestly think it's just the fear that I'm able to defend myself masked.

And with my father, I will skip everything and get to the point, my father tried to force me to take virtual classes for a university degree that I DO NOT want. It's a long story how I got a position there but I'll summarize by saying that I'm apparently smarter than I thought. I told my father that I did not want to do that, that I would rather focus on my English classes and then apply for a scholarship abroad. Do you try to talk to me in a civilized way and make me see reason? no! He threatened to hit me in the face if I didn't do what I wanted to do, it's terrifying to see how the face of such a sweet old man can turn into the face of the devil.

At the time I accepted, I did not have many options, and ran out of there. The topic came up again at lunch where I clarified in front of my mother that I really did not want to do it (although I did not mention the threat) and that I was afraid that leaving university (because I do not like it) would ruin my chances of being accepted in a prestigious university from another country. My mother initially took my side, but I end up agreeing with my father and I end up minimizing my efforts to leave. As she and my father talked to me I could see how my father's comments were full of anger but much more controlled. I will not go into details, but I ended up accepted, they say they will support me with all the procedures to go abroad but all they have done is leave the whole matter to me.

I really don't want to, I had a lot of things planned and this college degree would ruin my entire system. But more than anything, I am concerned about the level of power they have over me, they have important businesses in our area, and the people who know them have them in a rock, besides that they are technically rich.

At first it seemed that they respected my wishes not to follow the family legacy, but they have tried a thousand times to manipulate me to follow in their footsteps and take over the company every time they have the opportunity.

I don't know what to do, I accepted today. But I don't know what I will accept tomorrow or how long I will endure living in this house.

The main problem I have is that I don't want to be labeled a victim of family abuse and I really don't want that to condemn my life. There are times when I think that I would be able to leave and end up in some kind of shelter, but most of the time I think that maybe I'm wrong and I just have to accept it, and that if I hold out long enough I can leave the country with my cat and cut ties with them. I don't know what to do, is there any advice or other perspective you can give me?

\---

I've added an UPDATE on how things are now:, the virtual class of university is a disaster. I have not understood anything and the teacher has been super arrogant with any question we asked him.

problems also appeared, since all my colleagues seem to know each other previously. but this is the first class that I am notified of. I told my father how the situation was going and I even dropped the idea that maybe I had ended up in the wrong class (since my documents are not regulated) in addition to asking him for help. He went crazy and started yelling at me telling me that his father (my grandfather) had never cared about his education and he managed ALONE and as I wanted him to do the SAME.

I started to tell him that I would take care of my part but I needed a bit of his help but he cut me off yelling that with that attitude I would never be able to handle myself outside the country. Things got violent in a little while and my mother threatened to tear off my door to keep an eye on me always and she threatened to hit me, so I responded with the same thing and to take care of what I was doing. when she left I closed the door immediately.

I have another class in a few minutes, I am very lost right now and I honestly want to die. I don't know what to do now, any advice?",01Sep2020,1
18,"I(22F) need advice about what to do with my family. 

So some back story my parents separated 15yrs ago and divorced 9yrs ago. My father raised my brother(25M) and I since they separated with a few limited visits. 

When I turned 10 my grandmother had a talk with me and told me I was responsible for things around the house such as cleaning and cooking. My father has a disorder which makes it very difficult to do these tasks. My brother also has an autoimmune disease and possibly other issues but has not been diagnosed. 

So I’m summary for about 10yrs while I lived with them I took care of my dad &amp; brother to the best of my abilities. I can share examples in the comments if y’all would like. 
 
Now I work in a different city so moved out of my fathers house and into my own place. Now during this pandemic my dad has been very stressed out and asking me to come visit and help. 

My brother has made remarks of disowning me for an incident that happened previously. He was very disrespectful and I would love nothing less than to not be around him. However, my father needs help and I want to do whatever I can for him. 

So I packed up and made the 4 hour drive over. Since getting here my brother has called me a bitch, told me I wasn’t his sister, and screamed at my father a couple of times. He harasses him while he’s working and won’t do anything to help around the house. 

My father does his laundry, dishes, pays for everything and, cooks/orders his meals. While he works from 7am to 11pm from home. They have been living like this for 2yrs. My brother has never had a job, never moved out and, doesn’t have a license. 

So every time I come to visit I end up just cleaning, cooking and, taking care of them. I’m tired of being verbally abused every time I visit but I want to help my dad. What should I do?",01Sep2020,1

26,"One night, while my friend was under the influence, he showed me his collection of nudes. It was a disguised app that had several girls in there, each with their own folder. I was one of the girls. My nude goes back all the way to middle school (I do not condone child pornography, I was just naive). I am not the only girl’s whose nudes date all the way back to middle school. I never sent them to him so I’m sure he got them through someone else. I deleted my folder out of his phone. He either has these nudes for one or two reasons: to expose the girls or for his entertainment. Either way I think it’s weird, but even weirder for me because I was suppose to be his “friend”. What “friend” saves their friend’s nudes to expose them or just to boost his ego??? After that night he completely stopped talking to me and tries his best to avoid me. Not to mention he’s in a six month relationship. I feel like I’m overreacting and that most people keep a saves collections of nudes, but I think it’s just absurd to have that many pictures.

28,"I know my question sounds crazy, so let me explain.
I'm 18 years old gay guy. I'm mostly attracted to younger guys or at least looking young and cute. So basically everyone under the age of 25, who is skinny has a baby face, doesn't have beard etc. But the thing is it includes boys aged 10-14. When I see someone this age I always stare at them and sometimes I even imagine sex scenes with them. I also stalk their Facebook and Instagram profiles, because there I can find really nice photos of them (no, fortunately I don't jerk off to such photos or anything like that, I just like how they look, how they dress and sometimes I imagine how would they do in bed). I've never really considered it as anything bad (maybe because I'm kinda young myself, and I was always attracted to boys this age. I grew up in a but who I find attractive didn't. But I did something wrong. The first thing isn't that much connected to my question, but I feel you should know that. When I was 14 I created a snapchat account to trade nudes. I was just horny and wanted to see some dicks of ""normal"" people. I also sent nudes back of course. Sometimes it was with guys my age, sometimes older (even 30 or more, I was just curious how does a 30 old guy dick look like I guess). So yeah it's stupid af, but I did it so whatever. Fortunately I never sent any pictures of my face since I was too scared. The second thing (more important imo) is I still sometimes trade nudes. So about half a year ago I was searching for someone to trade in a chatting app (well, it's supposed to be a chatting app but most people use it for trading nudes). Now it gets fucked up. I messaged a really young looking guy and turns out he is 13 (and I was fcking 17). He asked me if I wanted to trade nudes. And I agreed. I know I should have blocked him, but I didn't. We traded some pics and videos and I really enjoyed them. Then he asked me if I wanted to fuck him. That's when I realized what I was doing. The first time when I thought that something might be wrong with me. I didn't stop tho. I didn't agree for the sex thing since it's illegal (and at the same time I was looking at child porn, kinda ironic), but we continued sending pics. Eventually he disappeared. I'm kinda glad he did lol. After all of this I wanted to make this post, but never did. I was still sometimes looking at his pictures since they were saved on our chat (and yes, this time I was jerking off to them too). Every time I did it I knew it was bad, but I was doing it anyway. But now he's pictures are gone (I deleted our chat, so I hopefully stop doing this). But after what happened this night I decided to ask you what should I do. So, someone once told me that a good indicator of being gay is if you have sex dreams with a guy. Guess what I dream I had today. I WAS GIVING A BLOWJOB TO A 11 YEAR OLD BOY! And it was my cousin. That's fucked up. I don't want to be like that. I don't want to be a rapist or a pedophile. What should I do to stop it? At this point I feel like it's something I can actually compare to sexuality. I can't control this. And I'm really afraid that I will do something really wrong later in my life. Is this something I can cure? I guess there are probably therapies, but I have no idea how to look for one. And I'll probably need to wait until I live by myself, since I don't wanf my family to know all of this.

Tldr: I'm attracted to boys aged 10-14 and it's going out of my control.",01Sep2020,1

32,"Basically i had the same friends from middle school until like junior year of highschool when i realized they were really toxic for me and i ended up pretty much hanging out with my ex most of the time and he never let me make new friends. Now im almost 20 and i only talk to one friend regularly but its inconsistent as hell and weve drifted apart a lot. I have no idea how to make friends now, guys just want to hook up and dont really care much about being friends and girls seem to hate me. I would just like a life outside of my s/o :/",01Sep2020,1
33,"met a girl on tinder a couple months ago, I think we hit it off, we've talked every day since then and have become good friends, the thing is she is basically on the other side of the country (both in the US, due to tinder passport back then). anyways I know we haven't met in person but I really like her so far and well, I would be interested in dating. however, I am not sure if she would be interested? we flirt sometimes and talk about a lot of stuff, every day, and we video chat sometimes and send selfies and even have made plans to visit each other once things calm down with the pandemic and we send letters to each other etc, anyways the problem is that she is still really hung up on her ex and recently they hooked up. im not judging, I get it, it happens, but obviously it made me kinda upset and I dont think a good friendship is gonna work out if im still here thinking she's really attractive and that I would like to date her and then she's still hung up on her ex or thinking of getting back with him or hooking up with him, I did bring it up before and she said we couldn't date cuz we're in opposite sides of the country and well, maybe we could work on that? my friend said I should try to hook up with her and like, yea that would be fun (if it were to happen) and all but I want more than that

anyways, I dont think we would end up dating but here is what I need advice on: should I just call it quits or just try to be friends with her still or try to see if we date ? would it really be messed up to just call it quits since I doubt we would date and im interested in dating? I dont want to just be here upset because I like her but she's hooking up with her ex or going on tinder again looking for other people so idk what to do

thank you in advance.",01Sep2020,1
34,"I've been subletting in this apartment for about two years. Two roommates left but I stayed and got myself a new roommate and we are now both on the lease. I used to have the smallest room but decided to take the slightly bigger room with its own bathroom. The only thing that really works in that small room is the loftbed and desk combo I have in there. I have also left a dresser and a desk chair. I already got new furniture for the new room. 

So my question is: can I charge the new person $50 a month for the use of my furniture? They will be paying less actual rent due to the small size of the room, but that $50 would go to me instead of the landlord. I would leave it up to them if they want to be on the lease or not (landlord is cool with subletting). 

I feel like since it's my furniture I can rent it out if I like. But I also feel like if they sign the lease then they have just as much right to the space and I'm the one who chose to leave the furniture behind. What would you think if you read an ad saying yes you can be on the lease and pay this super cheap rent but also part of that is personally going to the adposter because their furniture is in there? 

Thanks so much",01Sep2020,1
36,"I'm M23  and I'm mentally disabled. I haven't worked in a job since years and at this point I given up on it mostly. 

The past years or so I wasn't even considering that I may actually be able to be self-sustaining ever again but It didn't bother me. I had internet, a library and the bit of money i get from the state as compensation for not being able to work but my mother is turning 60 soon and my grandma about to hit 80.. and i realised that at one point I won't have their help anymore meaning I kind of have to get somehow into the way of life normal people have.

So I got an appointment at a sort-of-clinic for integrating disabled humans into a job and life on their own. After 3hs of showing around and talking the psychologist there went like I'd be above average intelligent. And would able to learn complex things extremely fast etc. I heard that often in my life but how would he even know? Anyways..

Current state is, that the bureau that is currently giving me money to life of and so on wants me to get a school education and study. Their logic being that thinking is the only thing i can so I should get into a profession where i have only to think.

I'd pick physics or mathematics if. Tho to me I don't see any reason why this would work at all.  
I was in school once. Went horrible. So bad that I ran home someday and haven't left my house for 2 years straight. But also I can not explain myself why standing in my room at my whiteboard trying to figure out how some physics work is different from school. (Probably the fact that other people are there and I am afraid of humans absurdly enough) and that I get stuff explained rather than figure out my own and that I get told what to learn. (tho that's speculation I don't know if all school work the same)

 And now I'm essentially sitting around at home waiting for a letter stating whether or not the school is paid for etc and try to get along with the idea i'd have to move out far away from home and have no idea what is coming at me nor if it works out and what if it doesn't work. It also doesn't help that from all them experts its a 50/50 split of ""This is a terrible idea!"" and ""This is the only thing that could work!"" and they expect me to decide stuff that I have no idea about. I don't know myself. I know what people tell me about myself. From my point of view... I learn. That's all i ever did. I don't know how to cook, how bureaus work, how anything of society works and understandable nobody understands why I can't learn things that aren't like numbers and rock solid logical systems. I thankful that I have all them therapists and stuff to help but I have less knowledge about myself than them etc.

Most importantly; I have no idea how to deal with this whole situation. I have so much trouble with this and (as usual) I can't express the problem.. which makes asking for advice a bit pointless to be honest... also sorry for the long text... but I don't see an alternative so I try..   
On the one hand I would love if it all works. I would love to get an actual degree, living on my own or even earn my money instead of just getting it. But I am crippled by fear and I have no faith in that..   


You know what, you can probably just make guesses on what I need advice on, I take anything.. Its not like I'd understand or know how to deal with anything at all...  
Thanks in advanced for any attempts on helping. ♥",01Sep2020,1
37,"So I’ve had the same group of friends pretty much all my life so far. My friendship group kinda split a few years ago but I stuck with my “best” friend and found a new group through him. I guess what I’m saying is I’ve never really had to “make friends” - at least since being a young child. I’ve either kept the same friends or been introduced to people through said friends.

Now I’m moving away to go to a college (local ones didn’t have the courses I needed but that’s a whole different story.) I’m not gonna make all these bold claims that I have “anxiety” or whatnot, but I’m definitely awkward in my personality - and I’m *extremely* shy. That, combined with the fact I’ve never really experienced “making friends” is making my terrified for this college experience. I know nobody there. Literally nobody. It’s a completely fresh start. I don’t know how to say this and not sound completely obnoxious but I’m not like other people my age. I wouldn’t say I particularly relate to the majority of people in my area. I don’t know how to describe it but we have a “type.” 

I’m not desperate for a huge group of friends. One or two will do. I just don’t know how to find them. How do you pick someone out and think “I wanna be friends with you?” Who do you choose to approach in the first place. Hell, I’m not one to do the approaching. I guess it sounds arrogant but I always let people approach me first. It’s more because of a fear I’ll mess up, as opposed to arrogance. Idk. Help.",01Sep2020,1

39,"Hi guys and girls, first of all thank you for taking some time to read my post:) So basically, I’m starting my associate degree online program (online for now) at my local community college (building Construction management). I just graduated high school. I just got hired to work at my local lowes (home improvement store) in the lumber department (seasonal- i can get hired to regular at the end of season). It pays 13hr. Ive heard from others in the store and looking online that this department is the “hardest” to work in and is lots of physical labor each day. It also supposedly has a very high turnover rate. It also has a tuition reimbursement program that pays 2500 yearly towards my college costs. However, I just got another job offer from a local (higher end) food store that will pay 13.75 per hour with not really any benefits. However my neighbor works there and told me it is a really chill job with not much stress at all. I did the math and if i work 30hrs a week lowes will pay me 1000 more (including tuition reimbursement) compared to the local food store. Im trying to figure out which will be better for me overall in the long run. Food store- slightly less pay, maybe slightly lower job security (much smaller business), low stress, free meal each shift. Lowes - slightly higher pay, high stress/ physically demanding, higher job security, employee discount, will look good on my resume in future. Im just really conflicted, stay at lowes or take the lower stress job. The worst that could happen in my opinion is in like 1 month find out i really hate lowes and wish I accepted the food store job. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",01Sep2020,1

The name came back, and what's weirder is that she was exactly where she said she'd be. She's in the City's correctional facility. I couldn't believe the name actually existed. She has three felonies. I posted her bond, which was nearly $700 out of pocket. She will be released to community-supervision tomorrow.

I didn't think this far.. Should I ask her out? I don't want to come off with ''I only bailed you to have sex with you vibes"", but at the same time I feel like the dream was pretty important to me. I want to try to help her back on her feet if I can.

What do I do guys.. I'm a pretty normal dude, with a normal life, have never had issues getting chicks and I've never had this happen before..

51,"There's a lot to talk about. I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder back when I was teenager. I was prescribed medication for them but I stopped taking them after about 2 years. I managed to get the anxiety under control and for the last 5 years I only had a panic attack once or twice a year and when I felt anxious I could bring myself back down. Depression was somewhat of a constant I believe, even if I told myself I wasn't depressed I think I may actually have been. I had a relapse in anxiety recently that made me realize that I'm getting older and that I have so much that I still want to do but now I have to fit it all in what feels like a small amount of time.

I just got my Associate's degree in Computer Science. This is great, but it means I still have 2 years to go before I get my Bachelor's at age 28 (this is if I do everything optimally). 28 feels late in life to finish college, even though I know there's plenty of people who do it even later in life. I want to try to get a job programming while I'm getting my bachelors so that I can earn more money and get industry experience, and I know that the younger I am when I start my career, the better I think I'll feel about it later in life. But I don't have a lot of discipline. I've always struggled with procrastination. Despite this, I've been able to do well in school, earning a GPA of 3.89 at the end of my Associate's, but I'm always waiting till the last second to do things. I think that procrastination is a large part of why I am in this situation and feel the way I do now.

I'm not sure if I really want kids, but I know my girlfriend does and she's 24. On average guys have their first child at 27, and that's one year from now. If I wait longer that means I'll have less energy while they're growing up and I'll also be older when they become adults. But I don't know if I'd be a good father or if I'd be happy with or without kids. I don't want my kids to inherit my anxiety, depression, visual snow, and narcissism. But what about my girlfriend? What if I grow up and regret not having kids and I'm lonely? What if I did have kids and they turned out just fine and didn't inherit my health issues?

I was an asshole for the last 10 years. I was narcissistic to the point that it destroyed friendships and harmed some people. I have so many regrets about the person I was in the past and I've only recently really realized just how terrible I've been and I've been making efforts to be kinder to everyone and spend more time connecting with people, but it's hard. I want to spend more time with people in person, but COVID makes that dangerous for everyone involved and I don't have great social skills because I've spent most of my time playing video games and not socializing as much as I think most people do and people are very busy, I don't have a group of friends I could meet with regularly in person. All of my current friendships are ones that take place mostly online, even though we know each other in person. 

I really love video games, and I enjoy them in the moment most of the time, but when I look back on my life I feel a lot of regret that I think may have been lessened if I had a lot more variety of experience. But I don't know what to do to make my life feel more fulfilling and give myself and others those fondly memorable experiences. I think that having a lot of experiences in life will make life feel longer in the sense that it would help alleviate the feeling of time flying by and waking up going ""where'd all the time go?""

I always wanted to learn piano and maybe even some other instruments like saxophone, guitar, and bass. 

I also want to make a video game before I die and maybe pursue game development as a career.

I just have so much that I want to do and I don't have the motivation, drive, and mental health to achieve them and the clock is constantly ticking. There's also big life choices I have to make now that will impact myself, my girlfriend, and possibly future kid's and I just don't feel ready to make those decisions. I can never be younger than I am now again and it hurts a lot. I've been waking up with panic attacks regularly now about all kinds of things, but aging is a big one. How do I overcome my regret of my past, how do I make a better future? How do I cope with aging? How do I feel like time isn't passing me by and enjoy it all? What do I do?",01Sep2020,1

53,"Hi everyone,

It’s my first time using this subreddit so I hope I haven’t broken any rules. I’m a 26 year old male and through no lack of trying, I’ve been single all my life. I’ve dated girls for 3-4 months here and there but it’s never worked out in the long run, I’ve either never felt a proper connection with them and ended it, or been really into them and have had things ended on me. 

It happened again two days ago. I reconnected with an old colleague via Instagram a few weeks ago and we just hit it off straight away, flirting, laughing, non-stop texting, never a dull moment via text or when we played Xbox together. She’s 10 years older than me, but it didn’t concern me in the slightest, I just felt that connection, that level of comfort with her  immediately, she told me that the age gap didn’t bother her either. We had arranged a date for a few weeks from now as we both work full time and have very busy weekends, and also future dates should our first one go well! So it was all long distance until that date.

I had just never felt a connection like this with a person in years. When i got a message and it wasn’t her I’d be annoyed! I was absolutely glued to my phone and could only think of her. Fast forward a few weeks to now, we’re still flirting heavily, gaming together every night, constantly texting whilst we both work until it gets to 1am last night, I get a message ending it. She says I’m amazing and will make a great boyfriend for someone lucky enough to have me, but she’s had a “revelation” and decided she’s not ready for a relationship. 

To tell you the honest truth I’m absolutely devastated. I felt as though this is the first person in a long time that I’d truly been 100% my dorky self to, and that she was totally into me. Telling me how amazing I was, how handsome I was, and it was all mutual, I was so attracted to her looks and her personality, she had me laughing constantly. I’d never felt something so strongly for someone in such a short amount of time, only for it to just be ended out of nowhere. I feel stupid, angry, like i should reach out and try to change her mind, or that I’m not good enough for anyone and never will be. I just feel like this cycle of nearly-relationships just won’t end, and almost feel like I need someone that’s not a relative or close friend to tell me they’ve experienced something similar and that theirs light at the end of the tunnel. That I’ll finally find my fish in the sea.

Again, I apologise if this is in the wrong subreddit, but as of right now i’m a broken man and just can’t pick myself up from the slump this time. 

So any and all advice on how to move on from this, how to pick myself up from this slump and get some self esteem again would be great. 

Thank you.",01Sep2020,1
54,"My (42f) sister (47f) is in an abusive relationship and can’t seem to give the guy up.

She moved to a different state to be with him and things were already rocky before she moved to be with him. They’ve been together for 3 years

He has now escalated to waking her up in the night drunk out of his mind to call her names. He is verbally abusive to her and has completely isolated her financially and by location. He does not like when she talks to me because I have made it clear that I don’t approve of his behaviour.

He is a vindictive drunk and angry at the world and using her as his verbal punching bag. I am sure she doesn’t tell me everything he has done and what he calls her. 

She found out he cheated on her and was telling people they weren’t together. She also found out that he had cheated with a girl that he claimed was a friend. 

She has now at least decided to leave but this was a long process to get her to finally go. She moved back home with family a few months ago.

We have all spent money to get her away and spent countless hours supporting her.

She is now telling me they speak everyday and he keeps asking when she is coming back. She says she asks him have you stopped drinking yet? Drinking is really not this guy’s only issue. He is a three time divorcee that claims ALL of his exes were crazy. 

He sells drugs, he is racist, verbally abusive (not physical yet, so she says)

She is really considering going back to him. I am at my wits end, her life has been such a stress for me and we live thousands of miles away from each other. 

He has nothing to offer other than money and abuse. Can someone please explain the mindset here. I am trying to empathize and sympathize but I am sad and disappointed that she would allow someone to treat her that way and now contemplate going back. 

I am beyond frustrated and scared for her future. Any advice you can offer to navigate this please I am all ears.  I love her so much and I don’t want to lose her.

Basically my freshman year of college I had a teacher for philosophy and he'd email me. I'll be honest he was pretty weird but I was into that. He reminded me a lot of someone I talked too when I was younger. Anyway, we'd email each other back and forth like text messages. I didn't think much of it at the time. I'll be hones, me being nineteen at the time, I was really into it. He was young and handsome as well. He was early thirties. We kind of flirted back and forth except I didn't think that was flirting at the time, and he supposedly had a girlfriend/wife so I didn't take it that serious because cheating is pretty fucked. Later that month I eventually started   dating my current boyfriend, so I tried to put that teacher thrill to the back of my mind. Within that period he offered to buy my alcohol to drink in his broom closet of an office.

 As it slowly got weirder I   became more sarcastic but I fear I wasn't sarcastic enough cause eventually he'd ask, ""Fuck why are so cute?"" that's when I started to panic. Within the days after that, I ended up reporting hime he was also talking to other students and found out he talked to students the year before I started too. I mean after that I felt so gross with my self and realized the danger in this problem, I wish no girl had to deal with, so I reported him. Within the year and now, I always feel anxious when I pass the building with the office in it or his favorite bar near campus. I have this scary thought in the back of my head what if he came to hurt me or worse in retaliation. Naturally with the title nine process, he got a slap on the wrist. I still think back on it frequently, there's like this want in me for closure I guess, that or the one man I talked to when I was younger. Either way, this teacher goes through my mind frequently. Everyone tells me he is in the wrong and I know that but alway ponder if I really wanted to do that or I was in the wrong. so now I think I miss him or I want to do things with him even though it's far from the truth cause I have a boyfriend. The situation reminds me a lot of the end of episode 5 of Tuca and Bertie if you've seen that show. I don't know to properly feel and cope I guess? Idk advice would be helpful too.

62,"I'm a nothing. I don't anything but I wish I could know everything. I think my social skills are undeveloped. I mean I have a few friends but I don't know how to be like them or communicate with them. Ive always believe that everyone is good at something, that's not my case. I'm studying philosophy at college but I think is to difficult for me, I know nothing about Kant or Platon or any other relevant philosophers. I think I know something about Ludwig Wittgenstein however I really don't know anything or understand it. I wish I was clever enough to study mathematics or physics or at least to be better in philosophy.
I wish I had learn to play an instrument like the piano.  I really like classical music but I don't think I understand the meaning behind every note because I didn't learn how to read music or understand it. Rachmaninoff is my favorite followed by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Bach, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. I try to hide this passion because I don't think the people will like it. I wish I could be like my friends so I could be a better friend to them. Ive always wish to be as clever and creative like Bach, Mozart, Godel or Newton. I have a lot of anxiety when people do something unexpected or when they are invited to my house because I fear they will disorder everything.

The only thing I really want now is change my life but I don't think it's possible. Every day my time is fleeing out of my hands I have the sensation that I'm falling into and endless pit unable to do anything. Every time I look into the future I remember my shameful past making me living the present in a strange and indescriptible pain. I want to be alone but I don't want to be lonely. I don't want to die but I don't want to exist anymore.

66,"hello fellow Redditors,  So my 55 year old mother has had Facebook for many years. She’s a typical mother who shares old memes and “like if you love your kids” etc...  

The issue is, mother ignorantly shares posts that could come off as offensive, tone-deaf or sometimes too personal. I’m an adult and I feel embarrassed about it. She is a sweet lady who definitely does not intend to hurt anyone. 

For example, I saw her share an “ALM” post which shocked me. After asking her about it I found out she did not understand the concept and impact of this statement and she quickly removed the post. I researched and had a long discussion with her to help educate her about the current affairs. She hasn’t shared anything relating to it since.

71,"The other night (Saturday), my wife and I were at my mother-in-laws house. My brother-in-law was there and was asking us about our home gym. We told him we don’t use it anymore and he offered to buy it all off of us. I said “I guess, what do you think is a good price?” He said “$400 for everything” I hesitated for a second and my wife said “yeah that’s good” so I reluctantly said “okay $400 seems good as we don’t even touch it.” He immediately sent me money for it (it was about $150 because they were going to split the cost amongst the household)

We then got home and saw that everything is selling currently for triple what we paid for it. We called him today to back out of the deal because it’s just so much money that we’d be losing out on. He said that it was no problem and that it was okay. He said they already have a good amount of equipment, this stuff was just going to complete his home gym.

Part of me feels like a huge asshole for backing out, but he did say it was ok. I just hate when money gets in between things; I’m not a sleazy, greedy person but the fact that we could sell this for money that we really need makes it acceptable to have backed out. I’m going to send him his money back shortly but I just wanted some input on if I did the right thing or not?",01Sep2020,1
72,"My gf of 1 year and I are generally happy. We are both high schoolers, and things are changing a lot recently. She left the friend group we initially mutually met through and now has new friends she met through the school's cross country team. I try to be very supportive even though I don't get along well with her friends. Her friends' humor is pretty crude and they aren't the crowd I want to be with. One day, her friend joked in front of several guys in the friend group that they should stick a lacrosse stick up my gf's vagina to save space. Most of them drink or smoke or both, and she has never tried anything like that. My gf has expressed that she wants to try things and I'm trying to be accepting of drinking or smoking despite my disagreement. We've had several big fights over the last few months involving her best friend Audrey. First big fight was when we all went out together so I could meet her friends. We went to ihop and the mall to go shopping. She acted very differently around them and it wasn't the same person I knew and loved. She swore a lot more, she made crude and flirty jokes with Audrey in front of 3+ other guys while I was there. It was far out of my comfort zone, but she said she didn't think that was who she really was and that she wants us to be together more than anything. I accepted that this will be what she does and tried to move on. Another few weeks of being happy, until one day this same group of friends comes over to her house to swim in her pool. I chose not to go. That night, Audrey kissed my gf on the lips. My gf was honest about it and told me, but I was still hurt and sad that it happened. Again, we both cried, but decided to put it in the past and talked about our limits and boundaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

That brings me to last night. About a week ago, my gf and I were out at a park when she mentioned that Audrey may be bringing her and a few other girl friends to drink (underage in the US as Audrey and my gf are both 17) at her house. We had talked about wanting to drink for the first time together, but she told me ""If the opportunity came up would you say no?"" I told her that I was not very happy about her decision but she convinced me that she'd be okay and would snap me a lot. Fast forward to last night. She is over at Audrey's with two other friends who bring alcohol. She snaps me and tells me about her drinking for the first time and how she ""didn't feel it at all."" Fast forward 30 minutes, and she's acting very drunk over snap. I asked her if she was buzzed and she said she was ""a little more than buzzed."" Soon she makes a group chat and I get a snap from Audrey with a picture of them both in the bathroom saying they peed. Then when I asked my gf about it she responded with a video of Audrey drunkenly saying something along the lines of ""Don't worry I didn't see her vagina I like more masculine people anyway."" Meanwhile I'm freaking out, and I can't focus at all, but I tried to act normal so she could have a fun time. She wasn't acting like the girl I knew and loved. That night she snapped me and said she loved me but I couldn't tell if she was still drunk or not. I told her to go to bed and she said she wouldn't sleep until I said I loved her. I told her we could talk when the alcohol was gone, and she kept insisting she thought she was sober.

Today is the next day, and I'm seriously considering breaking up with her. I feel sick when I see a reddit post about alcohol, I dislike any TikToks that feature alcohol, and I cried earlier today watching a ""Worth It"" video where they tasted wine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I hated it so much. I feel like I fell in love with a different girl than she's becoming. I love the girl I met but I can't say I love the girl she's becoming. I've been trying to tell her that she'd be happier alone so she could be free without me dragging her down, and that she didn't do anything wrong by drinking that night. She keeps insisting that she did something wrong and that she wasn't in control and she wasn't having fun and she doesn't ever want to drink again. I've been trying to tell her it's not true.

&amp;#x200B;

She wants to try and stay together and figure it out, but I don't know if it's worth it. I feel like I make her sad because I disagree with who she wants to be. I'm always the one keeping her in check and telling her no when her friends tell her to do things like drinking. I just know that if I hold on it'll probably come back sooner or later and hurt even worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice I'm looking for is two answers:

\- Should I try to make it work? We've been together a year now, and we've had lots of good times. I feel like I love her and she loves me, but when she acts differently I just don't see her the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

\- How can I become more accepting of her wanting to drink or do drugs or make crude jokes? I feel like I just fundamentally can't get along with that type and I don't know why. Just seeing her drink almost makes me think less of her.",01Sep2020,1

82,"I have a friend that has been a real struggle to deal with. Here is the background:

I’ve been friends with this person since 3rd grade and while we weren’t best friends, we were more than ready to hang out and play games. For this post, I’ll call him J. As we went to high school, J slowly became friends with another person that I’m also friends with, call him A. A and I have also been friends since 3rd grade and we’ve been quite close for awhile. At this moment, I had no problems with them being friends because they were friends before. However, as time grew on, J became more than just a friend to A. He became, what I call, a minion to A regardless that A didn’t want that to happen. The more derogatory term for this that others may know is a d***rider. At first, it was little things like siding with A even though A was wrong. However, after a few years of their “friendship”, it became much more apparent and volatile. At this point, J was saying that people were just jealous of his friendship with A, calling him sir (yes, this is real), and always doing what A tells him to do without any thought. Along with this, he began to become more prepared to drop everyone else in order to preserve their friendship. Another thing that became a real struggle to deal with was his change in personality when A was near him. Without A, he was a chill person who just played games and had fun, but the second A comes into the discord, he becomes aggressive against everyone and begin to show a ridiculous amount of cockiness and hostility. My guess is that he wants to impress A, but that’s merely a guess. With all of this, I have noticed it for a long time. However, very recently, it feels like all of this has been magnified 100 fold to the point where everyone that hung out with him have begun to notice and are distancing themselves from him. After this began to happen, he ultimately distanced himself from everyone by leaving all group chats and discord servers we had with him in it.

With that all said, I ask if there is really anything I can and should do? I don’t know if there is anyway to save this friendship because of how much toxicity and hostility that occurs when A is near J to the point where he becomes an extremely unlikable person. It’s taken a toll on friendships as the group has begun to question who is at fault and if this was avoidable. Any advice would help.",01Sep2020,1
83,"I'll make this as quick as I can. Two of my best friends I've known for like 4ish years, but they've never met. Friend A is someone I met online and Friend B I met at university.Since I'm always talking about one friend to the other, they really wanted to meet each other, so I set up a group chat last night.

Cue to today, where Friend B is angrily discussing family drama. She has a half-black sister who's part of her family drama, and all other times before she would complain about how shitty her half-sister is because of her actions. But no, now it was about black people in general are shitty. Some truly awful stuff. I quickly go to PM and tell her that this won't fly with Friend A, and she states some more awful opinions. Stuff like how BLM is bad because black people only care about themselves, and how they're all greedy and... yeah it ain't good.

Here's the thing: Friend B is not white, not in the slightest. Obviously she's not black either, but I won't mention what ethnicity she is here because I think its counterproductive to do so. This is especially shocking because otherwise, Friend B is pretty liberal - very pro-gay, trans, other races of people, etc. Also why does she think within 24 hours of meeting someone is an appropriate time to drop that kind of bombshell?

Friend A is horrified and left the group chat, and I totally understand. On the one hand, I really don't want to be friends with someone who's very stubbornly, openly racist. On the other hand I could still keep our close friendship but try to educate her. But here's the thing - a few times before, she would sometimes say things that were more... uneducated than hateful, and I would chastise her for it. This is a whole other ballpark.

If this was a regular acquaintance, or even a regular friend, I'd drop them in a heartbeat. But Friend B is very close to not only me, but my family as well, and beyond this VERY GLARING ISSUE shes very friendly, loyal, caring, etc. To Friend B, she thinks our different views is not enough to sever friendships over, but I'm stunned.

I've first posted this on r/offmychest

I'm new to Reddit that's why I still learning it I just want to talk to people and get good advice to them.

Ok before I started I would like to tell you that I'm not a native english speaker, I don't hate woman, and I'm not sexist!!

The reason is my past experience. One night I'm on the way home after school I usually take jeepney (as a form of transport because it's cheaper than bus) and when I'm inside I'm about to sit the driver stepped at the gas pedal, therefore I lose my balance I accidentally grabbed a woman's leg she started to act hysterically she keeps saying ""he grabbed my leg, he touched me! He touched me"" and some of them on the jeepney started filming me with there phone, I keep defending myself and said "" I fell I didn't mean to do it, it was an accident"" but she keep trowing bunch of mean words at me and the other passenger said ""take him to jail so he can learn his lesson"" I was shaking, I'm so scared, I don't know what to say so I just decided to keep quiet and wait until she reaches here destination. (This happened when I was 17)

Then it happen to me again in the bus (I take bus because all jeepneys are full so I don't have a choice) all seats are full so we are required to stand I was holding into a pole (so I won't fall) when i notice that the bus isn't moving due to heavy traffic I decided to get my phone to tell my parents that I'm on the way home, then the bus driver stepped on the gas pedal it was so strong that I didn't manage to grab the pole then I out balanced and I accidentally bumped into her, same thing happened she over reacted that's why she gained attention of the other passengers, and they started filming me! And one of the guys threatened me he said he will beat me up for what I did, I was so scared I keep defending myself but they don't believe me so I decided to move out of the bus and take a different bus. (This happened when I was 19)
Because of that I became afraid of woman/girls, I can't stand close to them or sit next to them I feel like they're gonna put me in danger.
I can talk to my female friend I'm comfortable when I'm with them, but if it's a stranger or if I didn't know the girl I'm not comfortable. I'm getting back flash for what happened.",01Sep2020,1

87,"I grew up with cats my whole life and it always felt like an essential part of life. When I was a teen, I was very suicidal and adopting a cat saved my life (he no longer lives with me though). I've since left for college and my first three years without cats was tough but manageable. My mental health has not been ideal, but I've been able to handle it for the most part. Since the pandemic started, though, my mental health has declined again and I'm getting pretty close to rock bottom, largely because of things beyond my control (lost my main job, can't see my friends, hold-ups in important legal proceedings etc.). I see a therapist and a psychiatrist quite regularly, and every time I mention to my therapist that I miss my old cat, she suggests that I adopt or foster another cat. I know that this would be really good for my mental health and would bring structure and purpose to my life. I'm on a one year lease at the moment until next August, and I asked my landlord and she's ok with it (for a minimal extra cost). BUT one of my roommates is allergic to cats and when I mentioned the idea of fostering, he said no. I brought it up a few days later and said that the cat would only be in my (pretty big) bedroom or outside, never in common areas, and that I'd get an air purifier. He still was pretty set in not wanting to have a cat in the house. I waited a week and brought it up again and said that we could just try it out and that I could look into returning/finding another home for the cat if the situation became unlivable for my roommate. He said he'd think about it and get back to me - that was two weeks ago. I'm not sure how many more times I can bring it up or what else I can say to convince my roommate. I obviously don't want to risk his health, but I also need to look after my mental health. Does anyone have any ideas of conversations I could have with him or should I just give up and accept that I won't have a cat for the next year? If I should just give up, does anyone have suggestions for something that would maybe bring as much purpose to my life as a living being?

I got into a big fight with my mom yesterday, she wanted me to help her paint her room but I made plans while I was at work and so I told my mom I’d help her out later. My friend came over and we were taking a break when my mom called me over to her she yelled at me saying that I was inconsiderate and only help her when it’s convenient for me. She then went on to say that I am her first priority and that she is never mine. I went to apologize the night of, and she then ignored me and didn’t say anything until this afternoon. She came into my room and apologized for yelling at me but said that I was disrespectful and wanted to put on a show for my friend. However that is not the case and i told her that “it was not my intention to put on a ‘show’ for my friend, and I believe I have a right to stand up for myself when I’m being yelled at.” She then said that it made her feel like shit I yelled at her and she just felt like I didn’t care, she then started to say that i never help her out when asked. I believe that I do and told her that, i said that she can’t just ignore me for a long time and if she was to then she could’ve said that she needed time. I then said that she didn’t act like the adult and she said “so I’m a terrible mother” i said “I never said that” but she continued to say that that’s what I think. She told me to take some responsibility and realize that she did not deserve to be yelled at/ disrespected. I apologized for not communicating because it was wrong on my part but she kept harping on the fact that i should’ve helped and told me that I knew it was a big thing. However she neglected to tell me she was even painting and needed help until I was already home and had made plans. I was overwhelmed with anger and sadness because she seemed to had made me feel as it was my fault so I did harm myself. I feel as though I don’t get to be angry because my family did adopt me and that I’m in the wrong. I do acknowledge that I didn’t communicate well, but I don’t feel the need to apologize for standing up for myself. Am I in the wrong? Or should I feel bad?",01Sep2020,1

We have not had sex and I’m going to be honest I’m really scared to. He told me he got HPV in high school and had a procedure to remove the warts. Then in 2016, he contracted genital HSV-1.

I’m trying to think of a way I can move forward in this but it also makes me wonder where this persons moral compass points. I know shit happens, but I practice safe sex measures and like I said I’m trying to remain non judge-mental because he could’ve just not told me. 

He also told me he has not had a breakout in 4 years with both of these viruses. He does not take antiviral meds and has had unprotected sex with past partners and said they have not shown up with either symptom. Which I don’t know if I believe.

Disclosure: I know this may come off as me being judgy, mean, or whatever else anyone on here wants to call me. But this is about my health and my life, so I’ll protect it all costs.

So my company just emailed out to a large part of the company a “Potential Opportunity for Voluntary Separation”. I am only four years into this career /work site so this process and email is both new and frightening to myself . My current section of the company within the IT support area is already a thin group compared to the rest of the groups so many colleagues don’t seem to think it will affect us. I was told this is usually geared to entice those nearing retirement or already looking to leave soon to do so and take the severance package I guess I am just trying to gather my thoughts and also not panic over this email . Sorry for the long post I just haven’t went through something like this before . I am the youngest and newest member within my team (4 years at 33 years old) compared to people who have 30+ years and average 46-72.  Should this worry me , as I’m not in a place where taking this would be good for me given my short time here and age . 







Some excerpts from the message below ; some info removed due to company privacy .


“As the evaluation of potential efficiencies and synergies associated with centralizing certain functions and changing some processes continues, it is becoming clear that some reduction in force will be warranted.

Therefore, in keeping with our long-standing commitment to provide as much job security as practicable in our highly competitive sector, we want to minimize involuntary reductions in force to the extent possible by offering general and administrative employees in the business units, shared services and corporate the opportunity to express a preference for voluntary separation from *company*. You are receiving this communication because you currently work in an organization that is eligible for this voluntary preference process.
 
We recognize that this offering may be surprising to most of you and stressful for some. Depending on individual circumstances, however, it can be a significant win-win, as employees who prefer to leave have the opportunity to express their preference and thereby provide greater clarity as to what positions will be available for those who desire to stay. We want to be able to consider employee preferences in making personnel decisions related to the efficiency project. This offering is a key component of management’s planning for a right-sized organization, and we anticipate that you and your eligible colleagues will take it very seriously.
 
To be clear, any expression of a preference is not a guarantee. Your management may be committed to your participation in their new organization. Further, while your management may be in a position in the near future to accommodate your preference, they may need your assistance during a transition period that could last for some time into 2021. We have asked leaders to refrain from giving specific advice to individual employees because this is your opportunity to express your preference based on your personal circumstances.”

Because the expression of preferences for voluntary separation may have a substantial impact on staffing decisions, we are asking anyone who wishes to express their preference for voluntary separation to send a confidential email that includes your full name and employee ID to ———- by close of business on September 18. You do not need to respond if you are not interested in taking advantage of the voluntary separation opportunity. Determining whether to take advantage of a voluntary separation is obviously a significant decision, and we encourage employees to consider the opportunity in consultation with their families and, if applicable, their financial advisor. From a management perspective, receiving that information by that date will enable leaders to make judicious employment decisions, including whether your preference will be accepted, as part of their overall reorganizational activities during the month of October. Management will be communicating organizational changes and all employment decisions in early November.”

It then goes onto list the severance information and such.

Always seen as the short quiet white kid in classes and can't really escape this image people have of me.

101,"Without getting too deep into details, me and my siblings are on the rocks right now due to my mental health. It has gotten worse over the COVID thing, and quarantine has been no help.

I used to be really close to them, but over the months, I’ve been growing suspicious of them and over analyzing every emotion, action, or word they say to me. I’ve been locking them out of my room. I’ve been keeping conversations limited with them. Why?

Because I think they’re out to get me. No solid reason why. My brain thinks that they’ve been conspiring to get me because they’re jealous of me or something, or that they never liked me in the first place.

So I’ve been escaping them and not taking to them. My oldest sibling is the one I fear the most, because she suffers depression but prefers to not seek help or better herself. I feared she was going to do something and lead my other siblings to do it too.

I love my siblings. Telling them this news would break their hearts. Is there any way to treat this paranoia so I can reconnect with them? I really don’t want to drive us all apart because of my issues.",01Sep2020,1
102,"I'm gonna be a senior in high school in a couple of days. Quarantine gave me a lot of time to really think about my past. And theres a lot from my past that I'm not proud of.

Mostly its been about things that I've done, and missed opportunities that I've had. I wish I had gotten myself more involved in wrestling or boxing or a combat sport of some sort, and work hard at something athletically instead of just studying all the time. I wish I had done JROTC earlier in high school, because I'm finding myself getting interested in joining the military after college, and getting myself involved in ROTC. I wish I had done more smart kid stuff (reading books, learning more skills, working more, etc), instead of doing dumb kid stuff (goofing off on dating sites, acting weird/dumb around crushes, playing video games, etc), and going into my senior year of high school, I feel as though I have wasted my life.

Another thing that has been on my mind was the fact that I was treated badly. I never had any drama freshman and sophomore year, but junior year I've had a huge falling out with some of my peers. One of them embarrassed me, and this other one made a video making fun of me. I confronted them both and had a huge falling out with them. The kids who I don't like are a very small percentage of everyone who I see on a daily basis. However, it sucks that not everyone in this world is happy being around me.

Another thing that bothers me is my weird relationship with my parents. A couple of months ago, I had a huge fight with them over grades. They wouldn't believe me when I tell them that I'm trying my best, and they kept yelling at me and comparing me to other kids. I hated them so much. However, they also bought me a computer, phone, and car, and even helped me open a debit card and get a part time job, and I love them. Its weird. Its like some times I really like them and other times I really hate them, and I feel spoiled like shit.

I have a 3.8 GPA and a 1340 SAT score, and I'm underachieving academically. I know people who have GPAs above 4.0 and higher SAT scores.

Overall, I feel very frustrated with myself because I hate my past, both because of ways I acted and ways others have acted towards me. I keep dwelling over my past over and over and over again, over missed opportunities, over how I should've busted my ass more and worked harder, about how maybe if I did more smart kid stuff, then I could've avoided drama with peers.

103,"My friend (19F) is very to herself and not outgoing whatsoever. She has a lot of anxiety and is shy. Not super shy but she’s a moderate shy. But she complains about opportunities she’s missed out on, especially in high school. Although she does this, she appreciates her close friends (which is just me and my other friend). We’re all very super close and we constantly talk about going to parties (before COVID obviously) and how we want to take trips to different places. She has a very narrow comfort zone and encourages us to help her with it. So we make these plans but she ends up bailing on us. I’ve tried to get her out of her comfort zone many many many times. I even send her inspirational and tell her things like “we all make mistakes”, “we’re young, live in the moment” , “we’re all gonna die one day”, or “dont take life so seriously” ... BTW: we’re both very blunt people, so the “we’re all gonna die one day” phrase is not something sensitive or scary to her.

108,"I know it’s a bad title but I can’t think of a better one. I did post this to a different place but I need some kind of advice. For some background, I’m 15F living with my grandmother, her boyfriend (it’s complicated. I can’t really properly explain) youngest uncle, and grandfather.


I wouldn’t really call it “extorting” since he pays me back eventually but my youngest uncle asks me for money when my grandmother won’t give him any. He currently owes me $260. I know it may sound stupid but I cannot say no to whenever he asks because he pressures me into giving it to him even though without fail every time I tell him that I’ll get yelled at for it by my grandmother later on. He only tells me that I won’t when literally five to ten minutes later she comes storming into my room demanding why I gave him money. 

I honestly don’t want to be in between my youngest uncle and my grandmother when it comes to money because I shouldn’t have to be. My family is emotionally abusive and likes to attack me for no reason. I cut off my mother and oldest uncle (I have 3) because of them lying to my grandmother just to get me in trouble. There’s obviously a lot more things they’ve done but I don’t want to make this thread too long. I’ve grown tolerable to the things that they put me through but now I’m getting to a breaking point.

My youngest uncle accuses me of telling her that he’s asking me for money whenever she confronts him about it but she can obviously tell he’s getting money from somewhere and she knows that I’ve given him money in the past so she automatically connects the dots that he’s getting money from me. 

My grandmother then accuses me of willingly giving him my money when that’s not even the case. Like I said before, I am not able to say no because like he also does to my grandmother he pressures us into giving him the money. 

Today (8/31/20) for instance, he comes into my room while I’m on call with my ex (he unfortunately knows how my family is) playing Xbox and asked me for some more money and I only had $40 left in my wallet since he still owed me money. My youngest uncle would not stop hounding me for the money and I got to the point where I threw my controller against my dresser, hung up on my ex so I could spare him listening to the argument even more, grabbed my wallet and threw it at my youngest uncle saying that he could have it. He only took $40 and gave me back my wallet before leaving.

I’m waiting for him to pay me back the money he owes me before telling him that I’m not giving him anymore but I know he’s going to try and pressure me again. What should I do? I’m at my breaking point because I can’t handle this anymore. I lied to him before saying that my grandmother took my wallet but then she drunkenly tells him that I still have it. My grandmother has called the police on him for doing this before but they did not do anything about it.",01Sep2020,1
109,"So, I’ve experienced brain zaps for over 20 years now. I am almost 100% positive that they first appeared as a withdrawal symptom, from stopping my SSRI cold turkey. Since then, though, I have experienced them intermittently, both when on prescription meds (or withdrawing from) and when I’m not on any meds. There’s little to no research on them but from what I gather, they aren’t dangerous. The only thing that somewhat concerns me is that occasionally they cause possible episodes of psychosis for me. 

This only ever happens when I’m having brain zaps while just drifting off to sleep. It’s really, really hard to explain but somehow I end up seeing two of myself and I’m unable to determine which body is actually my body. So because I don’t know which body is mine, I lose the ability to control myself and I go into this like sleep paralysis. And it’s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. And during this, I’m imagining myself moving and it’s so realistic that I “forget” about my actual body, laying paralyzed in bed. And then it becomes scary again when I remember that part. This cycle occurs several times, until I can overpower the hallucination enough to will my physical body to open its eyes. 

Is it even possible to be aware of your own psychosis? Or does the fact that I am aware of these episodes automatically reduce it to something less than psychosis??",01Sep2020,1

It was as if I wasn’t doing anything in the game, but I was just there and they were having to explain everything to me instead of having fun. It made me feel really dumb and like I was a loner in a group of people. I had a lot of fun, but I felt like I was dragging the hang out down. I don’t know if they’ll invite me back because I felt like a nuisance, but if they do, how do I not be so weird and isolated from the rest of the group?

113,"Hi. Obligatory I'm on mobile, and I've also never posted so I apologize if I do this wrong.

I need help and I don't know what to do. I (19F) am currently living with my mom and my brother, and things are extremely bad. I have not spoken to my ""father"" in years because he was physically, verbally, psychologically, and emotionally abusive so that's why he is not in the picture, and they have been divorced since I was very young. 

My mom, and her side of the family are all in the process of trying to make a huge move to another state, and as I cannot be in school rn due to covid and mental health reasons, I am expected to go with them. I'm terrified of that happening. I can't be forced to stay with her anymore. Things are continuously getting worse, and I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. 

Every single day she is telling me how I'm the cause of all of her problems, how I'm stupid, lazy, annoying. She screams at me at the top of her lungs, puts me down, shames me, criticizes me, is incredibly aggressive, says horrible things about me behind my back, and so much more. I'm just trying to keep me and my two pets safe and healthy, and every day she gets more aggressive and I need to get out of this situation. I'm really scared of what the future holds, especially in a new state. I try so hard to explain how I feel and to just sit down and have conversations at these things but nothing has worked, she won't listen. She's just so angry all of the time and takes everything out on me. 

I'm just trying to protect myself and my pets. I need us to be safe and healthy. I am suffering with my mental health and have already been in the hospital because of it this year, and I just want to be able to get myself better, to go to school, and to hopefully someday be happy. After evaluation, it was deemed that I am likely autistic as well, and it's really upsetting when she says that I'm stupid and that I can't communicate properly and all of these other things because I'm trying my best, it's just hard. I'm sorry if this seems stupid, especially in comparison to some other things, but I decided it's time to ask for help. 

I'm sorry this is so long.

I don’t want to leave this job off because it correlates directly with the position I am applying for. I also don’t want to leave it off or I will have a 2.5 year job gap. However, I know I will go through a background check for this position. I am under the impression the agency will be able to see I did not receive paychecks from my family members company. Am I assuming wrong? Not really sure what to do in this situation. Any knowledge, advice, help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Is it crazy to list it as volunteer work or paid internship?",01Sep2020,1
123,"Pretty much what the title says. This may be pretty long as I mostly just want to vent, so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

TW: Death and some talk about blood and body

A little background; my grandpa and grandma are my dad and aunt's mother and father. My pap used to be a giant drunk (though in the past decade he's been a much better person to everyone else, but still a jerk) and for most of my father's life, so close to 40 years he's pretty much been a raging asshole to my grandmother. Very verbally abusive and for whatever reason she could never leave him. She was such a saint though...But he would constantly be yelling at her, never hit her, but I know he truly didn't intend to kill or even hurt her in this freak accident.

Anyway, I got two missed calls from my aunt on August 30th, and answered the third one at exactly 9am... I had gotten home from a weekend of back to back 16 hour shifts and just got out of the shower. My aunt was hysterical and said, ""You need to come down here right now, gram got hit by a truck."" It was hard to understand her, but once I realized my boyfriend grabbed me into a hug while I cried for a minute (phone was loud enough for him to hear). I calmed down long enough to get dressed and we rushed out the door. On the way to my aunt's I stayed calm and just kept telling myself she's okay. She probably got banged up pretty bad, maybe a few broken ribs and other bones, but she'll pull through. Everything will be okay. It'll go back to being a normal Sunday.

As ashamed as I am to admit it, a very small part of me hoped maybe it was my mom's mom (I love her just as much, but my paternal grammy was just always around more and we had a special bond as I was her first grandbaby and everyone in the family said me being born just brought this woman back to life and gave her a reason to keep living). Still ashamed of myself for this thought though.

Well we got to my aunt's and there were so many people out front...Cop cars, two or three fire trucks and all the nosey neighbors. We had to go around the back of her house where most of the family was. My uncle and two younger cousins came over to us crying...My uncle has never once cried for as long as I've known him and I'm 20 years old. I asked my one cousin where Grammy was and she said they had her out front covered up. Still didn't believe it, but in the back of my mind I knew. So I go inside my aunt's and she's by the front door talking to an officer giving a statement. When she's done she walks me towards the back door and I start crying a little asking if grandma was alright. She started bawling and said, ""She's dead"". I just screamed no and dropped to my knees while she tried getting me up to go outside. I kept begging her to tell me she was lying and that gram is okay. That was the worst news of my life. 

I guess my grandpa had been trying to move my dad's work truck and didn't really know what he was doing and floored it hitting my grandmother on the porch below my aunt's window. At first I said I hated him (not to his face obviously I'm not a monster) and that I hope he lives the rest of his life knowing what he did and how he treated her.
I called my mom (my parents and siblings were in ocean City as a spur of the moment trip last week) to ask if he was told to be in daddy's truck. She said that pap was asked to move it so his friend could look at it and fix it as it had been acting up. He hit my grandmother on my aunt's porch because daddy always turns the wheels to the right when he parks it there because her driveway is at an angle (my dad and uncle work together, so that's why it's always there).

My pap and gram come to my aunt's house every single morning and a few times in the day after. Usually Grammy just goes inside my aunt's literally every day to go pee, but today she decided to sit on the porch....So when my pap went to move the truck he didn't realize what he was doing and accidentally floored it and it smashed my gram into the brick wall, actually pushed the brick in as the drywall broke inside the house. They had her body covered up right under the window so when I peaked out I could see her covered body with blood coming from it... I'm glad I didn't see her actual body as a close family friend who's like another aunt said my gram had her arms in front of her face...she was bracing for impact...I was told by another aunt that my pap was hysterical and my uncle actually seen her body right after he hit it. He was the one who went to my aunt crying and saying he was sorry, but her dad accidently killed her mother...

I decided it really wasn't anyone's fault, just perfectly awful timing...Like some high power decided today was her day...I even told my pap that it wasn't his fault...He told his other daughter, who told me this, that he doesn't even want to live anymore and that it should have been him in the chair instead of her...I plan on talking to him tomorrow and letting him know that I forgive him for her death, and that it really isn't his fault because as mean as he was to her I have her heart, and know that I can't blame him for a freak accident. But I also feel that this is supposed to be his karma for how he was to her when she was alive because now he has to live with this...I just wish she didn't have to suffer...It also doesn't help that once when my boyfriend and I were arguing I became a spoiled middle schooler and under my breath said I hoped he got hit by a car...I instantly took it back, but that doesn't make it okay in the slightest. I was just being an awful person, and I feel like this may be some karma for me too..

I was even about to sign a lease on Tuesday for an apartment 3 houses up from her apartment and told her she'd be coming over more often so I could see her and hang out together all the time...I had so much free time for a while and couldn't be bothered to go see her because I was so caught up in my own selfishness and now I will never get to see, hear her laugh, or touch her again... I'd give my own life if it meant bringing her back even for just one day...I loved her more than anything. I seen her Thursday night when I had to get the key to my mom's to check on her dogs. Got to give her a hug and kiss, but that was the last time I'll ever see her. This hurts so fucking bad.

Oh and my aunt's house was deemed unsafe to live in by the fire department so her and her two older ones are staying with my pap tonight and my uncle and baby cousin are staying with my boyfriend and I. My family came back early from vaca obviously and brought my aunt and cousins to come see us. I was hugging my mom and my aunt comes over and for a less than a split second she looked like my gram and I got excited until I realized...

It hasn't completely set in that she's gone for good, and I just wish I'd wake up from this nightmare. Even though I tell myself she's really gone for good and I'll never see her again, I keep thinking that tomorrow she'll be calling or texting me about the dogs...I feel so lost and broken, I have SO many what ifs...What if she went inside? What if my pap never got into the truck? What if I called her after I got off of work? What if she never sat there? What if my family never went to vacation? What if the tires were never turned that way? What if they just went to see the dogs first and not to my aunt's?...Like my heart is empty with a gaping hole that I can never fill back up now...


TL;DR: My pap was asked to move my dad's truck from my aunt's driveway so his friend can look at it as it's been acting up. My daddy always turns his wheels to the right so the truck doesn't roll backwards. Every single day my gram goes inside my aunt's house to pee, but today she sat on the porch. My pap got into the truck and didn't know what he was doing and floored the truck smashing my grandmother into my aunt's brick wall and she died 3 mins later. He was an ass to her, but I know he truly didn't mean to kill or even hurt her and that this was some kind of freak accident. Now my aunt and her family can't stay home as the house was deemed unsafe and we have to figure out living arrangements for a while on top of the funeral. The absolute worst day of my fucking life, and I'm still in denial that she's actually gone for good.",01Sep2020,1
124,"Hey everyone. My partner and I recently both moved to Utah because I got a better job here in my career field. I am an environmental scientist just out of college, just starting out and it was really difficult for me to find a good job - the first one I got out of college I absolutely hated and searched every single day for about 9 months before I found my current job, which I love and it's an actual career path with the federal government. My partner is an artist for a video game and works entirely from home, so it was fairly easy for him to move with me to Utah and still keep his job, not much changed for him except our living situation. He has recently mentioned, what would happen if he loses his job once this game is done with and he has to find another art job and it ends up being somewhere else, just like I found my new job in Utah and we had to move for it. What would we do? I'm getting kind of anxious about it because I really don't know how couples in this modern age deal with this dilemma? I would obviously want to support him just like he has supported me with my new job, for my career. But would we have to live apart until I found something in the same area? How hard would that be? Would one of us just be out of work while looking for a job in the area? I would really appreciate any advice if any of you have experienced this with partners or spouses who also have careers. How do you balance both? How do you handle job opportunities for one where the other spouse has to sacrifice? I'm imagining a scenario where we either have to be long-distance, or I have trouble finding a job, or what if I have to leave my job that I really enjoy and like and get a job I don't like as much, just to accommodate his job opportunity. Obviously all of these things have no even happened yet so maybe it's silly to already worry about it, but I honestly don't know what we would do. I have no idea if my job will ever be 100% telework but I doubt it.",01Sep2020,1

128,"(Hi! Throughout this post I'll be calling this person I know John, just know that is NOT his real name, thank you.)

John always seems to care more about my beliefs in God, than I care about his. He's always going on, and on about how people who believe in God or are religious are nuts. 

Which I completely disagree. There is nothing wrong with believing in God and there's nothing wrong with not believing in him, we all have different mindsets and opinions so at the end of the day how does it affect your life? That's right! It doesn't. 

He also likes to say I get offended whenever he goes on about how God doesn't exist, but that's not the part that offends me. The part that offends me is when he calls me crazy... How does he not realize that? Smh

Just a few minutes ago John was going on another one of his rants about how God isn't real and everyone who believes that he is, is a nut job. So I asked him, ""So you think I'm a nut?"" And he stared at me for a moment and then eventually replied, ""Yes."" It wasn't in a joking way either he literally just called me a nut because I have different views than him. I told him, ""Look John, I don't care if you believe in God or not. Those are YOUR beliefs and I respect them so just leave mine alone."" That seemed to quiet him down and we carried out our normal conversation for bit.

For a moment I thought I had actually gotten through to him. I was so relieved! He may have finally realized that we can have different views and that doesn't make either of us crazy... But boy was I WRONG. As we were talking he just suddenly said, ""Yeah okay nut job."" Again... Not jokingly.

I did end up telling him that it seems like he cares more about my beliefs than I do his and he ended up going on a rant about science, and how God couldn't POSSIBLY be real. I ended up just calmly walking out of the room and left him be.

The sad part is... I rarely ever talk about god to him, or anyone really. I tend to keep that topic to myself.... But anyways, this sort of thing happens a lot and I just don't know how to stop it... How can I get it through to him that I don't care what he believes in? Or better, how do I get it through to him he shouldn't care about what I believe in? 

Advice on this would be greatly appreciated, because I just can't handle this anymore. Thank you.",01Sep2020,1
129,"I have two housemates who are my close friends at university. Before we broke up for the summer both my housemates were very worried about the virus and throughout the summer one was liking posts about how eveyone should socially distance and use a mask. I'm already slightly on edge about going back to uni but have now found out my housemates, who are already moved back in, are completely not socially distancing. One has her boyfriend from another city visiting and sleeping over as well as a friend from another city visiting and sleeping over. The other is having groups of about 8-10 people round our house all in our small living room/kitchen. 

To give context we are in the UK and the house is in an area where local lockdown is being applied currently. The official rules are that you can't have guests inside your house and can only meet in outdoor open spaces, like parks, 2 meters apart. 

I could make them comply to the rules whenever I'm living there and let them do whatever over the holidays. However, they're my friends and I don't wanna be the bad guy. Especially when they're missing out on things outside our house that don't impact me.

So, I thought I could meet in the middle and let them break the rules but not in our home. Like go meet round someone else's house but, that would still mean one housemate wouldn't be able to see her out of town boyfriend (she's not allowed round his as his mother doesn't let him have girls round (he's 25))

Or I could ask around some other friends at uni and move in somewhere else they would let me sleep on a blow up mattress in their basement for free. I think I may be an annoyance if I didn't pay for utilities or some kind of bills then. 
Does anyone have any options or suggestions? And does anyone know if any other UK university students are following the rules? I'm definitely not usually the uptight one.",01Sep2020,1

131,"My nephew is 6 years old and my sister's first child. She hasnt had much experience with children but her husband is a fairly absent parent and leaves her to do most of the hard work - and she does an amazing job. 

When my nephew was younger (around 3-4), my sister started to worry about some of hisbehaviours. I wont list them all, but many of them are linked with autism. His school, at the time, contacted my sister to say they had also identified some signs and wanted her to get him reviewed, but my mom (who thinks autism is fake) told her he needed discipline and that these things are normal. 

Now hes six, and many of those problems still remain, but new ones have also surfaced. He seems to put everything in his mouth - constantly. I spent two hours with him and saw him lick or bite almost everything that he touched, even toys he found outside in the ground that didnt belong to him and were dirty. My sister would repeatedly tell him to take them out of his mouth, but he just ignored her. My sister kept asking ""why does he do that all the time?"" He often doesnt respond when she speaks to him.

He is extremely hyperactive, throwing himself headfirst off of sofas and literally jumping everywhere. I've never met a child this hyper. Ever. He does not sit still. He climbs, rocks, chews, babbles, jumps, etc. He doesnt make much eye contact and his speech seems quite far behind for his age (imo). He knows lots of words but doesnt speak in sentences. He starts a question, then mumbles nonsense, and then finishes with a few words, e.g. ""Mommy, can...gjskfjamfjwlgjd...snack?""

Of course, some of these are normal kid behaviours but I'd like to mention to my sister that some of the behaviours hes showing could be autism and she should consider getting some support to see if he is, and how she can better understand him and his needs, but I'm afraid my mom may talk her out of it again and I dont want my sister to think I'm criticising her parenting.

It didnt increase in cost, it doesn't involve her, i dont need her permission, it is MY account, it doesnt affect her at all. I didnt tell her i changed it the day i changed it, because of it NOT AFFECTING HER, DOESNT CONCERN HER, DOESNT MATTER AT ALL. 

When i brought this to her attention tonight, again, unprovoked. She asked me:

Why didnt you tell me this before?

Me: i didnt know you needed to know?

Her: well you didn't tell me so you lied to me.

Me: how is me not telling you that i changed my own plan lying?

Her: because you didnt tell me when you did it, so youre hiding it from me.

Me: but im not hiding it from you, i literally just told you now. 

Her: yea but you didnt tell me before so youre hiding it from me. 

Me: RAGEQUIT

140,"Okay. Bitch time.

To give some backstory, my sister got married to my now brother-in-law in July of 2019. She started dating him in October of 2013, and have been friends since childhood, so I've known him for a very long time. At the beginning of their relationship, he didn't seem like a bad person. He was humble, only talked when it was his turn, was smart but not arrogant, and I actually liked him. But over the past 2 years or so, he seems to have changed in a way that I hate. 

Now he's cocky, arrogant, interrupts people in conversation, etc. He loves to act superior to everyone, has to come of with some logical analysis for literally EVERYTHING, and points them out when literally nobody asked. It doesn't matter what it is. We can even just be watching an innocent cartoon and he'll have to find some way to logically explain something that happens in like Spongebob or some shit. He always has to have some kind of philosophical higher ground, and silences anyone who dares to disagree with him. All of the conversations he has are one-sided. He loves to give my sister shit whenever she disagrees with him on literally anything, and treats *her* like she's stupid if she says something he misunderstood. His ideas are the only good ones to him. His patience is thinner than anybody else I've ever seen. I'm probably forgetting some things but I'm too angry to think straight right now. 

He also continuously threatens to beat up my fiance for no other reason than the fact that he thinks he's annoying. He makes jokes about him that go too far, and loves to call us out for ""pda"" when all he does is hug me in public. I can't even bring my fiance anywhere around him because he's so quick to make comments that make me want to break every limb in his body.

I've been silently dealing with his shit for years now and I'm so sick of it. Every time I've been with him in the past few days, I've felt the urge to yell at him to the top of my lungs and beat his ass. I'm afraid that if I don't control myself, I may actually end up getting violent with him one of these days. I'm sick of letting him have his way with me and my friends, and I'm sick of the way he treats my sister. I've never beaten someone up before and I don't want to get to that point. I wasn't raised that way, I can't serve the time, and my brother-in-law is definitely the type of person who would snitch if I did. I have to try so hard to control my reflexes when I'm around him nowadays.

If I tried to bring all of this up to him, I know he wouldn't be able to have a civil conversation with me. All he would do is interrupt me and try to use logical explanation to justify himself. So with all of this being said, how can I let him know how I and many others feel about him without having to resort to violence?

I won an prominent award at a ceremony once, and when I asked them to take a picture, A said ""I can't deal with this right now."" A also pulled me away with a well known person in my field, because they said they needed me. I understand that A was having a moment, but I would never take away the joy from someone just because I was feeling upset. I have been in similar situations myself, but I always make sure to put my feelings aside for a moment and make the other person happy

In general, A is very unsupportive. I took my medical school exam recently, scored significantly above average but still not as high as I wanted. When I told A my score, they said said ""yikes."" while my other friends congratulated me and sent me their well wishes

in the past, A has made me feel like a horrible person for having high goals. They often tell me to settle, and are unsupportive of my career aspirations. I know I shouldn't rely so much on their affirmations, but thats my friend and I'd want them to be supportive. One time I told them about something I sought to do, and they straight up said it's stupid and I shouldn't consider that career path. Again, my other friends encouraged it. 

Just now, I was speaking to A about my medical school application. They asked if I regretted obtaining a high gpa, now that I didn't get the score I wanted. The way they said it made it seem like they were invalidating my months of hard work. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some examples. I have never been unsupportive of A's aspirations, while A is always incredibly hurtful towards mine. I don't know what to do. I have tried to limit my interactions with A, but they keep me coming back",01Sep2020,1

It is a pretty small company, but has a great company culture. 

Her boyfriend knows everything that happened during my freshman year and has a pretty negative view of me. I would love to intern at this company but I would have serious anxiety if I were to have to work with him. Should I still apply or should I move on and find another company?

They won’t allow me to go during my “week-off” no matter what. I’ve explained I will lose my spots, that I’ll be kicked from the choir. They refuse to accept it.

152,"I'm (F24) struggling with not being fulfilled in my career path that I've ended up in right out of college. I majored in Media and Advertising with a minor in Marketing which looks great on paper but realistically I only chose it because it was ""practical"". I've worked at a media agency for two years now and advanced to the next level but feel so drained and unfulfilled every day and even more so at the end of every week. I know what I don't like (tight deadlines, spitting out work rapid fire, bending over backwards for team/clients with no words of encouragement in return, cut throat competition, corporate politics/constant drama etc). That being said I have acquired transferable skills that I believe I could apply to a different area of work. The part I have trouble with is finding what exactly I like and what I would enjoy as a career.

Quarantine has given me some time to step back and think about what I actually want to do rather than what I think I should be doing and I've come up with a few ideas but nothing I feel I would be qualified to go after right now.

In a personal sense I've always felt like I don't know myself fully and feel a general sense of frustration because I don't know what I want or what I even love to do beyond obvious things (music, movies, art etc). I consider myself very self aware and this has always been a common thread throughout my youth and young adulthood.

So, my question to you kind Reddit community is where should I start to look or explore in order to find out what I want to do career-wise and in general? 

I've been trying to read up on different things and considered taking a few classes but I'm a very anxious person and sometimes feel scared to try new things and fail. I say this because it hinders my own decision making and makes me feel stuck. I desperately would like to try and at least find something that I don't hate and want to build a foundation for myself to at least be on ""the right track"" since I understand preferences might change and there likely won't be some grand epiphany where everything makes sense to me and I fully know what my purpose will be. I feel like I've been searching my whole life for a purpose and something to channel all of my passion into.

If it helps I just took a Myers Briggs Personality test and came up with an INFP personality type. 

Any resources, suggestions, or experiences you have had would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",01Sep2020,1
153,"I just entered college.  My 3 best friends and I are all going to different colleges across the country.  I deal with mental health issues and am having trouble finding my identity.  I don’t think my friends are necessarily doing anything wrong, but I feel like I just need to take a break from texting and FaceTiming them completely.  Is this rude?  I feel like I need to focus on myself, and even though they are still my best friends, the memories we’ve made together are the past, and I feel like I need to let go of my past at least for now, considering I’m trying to find who I am.

All 4 of us did well in high school.  I was at the bottom out of us 4 though success wise.  At times, they would have conversations that I would just feel left out in.  All 3 of them made my high school hall of fame, while I didn’t.  This is just me showing jealousy at times, which is obviously my problem and my fault.  Combining that with my mental health issues and at times my limited social skills, it’s just a weird situation.  I have had moments with them recently that have not been extremely tense or anything, but there have been some moments where I or they will say something that is a tad bit out of line but not crazy bad or anything.  Sadly, any small piece of conflict stays in my head and I can’t ever forget about it.

Honestly the majority of it is just that I’m fucked up and I feel like I need to let go of these minor issues that I connect with our friendship.  These are issues that they don’t see, but I do.  These issues are completely my fault and I don’t think they’ve done anything wrong.  Is it ok and will it ruin our friendship if I just take a break from them for a while?",01Sep2020,1

I was homeless looking and smelled bad because I was just camping but of course im going to help. I changed it and the spare was flat. It just needed air. The gas stations air compressor had a hole in the hose and didnt work. I offered to take the girl down the road to another gas station to air it up and bring her back and put it on. She agreed and thats what we did. Btw, this is Phoenix so I burned myself pretty good doing this. She was a really sweet girl and super thankful. I asked if she was single then when she said yeah, I asked if I could give my number (so she didnt feel obligated to give her number out). She then called me so I had her number.

I went to college a few years back, for a few months. Please hear me out.  I experienced it, and it was not for me. I enjoyed some of the topics but I can't deal with a lot of the dynamics of it. I also am in debt now, I (barely even attended it- which is the worst part) I flunked out, and no longer qualify for financial aid, so I couldn't go back even if I wanted to. 

I have had a variety of retail and part time jobs in the mean time, to support myself. It was tough working at stores due to my introversion and social anxiety, but after a while it became more bearable.   I also had depression. It is still difficult for me, as I dealt with harsh treatment from coworkers and customers alike. It took a toll on my health. It is not something I see myself ever really doing again; its just not worth it. Are there any career tests or something that you can recommend? 

Fast forward to the present day, I feel totally lost and confused when it comes to what I want to do with my life. I've tried doing research on topics that interest me but I don't really get anywhere. I am not marketable, I have no skills that would make me appealing to an employer, I can't afford college, and like I said, it did not agree with me. I'd like to hear from someone who preferably was in the same shoes as me at one point. I guess I can talk about my hobbies now.

163,"I'm doing a coding bootcamp and since I already have some experience I'm doing OK. A couple of weeks ago we went through the well known assignment of creating some code for managing dogs at a shelter.

This week, she used that code as a guide for today's class (she doesn't do live coding, she uses some other material and reads through it) This time she used what I had done previously letting everybody know it was my code. Then she went through it explaining what I had done and why, and using it as an example for some typical beginner functions.

At the end of the class, she let the class know that the code would be available from her personal Github. I had no idea this was the case, as I had no idea my code was going to be used in  the first place. 

I have some issues with it. The first and obvious one, I feel I have the right to decide if something I made is uploaded. Second, I feel like I should have been given the chance to upload it to my own github, which barely has 2 stars and a couple of followers, since the traffic would definitely be a boost for my employable qualities. And I definitely feel like I deserve the credit! And third, the code included some personal stuff (I used my pets as an example, of course) so there might have been some security or privacy issues she failed to consider.

171,"This is a throwaway account, so I'll try to include as much information as I can that is pertinent to this post. 

So I'm 26 years old, and I have been friends with this dude for about 15 months, five of those months we were in a relationship. Let's call this friend ""Z"". There was some drama that lead up to us getting together, and I want to bring this up because 1) during this drama, I was in a friends-with-benefits relationship with another coworker, 2) before this fwb relationship, I was never in a relationship before, and 3) there were certain things about what happened during the drama period that, in hindset, doesn't exactly paint his actions as benevolent. 

In the beginning, I wasn't really interested in Z. Me and the fwb coworker would make fun of how much of a cheesy sap he was, and how much he was in love with me. But I liked the attention Z was giving me, so I wanted to give him a fair chance. When we went out to our movie date, Z was like a 1920s scrawny dude who just got a girlfriend and thought his world was transforming for the best. He was spouting cheesy idealisms the entire way to the theatre, he even kissed me, we snuggled while watching the movie, and afterwards, he asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend. I was going with the motion the entire time, but thought I could learn to like him, so I had said yes. But after much thinking and talking with the fwb coworker, I told him the next morning that I shouldn't have said I wanted to be his girlfriend. 

I guess after a while, Z learned that me and the coworker was in a fwb relationship, and felt that I deserve better than that, that he was a much better person for me than the coworker. He also tend to... portray himself as some kind of brooding knight in shining armor. It didn't help that we were all (me, Z and the fwb coworker) interested in anime and video games, though I was already falling out of the former. When we were alone, it's like he was having his own soliloquys while gazing outside the window, and I thought it was pretentious as hell, and yet I was kinda forcing myself to like him as a potential girlfriend. He was also an overall depressed person because of how much his brother has everything but he doesn't, which is something I don't really have the emotional capacity comfort him about, especially since I wasn't really in love with him. But I tried to cheer him up anyways. 

In the end, I ended up in a relationship with Z after a date and said some things that made me believe that I was really in love with. Maybe it was something I believed at the time, but it was definitely not the case much later. I started inviting him home and stuff, and my mom loved him. But then there were some things that turned me off from him.

It was cute at first, but I started really hating how much he mirrors my cute gestures, to the point where I try to be more serious to discourage him from acting cute (even though that doesn't work). He also was talking about how he couldn't wait for us to be married, which wasn't my plan at all, but I played along for the sake of conversation, but I have expressed to him that I don't plan on getting married. He'd also want to be with me so many times for a long time, whether in person or by phone, even though I really needed my space. I had even tried breaking up with him a few times mainly because of how much he eats up my time, his cutesy-ness, and how much I wasn't really in love with him, but he would scold me for not communicating these issues to him before and that if I just give us a chance, I would see better things in our relationship. However, what I end up seeing is that he doesn't ease up on his behavior or tells me he couldn't help being with me, which only pissed me off more.

So in hind sight, I've started to realize how much of a Nice Guy lite he was in every sense of the word. Like, he was nice and polite and very caring, but just the fact that he framed the drama as me having to choose between him or fwb guy was kinda gross. If I was a more assertive person with a clearer mind, I would've not choose anyone because I just wanted to be friends. It didn't help that fwb guy did have feelings for me and even though it was no-strings-attached, he said he wished he didn't let me have my way. So it was gross on both sides. Though I wasn't innocent in this at all. The entire time I played along with Z's feelings for me even though I felt nothing for him, and just let this all happened.

However, the clinchers for me were his borderline racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic views. Here, I'll mention that he is half Dominican/half-Guatamalan, and I'm a light-skinned mixed black girl. At first, when he expressed his views about black people, which seems to be largely based on when he was in high school getting bullied by black people, it just came off to me as disappointment rather than anything racist bc I also feel a general disappointment with my race. But there was one moment when he said he would go on to say that he would call a black person a monkey for acting out in public. I told him that was racist, and he said it wasn't, and that people have to earn respect for him to give it to them. I then went on and said that not black people are like that and that he's acting like all black people are gangsters, that they can't be doctors, lawyers, and all sorts of things. But then he kinda twisted it around and acting like that's how black gangsters view their own race. In my mind, I was like, ""Did you just twisted around and started displacing your BS notion of a whole group of people onto the people themselves???""

When it comes to women, he had said how women are amazing and strong for just being women, and that women nowadays need to stop acting like men. And that men should be leaders because men tend to involve themselves in hierarchical groups throughout their lives, so they know how to lead better than women - which is something he draws from his prior experiences with gangs. He's never been in a gang (I think), but he had run-ins with some in his younger life. There was a time when I was talking to him over the phone as I was doing grocery shopping, and he spoke about how tradition his brothers and his nephew are, which already put me in a state of dread. He would talk about that one of brothers hate women who dominate conversations or something, and that there was one time another brother opened a door for a woman, but the woman turned around and yelled at him for doing that, so he vowed to never hold doors for women ever again. There's just a lot of things wrong about everything he told me because some of the things he said his brothers hate describes me, especially when I feel comfortable enough with people. 

Yet for some reason, I'm still associating with this guy. We eventually ended up breaking up, but I was told by another coworker (not fwb guy) and my mom that men need ""closure"" when you break up with him. But I didn't understand what that meant. It was my mom who said that it's fine if us two remain friends or something. And I guess for some reason I became stupid because 1) just being friends was my goal from the beginning, yet my dumb self just wanted to resolve the situation rather than realize that after everything I've seen and experience about this guy would not lend itself to the same friendship as if the drama and relationship never happened, and 2) I was just mentally worn out by Z just trying to extract a reason why I want to break things off, even though I told him all the reasons why. Though looking back, I realized that wasn't the case. I didn't bring up the fact that his bigotry played a role bc it wasn't as ""bad"" as it could've if he was a ""real racist/sexist"", though he did express his transphobia to me. But it was easily for me to block them out bc they were just pinprick moments in all the months I knew him, and they weren't exactly recurring things. 

So I ended up becoming his friend as a way to grant him his closure, but honestly, looking back, I should've just said ""Fuck it!"" and disappeared from this guy's life. We haven't seen each other in person ever since, and thankfully the pandemic ensured that, though we would still call each other or video chat occasionally. Ever since then, I thought deeply about what had transpired throughout the relationship. We also had a huge argument over his use of the word ""fairy"" when referring to gay characters, and from then on, I would either not speak to him about politics or just continued nodding and letting him say whatever. Fortunately, nothing like that was ever brought up in conversation again. But I've generally pieced together that Z is not an intellectual person. I don't think he has ever done research into his beliefs and just assumes he's right. After a while, I expressed to him that I really needed y space, and he was happy to oblige. 

So I've been taking month long breaks from him, and it wasn't until a month ago that I was thinking of just straight up ghosting him so that he would take the hint and leave me alone. But at the same time, I feel as though I should give a proper explanation as to why I don't want to be his friend anymore. He's not gonna accept that I see him as a boring person and have a much lower opinion of him because of his low-key bigotry bc those moments were so long ago, so why am I having a problem with them now and not during those moments? Not only that, but while we were in the relationship, it took me four times to try and break up with him until we're finally not together. I just wanna block him and be done with it, but I feel like he's gonna contact my mom through Facebook and ask her how I'm doing, and I really don't want to get my mom involved. Honestly, at this point, I just want to be alone and either stay alone or vet potential friends more rigorously than before. So what do you guys think I should do? Should I just straight ghost/block him or does he deserve an explanation?",01Sep2020,1

175,"So, I’m a full time college student and I’m having a dilemma on whether I should stay in my on campus apartment or go home. My school announced that they were sending everyone off campus due to covid unless you had a reason to stay. My reason got approved (I just got a new job here), however staying here and going home both have major pros and cons. Help me the fuck out and tell me what you would do.

Staying On Campus
- Pros: Keep my job that’s related to my major, live with friends, have total freedom when it comes to letting my boyfriend stay here and me staying at his house whenever (this is a big one as my mom is old fashioned and even though I’m 21 she likes to pretend I’m not)
- Cons: The job doesn’t pay well at all and my shifts start at 6am, the city doesn’t feel like home, I’d pay for groceries, the apartment would cost 85% of my refund check I got from financial aid, campus feels like a ghost town

Going Home
-Pros: I have an interview for a job (unrelated to my major) that makes more for less intense work, I would keep my whole refund check and put it towards student loans I wouldn’t have to worry about in the future, free groceries, more of a sense of home I think
-Cons: Although my mom has agreed to letting us spend nights in each others houses, she insists her place isn’t a “fuck pad” and I’m afraid she would randomly start having a problem with it and ruin the whole thing. My boyfriend wouldn’t be as comfortable staying there, and Being farther away from friends, losing that sense of total freedom

The money and the freedom are the two things I’m absolutely torn over, as well as the job I have where I’m at now. It’s fun, but the money is not worth the work in my opinion. Send help",01Sep2020,1

All I do is work and come home. I do have hobbies that I enjoy myself, but I don't even remember the last time someone decided to send me a message, see how I'm doing, or even invite me somewhere.

Recently (within the past month) I've decided I want to be a high school biology teacher in the US and would really like some school/any advice!

I've told family and friends and most are excited about it but some have all but told me it's a crazy and soul-sucking idea. I'm going back to school in the spring semester to get my masters and all the other required classes and plan on substitute teaching beginning of next year. 

I just really want advice or experiences from real teachers because I know I want to do it but I do want to hear from real teachers. I come from a large family of teachers and know how hard it can be. If anyone is in the 502 and knows more about this area please let me know!

Thank you guys :)",01Sep2020,1
179,"I am 18F and I just started college so this may not be the best idea. My grandpa has type 1 diabetes and he does not take care of himself whatsoever. No matter who tries to help him, he just won’t do it. He went into the hospital November of last year because his diabetes caused sores on his legs and he has had them infected for years. I’m surprised he still has his legs. When he first got out of the hospital, he was semi taking care of himself. But a little over a month ago he went back into the hospital because he got an infection that went into his blood stream. He had to go to a rehab nursing home to take antibiotics for a month and he absolutely hated being there. He said they treated him terribly. So he is totally against the idea of permanently staying in a nursing home. He is also showing signs of dementia, but has not been diagnosed. He just went back to the hospital last Thursday and I’m not sure when he can go back home. The problem is, I know he won’t take care of himself and this will happen again. He lives in a trailer home and it is not safe for him. I thought that if I got an apartment with him, I can hold him accountable for taking care of himself while also providing a healthier lifestyle (such as cooking nice meals for him and take him on walks and such) I know this is not my burden to handle, but I cannot imagine him being in a nursing home. He is too prideful. I’m sure I can convince him to make this move. I will be getting a job soon and I can help out on rent and other things like that. He has been there for me as much as he could when I was a child and I feel like I should do what I can to be there for him. 
For some context, his son, my dad, only wants money from him and has never helped him. I am adopted, but I still keep contact with some of my biological family like my grandpa. I talked to my boyfriend about this and he said it might be a good idea if he thinks it will make me happier. My adopted parents often neglect me and I might be happier if I don’t have to keep up with the feeling of being a disappointment to them. I agree that I do think this would be make happy. He is my grandfather and I have so many good memories with him and I want him to at least live the rest of his life to the best of his abilities.

I dealt with a lot of emotional pain and found physical pain a lot better to deal with.
Now I'm stuck with the fact that I don't mind pain and even seek it out sometimes when I'm feeling bad, but I hate myself when I let myself get hurt.

182,"i've been friends with someone, let's call them A, since my second year of college. A and I always had a weird relationship, but i've come to realize they may potentially be toxic and I don't know what to do. Here are some examples:

I won an prominent award at a ceremony once, and when I asked them to take a picture, A said ""I can't deal with this right now."" A also pulled me away from a conversation with a well known person in my field, because they said they needed me. They kept spamming my phone by calling and texting me. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I understand that A was having a moment, but I would never take away the joy from someone just because I was feeling upset.

 I have been in similar situations myself, but I always make sure to put my feelings aside for a moment and make the other person happy. When I brought this up to A, they were quick to dismiss it, said an unconvincing sorry and that was it. Often times, A uses their depression as a way to excuse their shitty behavior. I have depression too and I have NEVER treated A in this manner. Neither have my other friends who also have depression.

In general, A is very unsupportive. I took my medical school entrance exam recently, scored significantly above average but still not as high as I wanted. When I told A my score, they said said ""yikes."" while my other friends congratulated me and sent me their well wishes

in the past, A has made me feel like a horrible person for having high goals. They often tell me to settle, and are unsupportive of my career aspirations. I know I shouldn't rely so much on their affirmations, but thats my friend and I'd want them to be supportive. One time I told them about something I sought to do, and they straight up said it's stupid and I shouldn't consider that career path. Again, my other friends encouraged it.

Just now, I was speaking to A about my medical school application. They asked if I regretted obtaining a high gpa, now that I didn't get the score I wanted on my medical school entrance exam. The way they said it, made it seem like they were invalidating my months of hard work. I called A out for it. Whenever I call them out, they say ""you're just mad someone is challenging you."" I appreciate being challenged, but A is just being incredibly discouraging and unhelpful.

These are just some examples. I have never been unsupportive of A's aspirations, while A is always incredibly hurtful towards mine. I don't know what to do. I have tried to limit my interactions with A, but they keep me coming back",01Sep2020,1

I like to draw and paint from time to time, i would say im not bad at it. but i never get the support or encouragement that i expect from people that i know. like to day i spent a couple of hours making a drawing, and since i get anxiety about posting a drawing that i made or a picture of myself, i decided to post a story to close friends on instagram, lets say there were 20 people there, some of them people who i know do art themselves and i supported them before, and some i know who appreciate are in general. and again they are or were my friends. and all i got in the end was that everybody saw the story, and non of them commented on it or liked it or anything lol. i felt so disappointed because as an insecure person i felt like i needed validation from these people and support but i got non expect from like 2 people and my bf lol. i know that its my own issue but i dont know how to fix it.

This happened before a couple of years ago but this time it was a normal story, again a drawing that i was proud of and like a 100 people saw it (people that i know and that are my friends or were my friends at some point) and nothing...

191,"I feel like I'm trapped.

I'm 26M and live in my parents house due to the money I make being very difficult to live outside the house and still make ends meet.

My mental health isn't great and never has been. I have an ADHD evaluation scheduled in September. Physical health has been fine tho I'm overweight and working on that, and I've recently taken on eating better, working out 5-6 days a week and some personal training to help get me started.

Currently I'm waiting on the outcome of 12/15 physician assistant applications, 1 pending interview (which if it goes well looks like it'll put me on a waitlist rather than a full acceptance) and two rejections. I'm finishing the last application tonight. For all this I could be waiting clear through to early  next year sometime.

My cardiac monitor job is fine - irritating and stressful but fine. I'm working on getting re-licensed in my state for AEMT by the end of November.

However, I'd like to be more comfortable in my life than scrape by and/or work two jobs so I have almost no time. I have nothing against those who do, more power to them and I hope things get easier, but admittedly I don't want to caught in the grind for more hours a week then absolutely necessary.

Unfortunately, changing that likely means going back to school or making a relocation because I can't really utilize a biology bachelors around here unless I get a masters or go into the medical field such as become a nurse etc which I'm already trying to do with physician assistant school applications. Relocation is not likely because as a biology major with little lab experience there's not much to get companies to help me with that.

Masters programs typically want letters of reference and its been 5 years since I was in undergrad. I wasn't the sort to do more than show up to class then go home. I could get some from my job, but I'm not sure how many references could be professional vs academic. I imagine it varies based on the school. Anyway, even if I did apply for a master's of Biology I have no idea what I would even research for a thesis. I do not currently have student loans thankfully.

I'm very lost and very stuck. I'm not sure if I should just pick another bachelor's degree, attempt to figure out how to apply to a master's program, or resign myself to a life of 2 jobs to make ends meet. I'm trying to make improvements where I can but it just seems insignificant compared to not knowing where the heck to go career path wise.

Everything seems so complicated these days.

198,"Hi everyone. I've been having this problem for a little over two years now, and it has been getting worse as of late. In the wide variety of living situations I have been in recently, this problem has caused a lot of trouble for me. Forgive me if I'm not posting in the right place.

One night (¬2018) and then several times over the next weeks/months, I would wake up in the middle of the night. But I wouldnt quite wake up all the way, I would open my eyes, and be able to see the celing. Often, I would be approached by a figure, or sometimes just utterly consumed with fear. I would feel this impending awfulness, the worst terror. I would try to move but I could not, no matter how hard I tried. I would try to scream for help, but all I could do was let out a horrible moan. Eventually, I would snap out of it, and be able to sit up.

So this went on for a few months, causing embarressment with roomates/bunkmates and friends. Recently it has started to change. Now, I don't wake up exactly, it occurs in my dream. They are almost always different now, but it is always some variant of me, in an awful situation, and not being able to move. Being paralyzed, and trying to scream for help, but only being able to moan. I wake up moaning/screaming every time. As of now, I share a bed with my girlfriend, and obviously it is a big problem. She is very supportive and always tried to shake me when I'm having these dreams. I am extremely embarressed, and hate the sound I make. She says I sound like a ghost. She is the biggest reason I want to address this.. I frequently wake her in the middle of the night. She is very sweet and supportive, but I feel guilty.

Does anybody have any idea what might be going on with me, or what this might sound like? I have never gone through a problem of this sort. How should I go about addressing this? Do I need medication, should I change my diet, see someone.. etc. Any speculation as the cause, and any input on how I should address this would be much appreciated. Thank you.",01Sep2020,1

I've written to her that I've been having a difficult time and wanted to hear from her; no response to that. It now seems that she doesn't want to speak with me anymore.

I can't help but feel hurt. It now seems like I've been living in a lie, that the person whom I'd go the extra miles for, and whom I thought somewhat cared about me as well. It almost seems too unreal to believe and feels numbing.",01Sep2020,1
206,"Okay, so this is a long story and I'm not sure where to begin. I'm rather secretive of my hopefully unapparent daddy issues, so I though I would come to reddit. I don't know if this is relevant but I'm a female in my 20s. It pains me to say it but i def think its been the cause of a lot of my sadness lately (though there are a lot of contributing factors-- but those are off topic).

Anyway, I have a pretty weird relationship with my father right now. We haven't spoken in 6 months, so I wouldn't call it much of a relationship at all. For context, I still live with both my parents. And though my parents aren't divorced/separated, they don't have much of a relationship and they speak only when theres something to be discussed. I also have a sister. She doesn't speak to my father either, but her issues are rather different than mine and she does not care one bit about it.

Growing up I had a wonderful relationship with my father! I won't bore you with the details here but just thought it should be mentioned. Our fights always ended in us talking to each other and moving on.

Anyway, for the modern day details. I think I sorta was the one to stop talking to my father. And he sorta just didn't talk to me either. I hit my peak resentment after he came back from one of his ""vacations"" in February. He always leaves the country multiple times a year because he needs ""a break"" but I know it's because he secretly has another lady/family in that said country. I never knew how to cope with that. Anyway, he's always snappy with my mother, so right when he came back from his ""vacation"" I yelled at him because I was tired of him throwing tantrums anytime my mother did the tiniest thing that bothered him. What annoys me the most is that he's always preaching about peace and love and kindness and respect yadayadayada, but he never acts on it. After that I think he got the idea that I wasn't speaking to him, and I never really did. I don't know if that's really the moment that started it all, but I think it is.

So one day in April, the internet went out. My parents are both huge boomers so they never knew how to deal with tech stuff. When it was finally restored, my dad was disconnected from the wifi, and he couldn't remember the password. I saw him tinkering with the wifi router, and as I walked passed him, he said, in the most hateful tone, ""I know you don't want to talk to me, and i don't care to talk to you either, but I need you to give me the wifi password."" That made me so damn angry. I know it's silly to think about now but in the moment I was fuming. I replied ""I don't care to give you the password because you can't be bothered to speak to me nicely."" Now, that sent him on a rampage. I can't remember exactly what was said, but he threw around phrases like: ""you are garbage"", ""you are absolute trash"", ""I've done so much for you"", and lots more that I subconsciously erased.

So yeah, its been months of us awkwardly walking past eachother and saying nothing. As his daughter, I inherited his fatal flaw, which is stubbornness. I don't want to speak to him, though I wish we were on good terms, because truth be told, I miss him. I guess part of me worries about when he will, inevitably, move to his vacation spot to be with whatever it is he visits every year. I know that's how it will end with my father, good terms or not.

I just feel like as my father, who has taught me so many things about love and kindness, he should come speak to me. Shouldn't he love me unconditionally such that no matter how ""rude"" I am to him, no matter what I could say or do, he will always want to have me in his life? idk. is this dreaming? I've seen my friend's father come to them after a big fight and tell them they love them no matter what. Idk if I'm just projecting.

My mom and aunts are begging me to excuse his behaviour and to just apologize to him. He just got an injury that he told none of us about that ended up taking him to the hospital. My sister only found out from my uncle. my mom is telling me to use this as an opportunity to wish him well, as it is the ""christian"" thing to do.

Anyway, what the hell do I do? Do I avoid the inevitable doom of me and my father's relationship (due to the aforementioned side life he lives) by just moving on? Or do I swallow my pride and ""be the bigger person"" and say sorry to him (even though i'd have no idea what I'm apologizing about).

I don't know if anyone has read this far. If you did, thank you. Apologies if it was just a bunch of rambling, but either way i guess its good to get it off my chest.",01Sep2020,1
207,"I am entering into my sophomore year of college at a small liberal arts school in the northeast with deep fraternity traditions rooted within the college campus and community. I spent my first year of college getting to know the guys in different fraternities and attending different parties trying to figure out where I liked and fit in and if I wanted to rush. 

I very much want to rush to be part of a society with old traditions, great memories, and I also want to pledge alongside my best friend. My mom, however, is admittedly against frats. She has this idea that all frats are like animal house and I will get killed or hit with a lawsuit or something. I had great grades in my first year and showed that I could handle college and take care of myself, but ultimately I have to rely on my parents to support me financially so my mom has the final say on if I will be able to rush. 

I'm hoping to find advice on how to convince my mom that joining a frat is not a bad thing but could actually be a great decision and how to get her to at least sit-down and hear me out on why I want to join and what I could gain from joining.",01Sep2020,1
208,"So I broke up with my emotionally abusive and cheating ex gf recently. I’m convinced While at work she drove up left a note that said hey call me I think I’m pregnant.
So I texted her asking if she left a note because she’s lied numerous times and I’ve been with 2 women the past year... she said she was curious to what it said I didn’t budge I asked her if she left it again. All of a sudden 
She then denied it and proceeded to lay into about my new gf who isn’t actually my gf.. How’s she’s too young for me and she’s actually a nasty bitch and I’m such a liar and she could never trust me “I’m so glad I’m done with your bs never should have trusted you” When in reality i stayed with her and then I decided to leave her. 
And I texted the girl I’m seeing all of it and she raised a good question.
Who all of a sudden freaks out about who you’re seeing? If she didn’t wanna talk to  you could she could have just said no.

209,"The last 48 hours have been a nightmare. A few days ago my daughter, who is 6, went to a sleep over. She asked one of the girls to have a ""naked party"" and tried to take off her panties. Their mom is a close friend of mine and texted me yesterday to let me know. I immediately took my daughter into another room and asked her about it. She told me that she had done it. I asked her if anyone had been doing that with her. 


She told me that her older female cousin, who is 9, had been making her take off her clothes and had been touching her. She said sometimes her cousin would take off her clothes and get on top of her. I realize that kids often experiment with other children but it seemed like there was a significant amount of predatory behavior exhibited by my niece. 


My daughter told me that her older cousin had said that she talked to me and I had told her that the behavior was okay. I told my daughter that had not happened, and that I would never tell someone that it was okay to do that with her. She immediately started bawling. In between sobs she tells me ""I'm mad at her. I think she lied to me"". My daughter also told me her cousin said she shouldn't mention it to anyone, and that it was a secret between the three of us.


The grooming type of behavior really worries me because it leads me to believe that someone is molesting my niece. I called my daughters father once she had calmed down and he immediately came over. I called my ex sister in law next, and she apologized a lot. She texted me a lot after that. Her and her husband called my niece down and yelled at her a lot. They told her that she was ""fucking disgusting"" and that she had ""ruined all of their relationships with their family"". I should mention that my niece has previously had behaviors like this. Her birth mother (not my ex sister in law mentioned) had gotten addicted to meth and done sexual things in front of her. An old girlfriend of my ex brother in law had beaten and abused the kids for a year. My niece has gone to therapy and been released from therapy. It has been maybe 2 or 3 years since she had had any behaviors like this. After talking together, my ex husband decided to report it. He called his brother today and told him. Since then, his brother has called and yelled at him. I am currently getting my phone blown up by my ex sister in law after I said I supported him making the report for ""trying to get their kids taken away"". 

My ex sister in law says that the therapist has told her that she could have been too young to deal with the previous trauma, and that this relapse of behavior could be a good thing for my niece because she may be ready to work through it now. 
Do you guys think that my ex husband and I should have done something different? Was making a cps report unjustified when they already had other interventions in place?
Please let me know what you think Reddit. This has really torn my family apart and I feel so overwhelmingly sad.",01Sep2020,1
210,"We've been together for almost two years now. The recent months have been rough on my end as I began to have the feeling of falling out of love. There was this voice that kept telling me that our relationship was wrong, but I always found a way to convince myself to stay - and so I did. Until almost a month ago, the feeling got to a strong point that I had to tell her. So there, I ended it. We had an exchange and such on love and how our ideals of it worked. But there's one thing I still don't get. She still loves me. And in whole honesty I wish I do to. I didn't want things to change between us. But my feelings kept getting in the way. It was a clash of mind and heart. Which came across to her that she was unconditionally loving. While I wasn't. I want to know how to unconditionally love. I asked her for another shot but my feelings got in the way again as soon as she I convinced her and got her to say yes. So I had to tell her. She was furious. We talked it out a bit more and we decided to call it quits. We were still friends as per agreement. Its been like 3 weeks since the break up, we talk here and then. And I was doing fine, until yesterday. I had the thought of checking up on her. And suddenly I wanted her back. What if's started popping up. But at this rate I don't know what to do. My ""feelings"" might get in the way again and I don't want to hurt her anymore. I know her value, she's amazing. But at this point I don't trust myself anymore.

211,"Let’s call my friend Bree. 

We’re both 22, she’s my first friend to have a baby. I’m the god mother. 

The baby was born almost a month ago and I still haven’t really seen him. I saw her once because she came to the store I work at with him, but she was so sad and so was her husband. I haven’t been asking to see the baby because I don’t want her to feel pressured but I have mentioned wanting to see her and that if she needs anything, I’m here for her. 

She opened up to me a while ago that she is struggling really badly and I want to help her but I don’t know how. I want to send her something but at the same time I feel like she’s mad at me? I know it seems selfish of me to think this, but here’s why:

Our friend group is kinda dysfunctional. I’ve known Bree and her brother since I was 10. I met my boyfriend through Bree’s brother. Bree’s brother hates our relationship and has been trying for 4 years to break us up. Finally it all came to a head a head right before Bree gave birth, so the boys stopped talking. This fight had NOTHING to do with me or Bree, but I think she is mad at me for staying with my boyfriend? It’s such a fucked up situation. 

Bree has always kind of used me and then left me alone when she doesn’t need me, so I just don’t know what to do from here. Keep reaching out? Give her space and let her come to me?

My boyfriend and parents are telling me that I’ve been letting her push me around for too long and that I should tell her I don’t wanna be the godmother anymore. But I don’t want to lose her... even if she isn’t the best friend, I want to be there for her. I can’t just leave a friend to suffer",01Sep2020,1

216,"My niece (25) just got engaged, and wedding planning is in full swing. She invited me, her mom (my sister), and her stepmother to go wedding dress shopping next month, but when she made the appointment, she found out she could only take two people in with her because of COVID. 

She informed me on Saturday that she would be taking her mom and stepmother with her. She said she chose her stepmom because she felt bad that her stepmother’s daughter didn’t include her stepmom in her wedding planning, and she said that uninviting her stepmom would crush her. 

I understand that my niece is in a tough spot, but I am really hurt that my niece essentially picked her stepmother over me. 

The stepmother’s daughter didn’t include her in her wedding because the stepmom abandoned her kids when they were really young and moved to another state, so I don’t feel bad for the stepmom at all and think she got what she deserved. 

My family and I have always been super close, and we see each other at least twice a month and often more than that. When my niece was growing up, we saw them every weekend, and my mom often babysat her and her brother.  

My sister, niece, and I also have a group chat and text each other most days. I have been a central person in my niece’s life since she was born. I have always been really good to my niece and do a lot of extra things to help her out. 

The stepmother on the other hand has only been around for about 10 years and has been nasty to my niece in the past, which is why we call her the evil stepmother. That name is well deserved. Her dad and stepmother don’t do a lot to help her out. 

I talked to my sister (my niece’s mom) today, and she just made excuses for my niece saying that she would have picked me, but she obviously felt like she had to pick the stepmother to please her dad. I understand that and don’t want to give my niece a hard time, but it’s really difficult for me not to take this personally. 

I also feel that my sister was invalidating my feelings by making excuses for her daughter and basically saying I needed to let it go. I hate confrontation, so I usually let things like this go because I don’t want to cause trouble. 

My brother agrees with me and says my niece probably picked her stepmother because she knows I’m easygoing and would let it go.

I’m getting tired of being treated like this and want to tell my niece how I feel. My first instinct is to tell her I will bake her wedding cake, but that’s it. I was originally going to help out a lot with the wedding and probably contribute a decent amount of money.

They are on an extremely tight budget and really shouldn’t be planning such a big wedding. My niece wants the wedding of her dreams and wants us to help her as much as we are willing. 

I basically want to lash out right now because I’m hurt, but don’t want to cause a huge rift in the family or ruin my niece’s wedding. 

I guess my question is am I being ridiculous and over-sensitive, and should I tell my niece how I feel or just let it go?",01Sep2020,1
217,"Hi r/advice- first time poster. Let me give some backstory. 

My mother has been a gaslighting, abusive (physical and verbal) bipolar, depressive alcoholic since I was a child. Growing up, I always knew something wasn’t right with my mom or the way she treated my sister and I, but it was our normal and I didn’t question it much. I won’t get into the detailed history of what the addiction has done to her or the abuse my family has suffered. 

I moved out on my own after I graduated college, and a lot of anger issues I didn’t even realize I had seemed to dissipate. I sought treatment for depression and anxiety, had some rough patches, but had the realIzation that being away from her was the best thing for me. Any small joy or victory I’ve experienced in her presence is met with a negative comment. Examples- when I graduated college, post-commencement ceremony the first thing she said to me was “we didn’t even see you.” When photos came back from a friends wedding recently that I tried sharing with her, her only reaction was “that dress you wore wasn’t flattering on you” and “I don’t like the brides hair.” 

Now let me get to the point of this post. Two years ago I was laid off from a well paying job that I loved. I couldn’t find work for 8 months afterward, and my employment ran out. I moved back in with my parents as an absolute last resort, and managed to find a job that came at a substantial pay cut. I can pretty much only afford my car and student loan payment. I have been regularly applying for work (my expertise isn’t in high demand where I live, and I want to live in my home state permanently) to no avail. So it has been 18 months back home as a 30yr old adult, trying to get out of this rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. 

The living arrangement was bearable when I was commuting to work- but being home full time with my mother has started wearing on me. I do not engage when she tries needling me for reactions- an example, if I leave the room after one of her drunken rambling diatribes with only saying “I think I’d like to be alone right now,” I am met with insults like “you’re a bitch anyway” and “go fuck yourself.” Her unwarranted rants are usually focused on things that people ‘wronged’ her for 30+ years ago. She has multiple times entered the room I sleep in if the door is closed to insult me and demand to know who I am texting. She has stolen my work laptop and attempted to login as well as snatched my phone from my hands while I am using it. She will enter a closed door room and raise her voice or purposefully burp when I am taking work calls (I get that may be funny on a surface level and though I hate my job, I would like to keep it for now). I believe she is purposely trying to assert herself over me and is trying to force me into her level of misery. 

I guess what I am asking after this long post is how can I protect myself while I am stuck in this situation? I’ve been trying to find apartments, but I cannot afford many of them (I have a dog as well, which limits my options). I am so grateful I had a place to land after my lay-off, but I don’t believe that it requires I sustain verbal and abuse. I have reverted to how I felt as a teenager- unsure of why I am here, what I am worth to anyone, angry and wondering if I should carry on (some of this also has to do with working a job I am also miserable at). I haven’t felt this way in so long and I do not know how to preserve my mental health in the presence of such a negative and abusive force. Any advice, reading or hearing someone’s similar personal stories would help. Thank you in advance.",01Sep2020,1
218,"**TL;DR Meeting up with group, most don't like me. Filled to the brim with anxiety. How to dip without being an asshole?**

So i planned to meet with my friends tomorrow. (We have masks, and there's only 2 active cases in my town of 8000 so I swear we're okay.) 

I asked one friend if she wanted to meet, she said only if her best friend could come, and that escalated. so we ended up with 7 people including me going. Three of those people don't like me at all afaik, but I didn't invite them. And the one person in the group I can hold a non uncomfortable conversation with at this point just cancelled, putting us down to 6. 2 of whom are my actual friends. 

Im also a hardcore introvert. My friends are extroverted. Ive been very happy this quarantine. going out isn't an issue, but my social battery is *extremely* low at this point. That's tricky enough, whilst on the other hand I don't have any common interests with my friends besides the one who cant make it. Literally zero. can't think of any whatsoever right now.

So basically this outing is probably gonna suck for me. Im not really looking forward to it anymore, but I planned it so no way to skip.

 my sibling and I devised a plan. I send a text for help, they respond with a minor emergency that requires me to come home asap. Would it be an asshole move to pull that if Im struggling? The last family gathering we had, it was a struggle to breathe properly with all the noise and screaming and i had to leave for a while.

 If that happens again there needs to be something to cling on to. but I'm worried im a shitty friend for it! They would not understand at all if I tried to explain me dying inside to them. last time they called it an excuse and got mad. Is there a better way to go about this?",01Sep2020,1

225,"I have been dating this guy long distance on and off for the last two years, and it’s been fairly volatile and unhealthy with awful boundaries for majority of the time. He’s a pretty heavy drinker, which seems to change his perspective and ability to control himself. I also enjoy drinking, so even at the very surface of addressing “hey maybe if you drank a little less, we wouldn’t get into such big fights” it turns into “well you’re an alcoholic too!” Just conversations always turn into a fight. I’m also fairly volatile once I get pushed, which I’ve been in therapy now for over a year to address. 

We started seeing each other again beginning of the pandemic, and we virtually spend a lot of time together. We’ve also seen each other quite a bit, because although we are far away, it’s not too long of a drive and we both have fairly flexible schedules, so we can spend a good amount of time with one another for long periods of time (week or 2). 

We’ve broken up the last couple of months like 4-5x? And it always starts with a conversation about the game we play online together, or over me not answering my call because it was in another room and I didn’t hear it, or something really insane. Since I’ve been in therapy, it doesn’t effect me as much as it used to, because I’m able to keep myself chill even though he’s calling me a liar and a cunt and all the names under the sun. 

At this point, I’m really done. But I also struggle with the emotional aspect of being alone. My friends and I recently had a fairly large fall out, and my mom died last year, so I’m pretty isolated, even without COVID. COVID adds a whole other slew of isolation, which makes “reaching out to a friend” hard. When I start to feel lonely is usually when we talk again, resulting in me thinking “well, I was just as bad too.” 

Any advice from anyone? I just don’t know how to do this seamlessly, but I’m ready for a new chapter in my life and I know that this relationship is the last string attached to the person I am trying to grow to no longer be. I just need the strength to do it.",01Sep2020,1
226,So basically it’s my girlfriends birthday Saturday and we were gonna go on a trip together and I planned on giving her a necklace. I’m only 15 and don’t have any means of making money so my mom bought me a 10 dollar one to give her. I didn’t mind at first but now after reading the reviews it turns out they break pretty easily. I really like this girl though and wanted to give her something nice but it would be so embarrassing if it broke. I don’t know what to do. I feel the need to give her something but all I have is this cheap necklace. I was looking at this $30 one but I can’t even buy that. What tf do I do Reddit :/,01Sep2020,1

232,"So I (22F) just got hired full time at a new company and started my first day. They’ll pay me generously and have great benefits and nice coworkers but my direct manager has been ringing some very scary alarm bells for me today on my first day of training. 

My HR supervisor handed me and the other new hire a pamphlet with our schedules and orientation information but there was one very odd paper allotting a three day trip plan this Labor Day weekend over where I’d be joining someone in golfing and going to a casino. I don’t golf and I’m not a fan of casinos or gambling so I don’t know why they want me to go on this trip and I’m assuming it’s not even a work trip since there were no meetings or conferences allotted and it’s a national holiday. 

The paper was written in a different language that only a few of us in the company can speak (it’s the native language of my manager) so it was very private information that I assume wasn’t for the whole company to see and when I asked the other hire if she also needed to go on the trip this weekend she said she didn’t have any sheet like that. When I showed her the paper she couldn’t read it. So then I internally started freaking out because this was very weird and I didn’t want to be getting special treatment or unwanted sexual harassment like I had gone through at my old jobs and since I seem to naturally attract creepy men because of my decent looks and kind nature. 

When my manager went through the pamphlet later while going over the schedule with the new hires he saw that paper in the mix and got really flustered and mentioned how that was a super private paper for vacation and how he would need to take it out and it shouldn’t even be there. Suppose that it was just a trip for himself, it makes little to no sense for it to be included in a general new hire pamphlet instead of his desk. I am very scared for myself this weekend since I feel like he is going to ask me to go on this trip for work and then proceed to try to coerce me into sex. I also tried to get the company to push back my start date one week since I had trouble finding housing and moving but they wouldn’t let me do that and had me come last minute. I’m wondering if it has something to do with this upcoming trip.

I had to relocate for this job over 2,000 miles from home and away from my SO, signed a 3 month lease and have very little money that I can’t just quit and go home now, especially since there are no jobs back home. I really don’t want to back out of my new job now but I am a little scared of being raped this weekend. Am I just being overly paranoid or do I have good reason to be suspicious? Is there anything you recommend me to do in this kind of situation if my gut feeling is right?",01Sep2020,1

So we were on our second night at the hotel(keep in mind we've been having sex the whole time) so we decided to have sex but she wasn't feeling into it so she said we can just use lube and I can do whatever. At first I told her we didn't have to but then she went and got the lube and said it was fine. So we had sex and after she told me that it felt wrong because she wasn't turned on. I got mad at her for not saying anything to me like saying to stop or using our safe word. She said it was fine and not a big deal.

That was about a month ago and we had a bad end to the relationship because of things she said about a friend of mine and that she wanted more of a relationship that I told her I didn't want.

242,"Was in an 8 year relationship with my gf. We broke up 9 days ago but haven't seen each other for almost a month.

I won't get in to too much detail about why we broke up. But it's a combination of mental health issues and unhappiness. Regardless she broke up with me over the phone. 

When she broke up, I asked if there was any future at all. She said I don't know. I've been holding on hope since then.

I gave her some space this week. But gave her a simple message on Sunday asking how she was. She has not replied (2 days later).

I know it's early doors, but is she ghosting me? Like I understand the concept. She's hurt too. She obviously doesn't want to speak to me or deal with the fact that I might talk about the relationship or hurt her in anyway.

But after 8 years, despite how much hurt we both feel. We shouldn't ignore each other right? Like she actively knows that ignoring me causes me intense psychological pain. Especially when I already suffer from anxiety and depression.

So what do I do? 

I feel so much pain as I still want to be with her and make it work. But she obviously does not. Or maybe she needs more.time. But I would rather her tell me. I need more time or never speak to me again, than her ghost me. Because I can deal with that at least.",01Sep2020,1

a question, they go to him, and if I answer anything for them,

I don't mind that they're dating as long as they're happy, but I also want them to be mindful of the fact that when they're at our apartment, they're in a shared space. Today, I went right from work to a family dinner (which he bailed on to hang out with her), and was looking forward to coming home and unwinding.

I felt like my options were to just lock myself in my room (the smallest in the house) or awkwardly share the living room with them and watch my show.

I never thought it was particularly problematic until I started my first full time job after college. I've now realised how serious it actually is, and I don't know what to do about it. 

I forget to do things my boss has asked me to do, I don't remember new information I get about something or that I even read / received that information. I forget important information from prior conversations. This has led to many careless mistakes, asking stupid questions, and one or two more serious mistakes.

I retained that info for all of 1 min, and promptly went back to worry about finishing the data so I could share it with said person...and did just that.

260,"Basically what the title says. I broke up with my boyfriend 2 weeks ago. It was a very weird ending and had basically no closure.

Here’s some context for what happened: 
my boyfriend went away to work at a summer camp which was meant to last two weeks. It ended up lasting 3 months (don’t ask me how that happens becayse he never told me). Throughout the entire time he was gone, he was always in a bad mood and sometimes would take things out on me. I tried my very best to be there for him and would check my phone literally every 5 minutes to see if he texted even though sometimes he would go days at a time without texting. At first I thought: well, he’s busy and might not have wifi- it’s not that he doesn’t care about me. during his last few days there he began talking to me but all we ever did was fight over text. I had found out from my friend that he had been video calling this girl who was his friend (and whom i knew). I never liked the girl as I thought she was a bit rude and had said some mean things about me TO HIM and also i noticed some sexist jokes (which i didn’t really like). Nevertheless, I didn’t say much about her to him. He knew i didn’t like her but I wasn’t going to be jealous or mad and stop him from having friends. But now with this video call i did get a little mad. He called her but couldn’t text me back these past few weeks? When I brought it up he denied it and said that he called her “when i went to sleep” even though he hadn’t texted back all day. I was already annoyed at him because he had been grumpy and lashed out at me several times throughout the months. Finally, it’s his last day. I expect things to change. I had a particularly hard day that day and I was slipping back into my depressive episodes. I told him how i felt and ranted about all the things going wrong. Usually, he would be there for me, talk me through it, and be one of the nicest people i had ever met. But this time, he says that he has it much worse than me and he goes on and on about how my pain is basically nothing compared to his. I felt belittled, and felt very invalid for my problems. I also decided I would not be ranting to him anymore based on the way I felt after that. In one of our arguments that day, I said “I just don’t want to date anymore” in the heat of the situation. One I sent it i wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to say. I thought of it as a proposal that we break up rather than an actual breakup. The next day i send him a text saying hi and he doesn’t respond. two weeks later he still hasn’t responded. Until two days ago, when he said “just here to say goodbye”. LONG STORY SHORT: we didn’t talk about anything, it was just over. He didn’t care to fight about me or say that he cared about me he just went along with it.

Now for my problem:
obviously things have been extremely difficult for me. I am in a depressive episode and I am sad or crying all day long and have long nights too. I think about him all the time, and about what happened too. That said, I’m also really upset about completely unrelated things happening in my life too. I started to think: Was that the right choice? Was I overreacting? Would things have gone back to normal if i had waited till he got home? 
And then I also think:
But he would’ve fought for us and for me if he really cared. But was it my fault for overreacting? I had overreacted before, maybe he was just sick of it? 

These types of questions circle in my head all day long and most days I wish I had never sent it.

Do i run back and ask for forgiveness? Do i leave it as it is and try to wait for it to pass? and is there anythng I can do to stop these questions from circling my head all day? How do I get closure?

261,"Cut a long story short, my trusted long term partner suddenly ghosted me for the 3 months of quarantine after taking my virginity and then came back to dump me over text (it was brutal). I am still utterly heartbroken and disillusioned. My close friends have all moved away to college while I was rejected from my wanted school and forced to stay here in my hometown. I can't get a job and am stuck at home with my alcoholic depressed parents for the next year at least. 

I am completely and utterly alone. 

I was depending solely on making friends in college clubs but now it's all online and clubs are cancelled. I can't hold up the slightest shred of optimism anymore. I genuinely do not know what to do.

I'm seriously considering killing myself. I know that things 'will get better in the future' or whatever bs but I don't think I can hold on long enough to see that. I try to get up and be positive and exercise and everything but by the end of the day I'm worn down and disappointed and cry all night. I've done nothing wrong to anyone but the universe is laughing at me and throwing down more and more shit. I promised myself 6 months ago things would improve and they've only gotten worse. 

I keep seeing stories of people partying or moving into their dorms or with their s/o making the most of this last year and its like salt to wound. If I couldn't have love or my course, at the very very least I just wanted to have friends. I tried to reconnect with some people but it's like I'm broken or something. 

I have absolutely nothing. I don't know what to do.",01Sep2020,1

266,"So I am just now starting my final year of college for a biology BS degree.  The main reason I had initially chosen this major was because it was required for a program where I could automatically go to a D.O. school if my grades did not slip up.  I had initially thought I wanted to go to a D.O. school but I am now aware that I don't want to do that.

I got kick out of that program mainly because I didn't care.  I got kicked out of it officially last school year because I had failed to get a letter of recommendation from my school's Pre Med advisor.  He did not want to give me the letter of recommendation because I did not ask for it in the first semester of freshman year.  It took a while of me bugging him after that first semester and letters to and from the D.O. school for them to finally just kick me out of the program officially.  And they finally took me out of that program spring semester of last year, when I had spent basically 3 years doing this shit major. 

My GPA is a 3.4.  I took the MCAT last week and I know I failed it.  My parents want me to do late submissions to DO and MD schools.  So I am going to have to get a bunch of letters of recommendations and lie to peoples faces that oh I want to go to med school.  I don't want to do that.  

I think the only thing I would want out of life is to be self sufficient.  I don't know what the fuck I'm going to be able to do with a biology degree other than research.  If my lab classes have taught me anything, its that I am going to be shit at that.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know what is a well paying major that has overlap with a bio degree.  I don't know how to get my parents to stop telling me to pursue this thing I don't give a shit about.  I don't want to deal with this mess I created.  I don't want to deal with the only face to face human interaction I get being my parents nagging me to do what they think is best for me.  I can't even hate them because I know they want what they think is best for me.  At this point all I feel like doing is sleeping.",01Sep2020,1

271,"Hi there, 

Without getting into too much detail, I was recently diagnosed with a rare neurologist condition. It is completely benign, but I have a really hard time functioning and break down crying from the stress of dealing with it 2-3x a week. It took over 2 years to get a diagnosis, with most doctors dismissing me as stress ( it is not stress related) 

Fast forward to now: I finally have a diagnosis, and I need to book an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in this type of disorder. My parents won’t book anything, stating that “ a neurologist will put me on meds and those have side effects” “ I didn’t try other methods throughly” - these methods include a chiropractor ( which I hate being touched in any way but went three times to please them and had panic attacks every time without any improvement on my symptoms  ) and herbal supplements. I’m all for natural remedy’s, but there isn’t even anecdotal evidence that they will work so I don’t see the point in not following up with an actual medical professional as well . I keep begging for appointments and they keep saying that”  it’s too much emotional energy”. I know they love me, and that they are just scared to do anything, but I’m suffering. I want to be normal again. 

How do I approach the subject with them again? Should I just wait until I’m 18 and seek my own medical care?

This may sound racist but please read more before taking any actions. My whole life I've been made fun of for looking Arabic, i'm a little Indian and mostly Caucasian, but my hair texture and face shape makes me look Arabic i guess. every time i get in an argument someone brings up ""oh what are you gonna do bomb me?"" it's funny but damn it hurts cause its not like i can just change people making jokes. I went to an Arabic barber and he asked if i was Arabic because it seemed like i was in his opinion. I've been made fun of for it by friends parents plenty of times,""Faze Rug"" i get that one a lot. I don't know, is there anyway to change how i look or is it necessary because i'm going into high school and it can only get worse from here. i can attach a picture of myself but wouldn't that be against the rules or just weird? i could just attach a picture of my hair maybe but is there a way to just change me coming off as Arabic? maybe certain hair dye? my hairs completely black and Arabic texture.

We have a 7yo son and both my husband and I are high risk for covid.   
She was initially shocked we would ask her to
quarantine and thought that meant just staying in a bedroom in our house.    We said NO.  That means a hotel or air bnb or whatever.    She agreed.

pick her up at the airport???  We said THAT IS NOT OK and is not quarantine!

274,"Hey everyone. So, as my title states, I’ve been feeling extremely lonely since I’ve started my senior year of nursing school. I have never felt this lonely going back to school. I am an RA on top of the nursing major so I have TONS of contact with other humans. Except I just feel. So. Fucking. Lonely. 

I’m thinking that some of this has to do with being away from my boyfriend. We started dating a year ago on 9/26, so we were doing a long distance relationship until this past “summer” (March-August for us college folks that got kicked out in the US from the dorms bc of the virus) when we were living together. During this time, our relationship grew a lot since we went from barely seeing each other one day a week for a few hours, to living with each other. 

Ever since I moved back to college away from my bf,  I literally feel like my other half is missing. I can’t sleep, I haven’t been eating, and I barely feel the desire to carry out my daily tasks. I go to therapy weekly, exercise nearly daily, and socialize as much as I can to try to fix this funk I’m in. Except I feel myself getting more and more depressed with each passing day. I literally bawled my eyes out for 45 minutes before posting this because I’ve been feeling so lonely.

Long story short, we reconnected through a mutual friend. We talked on the phone for the first time ever yesterday. He's a bachelor with no wife and kids, in a different state. I told him that we lived in a different town than he had thought. We had a really great conversation, and I think that he's a super cool dude. He didn't say anything bad about my mom, he just said she was drinking a lot when they dated (and I know for a FACT she is the meanest drunk I've ever met). We have a lot in common... including our intense, mildly obsessive and high strung personalities.

Anyway, he's been liking my old photos on fb and sending them to me even with heart emojis. Sending very sweet messages too. But has been talking to me a lot, sending pics of his day etc. but I'm kind of wanting to take this slower. My friends say that this is normal for someone who just found out that they had a daughter (and who is also a boomer who doesn't know FB etiquette) but because of the narrative my mom sent me, there's a bit of fear involved.

286,"Hi all, I'm not really sure how to start this since it's kind of embarrassing to admit so I'll just come out and say it: my boyfriend (22m) and I (23f) are slobs. I used to be quite clean but since moving into my house and renovating it everything was always a mess so cleaning fell by the wayside. My boyfriend has always been messy and moved in during the renovations so I never really had a problem with it. We always cleaned up when we had guests over but left it messy the rest of the time because it's just us. Plus there was no point cleaning up because there was always paint, sawdust, tools, screws, timber, plaster dust etc everywhere.

The issue is I'm starting to get annoyed and renovations are winding down. I'm struggling to get back into a habit of cleaning regularly and I'm now noticing he has some foul habits. He leaves uncovered food out EVERYWHERE on the bench, in the lounge, on the stove, in the fridge, just anywhere. I've tried to combat this by buying new food storage containers and leaving the glad wrap out on the bench so he can use it easily but it doesn't matter. He also always has lollies and leaves them on his bedside table. They drop in the night and he never notices, so we have ants under the bed at all times. There's many more issues like this, I've asked him to stop doing this so many times but he just says sorry and doesnt change. 

I feel really underappreciated because I'm always doing the cooking and always doing the cleaning and he never ever says thankyou or does any of it. If I ask him to stack the dishwasher for example, he'll do it. But never on his own, it always needs prompting. I'm just sick of always asking or always doing it myself. It would be really nice to just come home one day and have the kitchen benches wiped. We both work full time as well, so I don't think I'm being unreasonable. 

The other problem is, when I talk to him he says sorry then acts really upset and sooks about it. I hate it so much because I feel like I can't have a proper conversation with him he acts like a baby anytime I bring it up. I try really hard to be nice about it, but no matter how I approach it it's always the same. And I'm starting to feel annoying by constantly complaining about the state of the place and asking him to do things. Even when we do it together it's the same, like last weekend I said ""let's clean the house"" and while I was working and doing what I could see needed to be done, he needed to be prompted to do everything. I feel like I've tried everything I can think of and would really appreciate any advice about how to handle this.

288,"I just got graduated, and I have just found a job. Two weeks ago, due to some reason, I needed a loan, but at that time, I didn’t have any credit card, or job, so the banks rejected my loan, then I turned to rely on the loan platform online, where I found an individual who said that they could give me a loan, and I was so happy, that I could finally get a loan, and pay them back by month. They told me to send them my bank accounts, which include withdrawing cards and the passwords, I was so happy, and didnt think much, so I did so. But a few days later, I found out there were some transaction going in and out, I asked them immediately, and they replied me that they were just checking if my accounts were normal. But the next day, I thought about this, and go on google to search some information, and found out that they were likely a scam, and they are using my accounts to scam others money, so I got so terrified, and deleted the chat history in terror. I was so scared that I might get involved, and didn’t even think twice about maybe those history is something that may prove my innocence. But I still made a call to the banks to froze my accounts, and called the police. 
And a few days before, the bank called me, and said that my bank accounts was reported as scam by the police, and I may be in the lawsuit in the future. For something I didn’t even do, but I have no way to prove it. 
I am so scared, now I have told my parents for help, but I am still so afraid that the court wouldn’t believe everything I have said, which is reasonable.

Given that they will paying for a good chunk of my tuition should save them some money and go to the local full scholarship or go against them and move farther away.",01Sep2020,1
297,"Hi, so a little bit of background. I'm 24.5 years old, and I came out as trans (mtf) when I was 13. 

I grew up In a staunch Republican and religious household, I knew when i came out that my relationship with my family would probably be changed forever. However, I never thought that after more than 11 years later nothing would really change. Some of my family will still dead name me, none use my correct pronouns. The most I get is a 'compromised' neutral nickname, and weird avoidance of any use of pronouns, but only sometimes. My parents literally refer to me as 'child' and have never acknowledged me as their daughter, or ever used my preferred, (now legal for 4 years) name. 

My parents forced me to go to a religious conversion therapist for a time when I was 14-15. They have never acknowledged how damaging that was to my mental health, and simply say ""past in the past."" They only stoped taking to her, when I had a massive breakdown prior to one apointment, and straight up refused to leave the bathroom.

My one sister and her husband don't let me have any sort of relationship, or sometimes even be in the same room as their children. It intensified even more once I started bringing around a boyfriend. Her husband has even threatened violence on me in the past. He also suggested a few times to my parents that they should send me to one of thoose 'jesus camps.'

My grandparents essentially don't recognize my transistion at all, and even say I grew up big and handsome, even though I look absolutely nothing like my dad, and have fucking tits. 

They've all, besides one sister, have never offered me any help, and my parents only started taking me to a proper therapist after multiple breakdowns in 8th grade, and me literally almost starving myself to death in high school. 

To this day, they all wonder why I avoid family gatherings, why I don't speak unless spoken too. And I know in my heart they're all still hoping one day I'll realize my 'mistake,' and how I did 'so much damage' to the family.

To me though, the worst part is I've been in a 3 year relationship with my current boyfriend. His parents and family are so nice to me, they genuinely seem concerned about my health, the want an actual relationship, and they feel more like family than my own has in what feels like a lifetime ago.

Still, I can't get myself to cut them out. I feel like I have this vain hope that some day they will actually accept me. I think too I still have some gratitude because they never kicked me out, and atleast let me dress the way I wanted to. I always tell myself, it could've been worse, but I also can't say that everything they did was forgivable, and especially not forgettable. I just feel like they see me more as a confused 'boy' who made a mistake and will eventually come back. Nathan was part of the family, but I, Natalie, am not.

298,"This sounds ungrateful or something but for some context, I’m closeted [M16] and my father is homophobic. I’m from a separated family so I live with my dad and step mom. I think I have a subconscious resentment from my family in general because they just backstab each other over and over. — Because of this I found that distancing myself from everyone and being a more private person comforts me. Anyway my dad FORCES me to eat dinner with everyone else. He would tear down my door if he could. I hate this it makes me want to never eat dinner with them. He would literally go really mad if I didn’t go down on time. His reasoning for this is because he wants me to socialize with the family and not feel like a stranger. How do I tell my dad this isn’t the right way to approach me and that it’s actually pushing me away from him further? Or maybe he’s right? I don’t know but I want him to stop I dread dinner now so so so much.",01Sep2020,1

301,"I grew up in a lower-middle class family. We didn't struggle financially, but we were definitely in the bottom-half of income for families of the kids in my high school. I learned to save, invest, and I took advantage of the housing market crash (and a career in the military) to inch toward my dream of buying a home on the lake. Now I'm about to close on a $1M home and I'm reluctant to tell anyone. Everytime I'm asked what the address is, I conveniently forget to say so they don't look it up on Zillow or something and see the price tag. In reality, it's embarrassing.
I'm extremely blessed, and I want to share the blessing that I have with others. I grew up going to the lake, and some of my best memories were going to the lake with my family (that could no way afford a place like this) and childhood friends. I want to pay that opportunity forward to others - friends, friends with kids, church members, veterans, and my extended family.
But, it's really hard for me to disclose the address to others. I think it's that I don't want to be judged (""oh man... he's bitten off more than he can chew""..."" he's going to be housepoor""...etc.), and I don't want people to think I'm conceited with a house like this. 
I want to be excited and share the excitement with my wife, but it feels like we've had to hide it. So far, we have shared with our parents and some close friends, and we always receive intense reactions... ""Holy geez!,"" ""What the F!?!,"" people generally getting very quiet, 40 questions about being housepoor, etc. My wife and I hate dealing with this.

After we finished our sets, I ask what his name was. We'll call him Mike. Mike is extremely muscular and black and Im dominately Korean and the same size as him. After asking for his name he asks for mine and I tell him ""ryan.""

Then he says ""Keanu?""
And I reply ""No, ryan.""
He repeats ""Keanu?"" While laughing

And then he says, ""you know cause you're Asian? You know karate and all that right?"" And starts laughing hysterically. He then says ""Hopefully that's not racist""

306,"Hello, I’m not new but this is my first post to reddit so any and all comments are welcome. So here is some background, I am the third youngest among all of my siblings and am currently next in line to leave as I am a highschool junior but I am currently in middle college/dual enrollment program. Me and my mom have had a rocky relationship with us butting heads often to opposing ideals and often having to be separated with no contact for days at a time. Some time ago she went to have breast reduction surgery came home with the same attitude she always carries. During that time I had grasped a basic idea of her situation and with me trying to be rational I try to stay out of her way. 

This soon took a quick turn, previous to that time she had borrowed money from me and I had no issue with her paying me back as I though she would get the money to me when she got it to me and I let it go. Going back to the day from her return from surgery she begins cooking and hears me on the phone in my room. During this time I am speaking with my friend regarding more money I’ve saved up and how I was planning on spending it. She then bursts into my room scolding me about how she’ll return my money she borrowed and to stop holding it over her head. I then defended myself having done nothing wrong and told her my conversation had nothing to do with her. We were both yelling at this point so she was then angry at me for raising my voice so she slams my door and proceeds to shout obscenities at me from outside. I call her stupid for her life choices and then she proceeds to burst back into the room with a broom and begins to assault me with it. I then grab the broom and heavily jerk it away from myself and she stumbles back. Now me being larger than heron weight and height and her obviously being weakened from surgery this already looks bad. She then proceeds to get in my face spitting and saying things like “you might as well kill yourself” and “you should have bought a gun with your money because you’re dead”.

Me knowing what she means( my older brothers who are in their 20’s and my entire family taking her side) I begin to panic. She knows that she can get away with lying as she often does and proceeds to spit more obscenities as my two younger siblings are watching in sheer disgust. I then return to my room and hear her shouting on the phone to other family members, twisting the story to better suit her and I just curl in my bed and sulk. The next few weeks turn out to be the worst as I am shunned by all and was slapped by my uncle who I’ve been really cool with (and still am.) Most have come to let the situation go but my mom never did.  Fast foreword to today I am on skype with my girlfriend and my mom returns from taking a class 6 hours away with being out from the previous night on a date (even though she is still married). She walks in with an attitude as her normal and proceeds to tell me to clean the kitchen. As I obviously don’t want to be embarrassed in front of my company, I ask her to please let me take care of it in a few minutes as cleaning the kitchen doesn’t take much time and after she got upset to let it go as I walk away and begin to clean the kitchen. She then proceeds to tell me don’t talk to her that way and that I need to get out and she expects me to find somewhere else to live in a few days. Keep in mind She tells me this as I’m already in the kitchen cleaning away. She then proceeded to threaten and say that next she will put her hands on me even though I’ve completely let the situation go. So that brings me to the end, for now. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated.",01Sep2020,1
308,"Okay, I’m going to preface this by noting I’m not the best writer so I’m sorry for any errors.

Me(f19) and ex(m18), who I’ll call Bob, dated for 5 months. It wasn’t a messy breakup, he just told me he was “no longer interested”. Not sure if these are true but I’ve been told he said numerous negative things about how I am in bed.

My current bf(m19), who I’ll call John, used to be friends with Bob and they still sometimes talk because they play vg together. Anyways, really recently, about a week ago, Bob hit me up trying to be friends with me and wanting to play games together. I had no problems with this because I missed him as a friend and wanted to be on good terms. He even invited me to hang out with him on his bday, I was gonna go this Friday but now I’m not so sure. He was always wanting to call me and play with me and overall just being really nice to me. Looking back on it, it was really weird, but I was excited so I didn’t really think about the logistics. Anyways, John messages me this morning saying that Bob said I’m always hitting on him and he told John to get a hold of his girl. Basically, Bob told John that I’m an annoying slut. PLEASE TELL ME WHY BOB DID THIS???",01Sep2020,1
309,"We met two years ago in a college class (Fall 2018). I’m usually shy and have a hard time making friends and rarely find people attractive right away. But I was immediately drawn to her, and knew I had to go way out of my comfort zone, face my social anxiety, and ask her on a date. After sleuthing to confirm she wasn’t straight, which I was already 99% sure of from intuition, I asked her out, she said yes, and the first date was great. We talked and laughed for hours. We hugged. And we kept hanging out in the weeks and months after that. I was pretty sure she liked me back, but it wasn’t super clear if her feelings were romantic. We went on what felt like “dates” several times, and at one point I checked in with her and told her I wanted to keep going on dates but understood if she just saw me as a friend, and she said she didn’t get romantic feelings easily but wanted to see where it went. The only time she made a move was when we were at a party with her friends sitting next to each other and she put her hand around my waist. That felt intimate, and I snuggled closer to show her I liked it, but nothing like that ever happened again, because shortly after she dropped a bomb on me. 

One day when we were hanging out, she casually brought up this friend of hers and the fact that she was in love with him. She went on and on talking about him and asked my advice. I was, obviously, shocked and crushed. But I went along with it and didn’t tell her how I felt because I figured that meant she just had no idea how I felt. To this day, I’m confused about the whole situation. I guess she doesn’t know that I liked her so much? It’s all very confusing to me. 

Anyways. After that I struggled for a long time, and our friendship faded a little bit (Summer 2019), but we eventually reconnected and actually became roommates (Fall 2019). At that point, I was surprised by how much I had moved on from her romantically. I really thought moving in would be fine because I saw her purely as a friend and felt good boundaries between us. That continued for like six months of us living together. 

Then, eventually I realized I loved her again (February 2020). I love her so deeply, but I know that she doesn’t love me back, and she never will. In many ways, we are not compatible, and we wouldn’t be romantically/sexually compatible based on the things she’s told me about herself. It’s pretty clear by now that she’s just not attracted to me. If something were going to happen between us, I think it would have already happened by now. And I honestly don’t know if we could ever have a healthy relationship beyond friends. Plus, I think she’s definitely way too good for me and out of my league. 

Basically, I need your advice on whether or not I should tell her. We just moved out of our apartment together, so we live apart now. I’m trying really hard to improve myself, including expanding my social life outside of just her, which she knows and appreciates. I’m in so much pain because of my feelings for her, and at the end of the day, she is my best friend, and it’s starting to feel weird hiding this from her. But I’m worried that telling her is selfish, because it will drag her into this and put stress on her for no reason. If I told her, I’d write her a note and give it to her when I see her someday soon. 

What should I do? Would you want to know if you were her? And if I tell her, what should I say?

TL;DR: Should I tell my best friend I’m in love with her even though I know there’s no chance she loves me back?",01Sep2020,1

328,"Every accident I've gotten in has always been near misses.

Maybe Ill get shit for this but If I don't look hurt, I still feel like that affects someone almost as much as an actual accident. Most of mine involve someone not yielding or seeing me and putting me in a situation where if I don't make the right move at the right time I will die. 

Today I was taking a protected left. Someone ran the red light as I was turning and I saw them at the perfect time to floor it halfway through the turn, lay on my horn and accelerate through, as if were to  slow down I would have been t boned. I laughed maniacally right after it happened then an hour later almost had a feeling of panic. A majority of my dreams involve driving. Sometimes I get dreams where I die in car crashes or get in brutal or minor accidents. Sometimes the dreams consist of me driving, but very badly and not being able to control the vehicle, despite knowing how to drive. Sometimes Ill wake up and actually believe I got into an accident because the dreams were so vivid, as if they somehow are able to temporarily latch onto your memory for a short period before reality overrides it.

I rarely get anxious while driving or before driving and am a pretty confident. I tend to take the stoic take it head on approach. Certain moves people do startle me out of reflex and my friends notice that I hover my hand over the horn when I there's a potential of someone not yielding to me.

I want to change my life but am I stuck in the same cycles. I don't know what to do anymore. I am not a good person, I do not deserve love, I have bad behaviours I am conscious of yet do them anyway. My life is an endless cycle of failure. Sorry if this is depressing",01Sep2020,1

332,"!THIS IS A REPOST! there were too many typos and unimportant things so i went through and redid it! 

Throwaway account. 

This one is little bit of a doozy, so please bare with me. I'm a 19 year old girl who is currently in quite a rough situation. So about a month ago, I was forced to come out as a lesbian and forced to tell everyone from my girlfriend's (19F) family that we were dating. We were forced to come out during a small road trip that her mom (45F) planned with the three of us so then she could finally figure out what was going on between us. We were traumatized. Going 75 miles down a highway and being forced to come out because you have no other option is just... horrible. So, obviously, my girlfriend and I were in a pretty tough spot after that. Well, a few days after that happened, my girlfriend got into a fight with her mom, which ended with my gf having a panic attack so bad she had to be hospitalized. I found her hyperventilating on the floor and she couldn't talk to me. I still have nightmares of that day.

Ever since my girlfriend was released from the hospital, we haven't left each other's side. She ended up living at my house for a week so then her mom had time to move out before her dad (51M) got back from his work trip. The only time we separate is when she goes to work. But here's where the situation gets messy. My family still does not know I am in a relationship or that I am gay. Which makes their understanding of this situation a bit difficult. They don't understand why my girlfriend had the attack and why she had to live at our house for a week afterwards. They don't get why I come home at 5 am, go to bed till 10 am, do chores, eat, get ready and then leave again at 4 pm everyday. I've being doing this every week day for a few weeks. And they are pissed at me. My mom (45F) is absolutely furious with me. She is so angry that I am never home and that ""all I do is sleep"" and I ""never do anything around the house"". I'm the middle child of the family and all my siblings still live at home. So being the middle child means that I am the sole caretaker of the house. I make sure the laundry is done, I make sure the dishes are done, I make sure my sister (17F) is doing her school work, I do everything. So with me not being there, the house is falling apart. And my mom is mad.

My mom and I have never had a good relationship since she's verbally abuses me to the point where I now have multiple mental illnesses because of her. And being home means that all she does trash talk me and get mad at me for shit I don't do and for being unemployed (had to quit my job because they were treating me like shit and my mental health has been so bad). So being home is hard. And going to my gf's house where everyone there accepts me and actually enjoys my company is better. Her dad and step mom love me (yes, my gf, her mom, dad, and step mom all lived under one roof at one point. gotta love losing your job because of everything going on.) and don't care about me spending time at their house. We cook, clean, buy dinner, go grocery shopping, and do whatever they need. So it's a pretty good trade off. 

The thing I need advice on is, I am starting to feel bad about not being home. At first I didn't care because the sole thing I was worried about was my girlfriend and making sure she was okay since she was not the mental state to care for herself (she's doing better now), but now the comments are weighing down on me and are making me feel guilty. My mom won't stop commenting on how I need to be home and I need to do this and I need to do that. But with the way that my mental health is right now, my girlfriend and I separating for just one night sounds like a panic attack for me. So just spending time away from my girlfriend is not an option. (yes, i know that is not healthy but i can't afford therapy) My mom hates my girlfriend and does everything in her power to make her uncomfortable, so my gf hates staying at my house and would much rather not spend time there. I just don't know what to do. I'm just stuck. I don't know if I just keep doing what I'm doing and making my mom mad. Or if I should just talk to my girlfriend about being at my house more. So any advice would be appreciated. My apologies for the long post and feel free to ask any questions.


TL;DR My mom is making me feel terrible for leaving every day to take care of my girlfriend after she suffered and massive panic attack and still struggles everyday.",01Sep2020,1

Typically what I do is set aside 300 into savings, 40 goes to my mom to help with gas, and about 100 I set to spend on whatever I want, then the rest I just keep in my account(Probably isn't the smartest thing to do but whatever)

We don't have wifi in our apartment complex, and it's become a huge burden. Not just in terms of entertainment, but my school as well. I'm trying to get my associates degree in Cybersecurity and it's super difficult to do assignments in not oy those classes but my others with just my mobile data hotspot.

I can't always just go to a place that has wifi becuase I can't drive legally and we only have 1 car.

Should I step up and start paying for wifi or is there anothe possible solution?

Again, I know this sounds like a first world problem, but I'm going to end up failing my classes if this continues and st this point all the emails I've written to my instructors, it sounds like I'm a bad student making an excuse.

I’ve always told them that I would never kill myself. And I still don’t think I ever will. I’m too scared of what happens after death to do that. 

But it’s scaring me that their starting to pop up now. I’ve never had them before mostly because I’ve had fun things to distract myself like music, video games, and youtube.

. I’ve had them while I’ve been doing this new job. I started two weeks ago and my life has just gotten more stressful since. It happens when I’m doing outside maintenance or dish washing when I’m alone and just hating life. I get stuck in these thoughts and it takes me a lot of effort to hold in tears when I’m there at work.

I still don’t think I’d ever kill myself. They’re only “what if” types of questions. But I’m scared that it will only get worse and I have absolutely no idea how to tell them considering that I’ve always said that I don’t have these thoughts.

339,"Hello everyone,

I’ve made a lot of realizations lately, correcting a lot of bad habits and thinking. 
I feel that I need to contribute more into the world, but I’m a little lost. I’ve been blessed by the VA with my 100% disability which has allowed me to secure stable housing, healthcare access that I needed, and the time for myself to “get right”. Yeah, well, I’m pulling myself along but I’m missing some “purpose”. I’ve tried to secure a lot of jobs in the past few years (since I got out of the Navy in 2016) and I just cannot find myself working for anybody right now. I don’t know what it is, I get really anxious, I freak out, and then I don’t show. I have a lot of daily anxiety from underlying mental health conditions. Sometimes I can’t even show up to the interview. It’s just frightening at some point i guess. However, I haven’t been completely lazy. I have found enjoyment driving for Uber, DoorDash, Postmates, Instacart. Heck, I’ve even tried a few other apps. I like working for myself. I know we’ve all seen the YouTube ads, and the Amazon books, DIY everything.. a lot of it. I have been interested in these amazon stores, drop shipping, passive income ideas but I’m not entirely sure if they’ll work. Maybe one of those “once in a million” ideas. 
Now that I secured my housing again, I feel that I should do something again. I could find a job doing something technical.. but I haven’t worked my field since I left. 

What would you suggest?

Thanks a ton. - Ben",01Sep2020,1

This is kind of a secret of mine, but I’ve always wanted to paint a girl’s nails. When I date someone, I like pampering her because I want her to feel pretty and I enjoy the personal time we spend together. I already know how to braid, do ponytails, and brush gently enough to get tangles out. I did this pretty frequently with my ex and we both enjoyed it. 

Eventually, I got curious and asked if I could try to paint her nails.  I know how to do it from years of watching my sisters, so it’s not like I’d go in there and start slopping polish all over the place. When I finally worked up the nerve to ask, she told me it would be “kind of gay” and honestly I’ve been embarrassed to ask ever since. 

Eventually I will get the opportunity again, and I want to ask. I’m a little more mature now, and my self-confidence is much higher than it was. Still, I don’t want to embarrass myself again. So women of reddit:

344,"Warning: a lot of this is aimless venting, sorry

I’m sitting alone in my bed, in my shitty room in a shitty house in a shitty neighborhood. I’m 21 years old, working the same job I’ve been working since high school. I dropped out of college and I only have a year’s worth of credits towards a degree. All my friends are already graduating and I’m 3 years away from a degree. 

I’ve spent the last three years in a horrifying manic depressive state, triggered when I was 18 and about to graduate high school. I’ve never had a girl/boyfriend for more than a few months, I’ve only had maybe 3 real friends my entire life. 

I spent endless hours alone in my basement playing video games instead of socializing. I had really bad social anxiety and self esteem issues after being violently bullied, and borderline molested, by 8th graders while I was in 6th grade. So, I shut down and didn’t put myself out there. 

I had a group of people I hung out with, but I was never really friends with any of them. I always felt a little more sensitive and emotional than them, so I felt out of place. Nothing against them: they were just different people than me I guess. 

I never got to be close with anyone. I never got to be what I wanted to be: someone who’s there for people, who looks after and loves them. I wanted to make relationships with other sensitive/artistic types, but I was paralyzed by fear of judgement and rejection. I’d have casual acquaintances I really liked and talked to often, but I never pushed anything further into a friendship or relationship. 

So, I went off to college, only 15 minutes from my hometown: manically depressed, feeling like I was in constant danger. The first year went by in a blur. I failed half my classes and dropped out early. Did the same first semester of my sophomore year. At that point I was suspended from the University. I had a disastrous, embarrassing relationship with a high school friend and crush, where my depression caused me to behave erratically, and now she’s afraid to be near me. 

I basically spent another 6 months teetering on the brink of suicide. Then, I slowly started getting better. I don’t really remember how it happened, but by the following spring(2019), I was feeling *not horrible*. I decided I wanted to go on a really adventurous trip. I spent the summer saving up and went on a 2 month backpacking trip. I had some great experiences, and some shitty experiences. Then, I got home. It was traumatizing to be back in my hometown, where all that shitty stuff happened to me, after forgetting about my life for 2 months. My depression came back in waves. Some days were okay, others were bad. I went back to my old job, and I was back in the rut. That’s where I find myself now. 

I just don’t want to be weighed down with regrets. I want to move forward in my life and not look back. How might I do that? Thank you.",01Sep2020,1

They also argue a lot like it won’t be to weird to wake up either early morning or late night to them arguing and some other things that bug me is that he  has threatened to throw things at my mom and when he gets upset and make a mess of things like I used to have a bad habit of leaving tea bags out and one day he apparently ripped them up and spewed them around and the only reason I knew about this is because he told me and I could see some remnants of what happened and I find that weird because he never brought up that I forgot to do it and it seem to have only punished my mom for my actions i find this weird and concerning

351,"I (M14) did some pretty bad stuff towards my friends. I apologized, but they still really hate me for the things I did. They're my only friends, and if they exile me from their friend group, I'll go back to being a friendless loser. 

To preface this, my friend group is pretty large. We all met up with eachother through school. We all now contact each other through Discord.

To sum up the terrible things I did, for one I tried hitting on this girl that one of my closer friends invited to our Discord server. I was just looking to possibly get to know her and date her (I know it sounds bad, but it gets worse). 

Later on, everybody found out about my intentions with this girl and people started DMing me, asking if I was into 8 year olds. It turns out this girl that I tried to hit on was 8 YEARS OLD!!! 

Now everyone in my friend group thinks that I'm a pedophile who goes after any girl he sees. In reality, I'm not a pedophile! But I must admit, I may have problems relating to obsessing over girls.

That's just problem 1. Problem 2 is just as bad.

There's this other girl in our discord server. We'll call her K. Ironically, me and K actually liked each other romantically, but we never dated because she found out about my perverted side of my personality. That was a major turn off for her.

Another friend, we'll call him Tito, actually had a crush on K, just like I did. Me, another friend, and Tito all made a group chat to help Tito try and get K. 

At one point, K took a break from our friend group. When she came back this is what I said.

""Now that K is back from her break, how should Tito make his first move?""

This was the absolute worst thing to say. First of all, K may not have been over me by the time I said this, so having Tito go in and try to hit on Korine would have been disastrous. Also, this was a very inconsiderate thing to say, because I wasn't thinking about K's feelings.

The other friend that was in this group chat took a screenshot of what I said, and sent it to another friend. This friend, for some reason, showed the screenshot to K.

After K saw the screenshot, she blocked me and avoids me when I get in a Discord VC.

These two events happened within hours of each other. It was the worst day of my life. 

I know what I did wrong. I tried apologizing to my friends, but they won't seem to apologize. They belittle me constantly over what I did. Perhaps that's what I deserve.

K won't even accept an apology. What's funny is that after she was done with her break, she said she would be happy to be friends with me. Directly after that, I made my 2 shitty mistakes. It's so horribly ironic.

My friends all hate me, and I've been feeling empty and sad and guilty. I want to right my wrongs, but my friends don't seem to care. What exactly do I do in this situation? Would finding new friends be a good idea?",01Sep2020,1
352," 

As the title says, I'm considering coming out as gay to my little brother but IDK if I should.

I'm gay and 18. I was outed to my parents at 14 and while it wasn't very good, it could've been way worse. Wyen they first found out, they prohibited me from telling anyone, specially him.

The last 2 years I have come out to most of the people who I wanted to tell except for him. He's 4 years younger than me, and he is the one single thing I care the most in the world. I don't know whether I could handle losing him, but I also don't want to hide myself from him for the rest of my life.

My parents have improved since I first came out. They accept that I'm gay, even though they don't fully like it. They still want me to hide it from everyone and hate whenever I show it. Hell, my mom and I had a fight a while ago cause I bought rainbow socks (in the end she let me keep them as long as they're hidden). I hide everything LGBT related from them cause I know they'd dislike it, but at least now I know they would be annoyed at the object, not me.

That parragraph was a bit counterproductive, but my point is that they are slowly improving. Now I know they wouldn't harm me or kick me out for showing I'm gay.

If I managed to tell my brother, I could finally stop hiding it on my household to a degree. Sure, my parents wouldn't like me having a flag on my room, but at least it would be possible. I could finally be me on my own house (tried to move away for college and a fucking pandemic happened).

But now, there's him: 15 and I have absolutely no idea how he feels about the topic. My parents don't allow me to bring up LGBT topics at home, so I haven't been able to k ow naturally. I'd have to ask him directly, and I have no idea how to do that.

But I want him to know. If he knew, the hardest part would be over. The one person I've been the most afraid of telling (I will never tell my grandparents or extended family unless something big happens, for I know they'd react poorly as much as it pains me.

My birthday is coming soon and I am considering telling him then, but I don't know whether I shoud. On one side, I could be finally be out to the people I care about. Hell, I could finally wear something rainbow without being terrified and enter my baby gay stage (jk... kinda).

On the other side, I could lose the thing I care the most about.

And I have no idea what are the chances of each.

361,"Hi, I'm currently 16, in highschool and I'm not doing that well, our school has a grad plan where you can either plan on going straight into the workforce, or you can go into a college, due to my past failures I'm unable to take the college plan, I was just wondering how important that is if I want to go into college, and eventually med school? also does anyone have advice for me going forward?",01Sep2020,1
362,"I’m 18 and the last few years have been depressing. In high school I was “the man” and community college life has been depressing. I mean I pass my grades and stuff but I just struggle with my mental health. A lot of old friends go to school with me but none of them reach out to me to hang or anything. 

My best friend is probably my stuffed Curious George doll I’ve had since I was a baby. Today my brother took it from me and killed him. I can’t explain it but he just feels different and it makes me feel awful. Is there any tips to being less sad. I just feel like the last thing that brought me comfort is gone.",01Sep2020,1
363,Hey y’all I really need advice on this. I’m young but for some reason I don’t feel attraction to guys my age only men significantly older. I don’t act on it because I know it’s unhealthy and almost 100 percent sure this stems from issues with my father but I hate opening up and don’t want to go to therapy so I don’t know what to do with myself. Is there any way that I can undo this on my own?,01Sep2020,1
366,"One day my bro and I were just chilling, we started talking about memories, school fight, and stuff of that nature and how he had never been in a street fight, i guess i tempted him because he was telling me how he kind of got in a fight at football practice but in my opinion that wasnt a real fight, so he said lets fight me and you then, i wasnt gonna back down so i said ok lets get the boxing gloves on and lets see who wins, he completely kicked my ass and things havent been the same ever since, i let him know how I felt embarrassed and humiliated because I lost but things just arent the same, I feel like hes so happy and proud of what he did and he doesnt feel sorry. He later told me he was mad at me but he never told me, he let it all out during that fight and now i just feel awkward around him and dont really wanna hang out with him or talk to him but he does. Weve been best friends since 4th grade(almost 13 years now) and i just dont know if i should avoid him to deal with these feelings myself or tell him about it but i dont know what to say anymore. I dont know what to do",01Sep2020,1
367,"I had an terrible day today. I had a critical test for college that least 4 hours and after I’ve finished my mother and I had a pretty bad fight. I was so anxious and it’s been 3 days that I don’t sleep well because of this damn test, so I’m mentaly and physicaly exausted. After hearing my mom’s shouts and she ignoring me I firstly started crying, then shaking, then taquycardia, then wanting to throw up, then formication in my arms and legs, I couldn’t even close my hands... My throat was closed I had a hard time breathing... It was awful... I called my doctor he said that I was having a panic attack and he teached me some breathing exercises and gave me a calmative. I got better but although i’m very sleepy right now whenever I close my eyes I start crying all over again. I never thought that someday in my life I would have this attack. How can I deal with it? How to calm myself? I need to rest but I can’t",01Sep2020,1
368,"I am a 26 year old working mom, who manages a retail store and a graphic design business. I also bring my 8 month old to work with me, which is 4 days a week 20 hours a week, not including the hours I put in on my computer and working with clients via telephone. I am so blessed to be able to bring him with me. He is a serious trooper and tags along with me every where I go! We are together 24/7. But it also means I am unable to give 100% of myself to my career/businesses at this point in my life because my #1 priority are my kids and they require a lot of time, energy and sacrifice. Despite this, I’m still successful in my professional life. I have a four year old son, who I share with my ex 60/40 schedule, so I have him on my three days off a week. I also take care of the following responsibilities...grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, caretaking and laundry with very little to no help. I make enough money to pay for all my business expenses, car payment, car insurance, phone bill, house utilities, groceries, gas, outings and whatever my kids need (clothes, diapers, etc). I never ask my partner for help financially, physically, or emotionally. I rarely get a a positive reaction when I do, so I’ve learned to deal on my own. My partner pays the rent, which his VA disability covers (but every single month before rent is due, he always asks me if I have money to pitch in. Even if I do, I say no because I think all the things I do are ENOUGH). I assume all the household responsibilities without complaining. I enjoy cleaning and love keeping my house on point, so I never rub it in his face or ask for help. My partner also works 6 days a week, 40 hours a week and makes over three times our monthly rent. He leaves around the same time we wake up in the mornings and when he comes home in the evenings, he spends a few minutes saying hi, showers and then relaxes for the rest of the night. Drinks a few beers, binges on the latest show and snacks hard. He thinks when I ask him for help cleaning the dishes after dinner or giving the kids a bath, he is convinced I’m trying to power trip him, which I don’t understand. Then when I tell him I don’t understand what he means, he says, “You know exactly what I mean. Don’t do that. Don’t pretend.” The way I see it, is that these minimal things I ask is the least he could do. It’s not even for me, it’s for his son! I’ve tried for months every which way to personally connect with him, encourage him to bond with our son, provide the perfect opportunity to show up but he has shown to be unreliable, inconsistent and uninterested. I want my son’s father to be present and involved, but I can’t make him do something he doesn’t want to do. There’s a long history of hurt in our relationship on both sides. We argue a lot. We disagree a lot. There has been talk of breaking up and me moving out, but I simply could not afford it without child support. Unfortunately, he makes his money under the table so he says he believes he only needs to give me a couple hundred dollars. A couple hundred dollars?? There’s no way I could afford a place on my own, and when I think about it, the pressure is intense. He has PTSD when it comes to child support/custody because he has two kids, who live in a different state, who he hasn’t seen in nearly 10 years. When he came home from deployment, his chick was with another dude. She managed to get a restraining order and took the kids with her. He fled the state and moved away. She filed child support. He fell off the grid a few years later and let the child support rack up. It was only after he met me, that he officially established himself with jobs, a home, a vehicle, a wholesome life, paying off collection debts, paying child support.... I am extremely conflicted. I have lost myself trying to make this relationship work and expecting him to be a parent. What are your thoughts? How do I communicate and find resolution with this man I have a son with and have chosen to be with? I’m starting to think there is no possible way and I need to move out, file for child support and work extra hard to be able to pay my rent.",01Sep2020,1
369,"It all started in march this year. I live with 5 roommates and in march one girl moved out of our flat and we got a new roommate. It was this amazing guy that I clicked with right away. We became super good friends, there were no romantic feelings on my side at all. In lockdown we basically hung out 24/7, we became almost best friends because I shared everything with him. Going through a rough time he was my anchor. Listened to my problems, helped me with my bachelor thesis, cooked me dinner. It was perfect, I was so surprised to have found a friend like that.

Then there was an incident with a friend of his, let's call him Jim, that I had a crush on in July. Jim took advantage of me because I was drunk &amp; in love and he received sexual favors from me at our apartment. When Jim told me the next day that he was not interested in me, I was heartbroken. I have a difficult past with men, never have been in a healthy relationship and usually get exploited for sex. 

I always struggle with thinking I'm not lovable, with having trouble believing that anyone at all could fall in love with me. So this situation really didn't help. Roommate however, reacted in a way that made me truly fall for him. He lectured Jim and told him how shitty and disgusting his behaviour was and ended the friendship. I was touched. I thought my roommate was really empathetic and cared about me, that I was important to him and that he was loyal.

After the fuckup with Jim happened, I was really needy and at a mental low, so at one point I asked my roommate if it was okay to 'platonically' cuddle. We cuddled but I think we both felt like it wasn't platonic. For me it was a way to apply a band-aid to my wounded self-esteem and for him, well he caught ""feelings"".

He confessed his love to me a few days after. I told him that I am not ready for a healthy relationship but that I also noticed that I feel more for him than friendship. He convinced me to try. 

I was the happiest I've ever been for one month. I never regretted saying yes, because I thought wow this is the first guy who's actually in love with me, who liked me for who I was and who truly got to know me before he talked of feelings or dating.

Then on my birthday the dream took a really ugly end. On my birthday he acted strange. I asked him several times if everything was okay and he reacted really irritated. Then after my party when we went to bed, he basically exploded in my face. He hated how narcisstic I was. That I was too physical, always kissing him in public, that he didn't like that. I was so shocked and scared and still SUPER drunk, so I just stuttered apologies and promised to be better and to not show so much PDA etc. etc. 

It was a really nasty fight and I cried several times that night but we sorta made-up. I woke up with a horrible feeling though and asked him the next morning ""Are we still together?"" He said yes. I am so insecure, my biggest fear is to be dumped out of the blue because that happened to me before and it caused severe, painful heartbreak.

In the evening, now finally sober and able to reflect upon what happened, I asked him if we could talk about last night. I told him that some things he said were very hurtful and that I was angry that he decided my birthday was the perfect time to talk about this. He was super defensive and acted like I was attacking them before finally admitting ""I'm not in love with you anymore."" 

I could hear my heart break in that moment. He basically said that the way I behaved on my birthday and also the days prior to that, being to needy, pushing him for sex, being ""narcissistic"", it killed something for him. The magic was gone. He no longer had feelings. 

I died right there, I really did. It's so awful to feel your whole life, you're not enough and you're not lovable and nobody could EVER love you, to finally find the guy who makes you feel loved and seen and wanted only to have him fall OUT OF love with you, completeley, after 1 month because of a mistake you made.

I can't breathe, I can't function, I am so hurt and scared. What followed after was hell. He wanted to break up on the spot but I could convince him that that was probably an overreaction and that we should probably talk about it and try to work on ourselves more. He agreed and we stayed together but I could feel the break-up hanging like the sword of damocles over my head. He then left all of sudden to be with his family.

And ignored me for a week. No texts, no closure. Finally around thursday, I had enough. I begged him to talk to me, call me and tell me what's wrong. He broke up with me over the phone.

I fell into a dark, dark pit. It takes everything to drag myself out of this living hell. He returned on monday, so yesterday and now he's just... living here. The tension is unbearable. I am afraid to see him. It hurts so much. I implied that I would prefer if he moved out but he seems too stubborn to do that. I really don't know how to continue living like this.

I don't want to move out, it's not an option for me. My closest friends are in this apartment, I like it here, this is my city and I was here first. Maybe that's childish but I don't want to be the one that makes room for him after everything he's done to me. But I need to find away to live with him here. 

I truly don't know how. I need to find strength in myself that I don't believe I have. And I somehow need to convince myself to love and trust again, to trust that there is someone out there that can truly love all parts of me and doesn't throw me away like a piece of trash after finding the first flaw. 

I do things that are good for me, I try to distract myself, writing this down is also a form of self-care. But every morning is hard. Everytime we meet in the kitchen my heart aches. It hurts so much to see the way he looked at me change from loving, caring, affectionate to cold, distant and indifferent. 

Maybe this is too long for anyone to read, maybe it's not interesting enough but maybe someone has any sort of advice for me I would be very grateful. Thank you for reading this.",01Sep2020,1
370,"Throwaway account 

Well I didn't know what other subreddit to take this to so I chose this one. Okay so, these past couple of days I got an app called Tellonym for fun and ofc I did get some mean comments and it seemed to come from the same person but I didn't care and I just deleted or ignored. Days went by and I was bored so I actually replied asking them why they're scared of me knowing who it is. They started going off laughing about me being a whore, r-word, ugly, gross and stuff like that and I just replied basically playing along like haha yeah and what about it. I even told them that if they hate my face so much they should come say it to me and to text me privately n I'll give them my address if they didn't already know it. They basically kept swerving and making excuses about how they didn't  have instagram to text me or whatever. I ended up blocking them after a while bc they were being 🐱🐱. Later my 2 friends show me that they got mean messages too and some about me and I knew it was the same person. We've been trying to figure out who it is because it keeps going for them but for me it stopped since I blocked them but a while ago I got a message from a random number. It said hi so i replied asking who it is and it was them of course but I know they're using a fake number. They kept insulting me and whatever and then they asked ""did your dad confront u🌚"" and thats when I remembered that like 2 months ago my dad got a message like at 7am saying I'm a whore and i snucked in older guys to fuck which like wtf no I didnt lmao. But my dad decided to ignore it and not tell me but my mom told me bc she actually wanted to warn me i guess just in case they sent something to my bf like that. So this person clearly is obsessed with trying to harass me to the point of making fake numbers, contacting my family and friends, waking up early to insult me. The things they tell me are things from like 3 years ago basically when I was a teen and most of it isn't even true just a bunch of rumors. My mom is actually the one getting really worried for me and I hate that she has to worry about me because of a loser with no life. I don't know how to get rid of this because it seems like this person won't stop finding a way to contact me and my only plan so far has been to get them to see me outside my house or something like as a bait but they actually said they'll come tomorrow. I don't know if they actually will but I just want to know who it is to get them to stop because I know they won't even if I block or report them online. Any advice on what I can do in this situation?",01Sep2020,1

372,"Sorry if i’m doing any of this wrong. I am new to reddit, but i am finding it hard to seek advice during the pandemic.

I (30F) am constantly being passive-aggressively harassed by my coworker (50?M). I include ages because i feel that he hates me because i am younger. He has been with the company 20+ years, i have been there 5 years. He is a designer, and my job as his colleague within the same department is to ensure quality control of all files for best print quality.

The argument that often comes up, in short, is that he doesn’t agree with my evaluations so either just doesn’t do them (then i have to fix them) or leaves passive-aggressive notes and emails to me indicating his disapproval of my evaluations. For example, on a paper routing of a project, writing “NO” all caps and underlined next to my suggested changes, which he has subsequently also crossed out. He had another “flare up” (let’s call it) today, where he emailed me and my boss telling me it wasn’t my place to make such a comment on a routing (even though it very much is exactly my job to do so). My boss (after about 6 hours and me nudging her) gave a half-assed reply of “OP should proof for these things, but we should look at them on a case-by-case basis. I don’t want a big conversation about this, so no replies please”. Which I thought was very dismissive 

When I initially brought this to my boss’s attention, I asked her if I shouldn’t be noting changes like that, or if I am evaluating for the wrong things. She confirmed my changes/notes were things she wanted me proofing for, and that she would talk to him about it. End conversation. After these events, there doesn’t seem to be a major issue for a few months, then the same thing happens again. This has been going on for a couple years now with no change.

I have gone to HR for this and similar things in the past, and repeatedly offered the solution of “have you tried ignoring the problem?” Needless to say, I don’t go to HR anymore.

I have been applying for jobs for over a year, but i never get even a call-back on my application. I feel like, financially, I am stuck and imprisoned in my dead-end job where they allow my coworkers to constantly harass me (this isn’t necessarily an isolated incident). What do I do? Is there anything I can do? I feel like I’m at the end of my rope and I’m just going to explode.

For some added context, they hired me for a more administrative-type position 5 years ago, and 2 or 3 years ago (can’t recall) they promoted me to a position that better suited my skillset, and was more needed in the company. It is a position they have never had before me. Could this be part of the issue? Do you think after all this time it could still be unclear to him what my role is in relation to him?",01Sep2020,1
373,"Two weeks ago my family and I (f18) were pet sitting for a close friend of ours. Durning one of the days my father ended up leaving the door open (after repeatedly being told the dogs will run out if its not closed) and of course one of the dogs managed to escape.

I started yelling at him (about 45 minutes after I was finally able to catch the dog) which eventually resulted in him telling me that even though I still live here that it’s not my home and that I can “get the fuck out of here”.

Since then he hasn’t tried coming to talk to me even if we’re in the same room, and the only way he’ll communicate is by sending me emails telling me if he needs something. 

What he said completely devastated me, and I was really hoping that he’d come try and at least talk or apologize to me for saying it but he hasn’t even done that and its been over two weeks. How do I try and resolve this? Or should I even try?",01Sep2020,1
375,"i'm in a bad bind, and i have no idea how to get out of it. i have one goal in mind- move out. currently im stuck in my parents home, and it's a toxic environment, to say the least. we all barely tolerate each other, and it just gets worse and worse. so, i've been trying to move out. fortunately, money isn't directly the issue- i have a decent idea how to earn enough, and it's likely my brother will move out with me, and he'll be able to help then as well.

the main issue, apparently, is that i just don't have a phone. paypal requires you to verify your identity through SMS (i don't even know what that *is*, but it's apparently mobile exclusive), and i haven't had a mobile phone in years. parents wouldn't get me one, especially not if they knew why i wanted it.

i had the idea recently that i could maybe go on one of those survey sites, like swagbucks or smth, and earn points until i can trade for a giftcard and buy one that way. but

1) i have no idea if those sites are even actually worthwhile, could just be a waste of time scam or smth. besides that, i qualify for next to 0 of the surveys anyway, so i'm stuck just watching videos or playing the like two flash games they have. i did find GameGleam, which lets you download and play games to earn points. but for some fucking reason, i can't access my account there anymore. i don't even know if it was trustworthy or not.

2) imagine this. i spend weeks playing videos, earning up enough points to trade in for giftcards- and woops! turns out, i need to verify my identity before then! wanna guess how! yeah. i'm terrified of that happening, and then i would've just wasted my time for absolutely nothing.

another thing- i'm disabled, and unable to work regular jobs. i've applied for disability, but it could take several years before that goes through, and i'm at my limit as is. i won't survive several more years here. that's the long and short of it.

as well, those free phone vendors? y'know, from when it was decided everyone had the right to at least one phone? a) our household already got one, so my odds of getting one are garbage, and b) I TRIED. the people kept giving me the gd run around and telling me i needed this and that, and there's like. maybe 5 of those vendors in this city anyway. each one only operates on one single day of the week and they keep changing their requirements and telling me the substitutes i brought weren't actually good enough, *even though they had previously said they were*. so, that's 100% out. this city is garbage, folks, any public resource you can think of, forget it. no one here actually gives a flying fuck, not in my experience.

so, to the point- i live in a toxic household, and desperately need to get out. i need a way to receive funds in order to do that. either an alternative to paypal that DOESN'T require a phone, an app i can use on bluestacks that suitably mimics a phone (and is legal, please- i really *do not* need possible jail or a fine to add on top of my mess, thank you), or a legit way to earn giftcards so i can buy one off amazon (ill probably just say it's to play mobile games or something, idk). i've been trying to trade art for the giftcards, no luck atm. i don't really have that much to offer otherwise currently.

seriously, please. if you've any recommendations, lemme know. a couple things i've also considered/tried- wwoofing, or something similar. problem is, again, i'm disabled, so i wouldn't be any help with anything. and besides, that would only be temporary, and i won't earn an income that way either. doctors and such would also be a pain to sort out. tried a group home, but being stuck in the same house with so many people, with all kinds of new rules and social standards to uphold- the stress made me sob daily. i need to get to a space where i can just breath and relax, without constant fear of what anyone else thinks. i don't care if it's a gd studio apartment, i already live in my tiny room 24/7, least then i wouldn't be constantly on alert for someone barging into my room and getting angry at me for this or that reason.

im just really at my whits end, and i feel like an idiot for not being able to figure this out alone. i swear i've been trying, but it feels like there's a new roadblock every step of the way and i just keep ending up back at square one. please help.",01Sep2020,1

379,"I met a girl. We related on a very very deep level- me being a 22 year old, ignorant male- I let myself fall for her. Long story short, I busted in her- because she told me to. She also told me she was on birth control, she had also mentioned that (long story behind this part) being stabbed- the doctors said she couldn’t get pregnant, and also she said without a doubt she’d get an abortion if she somehow got pregnant. At that point I was like, “hell why not” and did it. We dated for about two weeks and I realized she was a compulsive liar with a serious alcohol problem and substance abuse problem. When I realized this I immediately thought about what else she could have lied about. I broke up with her. Blocked any form of communication. My biggest fear right now, is what if she lied about the birth control, not being physically able to get pregnant, or having an abortion. I know there’s no guarantee about any of that. If I was older, with a career I was comfortable in, no goals- I’d be in a different mindset. But I don’t know what to think, believe, or do in the case she got pregnant and wanted to keep the child. I know right away she would not be a good mom- just based off what I’ve seen within the short time I’ve known her. On the other hand, my goals would be extremely difficult to reach if I had to pay child support. I’d also feel horrible later in life knowing I have a child in the wrong hands. My mom told me we’d figure it out if worse came to worst- but I still know I’m in no position to have a child or pay for child support. I’ve also heard I could “sign my rights away”- which although I have issues with that- especially when I’m older and successful- I’d know I have a child somewhere that I’ll never meet or have an impact on other that that child knowing his/her dad is just somewhere- that’s damaging to a child. I’ve made a really stupid mistake as everyone would agree. My choice right now, I’d choose to sign my rights away- but I don’t know if that’s even a realistic option. If anyone can help me think about this or know what my options really are, I’d seriously be extremely grateful. I need help, I know I fucked up and I’ve ridiculed myself enough, so please don’t come here commenting to tear me up with words. I need a logical response.

380,"So, I’m 18, and I’m about to start college/university in 2/3 weeks. I’ll be living at home but could use some extra cash for maintenance. I recently went to a takeaway and they have a vacancy but the pay is £4/hr when most minimum wage jobs pay £9/hr.

383,"My (14f) sister (12f),lets call her Alice, always tries to 'look after' me when I'm fine doing everything by myself. I'm sure she's just trying to help but it's annoying and quite humiliating. Whenever we go do something she always checks up on me and asks if I have everything when most of the time she saw me get it ready. 

Alice is very difficult to do things with like play board games or have a different opinion to. When my family and I, including Alice, would like to play a board game after tea  and it's one that she doesn't want to play or she ends up losing she will be in a bad mood for a long time after it. This makes it really tense because I know that if I do anything wrong then she'll yell at me. Often when we have a disagreement about some subject or opinion, I've learned to shut up because if she gets annoyed and leaves it's likely that she'll be annoyed at me for the rest of the day, which sucks because she'll make snide comments to me. She is very unpredictable and doesn't know when to stop doing something.  

An example of when she reacts over tiny things. For example, we recently got a dog (yay!) who is often sick in the car. I always have to go in the back of the car with the dog on the way to a place then Alice goes in the back on the way home. There is normally three of in the car - Alice, my mum and me. I asked Alice if the next time we bring our dog in the car if she could go in the back of the car instead of me. We argued a bit because she said that the dog could be sick either way, going to a place or coming home, which is true but he rarely ever is sick on the way home. The argument did go a bit over the top because I called her selfish for never wanting to do the hard part and always lumping it with me - we were both annoyed before I called her that. 

Overall I guess I'm just tired of having to be the responsible older sibling. In some ways I don't think that we had the same sort of childhood as she always had someone to guide her into new schools and things like that and I didn't. My parents tell me that when we are older we won't argue as much as we do now and we will get along fine but I don't think we will get along that well when we are adults because now she is quite hard to be around at the moment and I don't know what she'll be like when she gets older. I don't really know how to confront her about this without getting a bad reaction.",01Sep2020,1
384,"There’s a particular exam soon that i need to do really well on and the teacher who is looking at our results for that exam saw me talking to another teacher. This teacher is the only person ever who knows i have extreme panic attacks and since there’s a lot of pressure for this exam, i was warning her in advanced that i might have a panic attack half way through and that i’ll signal her to take me outside so i don’t disturb other students.

I’m not sure if she mentioned something to him, but he like randomly called me out of class today and said i shouldn’t be trying to get an advantage for the exam using other teachers/i shouldn’t make other teachers feel like they need to help me in any way. Needless to say i had a huge panic attack after he left... he was obviously angry at something and that seemed to be me for whatever reason. 

Should i tell the teacher i trust to talk to him? If he knows about my anxiety he’s going to tell me parents and that isn’t the safest option for me right now. Should i just let it be and apologise? I’m so confused, he made it sound like i was going to every single teacher and asking them to tell him to give me good marks when i only talked to two besides him and the other one is my main classroom teacher.

The overall question is to have a wedding or not to have a wedding?

Background facts:
- SO (M40) and i (30F) have been together for 10 years.
- I’m American he is Scottish we met when I was working in Scotland and moved in together and we lived their together for almost a decade. 
- we have always been struggling with money. Many of those years were very very difficult for us
- I lost two family members (dad and brother) while struggling with money all my family in California and I was completing uni in Scotland. 
- due to me completing my undergrad and the loss of loved ones and the shortage of money it never was a good time to get engaged but it was something we always wanted. 
- my mom was living on her own in cali after my dad and brother passed and needed us to come look after her 
- in 2017 we started the visa application for my SO to move to America with me. It was the fiancé visa where you have to get legally married within a set amount of days after you arrive
- we got engaged in 2017 before submitting the application but knowing that was the plan
- 2018 I had gastric bypass surgery
-2019 We finally had the visa approved and had to ‘do the paperwork’ without any heads up or family present. At the time we thought it best to not tell anyone that we went to the courthouse on our lunch break because we wanted a wedding for family to witness etc 
-we discovered that weddings are expensive 
- I got a pretty good job and for the first time in my life I was able to start saving 
- it felt really important to us so I saved and worked hard to be in a better position to plan a wedding
- we now have 20k saved up and it was FOR the wedding and we do really want it but all of a sudden I’m like omg this money could all be gone. Am I going to regret this? I went over a year thinking we wouldn’t be able to have a wedding at the thought always made me extremely sad yet now that it’s within grasp I’m like 😬😬. 

FYI we were looking at a small destination wedding (no more than 30 guests) in Hawaii at a small bar venue on the beach that was pretty cheap. With food an open bar the ceremony and a live musician it’s 10k but not including travel and photography dress etc. So it would end up being one epic week with friends and family but at a hefty price of 20k. 

On the positive side, we both know that people aren’t forever and it is so important to do something in front of family. On the other hand it’s a whole lotta money compared to what we have. 

Also - yes we have looked at cheaper venues until our eyes wanted to fall out. Yes we considered elopement packages yes we considered airBnB. We are in Southern California and I have a huge family that I don’t speak to much and would be obligated to invite here and his family would be coming all the way from Scotland so we wanted a destination to keep the guest count small and Hawaii seemed like a comparably priced alternative that would be a dream for his family to visit (we have consulted with them before booking anything). 

Honestly I just wish we could get married and have it be like the first time but you can’t change the past. Part of me thinks we should just forget the whole thing and part of me thinks what the hell let’s have this outrageous vacation/wedding with all of our loved ones because having them all around us is a gift. 

Do you guys get it? Basically I’m broke and want a wedding but would love a best of both worlds scenario. 

Anyways - feel free to make my life decisions for me.",01Sep2020,1

My mother is having health issues which affect her balance and make it so she can not drive all that often. 

I have a friend a state over about a 13 hour drive or 2 hour flight away that is offering me a job. He is also offering a place to stay with affordable rent. Starting is $12 an hour, good benefits, and I know there will be plenty of overtime and lots of room to move up through the company.

It would cost me about $3k to rent a U-Haul and move my shit up there. I am thinking of flying out to take the job and then flying down renting a U-Haul and driving back up with my shit once I have the money. However my mother has that balance issue and my dad is leaving the country.

Both sets of my grandparents are now within an hour of me and my aunt and cousin are living with us now due to Covid-19. Also I have 4 cats and 2 dogs. If I take this job I would not be bringing any pets with me but I feel bad leaving my mother (40) ""alone"" with all these animals and not me or my dad there.

395,"Long story short, 

We've just moved into an apartment block, four weeks in we receive a letter from our real estate with the threat of eviction due to a series of noise complaints (none of which we ever received). Mind you, this is our first time ever living in an apartment so we're learning fast.

I believe this is rather unjust as we have never been given any notice of previous complaints (nor had any of our neighbours approached us) and if we had we would have taken any necessary steps to reduce the noise. 

Of course from this point on we will be walking on egg shells with the noise we make, afraid of losing our apartment because our neighbour simply thinks our TV is too loud or we're laughing too much with our friends (Will suck the joy out of everything at this point). Do we have a leg to stand on in combating the eviction should our neighbour complain again? We don't think it's fair that we received such a severe warning letter without any notification of previous complaints. 

I was considering maintaining a log book and noting everytime we used the TV, played music, had some friends over etc etc So that we could determine whether or not the complaints are justified. 

This is all taking place in NSW, Australia, with noise restrictions taking place from 10pm-8am Monday - Thursday and 12am - 8am Friday to Sunday. (We have never exceeded these time frames).",01Sep2020,1

I’ve only gained about 5-7 pounds with obvious fluctuation. I’m very surprised at how well the human body holds up based on the total amount of sugar I’ve consumed.

I’ve never been unhappy about my body or had low self-esteem. I just enjoy eating and don’t see a major problem with my current situation. The only thing I’m worried about is blood sugar and blood pressure. I haven’t actually measured them, but my family has had a few blood/heart problems and I’m probably not helping. 

I’m just worried about my health, not my body. So it would be nice if there was some mental strategy or way to gain willpower so I can just cut back on all the sodium, sugar, and carbs I’ve been consuming. Especially the sugar... I don’t wanna talk about how much candy I’ve eaten.

397,"Throwaway account.

I go to a large university that like many others, had their summer semester online due to covid. I was housemates with Martin last summer semester and through mutual friends, he also got his first girlfriend around the same time and that is how I met Riley. All three of us are the same year and in very similar STEM programs. We got along in terms of friendship but their relationship together has always been rocky with fights breaking out almost daily.

So this summer semester we had a lot of prerequisite courses together. It was understood that Martin and I would rotate strength and weaknesses while Riley tagged along. With this mindset, I took on a heavier workload, assuming I would at least have one person to collaborate notes with. However, when midterms roll around for Riley and I, Martin is bending over backwards to get Riley the best mark and leaving me stranded. It left a bad taste in my mouth because Martin knows both of us struggle in this course but I gave him the benefit of doubt because it's his girlfriend, so he prioritized her. He said he felt bad after, promising me a more helping hand but when the second midterm came, he did the same thing. Eventually, with my mediocre grades and expecting no future aid, I dropped the course. Ironically, Riley dropped a month after because even if Martin was handing in her assignments and answering her third midterm, she still wasn't doing well. 

Riley and I were stronger suited for another course. This was a third level course and our professor allowed everyone to form groups and brainstorm for large assignments while submitting together for smaller ones. Because of this, the three of us collectively handed all of our small assignments in together, with me carrying a majority of it (we got perfect). Where was Riley and any of her contributions? Busy socializing, fighting with her boyfriend, and then doing something stupid. I let it go for Martin's sake cause he was having it worse and planned not to work with her in future courses. I continued to help Martin, as he struggled with this course, and gave him my notes, because I just felt that any negative feelings I had was with the other course and would stay in the other course. Eventually, Riley had dropped all her courses except for this one as she was missing her submissions or too far behind to catch up. With only one course remaining, I thought she would at least focus for the Final Exam, helping us all out. Wrong. I found out they made a separate group doc to collaborate answers while at the same time, offering scarce information (if not false) to me in return for my full answers. I was naive to think that they were struggling when they were collecting notes and answers from my peers while leaving me in the dark.

I felt used. I had trusted the two to at least let me in the loop for final for all the help I gave them and for not being mad at them for what I got in return. Throughout the course, I have been putting in the most work, giving them lecture material, and my assignment notes. I had assumed that this was just a bad semester for Martin and Riley so I helped them more than I should've. 

The last person I expected this was from Martin. So many times in other courses we helped each other out, understanding that sometimes we fall behind or get too stressed out. Never did it cross our minds to throw one another under the bus for marks. Moreover, for the past year that Martin and Riley are together, I've been there to comfort and give Martin advice when he cried about Riley, about how she could do hurtful things to him again and again, I sympathized for his situation! He's a kind guy, quite oblivious, and it takes effort for the poor man to scheme. I even gave him the benefit of doubt one more time for another of our Final Exams, hoping if Riley was not in the course, he would be different. Nope. He took the answers and left. 

So now, as most would advise, is for me to let it go, to make new friends. I'm told to leave both of them to struggle together, to not collaborate with them again but it really stings when the people you stuck your arm out for, snake you. Some of my peers said that their motives may be because they believe that without their help, I would've excelled anyways and that I'm a cheery person so I will get over it. 

So reddit, what is your advice (ideally vengeful) for this cheery and excelling student? Also Martin (you know your real name), if you are reading this, I liked you better before you met Riley.",01Sep2020,0

But I still have sexual urges and masturbating to porn doesn't feel the same anymore, I kinda only want her because watching porn just feels awkward and emotionless. 

We did do things before, but it was a while ago and she doesn't want to do it now. She always says no or makes an excuse when I ask to do it again, but I don't want to pressure her so I just leave it at that. 

I'm kinda worried that she's just not into me like that(sexually), it makes me feel insecure in many ways. I've talked to her about it but she says it's just awkward and makes her uncomfortable doing stuff online. But she never shows any signs that she finds me attractive as a man.. she always just calls me ""cute"" or ""handsome"" at best but these are just some generic compliments that someone could say to a kid. She shows little to no sexual interest on me either.. I'm scared that she'll find someone else because she's unsatisfied with me. 

1. How do I satisfy my sexual needs
2. Is my gf really just not into sexual stuff online or is she just not into me

One coworker worked there for 13 years, and when she put her two weeks in, they didn't let her finish it up. They didn't put her on the schedule, and when asked about it, she was told ""we don't need you.""

And i also wrote to a friend of girl 1, that i wanted to meet her even that she had a boyfriend.

So now they see me as a pervert and a creep.

Girl 1 deleted me on snapchat and probably will on facebook too.

I deserve this shitstorm, but i really just want to say im sorry to the girl. But she doesnt wanna talk. I have admitted that i both touched the friends ass by mistake. And talked to her other friend and asked her out even tho she had a boyfriend. And that i also texted wierd shit to her.

Is this common or is it me that is insane to do this kind of shit?

I told her to let me explain on a phonecall and say im sorry and all that. But i dont know how to recover from this situation.

Ask me anything you want.

Please help me.",01Sep2020,2
417,I was feeling suicidal one night and needed someone to talk to and it was late. I needed a friend and when I called my friend three times they never answered cause they were sleeping. But kept waking up to Snapchat me and tell me they were sleeping and asking what’s wrong. I told them I was able to get on the phone with suicide prevention and they said okay and to call them tomorrow...but I really needed them and idk why they couldn’t call me when they woke up..I would’ve. Is this person worth keeping as a friend..or am I being selfish for bothering them and dumping my problems on them,01Sep2020,2
418,"I (23F) recently moved into an apartment with 4 other people. The two friends in question are A (24F) and B (22F). 

This all really started when I moved in. I’d been fresh out of a breakup and as a result, was crying a lot. This concerned them, though their version of support came across more as criticism. A even thought it was a good idea to get me completely wasted one day to help me cope. As someone not used to drinking, this was an awful experience and didn’t help with anything. 

A few days later, I woke up feeling very hot and weak. I texted A and B about this and brought up how anxious I was feeling, considering the virus and everything. I also have a couple medical conditions which infectious diseases impact negatively (most people get seriously sick from the disease itself, whereas in my case, my medical conditions would get significantly worse from the virus).  I explained how scared I was, considering all this, and they insulted me, claimed my fears were invalid, and that I needed professional help. Later in the day, after I took the test, I brought up how their support sounded more like criticism to me. They told me I was over thinking things, that I was making it seem like they were out to get me, and that I, again, needed psychological help. 

A few days pass and they don’t speak to me. A couple days ago my test results came back negative, and I informed them. They thanked me, but still didn’t speak to me. Even when we’re in the same room, they ignore me and walk past me as if I’m not there. The next day (yesterday) they decided to throw a party but didn’t tell me. I felt unwelcome and spent most of the time in my room.

Today, I mentioned to them everything about how I’d been feeling. I brought up how I was hurt when they insulted me. I brought up how there seemed to be so much tension between us, how they weren’t speaking to me, and how unwelcome I felt around them. They responded by saying that whatever tension I’m feeling doesn’t exist, that there’s no problem, and that if I’m feeling this way then I must seriously need some sort of psychological therapy. 

Im at a total loss. I feel like they aren’t listening to me, and I’m actually starting to think I may be crazy. I don’t understand why they’re not speaking to me if nothings wrong like they say. My other friends said this is textbook gaslighting, but I honestly have no idea. I feel insulted that whenever I come to them with a problem concerning their treatment of me, their first response is for me to get therapy. 

What do I do here? Is this gaslighting?",01Sep2020,4

420,"Alright, so here's the backstory: I had a group of six people, and we were all friends. Now, I start realizing that I like one of my friends, let's call them Ami. Like, this is different than any other person I've liked before (which is a bit awkward, considering I was their wing-man and they were mine). Then, boom, quarantine happens. And two other friends in the group, let's call them Ana and Ella, are in this kind of unofficial relationship thing. About a month ago, I had asked Ella to a dance like as dates, and they accepted, but then they said their mom was spying on them and the mom wasn't fully accepting back then. So, we had to call it off, only for Ella to go with someone else (still salty). Now, what Ella didn't (and still doesn't) know is that I actually liked them, and wasn't asking them because we were friends and had nobody else to go with. I still have leftover feelings for them, which is kind of awkward, since we're homies and nothing will ever happen between us, I just know it'll ruin our friendship. So anyways, while I'm trying to get over Ella, I start crushing on Ami. Now, the other two friends in the group- Caty and Lily. After we go into quarantine, Ana and Ella are in their unofficial relationship, I'm trying to get over Ella while crushing on Ami, and Caty and Lily are just there. But then, it turns out Lily has a crush on someone in the group. Who? You guessed it! Ami! So I, in a panic, come out saying that I like Ami too, and wouldn't you know, the shortest while later Caty is all ""i like ami too"". So while Ella and Ana are over doing their own thing, here is Ami trying to choose between the three of us, and they can't because they've just got the biggest heart (damn hufflepuffs lmao). So basically it's like we're all kind of flirting with Ami while Ami flirts with us. Then, Caty say they get jealous when me and Lily talk to Ami. Fuck Caty, Caty is toxic. But anyways me an Lily get mad because why tf would they tell us, like expecting something from us, but guess what! We start talking less because we're friends and all that bullshit. Now, me and Ella are homies at this point. So I go over to Ella, and I'm like ""bro so like I'm getting sick of this, can you like,get Ami to choose between us?"" And so Ella is like ""I gotchu"" and then accidentally tells Ami that they should pick Caty. As I said previously, fuck Caty. Soon after me and Lily get rejected together, we start a relationship. And it moves way too quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so now that you've got the long and confusing backstory, back to the present. We've been together for a bit over four months now. And for a month at least I have been getting sick of Lily, which isn't a good sign for any relationship. Oh also Caty and Ami are still together in a toxic relationship imo (at least I'm pretty sure they're still together). So anyways for about a month I've been trying to tell Lily that I want to take a break, and then chickening out. But then, wooh boy. I take a break from my phone because I'm fucking tired of people, and I don't bother announcing my departure. By 6:00 PM, I start having small chatter in a gc to ease myself back into socializing. And wouldn'tcha know it? Lily bombarded me with texts, emails, going to google hangouts. They were talking to me as though I fucking broke up with them with all that ""tell me you hate me please I can't take it anymore""and all that other bullshit. So I'm just like wtf? and then we try to get back to normal. But now, every single little thing that they do bothers me. And I've already had a talk with them about shit, so I'm in a pissy mood one day and we start getting into a fight. And I tell them I want to take a break. Now, I think that they think a break is a break-up, which just makes me even more fuckin upset. But now, I think I'm gonna fuckin break up with them, I can't take this shit. But now I've turned back to my feelings and I'm like ""holy shit this shit is a fucking shithouse"" because guess what? Next to the near empty jar of feelings for Lily, theres a jar with Ami's name on it, with some feelings in it, and same for Ella. So like. I'm about to break up with my partner, and now it turns out that I have feelings for my best friends and my ex-friend? Like what the hell life. Oh, and there's also my other friend, who also has feelings for me, and I think there's another person I know that has feelings for me. Please, give me any help you can.",01Sep2020,1
421,"It’s probably my most closest I have gotten to something related to COVID19.... I am terrified to say the least.


So my dear housemate got coughed on by a fucking stupid guy without a mask during work. My housemate had a mask on, the guy didn’t, and he deliberately did it. To say the least, what a fucking asshat. Anyways, we immediately looked up on taking a PCR test, and it said that it takes around 5-7 days until the test result can really be accurate. So to get a more accurate result, you have to wait 5-7 days and then take a test. Or just quarantine the whole 12 days. We haven’t talked about what to do yet, since this just all happened right now. 


The problem that I have now is, I got work this weekend. I don’t want to risk anyone at work if my housemate is a carrier. But I won’t know until the end of next week. 


The good thing is, they have their own room that they are not sharing with anyone. So they can quarantine the entire time until the test results comes in. Our bathrooms are also separate (except for one, the two of them uses the same bathroom), so I won’t be exposed through that too. Food might be a problem, but we can arrange that by carrying the food to their room, or arrange a time to when they can come out the room (I don’t know if this is safe at all, but just an idea). 


So I need some advice here: Should I just talk to my boss and call off work completely until the test results are in, or am I just being over dramatic?",01Sep2020,2

426,"For the past couple weeks I have been hearing a neighbor kid screaming and crying in the middle of the night. It started out every couple days but recently has been every night. Anywhere between midnight and 3 AM. It’s currently 12:30 AM and the kid is screaming and crying again. I can’t make out much but I heard him yell “ Get away from me I don’t want you here get away” followed by lots of “get always”. At first I though he was probably having nightmares or something but it’s getting very concerning hearing this every night now. During the day they seem like a very happy family and they have fun jumping on their trampoline and laughing and playing around, but come night time the whole dynamic completely changes. Is this normal for younger kids (probably around 8-10 years old)? I’m tempted to call the police right now and have them check out the situation, but during the day they seem happy and I don’t want to stir up any trouble if it’s not anything bad but at the same time if it’s abuse I don’t want to let it slide

TLDR

Kid screams at his parents and tells them to get away from him almost every single night between 12 and 3 AM. They seem like a happy family during the day but at night it sounds like abuse is happening. Is it normal for 8-10 year olds to do this, or does it sound more like abuse?",01Sep2020,3
427,"I was with a guy for 2.5 years before he decided to end things and start dating his girl bestfriend - I didn't know that was why he left at first.

For some insight, they were always hanging out at parties before this happened that I was never invited to. Telling me she wasn't there when she was. I never met her and when we broke up, she left her current boyfriend, and a day after she was posting photos of her and my ex in bed together. 

(It's important to note she got a boyfriend the same day my ex and I first made our relationship public, so it was weird from the start. The boyfriend she had previously seemed like a time passer until my ex left me.) continuing previous paragraph &gt;&gt;

I only knew this because she followed/unfollowed me to catch my attention so I'd go look. Things like this continued on for the next few weeks. A bunch of drama went down, salt in wounds, arguing with them, tears then that was it. 

Fast foward a couple months into their relationship he got her pregnant, they had a baby and everyone carried on with their lives. Obviously this broke me as I had no time to grieve, he moved on so fast.

My ex partners dad crossed me in the street, told me his son made a mistake leaving me for the new partner and walked off before I could say anything. Why would he say this?

Anyway I've recently started a business page on Instagram, and she's started following it. After all the drama and rubbing salt in the wound about stealing my ex partner, she's started following me and looking at all of my online shit.
She's always looked at my personal profiles stories over the past two years, but never actually followed me on it.

It's really strange, considering the circumstances. Why would she do this? Fully knowing I can see her viewing my stories and that she's a follower. Can someone please provide a possible explanation, I'd greatly appreciate it as I can't find reason as to why someone would do this, especially 2 years on after the breakup. 

She got what she wanted which at the time almost cost me my life - so why can't she just leave me alone? Why does she need to keep an eye on me? Sorry for the long read.",01Sep2020,2

I can’t drive and I feel like I can’t ask my dad because he’s going in and out of hospitals all the time and his girlfriend can’t drive long distances (about an hour) so I don’t even know how to go about moving my things...

429,"TL;DR My friend stole money from me and I’m wondering if I should press charges against her? She paid me back, but the investigation w my bank has already proceeded. It’s a fairly new Chase account and I don’t want them to think I was in on it w her and close my account for any reason. 
~~~
So last week Wednesday (08/26) my friend and I went to workout in the morning and around noon we decided to stop by the grocery store and grab food to make at home (I had online class @1 and it was the first one. I couldn’t afford to miss it). I paid w my debit card cus we were making the food at my house so I was gonna just keep the food after. Anyways. 

Fast forward to around 3p that same day my sister is over w me and we’re just hanging out, watching tv in my room. I get a notification on my phone notifying me of my ATM withdrawal. I have it set up to notify me over $10 (I’ll post pictures). She withdrew $500 from my account.

I immediately got frantic and began looking for my wallet. I couldn’t find my debit card, but I somehow had the receipt from the store. So that part confused me. I had a feeling it was her, but didn’t want to believe it. She confessed to me about it this morning and I told her how I felt about her being here (my apartment) and she gave me this sob story of why she did it and how she’s so terribly sorry (mind you, I would’ve loaned her the money if she had asked me!!!) I was honestly so monotone when she told me. I didn’t believe her sob story. I was almost pissed because she waited 5 days to let me know she had taken it. She was in my apartment for 5 days. WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW 💔

My thing now is that she’s also my roommates girlfriend, but she’s been my best friend for 5 years and they only recently started dating. I don’t want her to have a copy of our apartment keys nor do I want her alone in the apartment when me or my roommate isn’t there. He says it’s unfair because he pays half the rent and says she will only stay in his room. I said that’s fine, but not when either one of us isn’t there. He insists on buying my a new key lock for my door, but I declined. 

Should I press charges? I’m just so tired of my so called “friends” using me and I’ve about had it. I’m done being the nice guy. I legit am that one friend that never relies on anyone, but myself. I’m really actually struggling w this cus I’ve never ever felt this way before. I’m conflicted. This is such an invasion of privacy.",01Sep2020,8
430," hi so. I and my girlfriend had sex on the 25th of august. she said she was due to have period in 3 weeks' time.  maybe a bit less. pretty sure her period is scheduled any time between the 8th  to the 12. and tells me shes during her ovulation stage (not 100% clear on what that is but i think iv got the gist, it means shes more likely to get pregnant and plan b won't do anything or will probably not be as effective) we used a condom but it broke and didn't realize for a couple of minutes. I didn't cum or even feel like cumming.  stopped having sex as soon as i actually noticed. anyway, she took the morning after pill the next day. (she has no birth control). today, she got a period. its a week after sex. and like a week before her actual period I'm wondering how likely it is that she's pregnant or if its just the side effects of plan b. i read up on implantation bleeding. as far as I'm aware its a 50% chance its that. and another 50% chance its plan B side effect. any thoughts/ advice is appreciated. i might not be correct but I'm assuming my two best hopes is that she gets her actual period on the scheduled date that means she's not pregnant? or if we go past her period date we take a pregnancy test, i assume its best to wait till then and not take one now?.. sorry if this is all confusing.",01Sep2020,2
432,"My parents raised me (24F) and my siblings pretty well. I'm autistic with behavioral problems so my mom would yell at me a lot while my dad had the inability to express any sort of emotions to his loved ones. I think I've been feeling empty since I hit puberty,  when my dad became more reluctant to do any sort of emotional engagement (he used to be playful back then). He would express his love by buying his children things instead. I tried to engage with him emotionally but he wouldn't reply with anything emotional and it upset me. I would also rely on fictional characters as my father figures but they aren't helping.

I'm more accepting towards my mom since she's willing to improve our relationship, but my dad didn't put effort into our relationship. Even my mom was aware of my dad's problems and she tried to tell him but he still wouldn't put effort.

I was initially more accepting to my dad's behavior, but now that he died I started to feel angry about the dad I could've had. I went to my therapist for this and she told me to accept that my dad was emotionally distant and commented something in the lines of ""your siblings were able to accept it. why not you?"" Meanwhile I talked this over to my mom and she told me that my expectations are rooted from being raised in an American culture (we're from an Asian culture that isn't a fan of being touchy). She insisted that my dad loved me and asked me to forgive him. (If only my dad had asked me to forgive him himself.) I wish I can feel like I've been loved. And I understand how my dad loved me, but I'm still angry at him.

So back to the question: How do I come to terms with the fact that I was raised by an emotionally unavailable dad? How do I accept him for who he was? How do I cope with the lack of an emotionally sufficient father figure in my life?",01Sep2020,1

Ok, So basically, at the beginning of quarantine, around May-ish, me and my mom started going on daily walks around a neighborhood for fun. We noticed that every day we would see this girl running and over time I began to develop a crush on her. I did some digging and found her Instagram and Snapchat and added her. For the first four months of a snap chatting, not one word was spoken. We didn’t even introduce ourselves. However, about three weeks ago, I asked her what school she went to, and then things broke open. We started talking every day. She isn’t super consistent with texting, but every day we do talk. We recently called each other cute which was cool, so I think she is into me. She doesn’t go to my school, but my friends know her.

440,"I (16M) have been depressed in some capacity for almost 5 years now. However I’ve experienced depression a few times since I was I third grade. There’s always been a baseline level that it’s at, occasionally getting worse, but eventually going back to just okay. However, with quarantine, I’ve started to realize a lot more about myself and my future and my depression has skyrocketed.

One thing to note: I have never told anyone about my feelings until a few days ago when I told my best friend, who has been going through a rough patch recently.

Anyway, I haven’t told anyone because I never thought it was a real problem and I was really good at hiding it from my outside personality. Not even my closest and only 3 friends or my family ever said anything. I’ve looked it up, it’s called persistent depressive disorder. My life has never been severely impacted by my depression.

However, recently I’ve been feeling exponentially more depressed than before, and it is starting to change me. I’m starting to become almost self-destructive; I feel extremely lonely, and yet I will purposefully not hang out with my friends. I feel like I will go no where in life after school, and yet I put off my PSAT prep. I get angry extremely easily and I argue with my family on a daily basis, so much so that I basically hide in my room all day except for dinner, and still we find a way to argue. As you can see, I am aware of all these negative things but I am unable to stop them. I have this thought that I’ve been thinking more and more often: “I don’t want to die, but I wouldn’t care if I did”.

This self-destruction brings me to my point; I need help, but I can’t bring myself to get it. I’ve told my friend and that was a big step for me, but that isn’t really helping. I need something else. I want to tell my family because my sister had depression so they’ve dealt with it before, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I make up all these excuses: we’ve never truly talked about emotion, I’m not that close with any of my family members, I’ve already been telling them “I’m good” for years, etc. Point is, I know they would care if I told them and those excuses would not matter. But I don’t know how to do it.

How do I get myself to tell them?

Me not knowing how to answer one or anything I ask my mom what it was and how I do it and I try my best to answer it and I keep receiving this call a few days after  .and I get a message from his friend Jacob he tells me that Daniel is in jail trying to get in contact with me  i ask him for what and he says he was in there for attempted murder and I’m in shock like what the fuckkk ??  I tell my current girlfriend and the time and she got really upset with me because I was trying to talk to my ex . And I was trying to explain to her that I just wanted to hear it from him you know ? I have so many questions to ask but for the sake of my relationship I tell Jacob that I don’t want anything to do with Daniel , I got messages from others that Daniel really needs me to talk to him and I say I don’t want anything to do with him . And I leave it.

Fast forward to right now arrest.es or something like that pops up to my Facebook because someone in the county got arrest again and I look up Daniels name to see his mug shot, things he’s charged with and etc. I really want to send a letter just to see what really went down , I wanna know what the hell was going through his dumb ass head you know? But I’m so hesitate of sending one because of my girlfriend maybe she’ll get the wrong Idea and I just don’t want her to be upset .",01Sep2020,1
442,"Okay so, I’m 21, and recently moved back home with my partner bc Covid and trying to save money 
We have a dog, 7 months old female. I try so hard to look after her, the only questionable thing is I haven’t had her done yet. My only reasoning is that after quite a bit of research and vet talks I believe that it is better to do it after the first heat. I’ve had a lot of people disagree with this but I’m only going from what vets have told me and what I’ve read doing my research. 
Any way, she’s currently in heat and my parents have a male dog (far smaller than her, but they’re both small) who has not been fixed either (they want to breed him because he’s purebred &amp; pedigree). I keep them 100% apart, she unfortunately doesn’t leaves our room because the house is mostly open plan, unless I have a nappy on her. Even then I keep a very good eye on them. Obviously I can’t be home 100% of the time, so when I go I try to remind either parent of how important it is to keep an eye on them and make sure they’re not alone together especially if she isn’t covered. They NEVER seem to listen. 
And even when I am home they make it so difficult to properly look after her. I won’t let her outside with the nappy on because they’re reusable ones, so once she’s weed it needs to come off. But my parents never listen and constantly let her outside with it on, so she wees in them and they have to come off and go into the wash, making it so I can’t let her out again until they’re all washed and dry. And even then they let her and the male dog out together, just now she came back in and it seems like he pushed the nappy to the side. I don’t think they were outside long enough to have sex &amp; tie but I’m still very concerned. Even in the mornings they know I will let her out as soon as I get up, I’ll ask them if their dog is outside first, but they still just open up their bedroom door (that goes outside) and let him out without asking whether my dog is out, so they both run off down the garden where we can’t see them, I have to go running down to find them. 


It feels like no matter how many times I remind them they just won’t listen and don’t care about how I’m trying to take care of her. She’s way too young to get pregnant and not have health complications, I’m so worried for her. There’s a million and one other things that they make so difficult for me to take care of her, and I just don’t know what to do. We hopefully have a home lined up for a couple months time, but until then how do I figure out how to make them understand how important this is? Or make them respect the way I look after her? I get that it’s their house but why is it so hard to not make it impossible for me to take care of my dog?",01Sep2020,1

448,"I was working at a restaurant for 2.5 years and was laid off with mostly everyone else when the pandemic hit. Since that happened, the owner could not pay everyone for their last two weeks worth of work. He didn’t even call everyone to explain, he had our unpaid GM do it for him. After almost three months of zero communication, everyone got together and filed a BOLI complaint. We were finally paid two days later. I’ve been pretty bitter since then (along with everyone else) but I’ve been actively looking for another job and I’m really enthusiastic to work somewhere else. It was a pretty horrible environment and really left me feeling taken advantage of as an employee. I especially don’t want to work in a restaurant anymore with everything going on with Covid. It has become a major struggle though because I’ve only had one interview in 5 months. 

Recently, a pretty popular Instagram (86listpdx) called out my work and apparently the whole staff walked out. So now the sketchy owner has emailed me and asked if I would return because he had “always valued my hard work.” 

I’m worried that if I deny this, I will lose my unemployment benefits. There’s absolutely no way I will go back. Should I just ignore the email? Or reply and deny the position?

The day after my birthday is when me and mom meet up at my house, I told her about the kit and she became upset quickly and pretty much denied me taking the test, When I asked her why she wouldn't look me in the eye and kept on saying how those test weren't accurate and I kept telling her It was just some fun for me, She ended up screaming at me, So I told her to leave I went to step out into the backyard so she could leave, but after a couple minutes I couldn't stand the heat and headed back inside, that's Just as I saw my mom leaving my bedroom, She still wasn't looking me in the eye and was stuffing something in her bag, She left without saying anything.

When she left I went into my bedroom I left the kit on my bedside table and now it was gone, I even tossed up the bedroom thinking I had miss placed it, But no it was gone and I know my mom has taken it, I texted her that she needed to return it but she's been ignoring me.

My gender: female 

I’m gonna be vague for privacy reasons. A friend of mine, let’s call them “X,” recently got hired where I work. Technically, I have two jobs where I work and the person who works Job 2 with me is leaving the position soon. I was told to look out for new recruits for that position. I thought X would be perfect for Job 2 but I wanted to wait to tell my boss and wait to see how they did with Job 1 to be a little more objective. I made the mistake of asking X prematurely if they’d even be interested in Job 2. They said yes enthusiastically and I was really excited that I may get to work alongside a friend. 

Fast forward one week, we haven’t officially started working yet, neither my colleagues, nor I, have gotten the chance to see X in action. I get an email saying a different person, let’s call them “Y” is interning for Job 2. Meaning, if Y wants Job 2 later, they’re more likely to get it than X. 

I had no idea this would happen. I feel terrible, honestly. I wish I had mentioned X to my boss earlier but I thought I was doing the right/objective thing by waiting. 

Anyway, I gave X a heads-up about Y and apologized. X seemed pretty upset, although it was hard to tell over text. Here’s what’s also worrying me: I knew Y a few years ago and we reconnected while I trained them for Job 2. I’m worried that X will find out and think I favored Y over X. Honestly, I value both equally as friends and Id be happy for either of them to get the job. 

How on earth do I fix this? Can I fix it? Should I tell X that I knew Y? I think I should at least tell my boss that X is another possible candidate for Job 2, what do you guys think? Any other advice related to this is appreciated too!",01Sep2020,1

458,"My boyfriend relapsed for the first time, didn’t tell me, and broke up with me.
(X-post from /r/relationship_advice , I just really need some help on what to do here.)

Hi everyone.
My (24f) boyfriend(23m) and I met last feb. We clicked very quickly and I have never felt a soul connection with someone like I have him. He has always said this is very much mutual. 
When we met, we both were not looking for a relationship. We just couldn’t deny the connection we have. He was struggling with a coke addiction. I obviously did not know this, no one knew. He only did it alone on weekends or after work. Never during or before. 

He realized quickly he really liked me, and wanted to quit for himself so badly (was draining his bank account, it’s unsafe, he’s embarrassed, etc.), but after he met me he realized he really needed to quit before he even began to start dating me. He and I stopped talking for about a month, and he told me he just needed time to himself because he was going through some things. It was around March/April, right at the beginning of covid lock downs. 

End of April, we came back into contact and quickly met up. We picked up right back where we left and he opened up to me about his addiction, and why he stopped communication with nearly everyone except his very best friends and parents. 

The only people he told were his mom and dad, and now me. We had good, clear, and healthy conversations about this. He described it as “you can’t love someone til you love yourself” which I definitely agree. The relationship moved a bit quicker than it normally would due to covid, we spent a LOT of time together (safely). We would discuss if it felt like a healthy amount of time, etc. We had a very solid relationship with fantastic communication. 

Everything has been amazing, absolutely fantastic. We fit into each other’s families like neither of us have ever experienced before. It’s honestly a soul connection. 

Yesterday, we had plans to take my dog on a picnic and he said he was on his way over and wanted me to come down to the car to talk about some things. I instantly had a bad gut feeling, but was so confused because there has been literally 0 signs of him breaking up with me so I didn’t think that’s what it was. 

I got to his car, and he tells me he’s been feeling guilty because he said he doesn’t “love” me as much anymore or like me as much as he thinks he should. This came from no where, he spent 4 nights at my house the week before (quicker for him to get to work and able to see me, and spend weekends with buddies. He usually doesn’t spend as many nights at my place but it worked for this week). He was telling me he likes me or loves me/being around me, calling himself “daddy” to my dog literally two nights before all of this. 

Nothing he said was making any sense. I asked him if there was another girl, if we just needed more space from each other and moved too quickly, etc etc. He just kept saying there is no second chance, that I did nothing, and that about 3 weeks ago he started to feel this way and has been figuring this all out in his head. 

I was so blindsided and heartbroken. 
Later on, I realized all of this would make sense if he relapsed. 

I asked him twice over text (we were having a conversation to clear some stuff up in the conversation in the car) if he relapsed. He called me and told me he did. He told me he’s done it 3 times. And when I did the math I realized it was 3 weeks ago that he would’ve done it for the first time again. 

I told him I would love to be by his side and help him in any way he needs or wants me. I agree being in a relationship could be too much for him right now, but I want to be his friend and be here for him. He seemed hesitant, but open to the idea. He hasn’t told his mom or dad. He has to drop some things off this week so I’m gonna ask him about talking to his parents to get professional help. He didn’t have professional help before, just did it on his own. 

I feel so utterly heart broken. I can’t stop shaking, crying, wailing. I know it’s a short amount of time for a relationship, but it feels so much longer due to the time spent together. I feel like he’s just dumped me on the side of the road after helping him so much (he did a lot for me too) and having this connection. I want to be there for him so so so badly. I don’t have a need to fix him, I just want to be in his life. The thought of him not in my life and vice versa breaks me to my core. My stomach hurts, chest, heart, everything hurts. 
I don’t believe that he just magically stopped liking me. I don’t believe he doesn’t see me in his future suddenly (when he said he did before). I feel like this is a wall he has created to try to protect me from himself and make it easier to leave me?? I don’t know. I know he’s been off and lethargic at work today (my friend works with him).

I don’t know what to do. I want to be in his life and him in mine so so SO badly. I don’t know where to go from here. I just need help and insight to what is going on here. I’ve never dealt with addiction so I don’t know what’s going on. 
I don’t feel like I’m not in a relationship now, and it feels wrong to be single. I just don’t know how to handle this or what to do. 

Thanks in advance.

I just fed him and he got food everywhere on the floor so i put him in his play room with my partner (hes playing the ps4) and because i closed the baby gate so i could clean up quickly and he blew up. He has not stopped crying for almost half an hour. 

He absolutely loves my partner so its not that. He just hates being behind baby gates while you’re on the opposite side. Is that normal for him to feel anxious from that and is there any way to help him through it. 

I have tried my absolute hardest to let him cry it out as thats what everyone keeps telling me to do. I personally struggle very hard with that method and i end up crying myself... He does this with his parents as well. 

He also freaks out if you need to go to the bathroom and close the door (so he cant get in).

I appreciate anyone who has any helpful advice and friendly methods to this problem. I love my nephew and just want him to be able to settle himself and not feel like that. As well as make my job a bit easier.

468,"I am a male in my 40s.  My son is 15 and lives with my ex-wife most of the time, as do my other 2 children.  I see them on weekends and once during the week - we divorced nearly 7 years ago.  He has always been a difficult child since the day he was born and his behavior just keeps getting worse and worse the older he gets.  FWIW, his behavior was the same before we divorced, so I can’t chalk it up to only the divorce as the driving factor as to where we are today.  To understand what I’m dealing with, here are just some examples (I could fill a novel) of his most recent behavior...

- A few years ago on Christmas, I noticed he didn’t unwrap an Xbox game that was on his wishlist.  I didn’t realize the present was missing until Christmas Day when he never opened it.  So I spent hours on Christmas looking for it all over the house and when I couldn’t find it, I asked him if he happened to know where it is (suspecting maybe he had taken the present early and didn’t want to tell me).  He immediately blew up at me and we got into an argument.  Based on his reaction, it was obvious he took it, I just wanted to know why and where it was.  He said he would only tell me what happened to it if I told him I believed that he didn’t take it.  So I told him that I believe him that he didn’t take it and then he immediately tells me he did take it and gave it to a friend for money.

- 1.5 years ago, I wake up on a school night to music blasting in the house.  I open my bedroom door to find he has taken all of the furniture out of his room and put it into the hallway.  I tell him to put it back and get to bed, he has school in a few hours.  He then looks me dead in the eyes and says “Make me.”  I don’t even bother, and I put the furniture back myself, tell him to go to bed again and go back to bed myself.  10 minutes later, he leaves the house.  I go find him, and we get into a massive argument and he throws a punch at me, so I called the cops.  They spoke to both of us and then I took him to his mothers house.  Fast forward 10 months later and my ex-wife files a lawsuit against me for 80k and submits an audio recording of that night as evidence against me in her court filings.  Yep, my son recorded our argument and gave it to his mom.

- 2 years ago, my oldest son who was 16 at the time and my now 15 y.o. son come up behind me while I’m watching a basketball game.  My 15 y.o. asks me if he can take the computer upstairs to his room to do his homework.  I told him no, because he was grounded at the time and had his computer privileges taken away.  I told him that he was only allowed to use the computer for his homework in the living room.  Then he started repeating “Give me my shit.” over and over until I got up, turned around and asked him to stop.  Then my oldest son starts yelling at me and inches closer to me like he is going to punch me.  At this point I’m not only confused as to what in the hell is going on, I’m feeling physically cornered by both of them.  My daughter gets scared and starts crying.  My wife witnesses it as well and asks them to leave if they can’t calm down.  Both of my sons leave, I go find them and ask them to get in the car and come home.  But they only want to go to their moms and proceed to tell me the whole car ride how shitty of a human being I am.  I haven’t seen my oldest son since.  It’s been over 2 years now and he refuses to speak to me.  My ex-wife doesn’t have a problem with this, and actually fought for a court order that allows him to choose where he would like to live.  That’s a battle I was never going to win with the court because he is 16.

- A couple of months ago, I find on his Instagram that he posted pictures of himself with beer and weed.  He had snuck out of his moms house, and he and his friends made comments about how stoned and drunk they were that night.  So I let his mom know that he’s sneaking out and that he could have gotten into serious trouble, arrested or an accident.  He could get kicked off of high school sports, or expelled.  She, as usual, tries to normalize the behavior.  So I pick him and my daughter up for the weekend and that night I get a text from him (from his bedroom) telling me to give him his shit back.  I didn’t know what he was talking about (and didn’t know yet if his mom spoke to him about sneaking out) so I go ask him to not talk to me like that, and whatever it is he thinks I have, he definitely won’t be getting it now.  Then he gets really aggressive and starts calling me a “fucking pussy” for ratting him out to his mom and shoves me.  He keeps repeating that I’m a “fucking pussy” and follows me around the house as I’m just trying to get away from him.  My wife comes out wondering what is going on and sees my son fisting up to hit me.  She asks him to leave, he does, and we call the cops.  He ends up going to a friends house that night.  That same night, my daughter, who is 11, tells me and my wife that she is scared of her brother and that he sucks the happiness out of everything.  My soul just breaks when she says that, because it’s true.  We are all scared of him, and he doesn’t like when others are happy.

Which brings me to where we are now.  Fast forward some time and my daughter tells me that she watched a movie with her brother in his room very late at night the other night.  Thinking this is a little odd because she just told me she was scared of him, I go and talk to her brother.  At this point he has no idea that his sister told me she is scared of him (which I later learned that she is only scared of him when he gets aggressive).  I wanted to talk to a therapist first to see how to handle if I should tell him or not.  Anyway, I try to delicately ask him to not watch movies with his sister late at night in his room and he keeps asking me why.  I just said, if you guys want to watch a movie together, no problem, just watch it in the living room.  I honestly didn’t think it was going to be a big deal.  I thought he would say “ok, fine whatever” and move on.  From my POV, I was trying to make my daughter feel comfortable.  From his POV, he thinks I’m calling him a pedophile and a creep and proceeds to yell at me, saying that I called him a creep and threatens to kick my ass.  After a while of him again following me around the house saying he is going to beat me up, he leaves the house and I’ve not seen him since.  I let his mother know what happened and that he needs to be in therapy and back on his meds (that is a long story).  Her response is that therapy won’t fix every problem and that it’s my fault he isn’t on his meds anymore.  She does give me his therapists contact info (who I am waiting to hear back from).

He refuses to talk or see me again until I admit I called him a creep.  I never said that and do not want to admit to anything I never said.  Especially when there is already history of that trying to be used against me in court.  

I feel like I’m being gaslighted and I just honestly don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I want nothing more than a healthy relationship with him, and all of my kids.  I just don’t know if it will ever happen:  It’s clear my ex-wife doesn’t want that to happen, even 7 years later.

I feel like my soul is in shatters, the whole relationship is toxic.  But he is my son and I love him, I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Please help.",01Sep2020,2

Today at work, a quiet guy who is so nice had a seizure. It was so unexpected and I had no idea he had epilepsy. But he was alright after that, just very shook and didn't remember what happened. 

But the whole day I just felt like complete shit for some reason, like I just couldn't stop thinking about the poor mans face as his body took control of him. I felt so bad for him and this kind of feeling happens so very often to me.

472,"So me and my ex slept together for months after we broke up. It was a total of about 4 months. I was in love with him and I continued to sleep with him because I broke up with him but regretted it. I was convinced that sex was enough for me until i eventually realized it wasn’t. So I told him that I didn’t want to keep sleeping together and I explained why. I made it very clear that my reason was (very specifically) because I didn’t want to keep hurting myself by continuing to sleep with someone I realize I was still in love with and I also suspected he was sleeping with other women. I was not mad at HIM for MY decision to keep sleeping with him. Almost an entire month passed and I intended to never speak to him again but he texted me and asked to make up. I told him that I wasn’t his personal hoe and that if he was looking to have sex to call someone else. He went on to say that he loved me and that he needed me in his life. He asked to meet and we did. During that meetup he got into an stare down with a guy for glancing at me and tried to kiss me repeatedly because he wanted the guy to know who I was with. I of course didn’t want to kiss because I didn’t want to kiss someone I wasn’t in a relationship with. He got very upset about that and asked to get back together and even cried and promised to change. I was surprised by the sudden change and I said I would “think about it.” We weren’t actually together but we did go back to kissing, having sex again, and going on dates. But out of nowhere he ghosted me and I eventually found out that he had got into another relationship. I tried to understand his point of view since we weren’t actually “together” but I couldn’t help but feel like he knew that he would hurt me by coming back. If I wasn’t what he wanted why did he do that to me? I also know that we weren’t together but wanting to be with someone “better” doesn’t warrant playing with my feelings until he came across that. I feel like he was SO wrong",01Sep2020,1

I was playful and said, “What’s your favourite dinosaur?” After her response, I replied with “I personally prefer tri-Sarah-topless” after which she unmatched. I thought nothing of this until I spoke about this with my friend, and he said that this counts as sexual harassment and abuse and blocked me.

477,"Yesterday my sister asked me to take a loan in her stead, because the bank refused to give her the loan due to reasons I would rather not mention. She said the amount was 5k and she would repay me in five months. She needs the money for her boyfriend's house, where she lives, with her boyfriend and his parents.

I asked her how she was gona repay me in such a short time (where I live, 5k are a lot to repay even for someone with a decent paycheck, and she does not have a decent paycheck). She said that her boyfriend's brother will return the money, and he actually earns more (not sure how much). 

So I was considering very seriously to do this one thing for her. While I do not trust her a lot because she has a habit of borrowing money and not returning them and breaking promises, her boyfriend is a much more mature and he keeps his word. I asked her if she was sure she could return the money in 5 months since I still though it is a rather short amount of time and I am not sure how much her brother in law earns. She said she would call me in five minutes.

She did not call or write yesterday, but today she told me that I had to ask for a longer loan term in the bank, 1-1.5 years, because she and her boyfriend would be making the payments if the brother would be unable to. 

To be honest I don't trust her a lot because I think she is irresponsible and has a tendency to say things just to get her way. 

Also:

- I do not trust her bfs and her capability to pay me the loan even in 1.5 years. 

- I feel like she initially told me the brother would get the money in 5 months just so that I would agree, and now she changed the deadline (maybe I am being paranoid about this specific thing).

- She owes me money (a small amount) from 5 years ago and doesn't sound like I'm getting them back for the time being. 

- She borrowed an even smaller amount two months ago, said she would return them in a week and hasn't returned them yet.

 - She doesn't do shit about our parents or younger brothers (actually borrowing money from one of them last year even though he was trying to save for college) but when it comes to her bf or his family she asks me to take a frickin loan. 

- I have invited her to hang out several times, always making clear that I am willing to adapt to her schedule but she never has time for me. Yet yesterday she was willing to meet so that we could discuss about the loan.

I don't think I can think straight about this. I wanted to help her initially, but now I feel like she is being dishonest and I am just getting angry at feeling used by her.",01Sep2020,2

480,"I (14F) want to become a Wattpad writer for fun.

I've always dreamed of making my mark in the world because I don't want to just come into this world and leave years later with pretty much no one knowing who I am.

No, I don't really wanna write cliché bad boy and good girl romance stories since my interests never lay in the genre romance.

My interests usually lay in Horror, Thriller, Mystery, Action, Sci-Fi and Fantasy.

I've had TONS of ideas for possible stories but everytime I start one, another story idea pops up and slowly I lose interest in the current one I'm only two chapters into writing.

In all of my previous attempted Wattpad stories, NONE of them have ever made it past the chapter four, let alone chapter five mark before my interest got pulled away from it.

So, I'm asking, what should I do to help myself stick to one story? I'm not a full-time writer BTW, so my plan for stories would be to finish about half of the plot and then start posting it since I technically still have school :/

489,"Hello. It is my first time to post here. Although I have been reading to other posts, its my first time here. I really created an account for this. I just needed to unload this heaviness in my heart. Please don't be too hard on me. I'm just looking for advice.

I (25) and my boyfriend (21) are in a relationship for 2 years now. I am using his laptop for for my online class since my laptop needs to be repaired. I usually used the incognito window for the websites that I opened. However, there's this one time that I forgot to used the incognito and used the main browser instead. I was able to open his Facebook account. I promised to him before that I wouldn't open his account but he promised me too that it's really okay for me to look at it from time to time. So I just look at the messages at his messenger because I just want to. Not because I don't trust him. So here we go, I was able to open a conversation (2 years ago) of him and his so called young sis (18) in the internet (I know because he was able to share it with me) and I was shocked to find out that it seems like they were flirting (at least for me) there were messages like this girl saying she loves on sitting on other people's laps, and my bf replied ""plz sit on me""; this girl also openly shares that some boys were attracted to her since she got big boobs, my bf replied how he wishes that he could make a girl horny just by existing; my bf also pushes this girl to cosplay a thicc waifu of him and it seems he's really excited for it since this girl represents the physical feature of that character; another thing was that they had video calls and I don't have any idea what they do.

I know that it shouldn't matter because it was a convo 2 years ago. However, at this point in time, I was very confused of my feelings for him because he confessed to me yet he immediately said that only as a friend. But afterwards he confessed for real. At this time also he was claiming that he already love me. We've been exchanging messages also at this time however it's me who always message him most of the time,  I always shared memes to him to make him smile. But there were times that our chat would end coz' (accordingly) he will be sleeping or he falls asleep. But when I saw the time of their convo with this girl, they were exchanging messages at midnight.

I was really hurt knowing this. It feels like he was making a fool of me. During at this time I  was so confused with my feelings for him, at the same time waiting for his messages for I was so inspired. On the other hand he was just exchanging flirty messages with some other girl while claiming he was fuckingly in love with me.

Although right now, our relationship is going well. I confronted him about this but he got mad why the hell I opened his messenger and why does it matter to me. He just said that IT WAS JUST IN THE INTERNET. But I can't help but be bothered and worried about this. It makes me wonder if I didn't send him messages first, would he even pursue me? I really hate myself coz' it seems that I was really a fool. I've always thought that I already knew all about him. He said that, that was just his humor on the internet. He also said that I was just looking for a conflict.

Does past matters? Am I wrong for feeling this way? Am I should be the one to be blamed that I was hurt? Am I the reason for this conflict? Please answer. Please give me some advice. My heart is really heavy. I am crying while typing this feeling like a fool and stupid for feeling this way. I hate myself.

Please help me. Thank you 😢

P.S I am jealous sometimes since he is holding his phone most of the time.
P.S I know that I was wrong opening his messenger
P.S He is my first boyfriend

Lately dying has been on my head heavy. As the older my mom gets the more I worry each day. I want her to be here forever. I know forever isn't a thing but I always check on her when I come home. I just got back home right now and had a mini scare that she wasen't breathing cause usually she snores. Or I can see that she is breathing but for some reason today I didn't see it so I flash my iPhone light on her and I was so relieved that she woke up. She was kinda mad I woke her up but my goodness I think my heart stopped for a couple of seconds there. 

I don't feel like I spend enough time with her I feel so selfish. Starting today and so on I will just stay home and be with her. I get so caught up being with friends that my mom should be my number one priority and school. 
I love that Women with all my heart I tell you. I'm so happy I can see her everyday while I have friends from all over the world whom their parents live in different countries and they live in America so of course they arent as lucky to see them everyday while here I am being able to come home to the women who gave me life 🥺

496,"Oh boy. Where does one begin? 

When I was 13 (f, btw, idk if that matters like at all), I met this fella on kik. In an anime fanclub chat. 

I was a big fan of anime as a kiddo and I had access to the infamous chat app, kik. 

I was young, stupid, heavily depressed and really, really unsure about life as a whole. 

My growing up was tough. I had to be the father for my lil brother and the man of the house. I took care of my ma and my bro. My past times when I didn't have to feed both (mom was very very ill and my dad was never home. Had a girlfriend he'd see and another 'family'.) 
consisted of roleplaying, drawing with people and gaming. It really helped me through those dark times. 

I met a guy... uh. Let's call him Snake. 

We chatted and hit it off really well, actually! We became friends and ended up dating. 

He told me he was 14. 

He'd tell me all these sweet, loving things and would be there for me when I was really fucking down. I vented to him, opened up COMPLETELY. And he did the same. I still know alot about him. Its a whole 'nother world of pain. I never told anyone about his past, even though-- I am extremely spiteful. 


It was grand for abit. 

Really grand. For about... a year. 

Then I found out he was cheating on his actual current GF with me. Cherub. 

I didn't know her at all, and when I found out it crushed me. He actually confessed when he slipped up. Thanks, man, that really helped. Albeit mature of him to confess, it didn't help my sorrow. 

My first real boyfriend CHEATED. 

And as any dumb ass kid who was naïve and too young to realize their mistakes-- he asked for a second chance so I gave one.

Bad idea. 

He guilted me, from what I can remember and I fell back in. 

So I stayed. 

We had a big talk about trust and he mentioned that since we were so mature in our relationship I should be up to sharing nudes with him. It what 'All bfs and gfs do' so, with a lot if his pleaing and begging and 'Cherub did it and so did my other gfs' I got really upset and caved. 

And so that happened. 

We'd do alot together. I trusted him. He was my only friend as I didn't have any at school. I had no one but him. 

I was finally being 'cared' for. To be cared and loved was all I longed for as a kid. I was always the caregiver. 

Then my ma got better and we finally escaped my abusive dad and that god forsaken home. 

I moved in with my aunt. 

Then he cheated again. This time, a girl younger than me. 

12. Cherri. 

But another one too

Malev, 14

Two. TWO. 

This is when I blew up, I was inconsolable for days. At this time I found out, my phone was broken so I had to use my moms to contact him. Thats when he spilled because Malev actually kiked me about it. 

Exhausting. Right? 

My heart sank into my stomach. 

It deeply pained me. Ontop of my unmedicated depression, my shitty life situation, and things I will not exactly mention-- this broke me. 

I thanked Malev for messaging me and asked her for screenshots and everything and she obliged and told me she was sorry. 

They exchanged nudes.
Love messages. 
Everything. 

He knew her in person apparently. 

After a long talk, begging my mom to let me use her phone, and everything else. 

My dumbass stayed. 

I needed him. He convinced me of it. 

So I stayed. 

I remember the lengths id go to just message him. 

Especially during the time I had to stay with my POS dad and use his phone and nearly get beat for it-- I excused it with I was just talking to 'mom'. I did end up getting beat because my dad found out I was talking to Snake. 

And that was that. 

The last time I remember talking to him at my dads is when Snake said he cheated on me again with Malev. I gave up then. He explained it wasn't anything serious, he just missed me and needed that solace. 

Bullshit. 

She messaged me again. Saying he wanted to have sex with her and everything. 

At this point-- both of them were on my shit list. 

She knew we were together. 


So thats the really short and blunt backstory because honest to the Gods I cannot remember EVERYTHING from that long ago. It'll come up in bits and pieces. But it still sticks with me. 

I do remember vivid as day-- the pain and crying. The torment it was to go without wifi or a phone to text him-- the fear I had knowing he'd cheat if I wasn't with him 24/7 or if I didn't send sexual stuff. 

I later learned he is 23. I'm 19. 

He was 17 when we met. Not 13. 

Also, I wasn't ever the only one. I was just more talked about in his social circle and the only 'Gf' he ever brought up because I was his longest. 


Also, this is all within a year and a half span. 

looking back on it now.. its really fucking disgusting to me. We'd video chat and everything. He looked so young. He excused it as ""I'm actually 15"" and shit. I told him EVERYTHING. I thought what we had was what every relationship was. I thought it was normal. 

I thought I was special. I thought I was loved. 

I wasn't. 

I wake up everyday and he doesn't always cross my mind... but when he does I look at myself at the mirror alittle longer and begin to think on it. 

He made me think of relationships differently. For awhile after him I used to be hypersexual for my partner in fear they'd leave, id be intense and beg them not to leave me when they acted alittle distant. I was in constant fear of abandonment. He fucked me up. 

I was too young. I was stupid. 

And to this day. I still know who he is. Everything he did to me replays as he crosses my mind. 

I loathe him so much and i'll never see him as who he is today. I hate him. I hate him so much. 

How could you do that to a fucking CHILD? 

I don't know if this belongs here and i'll elaborate if someone asks. This was a one shot. Sorry for shit grammar or whatever. Please forgive me.

498,"I (15F) have been struggling with many insecurities, my sisters &amp; brother don’t care and make fun of me whenever.

My looks are constantly made fun of, whenever my brother (11) does it my mother will usually say something about it and make him stop. Whenever my sister (16) makes fun of me, my mother will sometimes tell her to stop but will rarely do anything after my sister continues, telling on her doesn’t do anything and saying anything back doesn’t work.

My oldest sister (19) is who my mother absolutely doesn’t care about. She’s not mean all the time, but when she’s mean, she’ll compare me to girls on tv, call me fat etc. (she’s tall and slim), my mother (rarely) will ask her if she‘s said anything to me, when she does my sister will usually say that I have an ‘attitude’ and my mother will take her side, all over something small like washing the dishes, whether or not I have an attitude, how does it justify her talking about my appearance? I never stoop that low.

I’ve tried talking to my mother about my sister (16) because she does it the most without consequence, she says she’ll talk to her but usually won’t because she won’t listen and continue being mean to me, she then gets mad at me and yells, asking me what she’s suppose to do, she has told me before to just talk about her appearance if she talks about mine, when I said I wouldn’t she just shrugged and said ‘ok’, going back on her phone.

My self-esteem has been destroyed (not just because of my siblings) and my mother literally doesn’t care. I can’t really talk to my dad about these things, he also does nothing and usually favours my brother.

I hate living at home a lot of the time and always feel like I’m being judged at both school and home, I don’t know what to do, this has been going on for about 3-4 years.",01Sep2020,1
499,"Me and my brother (m/17) both have had issues with our stepmom stealing our debit cards and taking 100s of dollars from us. So today this happened again but my brother wasn't having it. So he called her out for attempting to steal his money again.
This lead to her calling her husband (our bio. father) claiming that he needs to discipline us more and give her more respect. He sides with my brother and tells her that she needs to stop stealing from us and this leads to her being frustrated.
She comes home from wherever she went in a fuss while Im sitting around. I get a text from my dad telling me to keep an eye on my stepmom because she threatened to drive off with my younger half-brother (7) who is on the spectrum.
I start to hear her packing and immediately tell my twin brother whats going on and he decided to jump into the car to make sure that she can't drive off.
This all leads to her pulling my brother trying to force him out of the car. She threw his phone several times telling him that its not his, even though he pays for it and she is unemployed. My brother punched her once after warning her because he was not only defending himself but also to ensure that my half-brother is not in danger.
My stepmom calls my dad telling him that my brother hit her first for whatever reason. So my dad tries to get home asap and call the cops on her but they pull me and my brother aside separately and away from everyone else to question us.
I try to tell them that my stepmom is a known drug abuser and that she has ODed several times and has been hospitalized, and revived due to these instances. They shrug it off as if it doesn't mean anything. One things leads to another and my brother is gone without me even knowing.
They send him to Juvie but he opts into a Halfway home program to make sure he doesn't get a criminal record.
He didn't get to contact us. We have no idea where he is and what we can do to fix this for him. The cops told us that he is ok but thats what they always say.

This is a very complicated issue thats been ongoing for 7 years. My stepmom has been abusing drugs ever since then. There have been several instances where she's driven high and almost crashed. She denies all of it.
She also, as I mentioned, is known for stealing money and will never admit to where its going.

I've been unable to do anything about this situation ever since it began and I still have no clue what to do.",01Sep2020,1

507,"(Sorry if the formatting sucks I’m on mobile) So aside from the catchy title, my boyfriend (22) befriended somebody during a brief stay that he had in jail over a traffic ticket. This guy has always gotten on my nerves. He’s a “troubled” soul to say the least. 

He’s 26 years old and has a son that he never spends time with. His mom is raising the child for him. When he got arrested he had no choice but to withdraw from heroin and was finally doing good when he got out. He was living with his mom and son again, had a nice job, the works. 

Now, he began hanging out with old friends in the same dodgy places and just surrounded himself back with that lifestyle. So what’s going to happen? Of course he’s going to start shooting back up. My boyfriend and I offered him a place to stay when we found out he had been kicked out of his home. (His mom caught him passed out on the couch with a needle in his arm with his son home so she kicked him out.) 

Nevertheless, he didn’t accept our help and kept doing what he was doing. So three nights ago he calls my bf saying “please help I’m about to get jumped”. So we pull up to this grungy little laundromat in a bad side of town and quite literally found a mob of crackheads chasing him. (One of which had a hatchet). 

So now we’re taking this man home who’s literally fucked up on Heroin and Xanax combined. He eats a little bit of food, and passes out. So now we’re on day three. I understand he feels like mortal hell, I can’t imagine what heroin withdraws are like... but he’s driving me insane. 

My boyfriend and I have barely gotten any sleep because he’s up all night coughing excessively loud or just vomiting insanely loud. He threw up all over my wall and floor and then just went back to bed and left it there... we put a trash can right by him if he needed to throw up so WHY?? 

He’s leaving trash everywhere he goes, throwing his cigarette butts in the trash can which makes the pantry smell horrible, and is eating all our groceries. I know this all sounds like small and petty things, but I have Autism. Things like this very much bother me, and the disturbance in my routine has been enough. 

I want to take him to rehab as this man has literally never done a single favor for us and my bf helped him just because he felt obligated. We were literally the last people on this planet that could do anything for him. He’s been trying to get clean for 7 years and always goes back. His family is done trying. It was either we help him or he’d die on the streets.

My bf and I are struggling very badly financially, we’re two months behind on rent. We just aren’t strong enough to be carrying this mans dead weight. But we’re broke, he’s homeless, and his family has given up on him. So what do I do? Where do I take him to get help? We’re not qualified for this. We are in over our head and literally either had to let this (dare I say very ungrateful individual) into our home or have his death on our conscious. I’m stressed and upset.",01Sep2020,1
509,"So just over a week ago I matched with this awesome person on bumble, conversation is amazing and we messaged a lot over the first week with really decent conversation with actual substance. 

We had our first date on saturday afternoon and it was amazing. We talked and laughed she held my hand and we complimented eachother loads and it is looking really good. 

The only thing is that she has now started to ease off on the messaging a lot. At least it seems. I know shes just busy and I am too, but from messaging a fair amount a day (even with gaps sometimes because of work etc...)

I guess what im trying to say is that i just really enjoy talking to her and I dont want to bombard her or anything but also it would be great to get a little more conversation. I know things are going well though, we have 2 dates booked in for the weekend and she even booked the cinema tickets without really giving me a choice which was awesome. (We had agreed to go but not on what we would see etc...)

510," Am I going crazy or is my mother-in-law a hag?
This will be a long post and I apologize if I make any mistakes,I'm not a native English speaker.

I (32f) live with my boyfriend (38) E for almost 9 years now. Been together a year before moving in together,in his grandma's house (no one lives there anymore).
Before I was with him,I was with another guy from the same neighborhood. Didn't end well. 
I became friends after this with my now boyfriend and we fell in love and have been together ever since. He's the love of my life,kind,gentle, caring. He's a bit controling too and maybe manipulative but I can handle it. He doesn't abuse me or whatever. But that's for another story. 
His mother S on the other hand,knew I was with this guy and didn't want me specifically because I had boyfriends before her son. E told her anyone had ex boyfriends,it's not that big of a deal. There are however some missing parts here that I won't include. And she probably knows the situation and doesn't like me for that. But my last is my past. Nothing involving E however. She also told E that I'm a foreigner and I have a kid,maybe I'm not the right person, maybe I'm only using him. E told me all these things. But I'm still here,I love her son. I'm proving her wrong. I may not be the most perfect person on this Earth but I never cheated or lied to E. I never do stuff that would make her hate me at this point. 
So she's been kind and affective for years or at least acted well,her and her husband helped us on many occasions. 
 
She showed love until about 3 years ago. She started making these little offensive jokes about me,about how I'd dress (I never dress provocative in case you ask, just T-shirts and jeans, normal shorts,a normal girl),about my cooking even if I'm a decent cook. Just generally being mean. It hit to a point that I wouldn't even want to leave the house for the fear of seeing her. We live door to door. 

Here are some examples and what I need to understand is if I'm being butthurt or she's being mean. 
  - when we're invited to S's sister's house,I like to bake something sweet to bring along. They always compliment me on the cakes I make and ask for the recipes. S doesn't even want to taste them. 
   -she gives me her food recipes and when I make them,they don't turn up the same way (I have her recipes written down and it happened so many times that she laughed when seeing them,saying those were not her recipes,why is there salt in the recipe for home-made pasta when she doesn't use it. Or the recipe for a cake,I couldn't cook it,it got so bad. Only to see that the 6 spoons of flour she told me to add to the recipe were spoons so full that there were 3 spoons of flour in one,if you get what I mean). And so on. 
   -her husband died 6 years ago and 4years ago she told us it it were to happen that we didn't have the money to purchase flowers (I lost my job due to health conditions),that we shouldn't worry. So one day I purchased some flowers for my sister in law (died the same year,4 months apart) and didn't buy any for my father in law because I knew he would have plenty. I know now I should've. After 2 years from this incident with the flowers,which she didn't say anything about it before,me and her got into an argument and she brought it up saying: ""there's something else I need to tell you: after all these years you've been with us,after all the things we did for you,I can't believe you wouldn't buy my husband flowers?"" That I was ungreatful. It hurt me so much,she told me not to feel obligated only to tell me I'm being ungreatful! 
  -she makes tomato sauce that is really special. She's a good cook. So naturally,I asked her how she does it. She said ""fry the onion and then add the sauce and salt and leave it like this for 2-3 hours.""
 I however could never get the same taste. So my boyfriend went to ask her and when he came back he told me that there's a secret,she adds like 200-250ml of olive oil!! I didn't know that and since I'm adding it,the taste is similar! 
-sometimes when she cooks something that I like to cook too,like a cake or something,my son would compliment her saying that she is a better cook than me. Which is true but you should see her face. She gloats at his words.
-she told my son in front of us several times that he can eat there whenever he wants,that she knows how to cook. And the way she said it made it very clear that she was making a comparison between me and her. 
-when I purchased silicone lids,as soon as she saw them she made a disgusted noise and said they looked disgusting. 
-whenever I cook something and she comes in,she acts like she's disgusted and will say :what is this stench? Even if what I'm cooking is a cake or frying onions. 
-also,I just found out that she gave as gifts, gold necklaces or bracelets to my brothers in law's ex girlfriends. There's was my boyfriend's ex with whom he'd been for 6 months and she gave her a gold necklace. I'm with E for 10 years almost and never seen anything like this from her. Don't get me wrong,I don't want it,I don't pretend it. It just hurt. I asked her why not me? And she sort of scoffed and said :I haven't and I'm not going to get you any gold. Didn't even say afterwards she was joking or anything. 
Overall,she disagrees with anything I say,tries to put me in bad light wherever we go,she acts like there's a competition between us. I tried for years to be silent,never gave her reason to offend me and still she does it, even if she knows it bothers me. There are so many mean stuff she said to me and most are being said when E is not around. And if he's around,he says I'm being crazy. Am I though? 
The furniture I chose for our house is ugly for her,whatever her son chooses is beautiful. 

So,is it me that I'm just being butthurt over nothing or its her that she hates me?",01Sep2020,1

512,"My girlfriend has a good heart and she is absolutely lovely. My problem lies in the fact that she is on the clingy side of things, which is honestly nice because every other girl has been terrible and wouldn't give me the time of day. I don't mind it but I think it is a little extreme as far as when we hangout. I work nights 5 days out of the week and she is now going to school mornings 5 days a week. We have weekends off together and we usually hangout on weekends. There isn't any problem there but when it comes time for me to have my relax time and, ""fill my bucket"", as i call it, she isn't a huge fan. My biggest destressor, besides her, is gaming, and when I do she is fine with me doing it maybe 2-3 hours and that is it for the whole weekend. She likes to wake up before me and play a good 5 before I am awake for the day. Which is fine i dont care but i dont think that it is fair that she asks me to give darn near every waking second to her and i only get a few hours for the entire weekend. I know that in life you cant always do what you want, especially in a relationship, but i dont see the problem in being able to play for a good stretch of time with my friends without feeling guilty. I think the reason she doesn't like it is because she doesn't like to be alone, she isnt very happy just being by herself and entertaining herself, i know it is a problem but i dont know how to fix it. I dont want to tell her how to live her life but it would be nice to be able to have one day of all date stuff and quality time and have another day to be able to game and do what I want and do what I like. You might think i should include her in my gaming stuff but i only have one console and cant afford to buy her one as well. 

Overall i just wish that she could entertain herself instead of me having to do it the entire weekend. With how it has been going there are weeknights where she is able to come over and i find myself making excuses to not have her over just because i would like to game. 

Dont take this as me not wanting to date her or be with her. I love her very much and we do have a lot of fun with each other, i just dont think there is anything wrong with me wanting some ""me"" time...right? Im just not sure what to do or say, if you have any advice to give i would really appreciate it. Thank you in advance for the help.",01Sep2020,1

514,"This has hit me pretty hard. And I don't even live in the US!

I am a young boy in his early teens with pretty severe hearing deficiencies. I have absolutely 0 hearing on my right ear and fine hearing on my left([x are left ear and triangles are my right](https://imgur.com/a/rBL8Vgh)). 

I live in Italy but my region won't cover a cent of the hearing aids I need because for them I don't have a disability because I can just hear with my left but I encourage them all to put an earplug in their right ear and try to live like this for a week. It will not be fun, trust me.

Almost everything is harder when you can only hear from 1 ear: from crossing the road to trying to focus on multiple people at once! If you are in a crowded restaurant or in general in a crowded place and are trying to hold a conversation with someone you almost suddenly lose focus on the conversation and you start having headaches AND tinnitus.

I haven't had any problems with school so far because I can kinda lipread when I do not understand correctly but with the new school year and the mandatory use of masks, it's gonna be harder to do that because you cannot see lips through masks to read them. While gaming I just set my headphones to mono so I can hear my teammates better and that's what the Hearing Aids would do, basically mono subsample life since I can't hear from my right. If you are speaking into my bad ear I ain't hearing nothing.

Working is out of the picture because I am under the minimum age that I am required to be in Italy to be able to work. Also my parents won't fund any of this because it's just too expensive.

515,"Sorry for the formatting, this is my first post on reddit and I'm on phone. Sorry if this is so long! 

OK so earlier this year I (I'm 15) came out fo my mother as FtM trans (female to male). I came out by writing a letter to her and leaving it where she would find it in the morning, she seemed to ignore it for about 1-2 months when I asked her for a, binder, it took me a month of begging for her to get it, at this point she still hasn't used my preferred name and pronouns, not even once.

A while later I sit her down and ask her why she hasn't been using my pronouns and name, her excuse is that I'm ""not a boy yet"", I told her that I felt really bad about myself when she still referred to me as a girl and that I wanted to ask my 2 brothers about using my pronouns and name, she made the excuse that it would confuse them (they are over 10 years old). 

When we were finished talking, she decided to go to our living room and I would go to my room, after a few minutes she called me and my brothers to the living room, she then got me to stand up and tell my brothers how I feel, I wasn't prepared to talk to them at that moment, I didn't think she would put me on the spot like that. When I didn't know what to say she said that I was nagging her so much about telling them and that if it means so much to me I would know what to say, so she told them how I felt and they seemed fine with my name and pronouns.

They never used my correct name and pronouns after me correcting them every time, my mom started punishing me for correcting them by taking my phone for a day for each time I corrected them, around this time is when school was about to start, I asked her a day before School started if I could tell my friends to use my correct pronouns but she said no.

On Friday just gone by when I got in the car from school I told her that I was fed up of not being supported, she said that if I came out as trans my brothers will be bullied, they don't even go to the same school as me. I told her that I was having mental health issues because I just felt so bad about myself, she just rolled her eyes and told me to shut up.

When we got home she then called my 2 brothers to the kitchen and made them watch her argue with me, calling me a selfish brat for wanting to be different, she said if anyone found out she would kick me out and to go back to my father (I have never met my father), I told her I no longer consider her as, my mother, then she turned to my brothers and asked them if they heard that correctly, then she sent me to my room, she has refused to talk to me since, I don't know what to do, I don't really feel safe in the house and I don't know if I can go to a relatives house, I need help.",01Sep2020,1

517,"My mother bought me a bunny when I was 13 after she took away my computer and I lost my phone at school. I named her Honeydew Bunny and I loved her with all my heart. We took her with us everytime we moved houses and I always was around for her. I used to let her out in my room for hours. 
Fast forward to 2016ish, maybe 2017 and she collapses and is stiff. Im a crying mess, my mom is scoffing and saying that there's no vets that take care of rabbits near us. We had no choice but to wait for the end with her. It took 2 days and before, we frantically started calling vets asking if we can come to put her down because she looked to be in so much pain. The most we got was a vet that said they would take her and ""make her go in peace"". We refused. She died with green coming out her nose. That's what I remember.
Here's my question. I watched her suffer for almost 2 days, we're getting no where and she looks so fucking miserable. I started looking up ways to humanely take her out of her misery. I couldn't bring myself to do any of the methods I saw and instead held the towel onto her mouth and nose for a minute. She started convulsions and died a minute later. 
I keep believing what I did was a mercy but after I spilled the beans to my mom, she's called me a murderer and that I can't play God and that God had a plan for her death. I don't think I'm a murderer but she looks at me different now. Am I?

523,"Ok so I am well aware that working in a supervisory position at 21 in a multinational company is a great blessing. I was hired into the position at 19 as a fresh grad. My pay is high not only for my age range, even compared to others who may be working in the same position as I am in other companye. Aside from pay, the benefits are great, we won employer of the year in our countrybfor how amazing the compensation and benefits package is.

I know that no company is perfect, that's why I've convinced myself to stay the past 1 1/2 yrs. But the catch is aside from how demanding the job itself is, we do a lot of ad hoc work that the position doesn't call for. I'm in HR for my local branch office, but have been doing work for the corporate office. The work I've been doing for the head office were different collaterals, videos, and info graphics that are to be distributed to all 100+ offices worldwide, something the Corporate Communications would typically be handling.

Aside from this, on several occasions now, despite being in HR and having no experience whatsoever, I've been tasked with spearheading initiatives and campaigns for revenue optimization, and subsequently pitch this to our General Manager. These are tasks you'd expect our local sales and marketing to handle, but it was handed onto me.

Being assigned to handle the aforementioned was tiring and ultimately stressful due to lack of experience in the given fields, but I would have managed. The real kicker is that I am also tasked with handling a lot of personal tasks for our big boss. Think of Anna Wintour, or Miranda Priestly. She's like that. She expects excellence and zero mistakes from her staff, but also has us do an insane ammount of personal work for her. A few examples of personals I've had to do are:

-Handledher visa applications for her personal vacation rrips to different countries.
-I've overseen the renovations of her sons apartment during work hours. Because I was away from the office to oversee the renovations, I'd end up having to work overtime til 10pm-11pm to makeup for the time lost and still meet my actual job deadlines 
-She asks me to go out and personally buy her furniture from from places that are far from the office 
-we buy her lunches
-the golden rule at the office is you cannot say no to her. If she wants something, even if it's not possible to procure at the moment, we still have to find a way. An example would be one time I had to pull strings to get her this cake that was very exclusive and the waitlist was typically 3weeks before you could get it. But she wanted it within the week so I had to pull strings.
-she once heard of a sugar free alternative chocolate and wanted me to buy it that same day. So i scourged the entire city and all the malls in the area looking for it, but it wasn't available. So i had to look online and found it in some small instagram shop. The earliest it could be delivered was first thing the following morning so I agreed and paid for it. When I handed it to her the following day she said verbatim ""what is this? I wanted it yesterday, get it away from me""


Aside from the personals, our boss also expects us to be available at her beck and call, regardless of the time, or if it's a day off. I've had several times where i reported to work on both of my days off, unpaid, because they asked me to report to duty. There are occasions where it's 12mn and I did not reply to an email just sent because I was asleep, so the office would call me because the email sent came from the head office and it was imperative that I complete what was asked in the email immediately. 

There were many occasions that despite me being kn vacation leave, I'd have to answer emails, calls, and work, even if I was out of the country.

I'm confused if i should resign. Im genuinely tired, but it's a pandemic and unemployment is at an all time high. I don't know what to do.",01Sep2020,3

It was really heavy and hurt like shit, and I thought it was my mom who was mad at me for walking off. But when I turned around, it was some random smiling toddler staggering backwards. There was no one else around, so I assumed it was him. I didn’t react or anything, just stared him down. I was angry as hell though, and it really hurt.

525,"I (17F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for more than one year and two months now. I will soon turn 18, and him 19, and for my birthday, since I'll be able to do anything without a parental approval, I want to get my septum pierced.
I already have six piercings in total, all of them are on my ears. I have really short hair and I sometimes dye it so I already look kinda ""edgy"". 

My boyfriend does not like change. I love change. I love changing my appearance, my style, dyeing (??) my hair, getting new piercings, etc. I love expressing myself through my appearance. My boyfriend says that I am ""just perfect the way I am"", and does not appreciate the fact that I might want to change my hair, or get new piercings. I have mentioned once the idea of getting a nose piercing, and he has always been really opposed to it. He says that it would make me look like a cow, etc.. 

So, the question is: how do I tell him that I want a septum piercing? Last time I mentioned it, it was more than a year ago. I know that he is going to be mad and the conversation will probably end up with me saying ""I'm sorry, I won't do it"", and I REALLY don't want this to happen. I've wanted this piercing for so long, probably three years, and if I don't get it now, I probably won't ever get it.
I am also a convinced feminist, I usually do not let anyone tell me what I can or cannot do, but it's different with him, I feel so weak and I am unable to resist.
I hate the idea that someone could control what I do with my own body by messing with my mind, but I love him and I don't know what to do.

I'm 30, I have a stable job. I guess I have more friends than the average person. But I don't know what to do with my life.

For the past 15 years I played video games or watched tv shows most of the time but I can't/wanna do this anymore. 

I think I have at least an average social life and I go to the gym every second day and go for bike rides or travel sometimes. But with all that I'm only able to fill 50% of my time.

532,"I(17F) don't get along very well with my Dad(46M) or my stepmom(50F). My stepmom is very loud and pretty much shares her opinions with EVERYONE. she's the most far right republican person I've met and we live in one of the most liberal cities in one of the most liberal states in the US and she constantly antagonizes everyone from random people to close family members just for the sake of an argument. My family holds the belief that it's rude to talk politics especially within the family so the fact that she's constantly talking about politics is causing lots of friction and we've been uninvited to family holiday events because people are sick of her trying to piss everyone off. Other family members had talked to her about maybe not talking about it so much at these events, but she just went off about how we were trying to infringe upon her free speech. 

Now I'm definitely more left leaning and like I said I don't generally talk politics, but my stepmom is aware that she and I have differing beliefs and takes every possible chance to shove her beliefs down my throat, I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion as long as it isn't hurting anyone else, but I am definitely over her crap. She's always spouting stuff she knows I don't agree with just to get a reaction and while I don't engage it definitely upsets me to the point that I've held a straight face while she's around and then gone to my room to cry. 

Now here's my issue, I was having a conversation with my dad a few months ago on my birthday about Hamilton because I'd recently gone to see it when my stepmom completely injects herself into my conversation and I won't get into it too much, but she was just completely crapping on the creator of Hamilton and how much she dislikes him due to his helping Puerto Rico, and I don't know I just kinda snapped and said ""I wasn't talking to you."" And oh boy was that the wrong thing to say, she completely made a scene in the restaurant about how she was disrespected and decided that she couldn't stand around me any longer so she totally just took an Uber home while the rest of us went to a movie, of course my dad was pissed and I ended that birthday grounded. 

About a week ago I was talking to my dad about a man who happened to be black and who also happened to be on meth in our neighbors front yard just cause ya know someone on meth in the yard is somewhat out of the ordinary, the neighbor asked the dude to leave cause he was leaving marks in the grass with a shopping cart and he left end of conversation, but of course my stepmom HAD to get on her high horse about how she felt about blm and was just saying a ton of really crappy stuff, keep in mind she was in a complete other room at the time apparently listening in to a conversation that completely didn't concern her and she was yelling her unnecessary contribution and I felt completely helpless in the situation. 

I'm at my wits end. She has different beliefs chill, but I don't know what to do about the constant yelling and antagonizing from her or about the interruptions. I don't know how else to tell her to butt out of my conversations nicely either. It's a constant occurrence and I honestly don't want to be there anymore because the entire week long it's the same thing over and over and my dad just constantly sided with her on every single thing which I guess shouldn't be surprising considering he chose her over us when he cheated with her, I can't just not go because my dad gets pissed at my mom if she doesn't make me go and will threaten to take away the two weeks of vacation time he lets her have us in the summer.

533,"Hello everyone, i've (21/F) been having a bad time recently and i would love to receive your advice or any kind of help. I've been battling depression since middle school and my life has really not been so great at that time, it felt like everything bad that could happen happened to me all at once. 

I left my boyfriend of 5 years because of his drug addiction, mental and physical abuse and a lot of other various reasons and i was left completely alone, my mother disowned me, and the other part of my 'family' turned their back on me.

 Then i got into a deeper hole by taking out 2 loans from two different companies because i didn't have enough money to survive, after realising that i don't have enough money to make monthly payments because my job wasn't paying me enough i started considering suicide, because everything was too hard to handle until one man walked into my life and he helped me through that point and is still helping me in any way possible and i couldn't be more grateful for that. 

At the moment the first loan is almost paid off, but there is still the second one and it really brings me down everytime i think about it. When quarantine began i lost my job and i was left at home with my thoughts and i just pushed myself deeper into the rabbit hole of overthinking. Right now i've found a job, but it pays the bare minimum. I don't have any degree because i had to work to make a living since i didn't have a family and didn't want to end up on the streets.  

Right now i feel really hopeless and useless since i have no talents or any amazing skills and i think i will never find a well-paying job. I also have no money to go study because of the loan and rent and it feels like i will be stuck here forever. If you have any possible advice on what should i do, please let me know, i would really appreciate it.",01Sep2020,1

It's even more upsetting for me because before I started working there and they knew beforehand during the interview that I was hit by a car so I constantly need to go to doctors appointments so I can make sure that I am healing correctly especially my broken ribs.

I really am thinking about quitting because I worked so long for the past almost 4 weeks and I still really haven’t seen any compensation for it.

I only really took the job because it was offered to me and in the job application it did say I was being paid $20.50 an hour but that turned out to be a lie so should I just outright quit or put in a two weeks notice.

Because from the start of it I was told I was hourly then I was told I was going to get a base pay us up to 600 a week and then it turns out I am only making five dollars an hour.

Just recently me and my current fiancee were packing to move to our new apartment, and she got a hold of a book that I used to scribble in when I was with my ex. She read the songs and then she turned to me crying and said that if I actually published the songs they would be good. 

I have always had self confidence issues and I immediately told her that the songs wouldn't be good, but she assured me that it would be good. I've wanted to record and release those songs somewhere for the last 6 years but I've never had the guts to be able to release my art.

548,"Hi, 

For information, I’m a 24 year old female. 

As the title says. I did a post yesterday in another sub with this - but I’ve realised now that I’m not in love with him, I don’t really know what real love is but I’m infatuated with him.

I finally found my dream job last year after 3/4 years of looking, I felt so lucky and grateful to finally get this after so many applications and interviews. I love my job, but there is a much older man there who I’ve become infatuated with, I’ve never been more attracted to anyone but of course I know there is no chance of anything ever happening - he’s married with kids and I’m much younger - even if he wasn’t, he’d never be interested.

I’m going back to working in the office soon after months from home due to the pandemic. Seeing him has been what’s kept me excited over these last few lonely boring months. But I know this isn’t healthy. How do I expect to get over him this way? 

So I’m considering leaving unfortunately. There are other areas I’m interested in working in - whilst they wouldn’t be my dream but I’d still hopefully find something I enjoy. But of course I’m aware of the jobs situation right now and I don’t plan on leaving until I have something lined  up for sure. 

I feel sad that this is how my dream may end. But I have told myself that maybe, in a few years time, hopefully my life will be in a better place, I might find someone I really love, maybe the man I like right now might leave the company. And having the experience and connections now could  make it easier  for me to get another job in that place sometime in the future. 

I really appreciate any advice and thank you all for reading. I just don’t want to regret leaving what I’ve worked towards for so long because of a crush, but it feels so much deeper than any crush I’ve ever had before, it’s affecting my mental health so much and I cry regularly.

i don’t really know how to begin and my grammar and spelling are all over the place so beware. also, i tend to jump around a lot. well, at least i think i do, but i don’t know. oh yeah, plus i’m not good at wording questions so please bare with me. currently i’m doing online schooling due to covid-19 and it’s not going well at all. the first week i had computer issues from the school issued computer and even on friday my internet went out midday. 

also, i’ve always had bad mental health and it was getting very bad before school even started up so i definitely wasn’t looking forward to school in the first place. another thing, i have no math class, my other class won’t start for weeks when it’s supposed to have already started, we have to use cameras and mics and stuff and that gives me anxiety. for one, i cannot focus on the work the teacher gives while she’s talking and seeing the other students moving around. it’s like when i’m on the computer i get easily distracted due to the online meetings and i did used to get distracted in real school, but i started skipping and i also had a physical paper in front of me which helped. i don’t have access to a printer, so i can’t solve that. to make a long story short, i can’t try to push through with something i can’t do. i tried to last year and i almost lost my life (long story) and i can’t get stuck with this and go into a cycle of skipping class like i’ve already started and did last year, so my school will probably start getting on to me. i don’t want my siblings or my mom to get in trouble for me not attending or me making a bad decision because honestly i’ve been in a bad place and school always makes it worse. 

the bad thing is, i’ve always wanted to get my diploma, but not go to college and now i don’t even see a point in that. btw, i don’t have depression or anything else like that it’s something else, but it’s something else and i just don’t want people to think weird of me even if i don’t care it’s annoying (i am diagnosed and not by myself). basically, i just want to know what else can i do for a school option? i can drop out in a couple of months, but i don’t want to regret it. i can’t go back to regular school because they’ve closed sign up, anxious about the virus and school was hell for me so i wouldn’t look forward to seeing anyone or anyone seeing me. i know homeschool is an option, but i don’t think my mom has the qualifications. i know there are other online school, but they probably require a computer they won’t issue, a camera ( i don’t have my own room or space or anywhere quiet and that causes a problem for my siblings school too. most teachers don’t take that into account because i guess they don’t realize.). my mental health is declining so no matter what i think nothing will work and i’ll end up like i always do.",01Sep2020,1

Today, my so and I went to a farmers market, a lot of local products, it's pretty nice. We decided to make some burgers so we bought meat and also thought about buying the cheese (Cheddar) from one of the shops. We talked a little with the owner and she said they don't sell typical Cheddar (the orange one) there because it's not natural and she only had a special one but that it is very expensive (70€/kg). So we said that we are gona go to a supermarket and buy a cheaper one. We stil bought an other cheese there.

After we were talking about prices a lot, the friendly lady asked us if we were students and we said yes (ofc we really are.). She then said she could make us a special price if we wanted to try the expensive Cheddar. We were very glad and happy about the offer and said yes.

So she gave us like 200g of the Cheddar and the other cheese (wich costet about 4€) and charged us 7€. That was realy cheap and extremely friendly!
But I kinda felt bad and gave her a tip of 1€ so a total of 8.

I know that sounds ridiculous but do you consider this as rude? I mean she reduced the price because she knew we don't have much money. I have no idea how to explain this properly as English is not my native and I know it's stupid and doesn't realy matter but I Stil feel strange about this.

My ex (as of a few days ago) is behind on money and has asked me to help cover majority of her half for the second month in a row. I have told her in the past to get more hours or look into a second job but she has never done something about it. On top of wanting me to just give her another $300, she technically owes me lots of money for other rent, i bought her expensive contacts recently too which she has never paid me back for on top of everything else. 

I previously told her yes i will try my best to cover her this month when it came too, that was before she dumped me. That’s why I’m kinda justifying giving her it because I did agree beforehand and I still do care about her and want to help her. It just angers me how she expects this from me. Yesterday she straight up demanded $27 from me and didnt say why (i already knew why, it was for our wifi bill) She just did not even bother to say please or thank you so that right there shows me that she may not respect how much i support her and what i try to do.

Do I be a dick or let her walk on me?

This person lost a close person to him due to suicide during the summer of last year. Not only did it affect him, but I didn’t see the emotional aspect of it as if was being masked. He suffered another crisis with his girlfriend around September wondering if she was the one. The girl got high and had reckless behavior. He cried over her and cared a lot for her. He ended up breaking up with her. One of the reasons is due to his parents going through a vicious divorce and not wanting to suffer like his dad did. He was terrified of the thought. It was around October I knew this person was taking adderal for his exams and confronted him about the issue. What I essentially told him is that he doesn’t need them and there isn’t any need to take them. I got responded with defensively with why he needs them and don’t doubt him. Not once did I even mention doubting him, but how do you have confidence in yourself when you are arguing you need them? What impression am I supposed to believe? It’s not like he has a prescription either he buys it from dealers. It became a frequent matter as it was multitude of times he took it and looked to be going into possible addiction. I told him to stop. However, he got aggressive when I cared and says I’m real. I did care for him a lot and to my kind heart it just makes me feel weak. In December it was like he broke. He changed drastically. He essentially left me behind for a group of friends. We were supposed to hangout and we had plans. I didn’t have a problem if he has other friends I have a problem when you don’t tell me. He knew we had plans for a long time and never bother to tell me and I found out through someone else. He never would’ve invited me either if I didn’t confront him. I told him about it and he just gave me the strong impression that yeah I prefer them. Like I was a second option. So I go from being this strong supportive friend to being nothing. I cared and loved him a lot, but did that leave a scar. We had a conversation in which I don’t know why I was leading it when I wasn’t in the wrong. When I called him out he tried to put them blame on me. Not once did this person say sorry only played the victim. I should’ve been feed up at this point, but no. We go into next year and he gets more distant and distant. I told him how I feel and he laughs. We go from caring and loving each other as brothers to being at war with one another. There was always something he wanted from me, but never communicated it. Like this was this expectations I could never meet and I don’t know what it was. He would talk to my other close friend on what to do and advice when he got me upset. I knew about this in secret and act like I didn’t. It isn’t wrong to ask for advice, but to think that would solve the issue without communicating what effects you doesn’t help either. I do care and if it’s important to him then it matters to me. I genuinely felt I was fighting this hidden battle. Never has he communicated to me the problem and was so passive aggressive. I asked him on multiple occasions and times as I doing something wrong? What can I do to improve? Just nothing is working and I’m watching this person unfold to his bad habits. I been trying to figure it out over extending myself for no reason. I’m walking oceans while this person wouldn’t walk a puddle. I know he is trying to have control of the situation. He basically leaves me like a second option and forgets about me. I was left behind. I’m very confident this person is a narcissist. We had this toxic relationship of being friends to not. We tried talking many times. It was always over the phone or texting. I asked multitude of times to talk in person, but was only given over the phone. It was clear to me it isn’t important to him. I always ask him am I doing something to you thag is hurting you or bothering you? Always get the response “no your good”. I was in the hospital and he choose his group of friends. I tried to align his goal. I supported his goals. I supported him the best way I could. It wasn’t even good enough. I’m over here devaluing my sense of self worth for what? Some illusion I fabricated in my head that distorted reality? I only do this to people I really care about, but gave him a Christmas present with his brother face on it as a t-shirt. It was something funny, but I was happy to do it. He gave me a gift, but stated “I didn’t care enough to wrap it or drop it off” and laughs saying that. He gave me this look like he enjoyed wanting to hurt me. He told me that he hates me and acts different. When I hung out with friends and brought them over for him to meet them he tell me to remind him to never bring them over. I give his brother a moment of attention and he gets sad and hurt. I can tell by reading his body language. It hurts because he can’t see I love and care for him. He is so blinded by anger and sadness it’s killing him. Yes, actions speak louder than words. I tell him he doesn’t appreciate me at all. He only started to hit me up when he needed something. I stopped texting him to see if he would and no just the people he left me behind for. Yes, I’m not responsible for fixing him. I was getting abused by this person severely. It wasn’t till July I finally pushed him away at a party. I never knew it was his birthday party with someone else until afterwards. We were all drunk and I was high (not my proudest moments). I was with other people and he came up to me telling me “hey dog I appreciate you and love you”. I just without a thought rapidly put my hand out to stop him from hugging me. He bounced and tried to come in and stopped looking at me. I couldn’t even look him in the eyes I was so hurt by him. I tried to look up, but my Brian wouldn’t let me. We stood there while everyone was watching while he told me “I love you” in a hurt voice. I couldn’t even respond because I do, but I know that not to be true. In my mind I said if you really did we would be standing next to each other not against each other. What came out of my mouth was just a  cracked hurt voice saying “yeah” with my head turned to the right. He withdrawled and went about his business. Then later again he comes back and takes pictures with everyone in the group while we were having a conversation. Gets everyone snapchat and takes a picture with me and puts his arm around me. I didn’t even bother looking at the camera I looked away. He takes another pause and walks away. 

Afterwards I go through my own nonsense about having wishful thinking. I was like no this has to stop now. I legit didn’t feel I was good enough. Why was it not enough? I understand him and could hear him suffering, but was pushed away. Why am I always the second option? Why am I begging you to be treated right? Why am I asking you to love and care for me? Why am I fighting these hidden battles? Why was I not enough? I should be enough, but I’m so hurt. I really am and he believes it’s my fault. I know parts of it was my fault because I allowed him to continue it. It’s like everyone I had just hurts me. I deserve love just like everyone else. I know I deserve the best people in my arsenal. I have been on this journey of self love, but I just have this “wound” attachment with this guy. I feel so worthless. I know he is hurting. I know he is in pain, but I did my best and I feel sometimes when I shouldn’t  that it wasn’t good enough. Now I’m left here to pick up the pieces while he obliterates me. I became stronger each day as consequence of it, but have to forgive him so I can heal. I don’t even know how. I meditate. I write journals. I do a lot of things and it’s a tough process alone. It’s hard fighting a hidden battle. I been seeing a therapist. I’m just so tired of caring for people. I take care of myself of course and I’m the priority, but love just is awful. Sure it’s great in the moment, but nobody told me about the contraindications to the drug. I been working on myself and so mad at him that drives me to better myself. I just hate and love him like a brother. I want to come out being the person I need to be. I want to come out a different person that grown a lot. I want to come out being a person that someone looks at and says I don’t want to lose you. Why wasn’t it enough? What hurts the most is it’s an anger that loves me and knows I deserved better. What did I do wrong? I need a hug bad...I need people. I need to walk....",01Sep2020,2
560,"SO, if you didn’t see my last post here, this is the context:

“So, what happened was I was joking with this friend on Snapchat and compared his grandmother to a monkey which crossed the line I think and now, I’m thinking about apologizing after a few days when everything is kind of cleared up but I don’t know how to go about it. Can anyone give me some advice?”


Now, I ended up apologizing and he replied saying it’s fine but not rlly at the same time and he basically accepted the apology, right? Done, dandy, and good, right? But no... it isn’t and I need advice on WHAT to do next because when I asked if we were still friends and I kinda got impatient because they didn’t rlly reply fast which is a problem on my part, they ended up replying very rudely and basically saying that we were still friends I guess. And you may think, hey, that’s great, but the I guess part really threw me off and now I don’t know what to do because I know he doesn’t want to anymore, so I basically told him that I know he doesn’t rlly want to which makes sense because I fucked up badly with what I did since it seemed to have really hurt him and I also said that we can take some time apart and stuff if he wanted to and that I really was sorry because I really am and I really do want to fix this. I even prayed to god haha (Christian here), that’s how important this is to me. And you may be thinking rn “This OP is fucking stupid, just drop the friend already, you fucked up, move on.” And I know that guys, but I don’t really have too many friends, I only have like one or two, let alone any that are genuine and this one felt genuine and I liked it a lot so I kind of want to do what I can and give it my all to fix things before I give up so that’s my explanation for that. Anyways, any advice as to where I should go from here?",01Sep2020,2
561,"I (21f) have to get a sick note from my GP but today I spoke to a rude receptionist and she was like I need to call and ask again, then the dr will decide if I'm fit for work. I'm worried it's going to be another doctor and not my actual GP and they wont give me a sick note, even though I'm eligible for one. 

The worst part is because of covid, I cant speak to my GP, the receptionist relays what the GP says and then they decide what to do next. So I'm worried this will somehow effect my chances of getting a sick note. This is really stressing me out. 

Any ideas on how to approach this? Also what can I do if I dont get a sick note. I'm from the UK if that helps.",01Sep2020,2
562,"Long story short:

My grandfathers placed a terrain to my brother's and my name decades ago for when we were 18. I am 23 now and my brother's 21.

My parents decided to build a big house and a business in there when we were kids. The house alone is worth about $200k.

I have always had an awful relation with my mother, to the point that 3 weeks ago she called the police because we were arguing about ""cooking a steak"".

Yeah, for real that's how ridiculous it has gotten. My mother is manipulative and has always been that way.

Well, she called the police as I was cooking the meal for lunch. I realized what she did and decided to hurry up and call some friends so they can get me out. Otherwise I would spend 3 days in prison.

So, I call my friend and then the police arrives. They ask who is the guy and I just say ""just take me already"" and turn back. They handcuff me and pick me up to the truck. All this was in front of the business and a lot of people I know saw me getting arrested.

When I am in the truck several officers seemed surprised that I am calmed but also that my mom was calmed, too. So they asked me if I was going to let this pass and stop arguing with my mom, which I say ""ok"".

So they let me go and don't talk to my mother. She is talking with my father by phone about what happened. My father calls me and asks what happened when I give him my version of the story. 

Well, at that point my father tries to blame it on me but I really let him now I am not in for BS and that I had enough of they always wanting to win every argument. I let him know without a doubt that my mother went phsyco. 

He arrives home and we speak, where he realizes my mother is not willing to let go any chance of losing, even if she is wrong. My father still tries to mediate by trying to convince me that once again I shouldn't be fighting again. He tries to excuse my mother's attitude at first until he realizes she was really wrong. 

Now, back when my mother finished talking by the phone to the police she said that I would be out (the house), which I replied that if it was my house she couldn't do it. 

Back to us discussing what happened (mom, dad and I) she brang this back and said I threatened her on kicking her out the house, which I replied I never did and finally she admitted I never did. 

Well, I don't speak to her anymore. It has been 3 weeks approximately since that happened. We have always had an awful relation to where problems have just happened more frequently and way more ridiculous. 

My father tried to force me into making a decision by saying ""If you want us out just say it... and in the blink of an eye we are out."" 

It makes me kind of sad because I don't want to break my relationship with my father (my mother I couldn't give less of a shit). I really appreciate him and I am a bit off he is buying her shit.

Obviously there is more that I could say in detail about my relation with my mother, like she used to beat me when I was a child and was always very manipulative.

If you want me to be more specific you can ask. 

Given this, would you kick them if you were me?",01Sep2020,2

564,"TRIGGER WARNING

&amp;#x200B;

 I have put this in in another sub Reddit but i felt here would help to as i'm so confused

This is really hard for me to type as I've only realised in the past couple of weeks what my friend actually did to me and i'm pretty sure that it has affected my teenager years as well but I haven't realised it until now.

He would be emotionally manipulative towards me if i had other plans or wanted to see other friends when we were younger but he he doesn't do that anymore but does it others sometimes and it hurts me because i want the best for him

Okay some context first me and him were best friends and still are but i'm having my doubts about it now as I've realised that he hasn't been the best friend to me the more I've become a better person.

I'm 20 now and have been suffering with pure ocd so my life for the past couple of months have been very difficult but a memory popped into my head when i was 12 and he was 13 he would try to get me to masturbate with him and he would do it in front of me watching while watching porn and one time i felt so pressured by it and that he wouldn't be friends with me unless i did it with him so i did. Another time he did it in front of me but said he felt as if i wouldn't mind him doing it in front of me and it wasn't me he was thinking about it would be someone else. (I was a very anxious child and had not such a great childhood and had a hard time making friends so as you can see why i did it) I am still very good friends with him but I just can't face him at the moment I was his best friend how could he do that to me he did it several times and he didn't seem to think of it as wrong at all that long ago maybe it was just puberty but I think this has severally affected me being able to talk to women deep down as I know how humiliating it was for me i don't want to make anyone feel like that. He had a tough childhood as well i'm not trying to defend him or anything but if he could do that to his best friend easily i'm afraid he could have quite easily done it to someone else or worse maybe. In my teens and until now i thought it didn't affect me at all but I think deep down i'm starting to realise that this may have severally affected me in the long run and i'm so confused by this I cant even tell my parents because him and my family are really close and I feel like I could ruin his life and I don't want to do that to him because he still is a fairly decent guy. He never touched me inappropriately or anything like that or at least I think he didn't.

When I was 14-16 we had a group of friends at school and and i use to get bullied by them and sometimes he would join in and i felt really bad like no one liked me but i never talked about it until i talked to my counsellor about it (not the sexual stuff as i'm still to embarrassed to talk about it) and she helped me with a lot about it but the more I think about it the more i start to see that he really wasn't a good friend to me and was actually quite horrible sometimes but as I said he had a really bad childhood as well but I still think it was horrible what he did to me even with the hormones through puberty should he have known better.

He used to read me sexual stories in the car even though i said i didn't want to hear them when our parents weren't around. he would just be horrible to me if i didn't turn up on time and he would tell me about who he would fantasise about and what was i into this wasn't all the time just some of the time quite rare but still made me feel horrible at the time. This all occurred about aged 12-15 and he was about a year older than me.

I also found it really hard to concentrate in school and college and would hardly do the work which I know is a sign of trauma I also have a lot of the other signs as well but They're not severe or maybe i just repressed them.

I feel as if i'm over reacting to the stories but i felt i have to get this off my chest because i think it has affected me through these times maybe its more common than i think i never liked what he did but i'm not certain weather it actually had an impact on my life i'm just so confused and would love some advice to weather i'm over reacting or not because i'm not sure anymore with my ocd i cant think straight",01Sep2020,1
565,"In terms of life in general, your job or career, passion or hobbies, and etc. I’m a very small artist and would like to have my passion as a career but sadly this passion has been kinda on and off for me for the past few year. But I’ve started drawing and learning again back in July. In the past few years a lot has happened but to sum it up; my friends betrayed me, grandma got cancer and i stopped going to school back in 2017. In 2018, my grandma passed away and I transferred to a different school a year behind. Then in 2019 my gf cheated on me. Those were the bad things that have happened so far. I live with my grandpa and I’m scared of what might happen to him during this pandemic because he’s the one mostly going out. I can’t because I’m a minor and don’t know how to drive. All these fears and traumas have affected me a lot with how I interact with ppl irl. I don’t have any actual friends and the only person motivating to pursue my career as an artist is my gf and the ppl who’ve commissioned me. But idk sometimes I feel like I personally just want to motivate myself but I can’t. I feel bad for having other ppl deal with my lack of motivation, especially my gf. I just hope one day that the stuff that I’m putting out there won’t be forced anymore because i forced myself to post at least once per day because I can’t keep up with other growing artists with lots of support.

566,"Hey guys :) throwaway account for privacy reasons. This is gonna be long, so sorry in advance.

So ever since the pandemic, my university’s been pretty merciless with us to say the least. Unlike many other universities in the country, which have offered plenty of scholarships and discounts on tuition fees to aid struggling families, our university did not decrease their fees a single bit. They didn’t even cut medical, activity, or lab tech fees (we’re studying online). None of that. Many students were complaining about it for months; they sent emails, made petitions, etc. but the uni didn’t even budge. Needless to say, we all gave up after a while because it’s a private university and there’s not much else we can do about it.

A couple days ago we started our first day of classes. Many of us were shocked to hear that we were required to buy certain slightly expensive softwares for our courses to do our quizzes and assignments on, and that if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able to attend the course. Needless to say, a lot of us were outraged. Not only were they being unreasonable by not lowering their tuition fees, but on top of that they’re asking us to pay to sit our exams. This was ridiculous to us as it should’ve been covered by the already hefty tuition fees. When we talked to the professors about it, they seemed to agree with us but were incapable of doing anything since it was not their decision. I was upset about this but I still sucked it up because compared to the tuition fees it wasn’t much to pay, but regardless not our responsibility.

I suppose the last straw was when we were informed that almost all our courses were going to conduct their exams with no backtracking allowed. This infuriated us because the no-backtracking feature is a SUPER unrealistic reflection of how exams were to be held in a face-to-face setting and adds a lot of stress to many of us. I literally dropped from an A to a B+ in a course because of the no backtrack feature. We are all absolutely fine with using webcams and a special software designed to prevent cheating because we understand the uni’s concern with cheating. However this was just a low blow.

Needless to say, me and a couple of friends decided that enough was enough. I wrote a lengthy email discussing the mentioned points above and sent one email to the chancellor and provost, then sent the text to all the WhatsApp groups I had and told them to send it to our dean. So many people agreed with the email and supported me wholeheartedly. We even had a list of people who joined the protest and it exceeded over a 100 students in one day. I reached out to the student council rep and also told her about this and she promised me that she’s aware of the issues and will work on it.

Now I’m worried because I technically started this whole thing. My dad also fueled my worry by telling me that the way I worded some sentences was too harsh and that I shouldn’t have emailed it to the chancellor. He said that they can use my words against me and it made me really anxious.  My friends keep insisting that it’s fine and that it wasn’t harsh, but I don’t know how to feel. On the bright side though, all faculty members are having a meeting today, and my professors told us to use the free trial versions of the softwares in the meantime.

What do you guys think?",01Sep2020,2
567,"Over this summer I had a bumpy road, starting with frustration about how the school year was canceled. Then halfway through, I started realizing that I was gaining weight, like alot, and I had to do something about it. Part of the reason I was gaining so much is because I am depressed. I don't like to admit it and frankly I tear up when I say it but yes, I have the common cold of the mind. So, I needed to take action. 

I started a really good diet that had fantastic results and I was feeling happier and healthier. Then, school started. I was really excited for school thinking this won't be so bad. But I don't think it could really get much worse. We all have shields on our desks that are supposed to protect us and we are all spaced out in class. I figured that while we were in class, we could just take out masks off right? Wrong. And it gets worse. Was have to clean our classroom after each period. That's 7 times a day. 

I live in the state of Florida right now, so wearing a mask outside is pretty sucky. I had a mask on as I was going around campus (outdoor btw) and I'm sweating and it's all inside the mask. It already gets really moist inside the mask, but with the weather added, it's like being water boarded. I know it's probably not that bad but I was trying to take deep breaths and I was getting little to no air, I'm sure there is some sort of mask out there that works really well but I just want to switch to online. In the middle of a class I had a meltdown. I was sweating profusely, starting to breathe rapidly, and I got really hot and I just ran out the door. I just wanted to go home. 

I didn't have any friends in any classes this year and I'm just feeling really lonely too. In fact, I don't even have anyone to vent this to so I figured reddit would be best. I feel like everything is unraveling. I've never felt this bad before. At this point I have 2 options. Continue online if even possible... Or, just drop out. I know dropping out is a bad thing. But I just don't know what to do. I just wanna see my friends again. I just wanna be myself again. Sorry if this seemed really dramatic. Thank you for reading if you did. I hope you have a good day.",01Sep2020,1
568,"Quick edit: I am also a male. 

Some background which may be relevant:
My parents split up when I was around 8 or 9 (could be earlier I can't remember) and I was living with my mother until I was nearly 13. At that point I was doing poor in school, getting bullied and getting in serious trouble myself (got suspended 6 times in a single year in primary school) and was VERY obese (weighed over 80kg at the age of 12). I moved away from my mother and three younger siblings when I was 12, turning 13 and in with my dad. One of the best decisions I made. Better school grades, massive weight loss, better attitude, etc. 2 years ago, my dad and I moved away from the area where my mum and siblings were, to move closer to my dads side of the family (who talk to me far more often).

A lot of shit has happened in the last few years though on top of the good, and I think my mental health might be deteriorating as a result.

Shortly after moving in with my dad, my mum decided to marry some god damn degenerate junkie after a couple months of knowing him. While they were together, he would verbally abuse the shit out of me while I visited my mother and he would send my father and I threats. He even tried physically harming my younger siblings, along with the half siblings he had with my mother. Thankfully, he is long gone now, but it caused serious drama for a few years and a broken relationship with my mother which still hadn't fully mended to this day. 

Moving away from my friends and my mums side of the family on top of her and my siblings was hard at first, but became easier. Dad and I lived with his at the time girlfriend and her children for a while. However, she was slightly abusive towards us both at times, but my dad got it way worse than I did. So, they broke up at the start of the year and we moved. 

But before that was the Australian bushfire crisis. Panic everywhere, houses at risk. My dad and I had to help save a relatives property because the fire was right next to it. That mentally affected us for ages. No power, people fighting at shops, it almost seemed apocalyptic at times. 

I also worked at Mcdonalds at the time. I got paid fairly well due to the hours I worked, but I kept pushing myself to the point where I occasionally broke down into tears at work. I switched jobs after my dad and I moved away from his partner at the start of the year, but I am currently stressing because I get less shifts, less money, and I need to save for university because my dad won't be able to pay for me. 

Another thing I'm stressing about is the fact that I should almost have my provisional drivers licence, but only have a total of 5 hours of the 120 or so I need on my learners, and I've had it since November.  I cant drive often at all because my dad has little to no spare time to take me out because of work. We're currently living with my granddad though trying to find a house so I've been able to borrow his car occasionally to drive in. 

I also feel like I have issues trusting friends or feel like they hate me, or get tired of me. When I do something that may remotely annoy them, I feel guilty and fixate on it for days at a time. For example, I'm trying to organise a (small) birthday party with some friends (keeping within covid restrictions) and started making a music playlist today with them. However, I found out I might not be able to play music because my family might not want me to, so now I feel like I've wasted everyone's time creating a playlist because we might not be able to use it. 

This whole covid situation is driving myself and my entire family mad. My entire friend group have had gatherings and stuff over the past month or so and my dad hasn't let me go because, 'you might catch covid' even though I go to school everyday with the same people. It makes me upset because I feel like I'm being left out of stuff after school and I feel like I'm not getting to know my friends very well in their out of school life. 

I find myself at home staring at my computer screen with no idea what to do sometimes. Whether it be staring at homework or at my Steam library, I find myself bored sometimes. I recently took up sim-racing which is currently keeping my interested, but I can't use it later in the day because of the noise, so I get bored again. 

So I'm stressing out about school, friendships, past experiences, driving, work, and plenty of other things. I've been diagnosed with Anxiety in the past, but is there anything I can do to relax or ease the stress slightly? 

Also I know it's quite a long read so I apologise for that too.",01Sep2020,1

572,"I’ve been working as a graphic and web designer for over ten years. I really love design but I’m not sure I love it as much as I did when I was younger. For the last 3yrs I’ve also been suffering with health issues, chronic pain and fatigue due to various disorders. Is it wrong that I keep working but don’t really care about moving up in my career or really doing anything above and beyond? I used to be an extremely hard worker, motivated and a perfectionist. I had big dreams and wanted to manage a team or become an art director. Now, I’m only working part time due to my health and I just do as much as my mind and body can give. 

Sometimes I dream about never having to work because life feels so much more bearable without the stress of having to give and give to a company. In the past I would have defined my feelings as depression, but I’m convinced it’s just who I am now, I just don’t want to do it anymore. I feel like work has sucked the life out of me, probably from my own doing and now with my medical issues, it’s just a heavy burden. 

I know I packed in a lot in this post but any advice or wisdom is appreciated.",01Sep2020,1

575,"I've (M31) this friend (F28) whom I've known for a couple of years, but live quite far away from each other. It's not turning into a relationship given the distance, but I really, really care about her.

It all seemed to be going so great, both of us got along well and have tons in common, spoke a lot via texts and calls almost daily for months. She had some rough times earlier and I was always there for her. For a while, I thought she did care about me as well and many times, it really seemed like she did. I've had some rough times of my own as well, and that feeling lent me the strength to keep on going. I felt she was one of a few people who truly understood and believed in me, my dreams, my aspirations.

However, recently she told me her schedule had turned hectic and started responding less. She told me everything's fine between us, that it's just her hectic schedule. There were a few things that I texted her, which I had expected a response, but she didn't reply to them. For example, I've written to her that during some of my difficult times I wanted to hear from her. However, I get the feeling that now she doesn't want to speak with me anymore. What hurts most is probably the fact that she probably wouldn't show up at times when I truly need her.

I can't help but feel hurt. It now seems like I've been living in a lie, that the person whom I'd go the extra miles for, and whom I thought somewhat cared about me as well. It's such an unreal feeling, I'm still trying to process my emotions. It's such a horrible feeling that I wouldn't wish on anyone.",01Sep2020,1

583,"This is mainly about a job and me being a lazy twat lol.

So,

I'm 18 and I've had 4 jobs in total.
I've left each one at the most after 4 months.

I've had 2 cleaning jobs, 1 pharmacy assistant job and 1 dog grooming assistant job. 

My last job being the pharmacy assistant job, I quit at the start of lockdown so I've been out of work for almost 5 months now which I know is alot.
I'm happy I've had this time off because my mental health got so so low and gets so low when I work. Which is the reason I've quit every job I've had. 
I get very suicidal and slow down completely.

But because it's September my mum is pushing me to look for work again obviously but I just don't know what to do with myself. 
I only really want to work part time at the moment because I know that's all I can hack before becoming awful mentally again. 
So I'm thinking of looking for a part time cleaning job again as it seems the least stress. 
Obviously my mum has forced me every time to get full time and we don't get on so I don't explain why I've quit each one or why I want part time. 

So I've started looking on indeed for jobs again and I already feel so worn down and I start crying for no reason because I know how awful I feel working.
It's hard when you don't know what you wanna do career wise too like I have no clue and I know I'm only 18 but I'm really struggling to see a point of being alive because work is the only way you can survive and it's probably the worst thing about life ahahahahaha.

This baby was planned, and when we found out my SO and I we're over the moon, even though I'm still scared. 

Our obgyn is super positive and is convinced this baby is going to be ok.

There's no doubt in my mind that I would not do anything to harm this child. I'm following all the pregnancy rules and terminating the pregnancy is not ever on my mind. 

But part of me isn't sure if I want this, I don't know if I'd be sad if we go to the obgyn tomorrow and hear that there's no heartbeat.

I'm a student who doesn't live in the US. Trying to graduate, find a job, move out ASAP, go no contact.

I have a shitton of mental issues. But what this post is really about is how do I get through the day when I live with my own nightmare boss and bully? Every time he speaks to me he demeans and insults me in some way, and usually in the stupidest ways. But of course, even if his argument is illogical, you can't talk back to someone like that just to prove him wrong. Doesn't work like that.

I don't give a shit about what he thinks about me and I don't love him. I don't want his love or admiration. I want his silence and I never want him to acknowledge me. I'd rather be invisible to him than be under his overly critical gaze where he points out or makes up flaws about me just to put me down. So it's not that it's because my dad is the one bullying me that puts me down, it's because I have a bully I can't fight back against I can't escape.

590,"I can sum this up as ""her own lies catching up with her"" as from childhood she piled lies upon lies and now seems to be totally lost mentally in her own delusions; she had an affair, but lied to my siblings and I that our father was a beating, raping, rent boy hiring, abusive person (100% bullshit and thankfully we talk now), and lied that she had an affair. Made us lie to our father that our half-siblings were adopted out of shame, lied about receiving money from our father and spent it on herself saying we couldn't afford school clothes, and these lies got to their peak after she broke her second relationship that being with my 1st step-father.

She lied about having cancer, had another affair this time with my current step-father, lost a baby and to this day my siblings and I are silently convinced she did this intentionally, has tried to convince my little sister to commit suicide, started hitting my younger siblings, has taken my half-siblings out of school to be ""homed schooled"" (not educated whatsoever), become a hoarder, committed fraud by claiming to be a Doctor, told my father's new wife that he was all stated above (she did not believe her thankfully), and regularly sends her racist messages (as she is Pakistani), and as of late has been telling my brother that she will be dying soon yet again from made-up cancer. 

This all not forgetting that she is still sleeping with step-dad 1st whilst married to step-dad 2nd and on one occasion even beat her head against a fireplace until it bled in front of my little siblings because he was about to enter the house and discover her ex was there, all to then concoct a story to have him take her to the hospital to hide her shame. She has lied to him about having miscarriages (she had her womb removed so this is impossible), lied about having illnesses, lied that I as her ""dead to me"" son was abusive like my father \*totally\* was and THAT'S why I left. She has gotten into debt with loan sharks and dodgy websites and is using her current husbands money to bail herself out, and the house she keep decorating is so dirty according to my siblings that still live there that they have to wear shoes indoors or risk sticking to things - also there are rats, but she insists she cleans! Also refuses to hire help to clean up because she is racist and hates poor people despite being from poor background and totally isn't ashamed of how she allowed a friend of hers to sexually assault one of her children when they were our housekeeper, :)))))), she also lies about being raped like....a lot. HEr excuse for being a cunt is ""wELL I was RAPED aS A ChilD sO itS FinE!!!"" all the while when 3 of her own children have been raped she turns a blind eye and called them whores who asked for it, saying they are an embarrassment to her.

She lies about ""going to work"" and then doesn't come back for hours, or days, or weeks. She leaves my young siblings to be babysat by step-dad 1st, who was abusive and cruel, but hey he's convenient to have around just let him rob your things. :))). She has claimed to be in the army, a doctor, work on film sets, just tell her you are a teacher and she will tell you she is a better more rich teacher, tell her you own an island and she owns 3 totally cooler islands. She believes everything she says and as soon as someone points a hole in her logic she goes nuts and tells everyone they are an abusive, racist, evil, ect ect ect, you get the point.

591,"So, my \[30M\] father \[62M\] is a business owner, and he intends to pass the business onto me. He has enshrined \~\*retirement\*\~ into this magnificent all-healing moment. ""The good will come when I get to retirement. Only then can there be good"" is how he acts at times.  This directly impacts the transitioning of the business as he doesn't seem to have a plan, and I'm having to pry any sort of structured transition out of him.

Recently, he's fallen further into the rabbit hole of poor health. This includes night terrors that make him jump out of bed which has lead to broken toes and skit knees from falling/crawling down the hallway in a stupor/terror. He's overweight and for a while was 'keto' by way of eggs cheese and breakfast sausage. His anger problem is the real kicker. He's not hurting anyone's body, but he will kick and scream and slam on the desk if paper doesn't rip right or if someone doesn't answer the phone.

We cannot grow a business where individuals are permitted to scream and slam things. I'm \*never\* subjecting someone to that unacceptable behavior. So, we cannot grow as a business due to his anger.

There's other nitpicky stuff, but mainly, he has admitted that he has an 'aversion to doctors' even though he \*desperately\* needs one.

Can someone from his age range give me some council on what to do? There's no getting through to him. I've been putting my foot down so much I just look like I'm stomping. I desire better health for him, not only because I love my father, but because everything is connected. By achieving better health, we will reach higher heights in the business. By staying on this path, we are surrounded by poor habits, distractions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

E: Also want to add a caveat, that I'm not this perfect ""can-do-no-wrong"" being, nor am I trying to be. I seek to change and improve constantly. Hell, we don't have a choice. But, by comparison, it feels as though my father thinks he's on a magic carpet ride, and unbeknownst to him, it's just all of his family holding up the carpet. He'll ask if we like the view while paying no mind that we're beneath him 'picking up all the slack' at times.

&amp;#x200B;

EE: Also want to add that my dad is a \*horrible\* communicator. And I was raised by him. That said communication skills is one of those things I've been putting a lot of time into recently. He, on the other hand, can be quite cowardice. Half the reason he's so successful in business is cause if it comes down to calling and talking to a customer or giving whatever the customer needs to them for free, he'll opt to give them free shit so that he doesn't have to face any sort of confrontation. He's a good example of conflict aversion leading to the creation of conflict itself. ",01Sep2020,3
592,"Hey I am 18 years old and my girlfriend is 17 years old,  we’ve been dating since I was 16. We’ve known each other longer. I love her with everything in me. I don’t want to lose her. 
She lives literally 20 minutes away from me and I rarely get to see her. Her mom does not like me. When we first started dating her mom saw us hold hands and didn’t tell us. Since then her mom hasn’t liked me, because “I’m the girl who made her daughter gay” . That put a strain in our relationship. But I found ways to see her. I would go visit her on her breaks. Went to her schools formal without her mom knowing. Any way I could see her I tried. 
By now her mom thought we weren’t even friends because she wouldn’t even tell her we FaceTime. So to her I wasn’t in her life. One day I broke and told her that her mom at least needs to know we are “friends” . I was tired of being this secret , even as just a friend. A year later and things haven’t really changed. The thing that gets me is she asks to hang out with everyone else without getting nervous and puts them as a priority. Her mom knows we are friends now. But she still chooses to put off asking to hang out with me. It hurts me. I’ve tried to be patient. Now I am leaving for the military and have not seen her in four months. I told her that we need to see each other. She says she wants to and I believe she wants to. But she never does. Every time I bring up about hanging out she says I’m “pressuring” her which I barely ask any more. I don’t want to lose her but I need her present in my life. I’m not asking her to come out. I’m asking her to at least treat me like a friend to her mom. She hangs out with other people. Why am I different?

593,"I'll be heading off to university on the 19th and commencing classes on the 21st. 

Something I'm massively concerned about is a potential ADHD diagnosis, given that the disorder's hereditary and runs, as far as I'm concerned, on my dad's side — though my maternal aunt's exhibited symptoms of inattentiveness as well. 

I live in the UK. The NHS, whilst brilliant for treating physical ailments, lacks in its funding for resources for mental health. The waiting times are extensive; dependent on postcode lottery, with some areas having a horrific 4 year waiting list for ADHD evaluations. I tried to request one from my local IAPT but was denied on the premise that I exhibit no symptoms of psychosis, which, honestly, was a little weird. I was advised to go private but neither myself nor my family can afford that. 

I've emailed the university I'll be enrolling in, asking whether a diagnosis might be possible through them, but I'm honestly feeling disheartened, what with the statistics and stories I've heard. I haven't been in education for a year due to reasons related to my mental health, and I've struggled to hold down a job, quitting as soon as I detect the slightest bit of criticism as it feels *physically* painful. 

I really, really enjoy the thought of university. I'd like to increase my prospects. I'm looking at studying psychology, and so in the long run I'd really love to help people. But I'm terrified that this potential diagnosis might make it impossible — for me. A comorbidity of ADHD is dyscalculia, and quite a lot of psychology is statistics, and so honestly, I'm absolutely terrified.

So let me start off by going back to nursery, I remember my mother taking me to this child development centre, I believe my coordination was really bad back then (kinda still is bad) but yea i remember placing my foot in this foamy pad thingy, marking my foot, practicing walks, i remember reading reports of teachers saying i struggled with some stuff in PE class. Anyways long story short i was thinking along the lines of dyspraxia.

Fast forward to Primary School/Elementary school. think it was my last year and i got taken out of my class and had a 1to1 assessment for dyslexia, nothing came back no getting told i was dyslexic or not.

Fast forward to High school, to my last year 5th year into high school, I took around 5 exams for the 5 subjects, one of the subjects i believe it was design i got taken out of the exam hall where everyone was sitting waiting, got taken to a room and the lady was a support teacher for students with dyslexia who needed extra support ( iwas a bit emotional just because i believed at that time i got lied to all this time no one told me anything about it up until my last year. Anyways i remember her asking if i wanted yellow coloured paper i says no, I basically rejected all her help she offered, like her reading the questions or a scribe or whatever, i done it all myself and i still passed.

Fast forward to the last section college, where i didnt tick disability in my application, went into the first or second week the lecturer took me out of class and asked me either if i had something wrong with me, i think it was a learning disability he asked me i had, cant really remember, i think he asked it because i was struggling remembering questions etc, i says no i dont think so. he referred me to the learning disability team (im thinking hold on how can this guy refer me if i havent had any former diagnoses) Bla bla bla then the team got in contact and i explained all the stuff i says in this post, i think i may be dyslexic but i havent been tested.

Please do not say my best bet is to get diagnosed. i know that, but can someone try to explain to me what the fuck has happened. Why did i not get told by anyone, Were they trying to hide it. Can someone try explain why i didnt get any support?",01Sep2020,1

I try not to be humiliated by it, but when I go home and try to improve by thinking of comebacks, I just think of comebacks FOR them which are easy and make me just get depressed increasingly.

598,"Hello guys im starting off with a pretty serious topic. Warning this is a sensitive topic so dont read it if you are having doubts. I don't know where else to seek help and to be honest it would be nice just to let this problem be shared to people i do not know and might be a help. My english is pretty bad so keep that in mind, im so sorry in advance for it please understand. 

Well to start off my girlfriend is being blackmailed by her stepdad for s**. First thing that happened was her stepdad trying to touch my girlfriend private parts at first my girlfriend thought it was an accident so she didnt mind at first. Then it happened more frequently that she started to notice she was being harrased so she told her mother about it and her mother quickly took action. My girlfriend's mother told her to go hide herself in a room and lock the door. Moments later she can hear them both arguing and fighting. While they were arguing my girlfriend heard her stepdad saying that ""she liked it"" which was completely false because my girlfriend didnt like it one bit and she didnt even allow him to touch her once, her stepdad was just lying. Moments later the arguing stops and her mother forgives him because she loves him so much. My girlfriend's mother asked my girl if she would forgive him too, she had no choice but to forgive him too because she knows how much her mother loves him. 

Years passed by and the touching stopped. But it cameback later after some years. The touching continued and this time it was harder to deal with. My girlfriend's mother has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. She cannot be mad or angry anymore because theres a chance she could die from it. Theres also another problem my girlfriend's mother is suicidal, if stepdad leaves her we are afraid she might take her life. That aside the touching continued but of course my girlfriend kept removing the hand and avoiding him. But she doesnt know what to do anymore. The situation became worse, stepdad is purposely making my girl's mother angry to go into arguments with him. He knows that my girlfriend will beg him to stop fighting her mother because my girl loves her mother so much. He doesnt care if my girl's mother die because he doesnt love her anymore one bit. His using this leverage to get s** with my girlfriend. At the moment stepdad still havent got what he wants but i want to find a solution for this quickly because who knows what might happen.

Im so fucking angry me and my girlfriend cant do anything. We thinked and thinked a shit ton of solution. From telling her mother what happened but theres a high chance she will get so angry and die, from reporting what happened to the police my girl's mother would get sad or angry and probably kill her self or die from high blood because of knowing and happened and her love one is in jail. From my girlfriend abandoning the house and come to me but her stepdad will probably leave my girl's mother because he doesnt love her anymore (stepdad stays only because my girl and her mother begs him to stay) and if he leaves my girls mother would probably take her life. We thought of recording what he says or what his doing and black mail him too so he would stop and save the reletionship between him and my girls mother but his the kind of person whos not afraid of blackmails so it wont work. The only solution that would work for this situation is something that would not destroy my girls mother and stepdad reletionship and something that would make stepdad stop harrasing my girlfriend. Please i am desperate for solution.

602,"Okay so,  before  you jump to the conclusion  that I am just a petty asshole that can't stand her friends having other friends,  please  hear me out. 

First of all the friends I am talking about are 19yo (lets call her A) and 16yo (let's call him B),  we are/were part of a group of people that plays overwatch together.   And the toxic  friend is 21yo (she can stay toxic friend) and was/is part of the same group. 
Both other friends struggle with mental illnesses,  A with crippeling depression,  and the B with anxiety  disorder. In general both are very nice people and tend to only see the good in people or well take on the struggle of others and ignore  their own bc they want to help. 

Everyone in that group is either from Germany or Austria and we all meet online via overwatch (so the age of consent is 14 around here...  Belive me that is important!) 

The  A and I kinda started of as group mothers jokingly  adopting the younger members after we got to know their age so B and an other member of that group are our sons so to say. 

To start it off we all meet about three years back after we somehow got thrown into a competitive  match together and were amazed we all spoke German. Back then we exchanged  numbers (it is important to note that our youngest member (lrt him be C) back then lyed  abt his age and told us he was 14yo when infact  he was only 10yo)  and made a WhatsApp groupe together. It all seemed to go well even tho the toxic friend already  seemed a bit ehhh possessive  and a bit much sometimes,  allways using this group to vent out her petty frustrations abt realy stupid stuff (like that she wasn't  allowed to feed the horses next to her house heeps of bread)  and sometimes bragging abt her sexual  encounters it seemed okay for the most part. Back then she still was in a relationship with an other member if the group (a 19yo back then)  she constantly  bitched abt when he wasn't  there playing with us...  All fine so far. 

However when I started uni 2 years back I started noticing  that this toxic friend somehow slowly  took over the other's lifes and got  really  pissed when one wouldn't  give her attention. So around that time this person got really  angry at me fro not having  time for her,  additionally  we constantly  got into fights bc of her sexual talk around the kids (I told her she should shut it and she would accuse me of 'not letting her have fun') . Anyway I distanced  myself  from the group a)  bc I didn't  have the time anymore and b)  I wasn't  able to constantly deal with the toxic friend and her bs. But I keept contact with the others and three of us meet sometimes to go to conventions. 

After I wasn't  as aktive  anymore the toxic friend got broken up with and shit kinda hit the fan. She basically  used the other two (A and B) as emotional crutches,  constantly  relying on them beeing there for her  and threatening  them  with panic attacks and suicide  should they ever allure to not having time for her. (Those are things I only  got shown afterwards from C who at that time did the same thing as me and distanced himself  from the group bc of the toxic friend but still keept lurking). She also additional  dragged A, B and C into multiple  social constraints,  leading an Amino with A and making multiple Rps and fandomservers with all of them,  some even against their wills, she also constantly gifted the youngest members games and consoles (okay I gifted B my old pc too after I go a new one so there is that). A'S mental state around that time got worse and she had to go into stationary  therapy  for a year (she is still struggling). According to the chat logs I got shown by C the toxic friend didn't  care about A only so far as A would draw ship art for  the toxic friend and whenever A went to the toxic friend that always took A and B as emotional  crutch for help A got turned down OR worse gut further put down. For example A expressed the fear of not passing her graduation and Toxic friend only said to her ' if she would have those grades,  she would be ashamed of herself'. 

There must have been a ton more conversations like that BUT they were in the in-game voice  chat sooo I can't  know for certain if they are real or not.... 

Annnnyyywaayyy now comes the juicy  part. 
At the start of the year I was made aware of toxic friend showing hentai (including Pokonopicu or how it is spelled) to B and C via discord ,  while C asked multiple  time to stop the stream bc it made him uncomfortable  but toxic friend kept going and C didn't  want to leave to not seem squamish  to B (which  it later turned out was the only reason why B stayed too). A and I confronted her abt that and it resulted in a huge falout with me while toxic  friend went crying to A bc 'we gave her a panic attack'. A forgave her but also told her she isn't  allowed to do stuff like that anymore. 

Well surprise  surprise as it turned out toxic friend made with the help of the shared fandomserver an whole new server full of mostly  underaged people to share pornografic material and play sexualized drinking games. A still doesn't  know abt that and I only  got to know it bc B came to me asking for advice  abt getting together with an other member of that server his age... 
So B had a chrush on that one other slightly younger boy from the sex server and despite everyone telling him to keep it slow Toxic friend and B arranged a meet-up with that kid around a month  ago. So Toxic friend and B went to server Kid (who just turned 15!!!!). On the first night there toxic friend got drunk together with the kids (drinking age is 16 for wine and beer)  and confessed her love for the 15 yo kid that B had a chrush on... 
She knew B had a crush on that Kid and she is freaking old enough to know not to jump on a literal KID...  Well that disgusting  side A-side,  the rest of the trip she would make sure B got ignores  and left out of activities and at the end of it toxic friend took server kid back home with  her (the parents were/are apparently  okay with thay -.-) leaving B emotionally  chrush and hurt.
Ofc B got angry at Toxic friend and the group all together started ignoring toxic friend .
Soooo two weeks ago I went over to A for a visit (I am still with her and that's the only  reason I only  know abt that shit show)   and now I am wittnis  to great a manipulations getting directed at A and B. Both constantly  get pleading massages  that 'it just was a misstep and that love searches for mistirous  ways' while at the same time  anonymous  massages flood their inbox  how they can life with the knoelage  that others mistreated their friend. Yes toxic friend has the opinion that the other mistreated her for not supporting her disgusting behavior. 
It is also fact that A had asked for beeing left out abt the situation bc she litteraly  has nothing to do with it and can't  mentally  deal with it but toxic friend keeps dragging her into it and asking her to fix things between Toxic friend and B.  A has to fight constant nausia  at this point ( stress affects her that way)  but the massages keep comming...  Only yesterday at midnight she got an other annonymus  massage asking if she can live with others misstrwating their friends and only  minutes after A had a breakdown bc of that Toxic friend (despite an agreement to keep distance for a while)  swooped in to ask how she is doing,  only  to start talking about toxic friends problems with her mom... 

Well it's a real shit show over here and the story probably  got confusing  BUT I wanna know what I can do to help A and B out of that relationship bc despite what Toxic friend has done/is doing to them they consider forgiving her in hopes she will change.  I don't  want to go down to the level of Toxic friend and start gaslighting and manipulating  them bc in the end they have to find their own power to leave such a relationship behind. 
So what can I do to help without pressering  them?",01Sep2020,1

Have you got any advice how not to feel like that?
Caffeine is not an option, because it stimulates me for really short time, but afterwards I feel even more worn out. I've been treated for depression for three years, although I'm off the meds for around four months. Funny thing is I felt almost the same, while I was on pills(SNRI).
This year I graduated from high school, but to achieve so, I had to use amphetamine, so I could get anything done, otherwise I'd fall asleep during classes. At the moment I am completely clear(it's third month now), but I still feel like falling asleep.",01Sep2020,1
605,"Hey this is serious and I’m at a loss for what to do about my friend.

So I’m a 15 year old male looking for advice. This school year (starting January in Australia), I was put into a class with Sam (fake name). We don’t really connect all that well but he’s nice and he’s joined my friend group of about 5 people. They don’t really like him as much as I do but they accept him in the group. He comes from a rough family, and he’s only spoken to me about it. He often talks about his porn addiction and it clearly impacts him heavily. Sometimes in class he’ll draw or view Hentai, which has made everyone think he’s really weird which doesn’t help. He says he lives with his mother and siblings (all to different fathers) in a small house, and that his mom is a prostitute. He told me only 3 days ago that his mom is pregnant again from prostitution, which I find suspicious but i’ll get to that. 

In the past few months, he has been texting me very worrying things. He has asked me how to throw up because he “ate too much” and is “fat”, he asked me “should I die?” out of the blue, he regularly sends me hentai and claims that its for his friend or sister (wtf) and that it was an accident, he claims that his sister tries to have sex with him and has at one point, he texted me how to stop people from yelling at him, and he’s ALWAYS saying sorry for no reason (only in text). I know that’s a sign of trauma, but he only does it over text even after I tell him its ok. It’s gotten to the point where im convinced he’s faking trauma. Maybe im wrong about this, but I have strong inclinations that he is doing this for attention. Keep in mind, every time he does one of these things I tell him im here for him if he needs it and am willing to help, but he always says “sorry nvm” as if he’s too hurt to discuss it. I don’t particularly trust him much, especially after he stole my assessment earlier this year. I was doing a presentation and asked him to change the slides using a marked pair of palm cards i had spare. He did it, then took the cards home, copied my presentation changing a few words and passed it as his own. It was so obvious other students noticed half way through which is weird considering no one even listens to high school English presentations. He of course failed for plagiarism and still hasn’t admitted that he cheated off mine. He’s jokingly racist and homophobic and is obsessed with the military to a scary point.

Anyway, something has come up recently that worries me a lot. He texted me today if he “should talk to a therapist about the asthma incident”. I had no idea what he meant, then he said that the text was meant for his friend (again). So i got quite angry and told him accidents dont happen this often and ive never once received a text like that from anyone else but him and it is suspicious. He still said it was an accident but I let it slide. I also said that he can tell me about the incident and im willing to help if he takes it seriously but he didn’t. He texted me tonight if he can talk about it. I said yes. He says that he took too many asthma puffs a few weeks ago and was feeling shaky. He texted his friend what he should do, and they told him to ride a bike (wtf). So, he supposedly rode his bike down his hill at 2am, crashed it and got knocked out. He then said he woke up later to find 7 men sexually assaulting him for “an hour”. He then said “sorry nvm ignore that”. 

Now I took this very seriously. I openly told him that I don’t completely believe him but I will assume it is true, and that he shouldn’t shrug this off. He said that is was “irrelevant”, and I said that it is very important and I’m going to take it seriously. I asked him to tell me if he was lying or not before I went further, but to be honest because im willing to help. He said it was true. I asked him if he’s spoken to anyone else. He said his sister only, who told him to talk to the school councillor which I seconded, but he said his mom wont let him see a therapist. He says he didn’t see their faces, so i asked him where it was so we could see if there were any businesses nearby which could have security cameras. He showed me the supposed exact location, which is in a safe and reasonably wealthy neighbourhood. It is surrounded by houses and is opposite a gym and a cafe. I told him it was worth going to the police about, because there is a decent chance the businesses have cameras and he agreed. I pressed him on when he’ll do it, and we agreed some time after school this week, and that ill be checking in until he did it. I also told him to organise a meeting with the school councillor and school police officer and that I would make sure he did, which he said he’d do. He then said he had to go and left.

Now I really need some help here. Either way he has to see a councillor because if he’s lying, he needs help, and if he’s telling the truth, he needs it even more. I just find it hard to believe the story he told. None of it adds up, and he acts relatively normal at school. He’s just weird when he’s texting and I just don’t get it. How does he go riding a bike at 2am, crash it and get knocked unconscious, then get sexually assaulted in the middle of a suburban neighbourhood by 7 men for an hour? I have no idea if any of this is true but I just have a feeling it isn’t. If it isn’t, what should I do? Of course I’ll treat it as true until proven otherwise, but I need your opinion on this. This is serious, and I would appreciate if you took the time to respond.

TL;DR My sketchy friend says he was sexually assaulted by 7 men in the middle of the street after crashing his bike at 2am and I don’t really believe him.",01Sep2020,1
606,"why throwaway? because this is honestly really embarrassing.

so i’m going into freshman year of high school and i signed up for cross country (a fall sport). why? because my longtime running friend somehow convinced me it was a good idea.

we hyped each other up about for awhile, but then summer training came and i completely blew it off. even when i did practice, i hated it and it was so hard,

my endurance is awful, no matter how much water i drink i feel dehydration, i’m just struggling so much. i used to be so fit i don’t know what happened.

my first day of school is in just over a week, with that comes cross country. i can’t get my sh*t together in a week! my mom (a total gym rat) will be so disappointed if i quit. i don’t even know if i can quit, a few years back my mom’s friend’s kid tried to quit cross country in middle school but the coach wouldn’t let her.

i don’t want to disappoint my friends, mom and even my coach, but i just don’t think i can do this. especially considering my class schedule is completely full, no study halls. will i have any time to do homework, or even time to relax? 

i’m just so conflicted and stressed... help",01Sep2020,3
607,"As mentioned, my partner (28m) and I (29f) have very different political views - we live in the US. We have been together for several years now, but any discussion of the president, current election/candidates, recent protests, etc ... it’s like tossing kerosene onto a fire. I would say it has increasingly got worse in the last year or so.

I am hoping to NOT get into the nitty gritty of politics, but rather, a discussion on how we can grow and cope in this decisive climate. Currently, these arguments ends up extremely heated and negative - and we both are at fault. The conclusions are always the same though...

A.)  He thinks I’m overly stubborn, and blindly ignorant for the sake of siding with my party. He thinks my views are irrational and not based in fact.

B.) I think he is disrespectful and belittling of my opinions and views, and truthfully deep down, some of his views are upsetting to me.

Outside of politics, truthfully, we are really great. He is supportive of my professional career, caring, and makes me laugh. We tried setting a rule at one time stating that politics were off the table, but eventually we fell back into old habits. We both are passionate on these subjects, so it was unrealistic in retrospect to try to implement this. I can’t think of an instance where we fought and politics weren’t the cause. Keep in mind this doesn’t happen everyday - every few weeks roughly as things had escalated in the news - but when it does, it feels toxic.

Does anyone have any advice on de-escalation, and methods for maintaining a respectful discussion on these sorts of subjects?

609,"(Throwaway)  It's become clear to me that someone I would call a pretty good friend is a very active and vocal supporter of a political figure and movement that I **DO NOT SUPPORT**.

We have a lot in common and get along very well.   We volunteer at the same place, have lunch a couple of times a month, have similar backgrounds and interests and hobbies, our wives get along, etc.  It's casual and in more than a year, politics has never come up in our conversation.

The other day a TV was on in the room and some election-related stuff was on.  He very casually mentions that he attends (and sometimes leads/hosts) political events in support of a certain candidate, and he starts repeating this person's rhetoric and praising him and hoping he wins in November.  He tells me how firmly and passionately he believes in this candidate's policies and vision, using a lot of that racist dog-whistle language.

He tells me with some pride that he organizes small (neighborhood-level) marches and gatherings and dinners and distributes yard signs, etc.  That kind of stuff.  I couldn't believe my ears because the thought of this candidate succeeding turns my stomach.  Had I known my friend was so into this candidate and so actively working to help get him elected, I would never have even talked to him.

It wasn't a shock to realize which way he leans politically in general, that part doesn't bother me.  I respect others' opinions and their right to vote for the candidate who moves them the most.  But by the same token, I don't have to associate with people I believe harbor dangerous and divisive viewpoints.  And this guy doesn't just passively agree with these things, he actively works and spends his spare time helping this candidate.  It's a dealbreaker.

So we're not going to be friends anymore, but he doesn't know it yet.  I don't want to be rude and just tell him to F off, I don't like your politics.  But I'm not a jerk, he should probably get some kind of explanation.

I'm trying to come up with the right way to tell him that we're done, and the only reason is because his reverence for this political figure makes it impossible for us to be friends.",01Sep2020,2

611,"A woman \[W1\] finds a dog (Beagle/Chihuahua mix), with no collar out on the streets. The dog is severely underweight (under 10 lbs) and his claws were so long his toes were twisted when he stood up. It looked like he was lost for weeks. So, W1 takes the dog in and asks one of her neighbors who has 4 dogs, is a vet tech, and has a dog trainer living in the same duplex to house him until they can find the owner since woman 2 \[W2\] is equipped to take care of the dog.

The next day they take him into the vet, and there is no microchip, he’s 8-10 years old. Luckily, he also does not have fleas, heartworms, or parasites, but has some trachea damage. So, no collars for him. They begin the search for the owners, posting flyers, calling every vet office in the area, calling animal control in case the owners called there, called doggy daycares, posting to community sites, and also social media. I see the post on Social Media and W2 was asking if anyone would be willing to foster the puppy as he’s a tiny thing and the other 4 dogs are much bigger and she’s worried about him as he’s new to the household. I volunteer and say if no one picks him up by tomorrow after work, I’ll come by and pick him up.

The next day comes around and I am now the foster parent of this adorable B/C. I tell my partner and they buy a harness, wet food, dry food, bed stairs, dog bed, poop bags, etc. He’s rather deaf but happily trots about on walks. We can’t lift his head without him whining and he has difficulty with dry food. So we get a different harness to avoid any pressure near his neck, wet down the dry food, and mix it with wet food to make it easier for him to eat. We brush him down file his claws and quickly get him in a routine of going on walks every 2 hours, with very few indoor accidents.

After a week he starts having a more sensitive throat and a very drippy nose. I take him into the vet, they weigh him (over 13 lbs! Woot!), run all the tests again, no worms, no parasites, and no fleas. The vet says he is around 10 years old and has an upper respiratory infection. So, he was put on antibiotics and heart guard.

Yesterday, after 3 weeks of searching, we finally find the owners. They left their number on one of the community sites. W2 contacts the Original Owners \[OO\], and then sends me their contact info. I try calling, no answer. I try calling again, no answer. I tried to leave a message, voice mail is full. I send an SMS and wait. The whole day goes by. I send a much more direct message saying I have the dog, she replies that the dog is her daughter’s, I send photos to verify. She says yes. I’m starting to set up a way to meet her, but I’m now starting band practice and don’t want to continuously stop people to keep texting her, so I ask my partner to take over.

My partner gathers information from the vets, W1, W2, and calls the OO to verify the dog and let the OOs know his condition and care. We find out that the dog got out on the day before W1 found him. So, our assumption of weeks of starvation outside collide and red flags start. We tell the OO that he’s underweight and the say he’s always like that. We ask why they haven’t been feeding him more and they say that he just throws up the food. We have not had a single incident of him throwing up any food here. We ask for more info and they start to get very angry. They yell at my partner saying we’re trying to keep their “blind and deaf, 17-year-old dog from them”. He is definitely not blind, and both vets said he was around 10 yrs.

They hang up and a different woman, the OOs daughter, and she says the dog belongs to the OOs granddaughter. The dog was a gift to the granddaughter. My partner tries again to explain the situation and that the dog needs more food, softened, and his claws should be trimmed. (My partner used to work at a dog training and pet grooming place.) The new OO flips her lid and starts yelling and screaming at my partner. Saying things like “Who do you think you are, God?” followed by a string of profanity. My partner says that they are just concerned for the dog and want to make sure he is cared for and would happily give the dog back once they indicate they understand the care he needs. The new OO hangs up.

We have a conversation with me, my partner, W1, and W2. None of us want the dog to go back to the OOs. The dog was emaciated and uncared for. The owners don’t even know his real age or health conditions. What do we do now?",01Sep2020,1

614,"You just got a position as president of a brand new HOA. You have never been on a HOA before but you do your best. It’s you and a Vice President that’s it. VP asks to take over finance and Facebook. The developer in charge of you tells you to take over the power bill and start paying ASAP so you do. You are responsible for opening up a bank account. You do. Account is empty and gets to a point where there is no money and money needs to be deposited or you won’t be able to receive checks. VP has a meeting saying she is having surgery and won’t be able to meet over the phone or in person for 2 weeks. She leaves you dozens of homeowners dues checks and a bill. The next day she is in surgery and you open the bill. It’s due Monday and it’s Wednesday. So you thoroughly document the incoming HOA dues, deposit them and pay the bill after the checks clear all while sending everything to the VP to keep her updated, including the date of the power bill. Saturday you receive this email. You respond telling her sorry and you thought your actions were justified because things needed to get done and she was supposed to be out for 2 weeks. She condemns you for being fiscally irresponsible for not having a discussion with her and seeking her approval before taking action and  resigns. She knows too many people in the neighborhood to be trusted not to turn the community against you so you have to resign and she takes your position. How are you supposed to respond to the situation in the first place and to the email to keep her from quitting, was she justified to be that upset, and was the tone of her email warranted? Keep In mind she didn’t get to my email until Saturday and if I would have asked her permission first it would have been too late to deposit the checks and have them clear in time to pay the bill.    


I am just catching up on my emails after surgery. I am confused on why a deposit was made and a bill was paid without talking with me first. We had agreed that I would handle all of the financial transactions until a secretary and treasurer was appointed. I remember asking you to hold onto the checks on Wednesday when I picked up the mailbox key, I don’t remember us talking about you making a deposit and paying the Power bill. If you are planning on doing the financial part of the HOA then I don’t see a need for me to be a part if the board. Nothing should have been paid or deposited without us both discussing it. We should not have paid anything without establishing a budget first. When was the due date on the power bill? Like I have expressed before I feel like the power was transferred way too early and should have been done after the HOA was officially turned over in September  So at this point I guess the role assignments we came up with are not being followed so I need help understanding now what my role even is. I can consult without being on the board.",01Sep2020,1
615,"Hello everyone. I'd like to address a concern about my relationship. 

Lately me and my boyfriend who live together, ran into a lot of fights (especially these last 1, 2 months).. Because of the fact we are not from same country but both of us studying in mutual country.. As my graduation comes closer I start realising soon I'll have to face the fact where we must make important decision.. Whether to keep being together or not, more over the stress from working, dealing with thesis etc. I have pushed my boyfriend for telling me his opinion and giving some proposals however he usually agrees with anytjing I propose without thinking much as long as I am the one who should do all the work. He enjoys playing video games all day, something most of all our fights were about.

I came from work, where I found him very drunk with some buddies, barely being able to say words.. As you can predict I got mad why he didn't come to help me about the supermarket or answered me at least.. He got defensive and mad suggesting I am jealous and not letting him have fun..

He came back we had a fight, he was drunk therefore he was expressing his emotions more aggressively(hitting the wall and he went back to drinking with his buddies)..

Afterwards I went to call him so we talk and he decided to tell me he can't continue with me anymore and that it is over. He started crying, hitting the door etc.. Told me he has felt pressured from all the things that time suggests we must decide faster, he is not thinking about our mutual future as he used to, does not feel happy lately ETC everything leading towards inevitable break up

BUT

Next morning, as he didn't have where else to go we spent the night together sleeping after some episodes of leaving the place and going with friends separately .. He woke up and heard me making plans for going back to my home country..

He asked me if I m serious about leaving. He proposed it can be just a break and we might realise we can't live without each other etc etc

I told him I understand his decision and I won't stay in the way of his happiness even if that is without me, but that I won't lie that I have been hurt and I need time around family and friends to start feeling better . Since I opened the Convo again, I just asked him while he is sober if he can confirm me the things he said the night before before we rush and make a decision..

He said he regrets saying some things but he can't imagine me being OK being again with him after hearing all those things and he would feel really guilty

He asked how I would feel returning in relationship knowing he feels sorry and all those other things he said..(sounded like he wants to be back but doesn't know if I'll accept after hearing all those stuff) 

I told him the decision is ultimately his that I have been feeling happy and very motivating about other aspects of lif ein our relationship.. However if he feels unhappy I don't want it then.. Back and fourth we exhanced words and lastly he somehow agreed on giving our relationship a second chance altho mumbling that he believes it won't work.. I told him to calm down and we can try and decide after some time, that there is no pressure from my side

Afterwards he started acting extremely nice, cleaning, being too affectionate, kissing, hugging me, cancelling plans to stay with me etc.. Altho some things looked forced the first 1 2 days, now he looks like he is fine.. He is laughing and no awkward vibes as if nothing has happened..

I am wondering if all these things he does are out of guilt and sorry for me not being able to handle the break up (As he thought because I said I'll go back to my country)..

I am confused about opening back that conversation with him since things are going pretty well again.. Or maybe I'm just delusional?

Been away from my parents since then, my college life has been stressful, the pandemic struck and I've been alone ever since.

Since March, I've been having trouble sleeping at night even when I do sleep, I wake up extremely tired.
But for the past 2 months, I've been having constant panic attack and have difficulty breathing sometimes. At nights the episodes of overthinking lead to fits of rage where I throw things around the house and pull the bedsheets.

My parents have been trying to get me back (in another country) but due to the pandemic it's just not been working out. My mom and dad have been supportive but this doesn't really help at all cuz I'm totally alone.

I'm really worried that my mental health might be detoriating really quickly became I have never experienced this before. I feel that I need to see a psychiatrist but my parents don't really believe that is necessary.

Any word of advice might help.",01Sep2020,1
617,"We have a dog and he’s super aggressive, my boyfriend and I both have been bitten by him a number of occasions and even one of my boyfriend’s friends, he’s a Cane Corso so he isn’t a small dog. 

My boyfriend randomly brought home the dog when we first moved in together when the dog was just a puppy. I personally wasn’t ready for a dog because how busy I was with work and my hobby and never really even liked dogs. My boyfriend didn’t do much to care for the poor thing so I was mostly left to care for him which sucked because I never wanted the dog in the first place and didn’t even know how to care for one. 

The dog was pretty aggressive since he was a puppy and growled for no reason and have became super protective of me. When friend come over he will try to bite them and even one incident my boyfriend accidentally let him out and he went charging at my friend and tried to bite her and I had to jump in front of her to stop the dog from biting my friend which caused the dog to bite me which was one of the worst bites I got from the dog. 

I don’t have enough money to hire someone to train the dog and can’t take him out for walks because he pulls on the leash and knocks me down so the only way for him to go outside is for him to go in our fenced backyard which is scary for me because I’m scared he will find a way out and hurt someone. 

My boyfriend and I got into a huge argument and it upset the dog so he attacked my boyfriend and now my boyfriend wants to put the dog down, I personally don’t wanna do it because I feel like it’s our fault why he’s like this so I’m just asking for help and advice on how to approach this situation, how do you deal with an aggressive dog?",01Sep2020,1
618,"I'm angry today. Why did I get cancer when I was 29? Why me? 

I feel selfish. I'm better now, I've been in remission for 6 months, I shouldn't be angry, I should be grateful that I'm here.

My job is 250 miles away, I moved back in with my mum for treatment so that I wouldn't be living alone while I was sick. 
The plan was always to go back - my job and all of my good friends are there. Then just as I finished treatment, covid 19 arrived so I was not able to go back. I've been shielding since and working from home. 

Now I have a decision to make, do I stay here and find a new job, try to build a new social life, be near my family. Or do I go back to work and to my friends. Working from home isn't an option for much longer. 

Since the end of treatment my baby nephew has been born and my grandma has taken a bad turn with her health. I don't want to leave them. But I want my life to get back to normal and I want to be with my friends. I don't want to leave my mum, she is lonely, but I want to return to work. I don't want to let my colleagues and friends down, but I don't want to miss out on my family. I want my independence back, but I want to watch my nephew grow. I want to be near my family, but I don't want to feel responsible for their happiness as well as my own.

I can't distinguish what I truly want from what I feel others want from me. They tell me to do what is right for me, they just want me to be happy. My family speak supportive words, so does my boss. But I can't let go of the need to please others as well as myself. The two are so intertwined in my mind and my emotions. Every time I feel like I have made a decision I wake up the next day back at square one.

621,"So on Friday night I had a chat with a girl who I was dating for a few months. I’ve never had a serious relationship before and I thought it could have lead somewhere. One problem. She lived 2 hours away. We saw each other and had video calls over the last few months and everything was cool. But on Friday night, we had a discussion about where things would lead. She told me it would be better if we could be friends, obviously nobody likes getting put into the friend zone, especially with a girl who was into me at one point. So I defended myself and told her it will pass. It lead into quite a heated discussion about where we thought it could lead. She has been in a long distance relationship before, and then told me she couldn’t do it again, as it would be hard, since she really cared about me. So I had to accept that. On Saturday morning she told me that I made her feel quite uncomfortable about trying to change her mind about things and she didn’t want to upset me any more than she had. So she blocked me from everything.  

This made me really upset, I also have problems going on with my university life. I’m struggling to pay my tuition fees and I struggled with a module last year. I made a really bad decision to drink iron supplements medicine and take 6 weeks supply of anxiety relief herbal remedies within 24 hours. It had no effect on me. The girl later unblocked me and told me the reasons why she did it. But I haven’t heard from her since. I just left it as it was. The only thing I’m mad about now, is taking the pills. 

I have suffered with mental health in the past. But I never tried to kill myself before. Luckily I told my
Parents and they helped me, As did friends. Today I woke up with great motivation and positivity and I have no idea why. I feel like I can take on anything. Usually depressive episodes last up to 2 weeks, however this morning I have an urge to conquer everything. Is this normal? I have had many depression episodes but this tome I feel moderately different. Deep down I know I’m a good looking and nice guy who deserves the world when it comes to women.

623,"So when my crush liked me at the time he asked his parents if he could date me. And now that he doesn’t even like me one bit at all anymore which explains why he just is so rude to me. I asked him if he even WANTER to date me at all. And he said no not really. And I’m confused to why he even asked him parents then. He made them think he liked this girl when he didn’t even like her at all. And I asked him if he EVER wanted to date me? He said he didn’t do all the flirting and cute things just so he could date me. So the reason would be he did it for fun. Played with my feelings. Yet he says he didn’t play with them. He did. 

BUT the confusing part is that when he wanted to date me and we were about to date he backed out saying no cuz what will people think of us cuz of our race. I’m black/Puerto Rican and hes Mexican. Idk if that means he doesn’t like the idea of interracial dating or what. But that made me feel some way different about him after that. He did make a wierd joke about me being black tho. That set me on the edge. 
And there were rumors that he and my sister had been walking to class but he got mad cuz he thought it was me spreading them. He got so frustrated and weirded out. I asked why is he so afraid ans he said cuz he doesn’t want people to get the wrong idea...he’s so insecure about what people think of him.

625,"First of all I have severe clinical depression. I was in another city Warsaw which is 2 h 45 min from home. I was too depressed and overwhelmed to go home and kept extending my hotel stay, during which I only got out of bed to go to the bathroom instead of seeing Warsaw. This morning I got the courage to take a taxi home.

After we had been driving four hours (I noticed we weren’t going the direct way to my home but I figured he knew what he was doing), he informed me we were on the wrong path and we were two hours away from home. I am staying at a hotel tonight because I do get motion sickness.

But now I feel like I’m breaking down. There is now no guarantee I’ll ever get home given taxi drivers do not have to take you to your destination.

I have no friends, family, or acquaintances who could help me.

I feel resigned to the fact I’ll never get home but I also feel that I’d be more comfortable at home.

Please help. What can I do to ensure I’ll get home? One idea I had was switching taxis every thirty minutes so that if one driver goes wrong, I’ll only be 30 min off course.

(I wouldn't care so much if it was a one night stand but she had deep incredible intimacy for so long living with this other man, and it sickens me) I want to marry this girl but I keep thinking of her living with this dude for many years and like being all over him and it makes me so angry and sick I hate it and then I want to like to numb myself from this tormenting emotional pain with said substance to feel better and pacify and soothe me and distract me.

I HATE IT SO MUCH. I keep thinking of her and him going out to dinner, her blowing him on the way home from dinner, them watching netflix and cuddling together, her hand on his dick, him moaning. I fucking hate it because ALL OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED.

It's sickening. It makes me so angry, this horrible feeling in my stomach - because I deeply care. I love her so much. I am literally choosing her over 3.65 billion women on earth to marry so I am super sensitive to her past, I keep myself clean. I just hate it.

What do I do? It isn't insecurity, I am very confident, hell, I'm over confident. I am VERY confident truly, it just sickens me to imagine them like doing the above, which TRULY happened. Like despite me being the best ever and so good and awesome, I still feel like sick over it. 

I hate it. I get so sick and angry. The feelings are horrible. It breaks my heart.

I just think it's so disgusting to picture the love of my life all over this other dudes dick and having all this deep intimacy with him. For so many deep years. They LIVED together. I fucking hate it.

The fact that I love her so deeply, is why it hurts SO INTENSELY. It breaks my heart. I just don't know what to do about this f\^&amp;king pain anymore.

634,"TLDR - My threesome is being dissolved by a member going rogue ???

&amp;#x200B;

My friend group consists of 3 persons- Eve, myself, and Sam. We go to the same school, though Sam is a grade level above Eve and I. Sam has always been a little more reserved and private than Eve and I, but the three of us still shared a very strong bond, and we went everywhere as a trio. We were open and honest with our feelings and talked a lot about the future or distant plans together. 

Towards the end of the school year, Sam started distancing herself from us. We knew that Sam was already an introvert and needed her space, so we tried to take it in stride, although it did hurt. (This was an assumption on our end- she was never the type of person to vocalize her vulnerabilities.) She started doing things out of routine, aka leaving school without saying anything, ignoring us in the halls, having lunch without us, ignoring texts. When we would gently try to bring this up to her, she would act surprised that it was important to us, and try and brush it off, or act like it didn't matter. This was harsh, and hurtful, but Eve and I hoped for the best, and that she was just going through something she needed space with. Eventually, she wrote us a letter, finally being vulnerable and telling us personal details (she was distressed, as a graduating senior, and didn't want to be around us, because we would notice and ask her about it). Eve and I agreed to let her take her time until she was ready, and gave her space.

Then Covid-19 hit, and it was like something changed. Whenever we would try and make plans together, she would insist that she couldn't; her family was high-risk and she wanted to play it safe. And then, on social media, she would be seen at the beach with other seniors, going to prom, graduation, and even parties. Eve and I were devastated. What happened? Why didn't she like us anymore? We love her, we want to be included in the celebration of her moving on from high school, we want to be in her life- but it felt like she never intended to give us the chance. 

What does this mean? We are worried for her and want the three of us to be together again- is she sending signals that I don't understand? 

I really appreciate any responses. She will be leaving for college soon and I don't want our friendship, which I regarded as extremely special, to end on such a confusing and unclear note.",01Sep2020,1
635,"Its been a year since I moved out and thats really made me reflect the last year, and how life used to be. I try to assure myself that things will change for the good, and that things will get easier, but the future seems really uneasy. late 2018 to mid 2019 was probably the most relaxed/happy time of my life, but things took for a turn late 2019 to mid 2020 was arguably one of the most sad/hardest times of my life. I recently started rethinking stuff and I would say that I am doing a little better, but I really dont want life to go south for me again. I feel a bit confused.

I had so many problems back then. Will they come back? If so what will I do? Suffer for longer?

I wasn't a good friend. I was completely distracted by my own problems to realize what was wrong.  I am slowly distancing from those who were my friends back then. Its starting to feel a bit lonely. When school starts (which is soon) how will I be able to show people who I really am? Should I apologize?

Then comes the exams. The main reason I am here is for my education. Even when I study I feel as if I am not going to do well. I started from the bottom. I am trying to rise up. I used to have tons of mental breakdowns trying to study by myself during quarantine.

In fact while writing this I feel foolish. I am not the only one to be struggling with these issues.

It makes me sad knowing that such a great and relaxed life was a year before. I really wish i could go back, but things have changed there. I used to feel like i did not belong here but now its as if I dont belong anywhere right now. I am really confused, and I miss home.

It’s not like I’m over thinking a choice like what to eat for breakfast or if I said the right thing in a conversation it’s just non stop thinking. Even if I listen to music, play an instrument or reading out loud I’m just thinking about random stuff and it irritates me so much.

640,"So, this happened 3 weeks ago and for background, I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for going on 6 years. I didnt have much of a family growing up so having his family ""welcome me in"" was a breath of fresh air, despite the fact that they are pretty toxic themselves. 

I got along with his sister (36F) nearly instantly. It took me a bit more to develop and healthy relationship with his brother (30M) because he is extremely self destructive and makes really poor choices. 

I helped out both his brother and sister whenever they asked. Whether it be helping his sister clean her house, watch her daughter or dog sit. I helped out his brother constantly by being a listening ear, always having his back, loaning him money, buying him food and giving him a roof over his head when he was down and out. This wasnt an all the time thing so it wasnt that big of a deal but it's just the point that I was there whenever they needed. 

Now, my boyfriend and I were struggling mentally due to quarantine and ultimately decided a short break would be best so that we could both sort of our shit out and think things over. He ended up at his brothers place during this time. While he was there (for a week) he became extremely distant and avoidant. He wouldnt talk to me about it because he wanted to mual things over alone before deciding what to do and talking to me wasnt helping. After a lot of convincing, he finally came home to talk to me with the intention of going back to his brothers place afterwards. He was very distant still after arriving and I couldn't place it. He stayed the night and finally opened up to me the next day. His exact words were ""I dont know why I ever allow my brother and sister to convince me that you and I shouldnt work things out. You and I make a great team and we never give up on eachother and that is extremely important."" 

Come to find out his sister (who had been calling me every day that he was gone to check in on me and told me things like ""Just give it time and stay true to him. Itll all work out."") had been running her mouth about me the entire time. Saying that I was way too over opinionated, didnt have my shit together and apparently pawned my negativity off on my boyfriend. She even went to the extreme of inviting over her very good looking, newly divorced best friend with the hopes that my boyfriend would see an attractive single woman and decide to play the field instead of returning home. Apparently she didnt come out and say this, but her comments made her intentions evident. 

Now, as for his brother, he had apparently been running his mouth as well because he wanted my BF to drop me and move in with him because he is going through some shit of his own and wanted his company. I guess he told my BF that working things out with me would be a mistake because he is still young and shouldnt settle. His brother is also a woman hater. So despite the fact that I have personally helped him out numerous times, he still doesnt like me; though neither him or his sister has EVER said anything to me directly that would even suggest their distaste. 

I have not come out and told my boyfriend that this bothers me because his brother and sister are his main support system and I dont want to put a word in his ear that would jeopardize that. He saw that I was upset about it but him venting to me about it was his time to shine, not mine. He needed me to listen, so I did. And where he is going through some things mentally right now revolving around their behavior, I didnt want to make it worse. He has not spoke to them since he returned but they have been blowing up both his and my phones. I have not spoke to them either. 

I'm curious what you guys think I should do here. Should I simply continue to do what I am doing currently because it's important that my negativity on it doesnt consume my boyfriend who is already going through stuff of his own. OR should I speak to him about it anyways? I would like to say something to both his brother and sister but I also dont want to overstep and make it worse.

He is obviously from a different time (being in his 80’s), has never abused his wife or children, I know that for a fact. My father for the time I knew him was verbally abusive. Okay, so today I was on the phone to him and we were talking about an argument i have been having with a friend, and he said “oh well women are known to go off uncontrollably, I can see why men would discipline them”.. and it left me kind of speechless.

What I’m struggling with is this is a person who 99% of the time his advice guides my life, but when he says something like this, it gets into my core and hurts my confidence, what if I get into a relationship in the future and I think in the back of my head “remember what grandad said you deserve to be disciplined”.

My partner wants to stop drinking. She doesn't drink heavily, binge out frequently, or do anything that would lead me to concern - but she's just kind of over it. She feels that alcohol doesn't really add anything positive to her life anymore, and I think that's just fine. 

I was curious if anyone has helped a partner be accountable for quitting drinking and if you had any tips for support. I did some research but most resources were centered on alcoholism which I don't believe is an issue here.

My bf and I have been together for a while now and I could have sworn that he was the sweetest and most genuine person out there. We sleep at each other’s places pretty much every night so there was really nothing out of the ordinary going on until this morning. I’m a light sleeper, I could wake up to almost anything and I woke up to him taking pictures of my ass while I was asleep... I was in a thong. I could tell because I woke up to him cuddling me and he stopped for a second but then he lifted up the blanket. At first I didn’t know what he was doing but when he pulled his phone out from under the blanket it rubbed against my thigh AND I heard his phone click, making sure that his sound was off so I didn’t hear the camera sound. I didn’t say anything or move because I was in shock and freaking out. After he set his phone down I kinda moved around and after about 5 minutes he did it again but from a different angle. At that point I turned around and he hid is phone so fast and I pretended to fall asleep as if I was just shifting in my sleep. He knows I have a very big history with stuff like this and it really triggered my past. I mean, I go to therapy because of everything that happened to me in my past relationships and I finally found someone (him) that I felt genuinely safe with until now. I haven’t said anything to him because I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is the first time this has happened or if he’s done this many times before but I just feel like he took advantage of me and honestly it is really disgusting!!

645,"I'm 19, 5' 11, and weigh 120 lbs. I've always been underweight. The most I've ever been was 135, but that took months and fell off as soon as i didn't stopped drinking protein shakes and eating half a dozen eggs every morning. Should i just jump back onto that routine? Or how do i do this?",01Sep2020,1
646,"So a few weeks ago I asked my best friend (let's call him 'Abe') if he wanted to come hang out with me and another mutual friend. He said that he doesn't feel like he really know me anymore and I was like: ""Excuse me? What?"". Abe said that another mutual friend of ours (Call him 'Charles') told him that I have been treating him like shit constantly throughout the 3 years we've all known each other.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I didn't think much of it, and told Abe that if Charles has something to say then he can speak for himself and do it in a private conversation with me. Then, a few days later, Abe texted me again saying that I treated Charles like shit and that he doesn't think he can forgive me for what I've done.

I was annoyed by that and went straight to Charles to ask what's happening. Charles told me everything: Over the 3 years we've known each other apparently I made him feel like he doesn't matter to me and that I don't care about anything he says. After hearing that, I immediately apologized to him and told him I was so so sorry. He then told me that everything is ok now, and that we're both good.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason my stupid ass wrote a long ass message to Abe that said how I was hurt by him telling me that he doesn't really know me like he thinks he did and that he can't forgive me. My stupid ass tried to make myself the victim here. And I regret that.

Abe then replied with another long ass message about how he hates that I always lie to people and make it seem like nothing is wrong and everything's okay. How he hates that I think that someone can apologize for something so terrible they have done, and then expect to just move on from that. He told me that he can't trust me anymore and that I was never his friend to begin with.

After that he blocked me like a fucking child. (Keep in mind that this all happened while we were all in Summer Break and in Quarantine).

&amp;#x200B;

After a few weeks of trying to get in touch with him, he finally out of blue unblocked me. He would post stuff on his Instagram stories and I would reply just to be nice to him. In all his messages and replies to what I wrote to him, he was very rude and cold hearted. I asked him to respect me just like I do him and that after all, I did NOT do ANYTHING to him.

&amp;#x200B;

We then got into another big argument where he told me that he never cared about our friendship and that if I did really care, then he's sorry because he ""didn't notice"". He also said that Charles is like a brother to him and that he feels obligated to protect him.

&amp;#x200B;

We just ended that argument on a good note, and I told him that I was glad that we're not friends anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, it's the first day of school, and our classes are divided into small groups that come at a certain time to school in order to minimize the interaction between larger amounts of students in a room. Abe is in my group along with 2 other mutual friends. Charles is NOT in my group.

When I came to school today I did say ""hello"" and ""good morning"" to Abe, but it wasn't more than that. On the period breaks and lunch breaks Abe was always with the other 2 friends, and none of them talked to me or even said ""hi"" or ""good morning"". I was afraid to go up to them and talk with them because I know they always hang out with Abe after school and I have no idea what he told them about me so yeah they might hate me too.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Had an argument with my best friend. He doesn't forgive me. He hangs out with my other friends so I can't really hang out with them either without making it super fucking awkward for us.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I need advice on where to go from here. thx.",01Sep2020,1

Same thing happened when I joined an online movie review club. We'd video chat every week and discuss movies, it was really fun and I liked the people. However, within 1-2 months, my interest started to go away and it felt exhausting to join them. I started to just do my own thing on Sundays again, instead of joining them.

652,"Hey! This is kinda random, but my family is supposedly white, and that's all any of us know about our history, but myself and other relatives get asked by friends and strangers ALL THE TIME about our race. I don't really care, but the more people ask, the more I start to wonder too. It's definitely not a secret affair/adoption scenario because it's not just me in my family--it's a common experience. People tend to think I'm part East-Asian, my mother also gets part East-Asian and Indian a lot, my uncle and grandpa get mistaken for being Middle Eastern, and (I know this is technically white, but definitely different from supposed Northern European ancestry) I get Italian and my brother gets Greek. Me and my brother have more of my dad's pale skin so look a bit less ambiguous, but my mom and uncle and grandpa all are deep olive. Also, not only that, but the people who most commonly mistake/question us are people of the race that they think we are--like a Middle Eastern person asking my uncle where in the Middle East he's from. Recently, I've started noticing too that I never see any white people who look like my mom or uncle or grandpa. It's only clearly Middle Eastern or Indian people who I do double takes with bc they look like one of them. I have white friends, but most of my friends now are East Asian, Middle Eastern, or South Asian. This isn't something I've done intentionally but just how it's happened; I've also noticed I tend to be attracted romantically to non-white people but that who have traits similar to some of my family members--similar skin tone range, eye color, hair color, etc--like the two most recent guys I was with, both were biracial, one part TUrkish, the other part Indian. Again, none of this is intentional, but noticing a pattern. I kinda assumed that it was because my mother grew up in a place (not where we are originally from) where white people are a minority and that's majority Asian, and, that bc I spent a lot of time there, I'm used to that and so I naturally find that in my life now in a white-majority area. But I really don't know! I had a (very white) boyfriend who actually told me one time he liked my looks and black hair bc he found it, and I quote, ""exotic"". Yuck. He was not a good guy in general btw. Obviously this is a big issue that WOC have experienced for a long time (being racially fetishized in yucky ways  by white dudes), but I hadn't expected to be seen that way, again, because I think of myself as white and I assume others see me that way. I am constantly surprised going through my life how many people are seeing me and making assumptions about me that I'm not expecting. 

So--anyone else have experience with this? Does this sound like a need for DNA test, or is it totally normal for some white people to look very ambiguous? Thoughts?",01Sep2020,1

Im quitting my job today. I have enough in savings to get me through for a long time.

654,"As the title says, I want to start my life over. To begin I had a really rough childhood and didn’t learn the most basic things (like how to get your license, how to get a job, that college isn’t just for rich people) in life until my early 20s. I don’t have parents, I do have 2 older sisters but they married young and are stay at home moms. And so basically due to depression, anxiety, abandonment issues, etc, I really only focused on trying to find someone to love me. 

I have been in 2 long term relationships in the past 10 years and both followed the same path... me relying on them solely for my stability and happiness, eventually overwhelming them with my controlling and negativity.  Never focusing on bettering myself only about keeping them so I’m not alone. And then it ends. My most recent 4yr relationship ended 3 weeks ago, it started with me moving out to give him space but 2 days after I moved out he informed me he was much happier single and had no intention of trying to fix things with me. I know where he’s coming from, I don’t blame him at all. 

I do have a stable, ok paying job in Human Resources. Going on 7 years. But it’s a very toxic environment. Small business, owners are greedy and manipulative and their over all business practices is to use, abuse and take advantage of their employees. My job as Human Resources is really just paper pushing. I do things how they tell me, not the ethical or even sometimes legal way. 

So here I am now, almost 30. And want to start over. I have always wanted to become a Nurse but spent my life focused on all the wrong things. So I want to quit my job, probably get a part-time job in town somewhere, but this wouldn’t cover my living expenses so I’d be relying on loans in part to live.

661,"For context, I'm generally a relatively normal guy, I have a fair few friends and people seem to like me once they get to know me, although I am more on the introverted side. I think I'm fairly average looking. However, I've pretty much always been single - I've only had a SO for a couple of months a few years back. She's the only person I've kissed etc. and I haven't had sex before. This isn't something I'm necessarily pleased about but I usually don't let it get me down.

During the pandemic I've decided to try online dating again a bit. I was talking to a girl for a couple of weeks recently and liked her. However she eventually got frustrated that I only seemed to want to chat platonically rather than commit to start dating, and said we should stop talking.

I felt kinda bad and it got me thinking, I liked her company in the way you would a friend, but I didn't really have any 'feelings' for her? I mean in the way you get crushes on people, and think about them when you're not talking to them, feel extra happy when you do get to talk to them and stuff, not as in completely falling in love. It then occurred to me that of the 5 other girls I can think of who I've met through dating apps and gone on dates with, we mostly stopped talking due to either me realising I only saw them as a friend, or them getting frustrated that I wasn't making any moves as I didn't feel the urge to. 

This then made me realise that since secondary school (ages 11 - 16 for non Brits!) where crushes were common, I can only really think of 3 - 4 girls I've actually developed any feelings for, and that's over a 10 year time period, and includes a couple I only knew for a number of weeks. During that time I've hung out with quite a few of great girls, including some I've found really attractive and got along with really well, but have never made any efforts to go any further with them as I've not developed any feelings for them for reasons I don't understand. Also, it's worth noting I don't think I'm comfortable with hooking up with people I don't know well.

So this leaves me in a situation where I'm not comfortable with one night stands and such, but also almost never actually feel attracted (both physically and by personality) enough to someone to want to date them and be in a loving relationship with them. It feels like my brain is working against me as I'd love to experience either of these things! (Although mainly a relationship)

I always wanted to be a skinny girl but I'm very into fitness and my body type is a healthy fit girl (I look like an athlete, broad shoulders and thighs but she looks like a model, skinnier taller etc')  
Her nose is smaller, her eyes bigger. Her hair is naturally perfect and straight and shiny and mine is really damaged and dry and curly. I am darker skin tone then her and I'm living in a very racist country in the middle east that has very strict european beauty standards.Every guy I meet, ends up wanting her. My ex told me that the first time he was us he didn't even notice me because I was beside her and she's very pretty.   
But someone, he are similar . I just look like her older sister and a lot of people tell me that when they meet us. Friends used to laugh at me for being ""the ugly twin"" and for looking weird next to her. 

Girls compare themselves to other girls all the time, but image living with a ""better looking you"".

I have a good looking face, a nice 3days beard and a mid parted dicaprio hairstyle;). I study clinical psychology and overall my life and lifestyle is very attractive to most women.

a guy that i hookup with occasionally, came out to me a while ago, and i told my boyfriend that i wanted to peg him, my boyfriend also knows that i like gay porn and the idea of bisexual threesome.


recently when i was giving him a blowjob he told me it was okay if i put a finger in. i was surprised, but down, and i did it. it was hot, he said it felt good, and that was it. 

but last night when i got home from work he kept saying things like “i’m feeling veeeeeeerrrryyy open tonight” or “you can do whaaaateeeeever you want to me” and i was like oh shit he totally wants me to put my dildo in his ass. i started freaking out in my head and i feel so guilty. 

so i pegged him and he was extremely into it. like really into. took the whole 7 inches and was throwing his ass back and moaning louder than i’ve ever heard. i’ve never seen his body move that way and i couldn’t help but notice that i’ve never made him moan like that before. three years we’ve been together. i’ve pegged someone before and loved it. it would’ve been hot if i wasn’t thinking and observing so hard the entire time. i felt gross afterwards and i didn’t want to talk to him about it because i know he doesn’t want me to look at him differently. and i told him that i don’t but why is it that i kind of do? i just have so many questions and thoughts and i can’t help but wonder if he’s gonna come out one day, or if he’ll be able to enjoy normal sex without feeling like something’s missing, or if he’s used my dildo before, or watched gay porn, or if he’s wanted this for a long time

So 2 years ago on the exact same day my long term boyfriend and I broke up I met this amazing guy through mutual friends. I was feeling really shit that day so I was a flirty with him. 

We went on a date after but I realised that he’s too sweet, not something I’d want to be short term so I said I only want to be friends. We were best friends for about a year, but he asked me out four times. Each time I said no, I was too emotionally unavailable because of my break up. I really wanted to have feelings for him but I didn’t. I was kicking myself that I didn’t meet him before I dated my ex.

I ended up ending the friendship after he insisted I stay at his because was I was drunk after the party we were at. When we were at his I was feeling really shit and depressed and I wanted a hug, but he took that as me wanting to “get funky” if ya know what I mean. He mentioned it in the morning after and I felt sick to the stomach that he thought of me that way. Especially since I turned him down four times and said I only want to be mates. 

Well since then we’ve met up about 3-4 times about  couple of months apart. 

Recently he messaged me again asking to hang out. When we met up I honestly had my socks blown off. He’s so incredibly handsome and soft and so so kind. I felt so comfortable around him even though I was anxious. 

I feel complete and utterly healed from my last relationship now but I’m scared he won’t want me. He seemed a little bit not there when we met up and hasn’t messaged me unprompted since but I can’t tell whether that’s because I’ve not put in much effort to keep in touch other times we’ve met up.

Mentally, I'm not abandoning the projects, I'm just putting them on hold. After a recent conversation with my dad I learned he and my grandpa are the same way, but the number of projects continues to grow, to the point none ever get finished.

I'm looking for advice on strategies for sticking with a project for longer, ideally until it is finished.

675,"We currently live apart right now. My fiancèe had graduated from university a few months ago and just landed a new full-time job she wanted as a senior nursery practitioner. Whilst she was at Uni she had a Saturday job only working 6 hours a week, but her new job requires her to work Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm, so a huge 50 hour work week. She starts next Monday.

While I am over the moon at her achievement and she knows so, I have become concerned about the huge bump in hours she'll be doing and the impact it will have on her life and mine. I'm worried it'll be too much for her and she won't be able to cope, or that our relationship will suffer because she won't have enough time to do much. I have mentioned my concerns to her and the outcome of that was to just see what happens and see how she handles it. My work week is only 37.5, adding another 2.5 hours onto my day seems bonkers.

Seeing how she handles it is very probably the way forward, but in the back of my mind that concern is still there. Does anyone have any more input to this, anything that can help her with her job, and by extension, myself? Much appreciated.

676,"Hi, this is my first post here and English isn't my first language so sorry of some things don't make sense. 

Anyway, I have a friend abroad. We met on a camp more than a year ago and we're still in contact and talk almost every day. She's in highs school and I'm just a year older than her. 

At the start of quarantine she texted me that this guy confessed his love to her over text. He apparently loved her for 4 years. They go to the same exact class and they have almost never spoken a word to each other, she said that they maybe said hi to each other in the hallway twice in those 4 years. I thought that was weird because if you like someone wouldn't you want to befriend them? But that wasn't that strange... Maybe he's just very shy or anxious right? 

Now, the same day he told her that, he blew up her phone with so many texts with random messages and that made her very nervous because she a non confrontational person and overly nice and she didn't know how to tell him not to talk to her. And kept the texts up for another few days.
My friend answered some of the questions he asked and being an innocent and trusting person she accidentally told him that she lives near a specific shopping centre. 


• Now onto the sus things:
She went to buy gum to a market near the shopping centre (this was before school) and when she was in the store, he walked up behind her out of nowhere and started to talk to her and asking her out on a date. She said something along the lines of ""I'll think about it"" even though she doesn't like him. (As I said very non confrontational.) But this is very strange because he supposedly told her he lives on the other side of the city (and this is a very big city in Europe) and my friend was weirded out by him being there.
Then when she walked with her friends from school he followed behind them and as soon as she and her friends parted, he walked up to her and offered to walk with her to the metro station. 
Yesterday, she frantically texted me, very scared. Because apparently when she was walking to school she was listening to music and he walked up behind her and grabbed her shoulder and greeted her, which frightened her a lot). He kept talking to her all the way to school but she didn't respond to anything he said. And he has done that a few more times after that. 

Yesterday she went home from school early just so she wouldn't have to meet him and and talk to him. Bare in mind that I don't know this guy because I live on the other side of the continent. I am the one of us 2 who has anxiety and is the paranoid one, so if my friend is scared of this guy I think there must be something a little off about him.

My friend doesn't know what to do and she's very upset, but doesn't know how to confront him, and she afraid that hel react aggressively if she says no. I'm scared for her because I'm very anxious that he'll follow her home or something. And I don't want anything bad to happen to her. He could just be very socially awkward and shy but idk.

691,"Coming here because I don't know where else to go, and I don't have anyone irl to discuss this with further. TLDR; My indoor cat of 10 years is peeing on everything despite me doing everything in my power to fix the root issue. Fiance is not having it. She either has to transition to garage/outdoors or go. 

Within the past month my indoor cat (F) of 10 years decided to start urinating outside of the litter box. On walls, shower curtains, bookshelves. She is spayed. We have recently moved but this was 5 months ago, and this pee problem has only started this month.

At first there was a presence of a UTI. I addressed that with vet visits and 2 rounds of different antibiotics. I've spent over $1,000 alone in total taking her to different vets to rule out further medical problems, and they've finally concluded it is now behavioral. To rule out litter box dissatisfaction, I bought a new litter box with no cover, cat attract litter and even Feliway plugins to reduce stress. Nothing is working. I don't have the money to try behavioral medications (that might not work or make it worse) nor do I have the money or time to try and resolve this with a behaviorist. As of now those are my only 2 options.

My (26f) fiancee (29m) is past his limit on this. He wasn't much of a pet person to begin with, but after all of this he has had it with the entire situation. The money spent, the damage done, all of it. She peed in our closet and the smell set despite multiple rounds of enzyme cleaner, she peed on his board games (not like Life or Monopoly, but an expensive board game collection) and recently she peed right beside me on our new couch (also expensive). Not to mention she has peed in our daughter's room as well, which is a big problem for both of us. 

As of now I'm forced to keep her either in the garage (with a fan going) or outside. She can't be inside the house unsupervised any longer. At first she loved going into the garage, but now she wants back in the house. She is not comfortable going outside in the backyard for long periods of time, so I have started trying to acclimate her to it by just putting her outside for 10 minute intervals, but she just sits by the door and meows. I have a little cat house and tags that I ordered on the way so she'll be safe out there, but my goal is to transition her outside.

I feel absolutely terrible because I know that she's been an indoor cat for so long and the indoor option is better for her. She has a brother from the same litter who is neutered, and he has been acting just fine during this whole ordeal. Unfortunately with my living situation I can't let her back in if I want to keep her. She really is a good cat other than this. I'm looking for any advice to acclimate her to this change, or just anything from anyone who had a similar issue.

Thank you,

692,"Okay, tiny backstory first: I've been struggling with depression and having suicidal thoughts on and off since I was about 15, so that's almost 10 years now. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse, I can deal with it most of the time. 

I have a friend that's been messaging me about him wanting to kill himself for a couple of weeks now. He's done this before but he got a job and a girlfriend and those thoughts kind of went away and he got better. We are not super close; but he likes me a lot more than I am comfortable with. Not that I don't like him but I see it more as a casual friendship and I think he wants it to be more. It's hella awkward because I don't know him that well but of course I don't want him to hurt himself.

Now he started to message me everyday saying how he's gonna do it, how life is pointless and he just wants to die. While I really want to help him (I have no idea how, I've been trying to be supportive but I can't fix his life) but I'm starting to get really triggered by his messages. I had a panic attack two days in a row now because he won't stop saying these horrible things and I feel awful for saying this because it's not his fault? But I can feel myself thinking about suicide a lot more since this started and I've generally been feeling a lot worse again. This might sound awful, but sometimes it feels like he's saying all of these things to make me feel bad. He'd ask if I want to come over this week and when I say I can't, he says something like ""Alright, but I won't be around next month."" 

It's gotten to a point where I seriously just want to block him and cut him out of my life because I honestly can't handle this anymore. I know that's a horrible thing to say. I just don't know how to help him. If he hurts himself I will probably never forgive myself but this whole situation is taking a toll on my already very fragile mental health.

So im already 20 years old this year, but my dad is super strict with me, like he literally doesnt let me ride with my friends to a mall which is only 30 mins away, ? But tommorow hes letting me go but hes going to do a spot check on me to see whether i am where i said i’ll be. Like can you imagine, your own dad spying on you to a mall thats 30 mins away...He doesnt let me go to other places other than the mall, but my friends already planned on going to the beach later (my dad doesnt know). If i told my dad that i want to go to the beach after going to the mall, i swear he will not even let me go to the mall. So yeah im kinda sneaking out because THATS WHAT KIDS DO WHEN THEIR PARENTS DONT ALLOW THEM TO DO ANYTHING ! im 20 ffs, idk if im gonna get caught or not. If i do then ill be dead. He has a very loud voice so if he gets mad at the mall, the whole mall can hear it. my friends sympathize with me coz my dad doesnt even allow me to go out for more than 4/5 hours. Like if i go out at 10am, i have to back by 2pm, he will call me and forces me to go back home right away if its more than 2pm, like why ? Its not like i have anything to do at home. Im not doing anything illegal. Im just chilling and having fun with my friends. Whats so wrong about that? 😭 and now im super scared to go out tommorow. He doesnt let me watch the cinema because of the covid but the purpose of me going to the mall IS to watch cinema, i didnt tell him im going to the cinema tho coz if i did, then yeah i wouldnt be allowed to go. I just stayed quiet when he told me not to go. 

So im breaking 2 rules tommorow
1. Going to the cinema
2. Going to the beach

I just hope i dont get caught 😭 pray for meeeeee. Im super scared, like what if he calls me when im at the beach ? What should i tell him ? If he calls me in the cinema then i can just go outside of the cinema, but if at the BEACH THEN WHAT SHOULD I SAY?? GUYS HELPPP 😭",01Sep2020,1

While at my airbnb stay my host canceled my reservation early due to claim of new regulations in the city about short term rentals. I ask to read the letter she received and she refused, so I let her know that I will not accept the situation without compensation. Called the city and they told me that there are no regulations on short term renting. But regardless I had to leave since the host was canceling my stay. However the day before I was supposed to leave the host received a call from airbnb stating that I am requesting compensation for the abrupt cancelation and for large loss in money for booking a hotel for the remaining stay. The host comes down to (the basement apartment) and starts going crazy and screaming in my face. "" you are so greedy"" and starts going red and cussing at me. An airbnb employee was on the phone on her end listening to all of this. I kept my cool and told her I'm sorry but I feel like i should get compensated. She leaves and smashes the door on her way out. First off she should not be entering my apartment for any reason, so I called airbnb let them know I am leaving as she is going crazy and I do not feel safe after her entered abruptly and was going manic. They told me to leave take my delongings and that I do not need to clean the place if I feel threatened. While I was leaving the place the lady comes out with her 6 foot 6 boy friend and starts cussing in my dirctly 6 inches from my face and blocks me from getting my delongings. Her boyfriend the whole time Is looking down at the floor in embarcement and does not say a word. I told her please get out of my way i want my stuff and im leaving.  She doesn't until her mom comes out and told her something in Spanish and she finally lets me get my things. On top of this after I leave shes claiming I stained her couch which I know I did not (picture looked like a puddle of soap water on the couch). I broke the TV, but she didn't provide evidence and that i ""stole her Amazon fire stick"" which I did not. I declined her request of 970 dollars in damages. What should i do from here? Should I file a police report for her being 6 inches in front of my face and cussing me out and literally being a human wall and entering my apartment like that. I am a student and can not afford to pay these bogus charges, as I already lost 1.3 thousand on a hotel now... should I seek compensation on the hotel and abrupt cancelation (as her reason is a lie)

699,"Sorry I’m advance this is kinda long and I needed to vent. 

Me and my ex broke up because he did a dumb thing, he messaged a girl on Instagram and was complementing her. I actually work with this girl and she sent me a screenshot, I was devastated because this girl is really pretty. His reasoning behind it was he was trying to get back at me for having one of my guy friends help me with moving into my apartment. Kinda caught him in a lie, because he has no idea that me and this girl we’re friends with each other.

 So after that I told him I wasn’t sure if I could be in the relationship anymore, but I told him I wanted to talk to him like adults cause I lived him and we made promises to each other. I heard nothing from him and didn’t hear anything from his for about 3 weeks and during that time he was the first to watch all my stores on snap. He was able to walk away from me so easily and I was willing to make it work. this man told me he loved me, called me his future wife. We talked about kids he told me very personal things about his life, he showed me his childhood home and where he grew up. I meet his family and I meet his dad ( the most important person to him) he brought me around all of his friends. He told me that he imagines the rest of his life with me. I gave 100 percent to this relationship, made myself vulnerable and I have also been hurt before like him, I was always there for him and when he got drunk I would get out of bed and drive to him to make sure he got home safe. I gave him all of me! 

The relationship was hard because he was really immature, he drank a lot and he partied a lot too, he always got into fights. He wasn’t really there for me and when he was drunk he would say things like he didn’t want to meet my family and that he wouldn’t make time for me. I only saw him once or twice and week and his weekends were reserved for his friends. He was very bad at communicating, in the beginning we would talk and FaceTime all the time. Then after a couple months he I could barely get hint to text me and some nights he wouldn’t even text me back.  When we stated saying I love you, he would only say it sometimes and when I said it he would sometimes ignore it. That last month I was moving into my apartment and he was not very supportive, I’d vent to him about what was going on and it was a pretty bad situation and he didn’t seem like he wanted to be there for me and offer support. Knowing all this about him I still feel in love, I still wanted him despite this. 

After the 3 weeks we exchanged  words, it ended by him asking if we could still be friends and I told him to go fuck himself, I’m absolutely heartbroken and shattered. How could someone go from begging you to be in their life to not wanting you at all. I went to a bar that he frequents and he happened to show up there, I thought I would be okay seeing him but he he walked past me and didn’t even acknowledge my existence, as if I wasn’t ever there, as if we where strangers. This hurt me more than anything, he doesn’t want me. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so hard in my life. I still love him and I want him but it’s clear he doesn’t want me and possibly never meant any of the things he has said. That night I told him I still loved him and he told me that he was happy to see me. That’s was the end of that conversation. I’m still trying to process that I might never talk to or see this person I love  so much again.

Even tho I know he is not good for me, he’s the only person I have ever truly loved. I keep thinking all these terrible things, maybe he was looking for a way out, maybe there is something wrong with me. I don’t understand how I could have lost so much.

700,So I feel as though I’m at a very bad point in my life. Basically I was going to go to college last year but got cold feet and instead returned to high school and did classes so I could get into a university engineering program. I’m really not passionate at all about engineering but I feel like that’s just because I’ve been in a depressive state ever since quarantine started. I smoke weed a lot and also put tobacco in the bowl which makes it addictive. I worked throughout all of quarantine but stopped for a couple weeks before leaving to uni. Now I’m here at university living in a house with a bunch of second year guys I kinda knew from high school and they’re all good friends but I never get into the convo because I’m always in my head thinking of how to sort my life out. I don’t really have hobbies because I’ve just become so used to watching tv and getting high. I can feel myself becoming more uncomfortable than I was the months prior and I’m just so sad that I committed to the lease so I can’t get out of it and I’m not sure whether to stick with my program and living in the house even though I’m uncomfortable or to move back home and work full time at my old job where I felt comfortable and would pay off debt like that and then would completely prepare my living situation next year to be something I’m actually excited for.

Then I get aggressive. We storm out. It could've been easily avoided if she had just respectfully responded to my statement when I firstly said it.

I just want to have a normal mom, who listens and talks proportionally and who is able to have normal conversations. I'm exhausted.",01Sep2020,1

I work at a doggy daycare and I pretty much love my job. But... The owner’s son (let’s call him Dan) sucks. He gets away with a lot of things. Like that one time I found his weed stash at work hidden in one of the dog play areas, that’s not only weird but also harmful if the pups found it and got into it. But when I told my boss nothing happened. This is the norm with Dan. 
I found out this morning that Dan blamed me for a dog fight that I wasn’t even there for 
On Thursday I don’t mess with daycare or putting dogs into groups because we close at 6pm and I get there at 3, I just do cleaning.
Dan does daycare that day.
So to make a long motherfuckin story short- Dan was there when there was a dog fight (we are required to report when a fight happens and check the dogs involved for injuries) and didn’t tell anyone that one of the dogs got hurt. Let’s call the injured dog Benji.
On Friday when I work in the morning at 8am I find out that Benji’s parents had contacted us through Facebook with photos of his injuries. When asked who Benji was put with Dan threw me under the bus and said that I was the one putting Benji with dogs that he doesn’t get along with on Thursday knowing full well that I only clean that day. 
I don’t know what to do now, I am worried that my boss will confront me and blame me for what happened. What do I do?",01Sep2020,1
704,"Now, I know this may seem like a minor inconvenience, but there's more to it.

You see, 4 months ago I joined a community on instagram, and quickly found someone who was extremely nice. We've been DMing ever since, practically daily. She claims that she's a girl, and I claim that I'm a girl. I even have a fake name attached to my account.

Why would I lie about my gender? Well, the community is female dominated, and I think it also makes people more willing to talk to me, because if I straight up said I was a guy, they'd probably not feel as comfortable talking to me.

I've even used a few ""girly text styles"" like abbreviating a lot of words, and adding emojis.

So far, we haven't shared any personal information, she just claims that she's a year younger than me (16). But I feel like eventually one day she'll propose ""hey, let's video chat!"" Or something like that.

It saddens me to think that one day either her, or I will disappear from that community (because of college, job, etc). But I want to make sure that before that happens, I come clean.

I want to come clean so bad, but 4 months of a lie?! Is it even worth it? And how would I come clean to her?

(Keep in mind she could very well be lying to me about her gender also.)",01Sep2020,1
705,"So I want to start this by saying that I’m not using this as a way to brag but so a little backstory so school always was a breeze for me in terms of test taking but I never really did homework because I was always able to just take a test and pass but I always had low grades in school because of homework. This along with getting diagnosed with auditory processing disorder, social pragmatic disorder , and adhd so this always lead me to believe I wasn’t intelligent , after a heart to heart convo with a teacher in grade 10 (I’m grade 12 now) . And now I realize that I’m very smart and now it’s greatly changed my way of thinking , I’ve always had problems with getting upset at not understanding things but now it’s become more of a problem I find my self getting angry at my self when I don’t do as well at something I should of done well. For example I took my ACT and did exceptionally well on everything but one part , now I did awful on this part at no fault of my own, due to my disability’s I’m allowed extended time normally but for some reason the ACT didn’t allow this but it was not to my knowledge. Making me fail that section , after this I’ve been beating myself up over it a lot. And I also now feel a need to learn everything, like things I’m not even interested in if someone talks to me about something I don’t know about I feel the need to learn about it just to prove to them that I can understand it. Learning used to be fun for me but now it’s just turned into a competition to prove to everyone / myself mainly that I’m not as stupid as I had thought . 

Any advice? I know this seems kind of like rambling and I doubt anyone will respond and once again I want to make it clear that IM NOT doing this as a way to get people to look at me as being smart I just want to know if anyone else has faced a similar problem and or if anyone had any advice to deal with the internal conflict I’m having with myself",01Sep2020,1

708,"My girlfriend is divorced with three kids [f6/m4/f20 months].  Her ex husband has not adjusted to the new arrangement well, to say the least; there was about a four month period where he took sole care of them and would only let us see them for a few hours every two weeks.  We’ve since agreed on a traditional 50/50 arrangement all before the court gets involved (delayed like crazy per Covid-19 and him dragging his feet).

Her oldest daughter, literally out of nowhere, has started saying things like “Jesus loves us,” “Jesus watches you when you sleep,” and so on.  My gf is Jewish and her ex is I believe Christian, but they had never gone to church or temple while they were married.  I’m somewhere around agnostic/humanist, so we decided we wouldn’t talk to them about religion on them until they were older and could understand it better.  When we confronted their father he said “I’m just answering her questions.”

It’s impossible to get through the this man, I promise you.  We already know we’re going to get married and I treat this kids as if they were my own.

709,"My BF and I have been together 2 years. He's a good guy, he's always treated me amazingly- always wants to see me, calls every night, surprises me with thoughtful gifts, puts in a huge effort with my family. Basically always puts me first. This is why I feel so terrible about wanting to leave/doubting if I still romantically love him- it's not like there's been cheating or abuse, just a grinding mental illness on his end.

Little things that weren't an issue are starting to bother me- like his ignorance of politics and a lot of general knowledge a college student should know, which admittedly is stupid and nitpicking on my behalf, never bothered me before. I just wish he had his own opinion of more things, but whatever, that would be icing on top of the cake. Sometimes, he can be quite immature, he cares way more about what others think than me, kinda like a teenager. He is quite lazy when it comes to college. We are in the same modules/lectures but I will start studying/doing assignments a week or 2 before him. He'll start the night before something is due and I will help him just about pass. 

He can also be a little insensitive. He suffers from terrible anxiety and goes through phases of frantically confessing things to me. He doesn't care how it affects me in the moment, he just wants to cure his anxiety by confessing and that really hurts. He's confessed bad thoughts he had about me and some still hurt even a year later about someone being hotter or sometimes not finding me attractive or me being a loser cos I only have 115,000 of a Snapchat score.  He has apologised over and over and made it clear it was just anxiety but it still hurts and part of me thinks I could never happily marry someone that would accidentally hurt me like this. I've heard like 30 of these and about bad stuff he did in the past. It's a lot.

I feel like such a phoney for the last 2 weeks or so. He'll be excited to meet me and looking for kisses and cuddles and I'm not feeling it a lot. He'll mention somewhere we could travel in a year or 2 or even our future house and I feel so guilty because I don't rhink I want this anymore? Part of me feels I would be crazy to let him go, how do I know for sure I will meet someone as loving again, minus the flaws? Help?

He did have some pictures from a few years ago with a girl, and being he avoids the topic of relationships outside of what we have I assumed it was a more recent breakup that was hard for him and never mentioned it.

We met on reddit and I happened to open the app out of boredom the other day and scroll through messages and came across our first conversation. Just clicked his profile for whatever reason I didn’t even plan to look but saw his most recent post was talking about being NEWLY engaged, like a week ago. 

I was honest and told him I saw this and that I was sorry and if I had made it out to be more than it was and he felt bad turning me down because he knows I’m having a hard time, that I would be okay and I understood. 

He told me that he had posted it for someone else and was trying to help them out. Honestly had I not talked to my sister about this and she done more snooping I would’ve believed him. She found a wedding registry from about a week ago also with his name, and the girls name who was in his old photos. Her page shows nothing about them being in a relationship either though,  so I’m just super confused at this point.

For context, I'm a 20 year old female who's parents havent been together since I was like 4. I'm essentially a bastard. 

My dad was on the hook for paying child support for both my brother and I until were both 18. My brother turned 18 a couple months ago so the child support stopped. In the beginning he was paying 750 each a month, claimed he couldn't afford it. He lost his job and took it to court again, got it lowered to 400 a month each, and we saw him once every other weekend. Mind you he worked full time and my mother worked part time. 

Even by the time we were in middle/highschool and never needed a babysitter, she never got a full time job or tried to move up in her company. She stayed signing receipts for a retail store for 20 something years. 

My father constantly complained about this because I always had to share a room with my brother. He said hes giving her enough and that she needs to stop being lazy, get a full time job, so we can have our own room we deserve. We never got it. 

3 years ago my mother had a work injury so she stopped working. She hasn't worked in years by choice. Shes claiming she has no money, cries about it constantly. Meanwhile I'm working a full time job going to college, bought and paid my own car and expenses. She gets mad at me when I ""dont feel bad for her or show remorse"" when shes sad that she doesnt have money.

717,"Hi. So I’m sure many of you are struggling right now and I just would like you to know that I’m thinking of you. 

My boyfriend has been labeled an essential worker during covid and was able to keep his full-time job. He’s recently been at risk of being furloughed due to lack of incoming jobs to work on. He lives in an extremely small apartment (costing about $1100 w/ utilities, not including cost of living) that he was only able to afford by working overtime. Now that he isn’t receiving overtime, he isn’t able to afford everything. I (mid 20’s F) have been helping him stay afloat. 

My problem is that I’m a full-time masters student working a minimum wage job (also considered essential) and still living at home to help me get by. I’m lucky enough to have some savings built up that has me able to able to help him out. But, I’m starting to feel uncomfortable with how much money I’m giving him since I also have bills and am trying to build savings for when I can eventually move out. As of right now, he owes me about $1,000 and I’m in no way rushing him to pay me back, I just want him to not feel worried or stressed.

I’m also trying to help him solely so that he doesn’t need to ask family and end up having to owe more than one person. I also know he would feel ashamed for reaching out to them for help, as he doesn’t want to look like a failure. 

I’m in the US and it feels like the government just doesnt care and has given up on people like him and I. Not only have essential workers received nothing, but now the incentive for unemployment has basically ceased. Even if their renegotiated incentive of $400 is active, given the baseline employment pay is less than a weekly salary, he still wouldn’t be able to afford to live. And of course rent is still active. I don’t want to make this political, but wanted to share my frustrations. 

I have no doubts that if something were to happen, his family would be able to figure something out and help him. I of course want to avoid that situation at all costs and dont want him to feel like he’s a failure compared to other family members. I’m not really sure what I can or should do in this moment as it’s a tough spot, and I’m sure many of you are in similar boats. If there’s any helpful advice you can give me to help support him in the best way I can, that would be much appreciated. 

Thank you for making it this far. Stay well.",01Sep2020,1
718,"I (18/f) currently work in a school for children with special needs. I am not a teacher, I'm just assisting a class. This is a part of my education for the job I want. In ""my"" class, most students have a form of autism. There is one specific boy (ca. 16) who isn't there because of his intelligence but because of his social skills (or the lack of them). He has a light form of Aspergers, but the main issue is his behavior. In my country, many people with Autism/Aspergers go to a normal school if they are high-functioning. 

Because many of the children at this school have a lower intelligence than the average person and his intelligence is quite average, he thinks he somehow is superior and a genius. He almost always speaks English (I'm not from an English-speaking country) even thought the other children in this class have serious learning disabilities which makes it almost impossible for them to learn another language and, therefore, don't understand him. When they ask him to stop, he calls them stupid. I told him how unfair it is, and he just said ""If they're not smart enough to understand me, they're not worth of my time anyways"". We started to speak French to him whenever he speaks English, and this has helped a little.

He has made comments about my butt and constantly calls me ""m'lady"" even though I tried my best to explain to him how inappropriate this is, especially since I am some kind of teacher to him. He just muttered how women today can't deal with gentlemen and how he just wants to be nice.

Whenever something goes wrong, he is never the one who caused it, he always blames the others. 

I know that he has a light form of Asperger's, but is it too much to expect minimal social skills? I don't expect him to always know exactly how other people feel, I just want him to be able to show respect. Is there anything I can do or am I treating him unfairly?

So I have this aunt who has been in my life since the day I was born, and don't get me wrong, she is a good and caring person but is a total control freak. She bosses around our family members but especially me. We used to live in different continents but now we live five minutes away from each other. Every single day she will call me and ask me what I'm doing to see if I'm ""on task"". And several times a week she will come over to my house to lay out a timetable she has set for me for the next few weeks and check in to make sure I'm following what she told me to do. I get that she has good intentions, but like, I have parents too who are strict and already do plenty to keep me productive, I don't need another person! She also has an extremely short temper and is extremely critical of me, pointing out every single flaw every time she comes uninvited. Even my parents know how overbearing she is, but they can't say anything because she will probably flip out. No one in our whole family can say anything to cross her, because it's her way or the highway. 

It's not that I dislike her, it's just extremely tiring and overwhelming having to deal with this when I've already got a lot on my plate. Also I feel like she doesn't really have the right to control my life like this when I have PARENTS, and I'm going to college soon. I don't know, it's just a lot to put up with.

Long post coming, and idk why my grammar gets worse and worse through this so sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND:  My dad has always been against video games, since my sister and I were born, but he still bought me a Nintendo DS when I was little, and it was just amazing. Generally played Mario games, really fun times... He also got me Minecraft( cause he's an engineer and likes the idea of creative mode).

One day though, when I was about 10, he read an article that talked about how games make you more violent in general and all that, and since then, he took my Nintendo DS and uninstalled any games from his computer. 

Time went by, and both of us understood our lesson and didn't play any form of video games since then. The first few months were harsh, but afterwards, everything went well. Now, though, all of my friends have at least one console, and they always tell me: "" Come on, bro, just talk to your parents and convince them to buy you a PS4 so we can play together"", I always brush it off and tell them that I don't really want to and stuff, but deep down I really want to play some Warzone and shit with the boys...

Here is where the post starts:

Last year, my cousins from the US came to stay for 2 weeks at our place, and they brought their Nintendo Switch, and boy oh boy, let me tell you, we had tons of fun, it was really epic. My entire family played Smash Bros. Ultimate together, and it was amazing. Our cousins even bought Super Mario Party on the spot just cause they enjoyed how much genuine happiness we got from playing Smash. It was really really fun.

\* And so, after the 2 weeks, me and my sister decided that we have to buy a Nintendo Switch, so since then, our (genius, might I add) plan started. We began saving money(our scholarships), and we reached 1050 dollars, which is pretty much a lot, 4 times the price of a Nintendo Switch. The only problem left was: ""How do we buy it and use it?!"". Well, that's the tricky part.

In November lat year, I threw a birthday party at my place, with 14 of my friends( my birthday was on the 14th hmmm, coincidence?), and it went amazing, so I thought: What if I make it look as if my friends bought me a Switch for my birthday? And decided that's how I'll proceed, so the plan is:

1. Save money( which I already did)
2. Tell my friends( already done)
3. Go buy the Switch ( one week prior to the birthday party, with 2 of my friends)
4. Keep the Switch at one of my trustworthy friends' house ( already chose one)
5. Organize the party( another hard part of the plan)
6. Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.

Personally, I think there are a few flaws to this plan:

1. The money: a.  how do I spend the money without my parents questioning it? Cause they sometimes might ask me to borrow 20$ or something like that, and I can't just use them like that. The good part is that we have saved way more money that what we actually need to spend

b. the money comes in different currencies( but this isn't really that big of a problem, we'll just change it, but there's this)

2.  Organize the party: COVID-19 kinda messes this up I guess, I'll try convincing my parents but I don't think it'll work, at least not at my house, maybe in a park or something, idk.

3. My dad's reaction: this one decides everything. If dad reacts positively, then everything was worth it. If not, I'll have a bit of explaining to do and maybe a few months grounded, but I hope not, I mean, what can he do, ask my friends to return it? I don't think so.


Any advice on how to decrease the risk of a negative reaction from my dad?

727,"Recently went in to my doctor’s office for an annual check up. Because I needed to schedule it between my classes, I ended up seeing a nurse practitioner that’s in the office instead of my normal doctor, which was totally cool until it wasn’t. Visit started normal until we got to pre-existing conditions, to which she questioned my asthma. She asked when my last attack was and when I said around December, happened while I was at work, she asked if I had really had an asthma attack or if I was just out of breath. I was honestly surprised because I’d never had a medical professional ask a question like that. Anyone that has asthma can tell an asthma attack is VERY different from being out of breath. So when I told her no she continued to question me until she finally huffed (not even kidding) and asked when my first attack was. When I told her I was four and had struggled with it my entire adolescence, she seemed to back down a bit. Then, as she was listening to my lungs, she made a comment about how “there was no asthma today”. She proceeded to feel around my abdomen and as she was, she told me I needed to enroll in “some sort of regular exercise program because I’m worried about your weight.” Honestly, if I had just looked my chart, I would be too! I’m 5’1” and 190 lbs. However, I did weights in high school and can still easily lift 200 and press 475 (even with being out of practice for ~4 years). I wear a size 12 and have a 34” waist.

728,"So, im a 16 year old guy who isn't even obese. Im just about 6-7 kgs overweight for my height but I have man boobs. I used to be insecure of them but I slowly didn't give a shit, but now im in lockdown and I've been doing nothing much and I want to reduce them or get rid of them. I don't know if I have gynocostamia. I guess the other part where I have a decent amount of fat are my thighs. I don't have much belly fat. 

 I eat pretty healthy but I don't excercise much. I have a considerably low metabolism, which makes it hard to loose the calories. 

If I do have gynocostamia, can I get rid of it without surgery or do I need surgery. 

I have started with knee push ups, bench presses and sit-ups. 20 each every day. Im planning on cutting on my carbs aswell. 

Stamina is my weakness right now, I can only jog like 500 meters without completely loosing my breath.

I just want some excercise and suggestions about how to go forward with this.

I appreciate any advice. Thank you .",01Sep2020,1
729,"So me and my ex slept together for months after we broke up. It was a total of about 4 months. I was in love with him and I continued to sleep with him because I broke up with him but regretted it. I was convinced that sex was enough for me until i eventually realized it wasn’t. So I told him that I didn’t want to keep sleeping together and I explained why. I made it very clear that my reason was (very specifically) because I didn’t want to keep hurting myself by continuing to sleep with someone I realize I was still in love with and I also suspected he was sleeping with other women. I was not mad at HIM for MY decision to keep sleeping with him. Almost an entire month passed and I intended to never speak to him again but he texted me and asked to make up. I told him that I wasn’t his personal hoe and that if he was looking to have sex to call someone else. He went on to say that he loved me and that he needed me in his life. He asked to meet and we did. During that meetup he got into an stare down with a guy for glancing at me and tried to kiss me repeatedly because he wanted the guy to know who I was with. I of course didn’t want to kiss because I didn’t want to kiss someone I wasn’t in a relationship with. He got very upset about that and asked to get back together and even cried and promised to change. I was surprised by the sudden change and I said I would “think about it.” We weren’t actually together but we did go back to kissing, having sex again, and going on dates. But out of nowhere he ghosted me and I eventually found out that he had got into another relationship. I tried to understand his point of view since we weren’t actually “together” but I couldn’t help but feel like he knew that he would hurt me by coming back. If I wasn’t what he wanted why did he do that to me? I also know that we weren’t together but wanting to be with someone “better” doesn’t warrant playing with my feelings until he came across that. I feel like he was SO wrong",01Sep2020,1

My boyfriend's family is aware of my financial situation, and they are quite rich in comparison to my family. So, my boyfriend's mom has started giving me money at every opportunity. For example, I forgot an item at her house, so she mailed it to me along with multiple gift cards. When I thanked her for the gift, she told me that if I wanted anything from Amazon she would send me more gift cards or just buy it for me directly. 

How can I politely decline her generous offer? I'm uncomfortable accepting so much financial help from these people. I love my boyfriend very much, but his mom isn't my mother-in-law yet.

They kept telling me to contact the company I purchased from but still nothing was resolved. I bought this item from Nordstrom rack on sale for $800 so I’m very disappointed that I didn’t get it.

734,"I’m in my mid 40s. Married guy to a busy working lovely younger woman. No kids yet. I quit my job last December after working quite unhappily for 7 years.

I then began my own business which involves working alone and online. E-commerce biz. 

But I deeply struggle to work on this new business. I really should be putting in at least 4 hours a day during the week, if not more. I have a lot to learn and study, self study.

How on earth can i get myself up and truly move? Sure i know i need to set goals and remember why I’ve chosen this new path (freedom, not have a boss, make decent money) and what it could bring me. I just get discouraged and put it off. And put it off. And put it off. There’s certainly no guarantee this will all work but i do know i need to at least try! But i do struggle.

738,"A few months ago, I got belligerently drunk. Typically when this happens, I keep some distance between my phone and my person- but this time I didn’t. I ended up sending some pretty cringeworthy and overtly sexual texts to an old friend’s current girlfriend (a woman I was involved with a long time ago). Woke up in the morning to this old friend very upset just laying into me. Since then, I haven’t been able to formally apologize and my phone calls and texts to both of them have been left unanswered and unread. It seems both of them have blacklisted me. 

Well, old pal is coming over this weekend since he’s great friends with my roommate. I want to immediately address the elephant in the room but I’m not quite sure the best way to go about it or if I should even confront the issue at all.

My gut is telling me to apologize but I don’t want to stoke the flames if he’s moved on from it himself.

739,"I actually just made a previous post! 😅 
Back on topic, let me give some backstory that is important:

I'm middle eastern/Afghan, and my boyfriend is Mexican. I date him in secret right now because my family ABSOLUTELY cannot know I'm dating. I'm in nursing school right now, and would prefer to let them know once I have a job and my own place. So... 2022? 😅 It's too much stress at the moment, but I love SO. We talk about kids, our future, and being happy. This is where things get hairy. He has 2 kids, 2M and 3M. Super cuties and can't wait to meet them (it is being planned and in the process to be in October!) Their mom is a high conflict person... and she knows about my presence, but my identity is hidden to her(THANK GOD). The only thing that makes this hard, is my ""SIL"" (just for the story I'll call her that -she is SO's brother's girlfriend). SIL and HCBM are friends, like GOOD FRIENDS. SIL is also a troublemaker too... SIL, due to a recent incident, is not welcome to SO's house (SO lives with parents). SIL and SO's brother were quarantining, and they started fighting. SO's bro was having trouble breathing, and she started punching him in the chest. Police were called, she ran over his foot with a car when taking the baby and that's a good summary of the story. Only SO's brother and his son (1M) can come. Although SIL came to the driveway one time, however, she was blocked entry.

I'm worried that once I am introduced to his kids and start hanging around his family more, that SIL will find out my circumstance, pass it to HCBM and then rat information to my family. If not that, that SIL will report any information (my name, my license plate idk) to HCBM. I told this to SO, and he said that she might do this shit.

I decided to remove my middle and last name on facebook, and fill it with some silly name, private literally EVERYTHING on there. Change my name on IG as well, but it's still public cause I don't have anything important on there. Although the more I think about it... I should so she doesn't bother my sister (who knows my situation) or other family (who DON'T). 

SO is very willing to work with whatever makes me comfortable. I feel she may know my name if kids start to talk around her or she instigates them. 

What are some measures you recommend for me? (I'M PRIVATING IG right now though 🤯).

PS- no one knows of my circumstance of keeping secrets except for me and SO.",01Sep2020,1
740,"So, as the question says, I was raised by Atheist parents and beloved up until this year that there was nothing beyond the spiritual world. But after some major personal trauma from my past resurfaced, I have been questioning the nature of consciousness, and how ""real"" the material world actually is, and I have the vague feeling that there is something more to the world beyond the material.

I feel a very strong connection to animals, plants and nature and I'm really looking for a spiritual practice which places high value on connection with, compassion towards and oneness with the natural world. The thing that has most put me off about the major religions is they express the idea that humans are special and superior. I don't feel superior. I feel that I am no higher a being than the birds and the trees, that they have as much of a soul as I do. What is a spiritual path I can follow which is compatible with this view?",01Sep2020,1

Last night at 12 AM my door bell rang and I went to the front door assuming it's my downstairs neighbor who is blind (I live in a two family house). Instead it was a 40 year old man saying he was having car trouble.

His SUV was in the middle of the street and the hood was propped up as someone else was ""working in it"". He asked if I could give him a ""jump"" but I told him I didn't have any jumper cables. He kept insisting I help and got upset when I couldn't. I went back to my room and my mother checked for the car through the window 5 minutes later and the car was gone and no one was outside.

748,"We've been dating a little over a year, we're in our early 30s.

A few days before meeting me, he went on a date with a girl pretty opposite me - they never went on another date or saw eachother, however he continued liking her instagram photos - but only her selfies. I only realized it because she would appear in my ""Recommended"" feed and his name appeared under that. Finally about three months into our relationship, I got very sick of it and said ""I notice you've been liking a girl named xxx's pictures. It shows up in my discover feed and I am wondering if it's something I should be concerned about?"" He was very apologetic, embarrassed and unfollowed her. 

That to say - it made me insecure and continues to badger me a bit wondering why he continued to like her photos even when we were exclusive. I don't want to resent him for it - but I find myself wondering why he did this and if he would have stopped had I not said something. Part of me wonders if he wanted to have another option, and the other part wonders if it was just innocent and i'm being insecure (my ex of 6 years was a habitual cheater so definitely some scars there).

Aside from that, things with him are great and he is very receptive to my feelings, a great communicator and all of the great things. In a perfect world, i'd love to say something like - Hey, I know this is long past but this situation is something I still have questions about, can you help me understand? but the other part of me says, that is silly and it is minor, stop being a nut.

750,"I met my college best friend a few weeks into freshman year. We very quickly started spending all our time together and we became super close. It was an amazing friendship at first. Over the years I started to pick up on some red flags about our friendship, and whenever I tell this story people insist that he was in love with me, but I really don’t think that was the case. Anyway, the first red flag I noticed was when he wouldn’t want me around when he had met new people. For example, if he was sitting at a table doing hw I couldn’t come join. He would make comments about how I wasn’t his type when people would ask if we were dating, say his type was skinny girls other times (I’m mid sized), but then grab my ass and boobs in private and try to kiss me when he was drunk. One summer I drove 1.5hr to visit him at his internship and he was uncomfortable with me going inside his apt to pee because he wanted the other interns to know he was still available (not sure why just telling them i was a friend wasn’t good enough). Clearly this was unhealthy, and I realize that now but at the time I had very low self esteem and we were able to talk about super personal stuff and I felt safe around a friend for the first time in basically ever. We understood each other so it was easy to look past the warning signs. Fast forward to Junior year, I had decided to join a sorority because I wanted to meet new people and this took up a lot of my time. I also started dating my current bf, so I was busy a lot but between school and friends etc I was doing the very best I could to maintain our friendship. This seems he was living with another friend of mine. Whenever I wanted to see my friend and go over to their apt I had to go through him first because otherwise I would be invading his space. Obviously this was controlling of him but I choose to look past it because I thought our friendship was worth fighting for. Any time I would try to talk about my relationship he would get mad and be super rude. He never liked my bf and even tried to turn another friend of ours (she was studying abroad when I first introduced him to my friends) against my bf, and it worked briefly but she has since apologized for believing him. Towards the end of that year he started hooking up with a girl, and I didn’t take it that seriously because he would constantly talk about how he was just using her and make fun of how she acted during sex to our entire friend group. That summer I was very stressed and juggling a lot, and we had a falling out because I told him he couldn’t expect me to be available every night to talk to him for hours. That summer he made that girl his gf, and we didn’t talk for a few months. We made up right as senior year started and everything seemed fine for a little but it was obviously he didn’t want to see my bf and he would make a point to not make plans with me (a few exceptions but he was definitely pulling away). He made double date plans with another one of our friends but never me, and was overall difficult to make plans with. We both made a point to see each other during the day between classes, so I thought we were fine. COVID happened and he moved across the country during the lock down so there weren’t any goodbyes. After moving, I still thought our friendship was fine, but because of everything going on many of our conversations were about politics. Usually we agree on our political opinions but not anymore. I thought we were engaging in interesting informative discussions but I guess he didn’t feel the same. I realized a few weeks ago that he had unfollowed and then blocked me successively on twitter. I was never rude, or disrespectful of his opinions, but I do use twitter as my own personal sounding board (I have maybe 6 followers so not really a big deal to retweet whatever I want). I’m not surprised that he didn’t want to see my activity but I am surprised that he couldn’t just tell me that he didn’t want politics to come between us. He also wasn’t responding to my texts during this time. After I realized unfollowing turned into blocked, I decided that I had had enough over the last 4 years, and I quietly unfollowed him across all social media platforms. For my own mental health I didn’t want to see another story or post and wonder why he wasn’t talking to me. Should I have tried to talk to him? Did I do the right thing? Unfollowing him wasn’t out of anger it was more of a calming thing I felt I had to do. Sorry for such a long post, but it’s a long story. Please advise, I miss him and our friendship, but I’m tired of being an after thought.

767,"Like months ago, i made friends with some dude and his girlfriend. We did alot of stuff together and even joked abt a threesome but the guy didn't want to do it and i respected that. We've been friends for a while and i was the guys only ""best"" friend bc he didnt have many other than our small friend group and he talked and trusted me the most out of them. 

When quarantine came around our friend group noticed he seemed to get more toxic and negative with us (mostly his girlfriend). He would say mean shit or when someone took something seriously he would call them too sensitive. His girlfriend told me they broke up 3 seperate times over minor shit. I forgot what happened on the first breakup but she took it very seriously and almost killed herself and got baker acted (place for people with suicidal behavior. I think) 

the second was over him getting in trouble from something he did. The third was over a picture that wasn't even that bad. He would tease her abt leaving her too and other shit that wasn't cool. I was there to comfort her through every break up too. She dumped him abt 4 months ago and confessed love for me the day before she did.

 We have been dating since then and kept it a secret from him for as long as we could. Of course, he found out and tried to take his life but we called the police to get him before he does it.  We obv aren't friends anymore and when he told me he was going to off himself he told me things like ""i trusted you, how could you do this to me, all you do is think abt yourself, etc.""

 Although i know he was just trying to manipulate me into giving him his girlfriend back but it just kind of haunts me since i never had a gf or a person that hates me before. Can someone pls tell me if i made the right choice by doing this? Im just tired of staying up at night wondering if i could've helped them both without losing one or the other. 

I love my gf too i think we'll be together for a long time i just feel selfish sometimes too. I just need an answer from somebody. Hopefully i can feel better knowing people agree or disagree. Idk im just confused. My brain hurts.",01Sep2020,1

I'm not interested in exploring other cities, I don't need a pool, beach, sun or other attractions. I don't think these things are bad, but I prefer to hang out with my internet friends.

today i just feel down, my birthday is tomorrow. 
and i texted the man i’m seeing (we’ve been together for over a year) last night for the first time just saying “i’m sad” 
i fell asleep and woke up still sad and saw he read my 2am text and responded immediately, four times, asking what was up and just being there. i ignored it till just now, because i didn’t think he would actually respond. 
i’m usually the nurturer. 
but instead of saying “idk sorry lol how are you” in my usual isolated manner- i ADDED the vulnerability. for the first time in my life. i said “idk tbh lol. sorry, just have been having a rough few days. how are you?” 

and he again, responded immediately, actually caring and now i am here. 

i started crying because, well, idk why i am sad. i don’t know why it’s been rough. but i feel like i sort of just did something so easy but that exposure- so simple- just saying i am sad- letting someone know/ it feels weird. i am crying now (or planning to in the shower, after i try to rationalize and intellectualize my feelings on this sub), and i’m not sure why this feels the way it does.

I can't rush her because although I don't know what's she's going through mentally (she might not even be able to describe it her self) I have experienced a lot of death in my life and it stays with you forever.

After that, she told me “whenever you come up here it brightens up my day.”

I said thank you. I appreciate it and smiled.

Before that she subtly invited me to her house because we were talking about hair dye and she offered to dye my hair.

She also told me whenever she flirts with people she teases them and she teases me a lot.

One time she told me her dad was coming up here but it was so out of the blue I didn’t know  what to say other than cool.

I’m not sure I like. I don’t know if the reason she likes me is because I’m really nice to her. 

Like for example, one time she had her hair down and I was like “oh, it looks good. You should keep it that way.” I would say stuff like this and other nice stuff because when we first met, she told me she was lesbian. I think she told me this because she thought I was trying to get with her because I was super nice and asking about her day.

I kept saying nice things to her and complimented her hair and earrings because I thought she was lesbian and she would know I meant nothing of it. I then learned from someone that she is bi.

782," There is a group of obnoxious women who meet in the dog park gazebo that is 24 feet from my front door in the community we live in. They socialize for 2 to 3 hours every damn day. They are so loud I was able to record them yapping away from inside my unit, about 10 feet from the nearest window. To make matters worse, they have ""valley girl accents"". Every other word is, ""like ya know, and ohhhh muhhhh gaaaawwwdddd"".  They all sit there yapping while one of the kids torments the dogs by taking their balls away and chasing them around so they bark non stop. The bimbos just talk louder to be heard over the dogs. Never mind that there is an outdoor pavilion further away they can use, except their dogs would need to be on a leash. 

I complained the situation to the office, they put something in the newsletter about tenants using lower voices in the dog park. This did not correct the issue, so the office asked me to make a recording. Well that turned into a 💩 show with the women getting pissed and claiming their privacy was violated, threatened to sue the office, you get the picture. Turns out parents and their children are a protected class in terms of rental laws. Other tenants cannot make complaints about the noises they make unless it's non child related or past 10pm. 

I work from home as a writer, not that this post shows off my writing skills. 😆 At any rate, I cannot simply put music on to drown out the noise, it interferes with my ability to think. Tried using two white noise machines. Had the windows closed with the AC on, now the weather is cooler. 

At this point I have decided to take matters into my own hands. This may sound nuts, but thinking of making a smelly mixture of pureed fish and Mountain Dew, letting it sit on my porch to ferment.  Under the cover of night, slip into the park and pour the liquid over the thick stone / pebble base that goes around the outside of the gazebo. So the mixture drips down between the stones which are too large for the dogs to swallow. Hoping to create a nasty smell with enough sugar to attract insects. The dog park has a camera that does NOT actually work. Hence the office asking me for a video. I am planning on pretending I am on my cell with a bottle of water that I'm drinking. Then pour out the bottle before leaving. Not too suspicious. 😉 Any thoughts or ideas of what else I can do to make the gazebo an unfriendly environment without damaging anything? Is there a skunk potion I can spread? 

My other thoughts is to purchase a cricket and fart gag device to hide in the bushes of the wooded walking trail that borders the dog park. They work on remote. Make their chit chats as annoying as possible.

783,"i guess i’ll start off by saying that there’s literally no reason for me to be as fucked up as i am. my family loves me, i have friends, i’m pretty well off socioeconomically, and i haven’t had any major traumatic experiences other than lots of panic attacks when i was younger, depression stuff (which i’m now medicated for and doing well with), and the whole tragic “gifted kid” story arc. by all standards, i’m super lucky. 

the issue at hand is that i lie compulsively and have been doing so for years. whether it’s to make people laugh, to fuel my constant need for attention and validation, or just to feel more human, i’m always lying. even now i struggle to not write some dramatic bullshit and make myself out to be something different in front of an audience that i’ll never meet. 

i feel insanely disconnected from humanity and i’m honestly kinda convinced that i’m not capable of feeling actual emotions and that i’m just lying to myself in order to convince myself that i’m not crazy. i can turn my feelings off like a faucet and i have no genuine moral adversity to anything. i’d say i still have a moral compass as a result of the society i grew up and and what not, but breaking my own rules doesn’t really bother me. 

on top of this, everything “benevolent” i do is to fuel my own ego and convince myself that i’m a decent person, rather than to actually make a positive impact on people’s lives. i’m just worried that i’ll never be able to live a genuine, human life. if it makes any difference, i’m 15 and am still kinda developing as a person i guess.

Also, Facebook disables accounts these days. So, my accounts don't go past 1-2 days. I've made hundreds of accounts till this date. Last I made was yesterday and had 2 sex video chats with women.

Doing this takes my entire time and gets me hooked on for days and nights. It's so addictive. I've been doing this for 5-6 years now and TBH, I've missed out on things in order to fulfil this ""hunger"" of mine. I've wasted so many opportunities and failed. I declined social things for this.

I received tons of  messages asking me for the card information, they said that they will buy the information and/or will team up with me to buy bitcoins. Browsing through their messages, I realized that I cannot do it. I'm an evil person to even consider doing it, passing my burden to some stranger.

791,"My roommate has been depressed as of late. He is unhappy with his job, his home life has been “messed up” for a long time, and his love life is not where he wants it to be. 

My issue is that I’ve known him since college, so about 4-5 years now. I know for a fact that he is a narcissist who genuinely mostly cares for only himself. I’ve seen him use a lot people. I’m not a therapist but there is a disconnect in him, emotionally. I’ve never experienced someone so overt and outspoken about their depression and suicidal thoughts. I don’t want to say he’s doing it for attention or to get something but honestly knowing him it’s not far-fetched.

He just seems to “emote” feelings that are not real or even rehearsed. I say this cuz we both love movies and tv and he literally sounds like he is quoting/imitating depressed characters in a film. Kinda like a caricature of a depressed man. 

Regardless, if real or not, I don’t know how to respond anymore. For as long as I’ve known him he’s always complaining about being unhappy. Every time I propose a solution, he just rather wallow in self pity and ignore it because it’s too much work. Example: He HATES his job, I told him to get a new job (switching jobs in our field really isn’t too hard especially now). He made a million excuses as to why he’s staying yet 90% of his complaints come from this single job (that isn’t bad whatsoever)

Idk I’m just starting to feel more annoyed than anything because he is continuing to bitch and complain about shit that really isn’t too bad. So many people are worst off rn yet he genuinely believes he’s had the worst life.

I guess I just don’t know whether to take him seriously or what i can even do besides just listen. Is there anything I can say to help? Any advice would be helpful. I’m sure I sound like a bad roommate, and like a bad person to even be questioning someone’s depression. But I genuinely don’t have any experience dealing with something like this.

Its been 2 weeks since she said that, she said she has some things to take care of (won't say what they are for her privacy) and I'm okay with that and still am but I'm afraid I'll be lead on like my last one, I don't want to bring it up again since she said she'll let me know but I don't want to be led on either.",01Sep2020,1
799,"He hasn't been been himself the past few weeks but I'm not rly sure how to tell. most of the times on weekdays he'll always sleep in for like 3hrs and get up only to make lunch for me and my little brother, and sometimes play football w us in the afternoon. then he'll just go back to bed or prolly his office and do work or whatever, he normally isn't like this 4months ago (before quarantine started).


i often also hear him crying in his room but i didnt give much thought to it. sometimes he'll play video games w me or watch netflix til midnight, but i don't rly get the chance to talk abt this kinda stuffs w him cuz I'm scared he might get mad if i ask him what's wrong. online classes is gonna start in a week for me, and in a month, if the school think it's safe, im gonna have to go back to boarding again but im scared leaving them alone knwking he might not be ok or something.


anyone knows what i should do, or prolly tell me if this is a sign of depression?",01Sep2020,1
800,"The title says it all. I'm (M25) confident around girls, make jokes, sometimes make compliments, good with small talk, etc... I generally feel pretty comfortable around them and I get the sense that they do too. I've had girlfriends in the past, I've had sex before and I'm a fairly experienced guy - it's not like I'm trying to learn how to talk to girls.

However, what has always been a difficulty for me are two things. Approaching a girl I find attractive, which is not the one that haunts me too much, but the thing that really haunts me is making the first move. I usually get to the stage where the girl and I are comfortable  around each other and we make fun of each other, maybe get a little touchy and what not but when it comes to making the first move; the kids, hug, direct eye contact, that's where I really struggle.

Just recently I was with a friend that I'm into and we were having drinks and talking about life. We joked, we danced, we cried, we talked about some of our hardships and overall, we really connected. And this is where I get stuck??? I'm not sure how to make the first move. How do I go from connecting with someone to kissing them or cuddling, hugging, etc??? Especially without the use of a little liquid confidence 😂😂

TL;DR: I'm comfortable around girls but just not enough to make the first move.  

P.s. we did go back to her place after having the drinks and we ended up cuddling and... things happened but I want to make a move before it escalates to that instead of the, last Hope approach which is the equivalent of going for a kiss on the goodbye 😂",01Sep2020,1
802,"So majority of my life I’ve been overweight and I had gone into a pretty toxic friend group. The only person I had was my best friend who I had been friends with for majority of life. Recently I had developed an eating disorder because of the insecurity I had about my weight because of the continuous jokes and insults made about my weight. Although I cut ties with majority of the toxic friend group, I’m still in contact with my best friend. Although I hold such strong emotions towards these people, my best friend chooses to stay friends with them despite the shit they have done. She always brings them up and it just makes me feel horrible. I don’t know if it’s just me overreacting but I don’t know what to do.",01Sep2020,1
803,"My friend Amy (24/F) and I (24/F) have been super close friends for the past three years, we met in college our senior year and have been pretty joined at the hip. We were having a conversation on the phone and as we do. I had a breakup back in March that was rough and continues to be rough as I miss my pevious partner dearly. He was my best friend for almost four years and feels like the biggest loss I've encountered in my early twenties. For some reason, whenever I mention my previous partner to her, she will try to bring up the fact she thinks he is autistic. It makes me uncomfortable because it spawned off from her originally saying that he is socially awkward and constantly misses social cues. I think that everyone socially awkward depending on the given social circle, I certainly am, it's something we all have. Also, she had met my previous partner once as he lives in Utah. Amy thinks that she is autistic and that several of her family members are as well. I do not think it is her place to repeatedly say that she thinks my previous partner is autistic. I don't think it helps me in my grieving for her to say and doesn't help him in any way shape or form? Like it would be different if say, someone were to express concern over another person displaying symptoms of depression and letting someone close to the affected person know out of concern for their well-being. ""I'm telling you, he's autistic"" does not seem to showcase any care or concern and hurt my feelings. 

The other thing that hurt my feelings - My sister had made a recent comment to me that my breasts were unfairly ""perfectly symmetrical"" and Amy responded by saying ""Well your chest is flat, so there isn't really a difference there."" I continued on with what I was saying as I assumed she didn't really mean what she said, but then she continued to say ""I'm surprised that didn't offend you"" and I countered that I knew my chest wasnt flat and I feel confident with that part of my body now, as earlier in the year I didn't due to unexpected weight loss from a depressive episode. She then told me that my breasts were just made up of muscle since I workout so much. I got off the call and felt really hurt.

A few days later I texted Amy to let her know that the comments she made about my previous partner hurt my feelings and that the comment she made about my chest also hurt my feelings and that I'd appreciate if she could refrain from saying comments like those in the future. She didn't respond until the next day where she said she was sorry, but then defended her comments profusely. While she said that it was not her place to say that my partner was autistic, she did further that I really hurt her feelings because she identifies as autistic and that me being ""upset at discussing potential autism"" shows that I see autism as a bad thing. She then said that she was really surprised the flat comment upset since we joke about being in the ""itty bitty titty committee"" and that she did not remember me saying anything about my weight loss struggles regarding my breasts. She concluded by saying that we have been growing distant for awhile and that the last time we hung out felt off and asked if there was something more I was not expressing.

I do not see autism as a bad thing. I feel that typically when someone says, ""I think so&amp;so is autistic or insert disorder of choice"" is not to point out the positives within a person, and rather what makes them different, like my previous partner being socially awkward as she put it. I explained that to her and explained that her pointed remark on calling me flat did not have the same humor attached to it as ""itty bitty titty committee."" She said she understood me on both points and that she'll keep that in mind for the future.

I found out yesterday that she deleted all photos of us on social media and has stopped liking all my posts. This is the first time I have ever openly critiqued her before in our friendship. I really struggle with communicating hurt and usually swallow whatever treatment or emotional harm I receive from others. It makes me feel like it was my fault for feeling hurt in the first place. Amy has made comments in the past that felt like passive aggressive put downs, that I always assumed weren't actually meant as anything, but now I don't know. How can you throw away a three year friendship just because I said my feelings were hurt?",01Sep2020,1
804,"So I have a group chat with a bunch of friends, including my best friend. She keeps chatting in the group chat but when I text her, she leaves me on read. Like she replies a week after I text her or when I'm not on. Someone, please tell me what can I do??",01Sep2020,1
805,"My dog has had a lot of medical and behavioural problems since I got him. He is the most loving and affectionate dog I've ever owned and I just adore him. He follows me around the house everywhere I go and will cry when I go somewhere he isn't allowed to be (like on my mums bed), when I leave the house and someone else stays at home they have told me he just sits on the stairs waiting for me to come back but if no one is at home with him he destroys the house. As soon as I step out of my house I'm always thinking about him, is he okay? What if x or y has happened? I have absolutely no social life because I always rush home from work to see him. I dont go on holidays because I know I wouldnt enjoy myself, I would only be thinking about my dog.

He is fear aggressive and scared of other dogs so becomes aggressive/defensive when near one. I have had private trainers, group training, and professional ""dog boot camp"" training but nothing has worked. My vet refuses to see him because hes a larger dog and just goes crazy when he sees other dogs. He has skin problems that he will always have, and he used to have eye problems but he got surgery to fix this.

Whenever he does anything slightly out of the ordinary e.g. sleeps more than usual, scratches a bit more than usual, shakes his head, licks his paws, doesnt poop on schedule, etc anything like that at all and my anxiety goes through the roof. I'm riddled with thoughts like ""what's wrong with him now? What if I cant pay for the medical care? I dont want him to be in pain or irritated, how would I even take him to the vet?""

Im tired of living in constant anxiety. Its the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last I think of at night. I cant get rid of him, he has too many issues and I don't trust that someone would care for him the way he needs. I love him but he's ruining my life. How can I stop feeling so anxious about him?",01Sep2020,1
806,"I have this friend. I’m going to call them G. So G, and I have this sort of relationship going on. Don’t know if it’s important to my situation or not but—
G, and I have known each other for a bit. At first it was great. We would joke, and mess around with each other then we started opening up for each other. Immediately I knew something might’ve been wrong since they just started dumping all their stuff on me but y’know I wanted to be there for them.

Ever since we have started talking, and opening up it feels more like I’m just his glorified therapist than anything else.
They dump their problems on me, and I do my god-damn best to help them out, but when I try to talk about my issues, and problems they always respond with a, “rip, oof” then continue on with whatever is on their mind.

For example:
“I am feeling kind of down, and disconnected from reality.”
“Rip. Anyways (insert their problem)”

This goes on even when I first wake up. I’ll hop on my phone and say, “Goodmorning G.” and they just continue on with their shit.
I feel bad for complaining but I don’t know if this relationship is healthy and I just need advice.

What do you think I should do? I feel bad for complaining but I know this isn’t healthy.

TL;DR I feel like a therapist for my boyfriend instead of their lover.",01Sep2020,1
807,"About 5 years ago I had a regional manager invite me out for food to chat about a job opportunity. I was nervous, it was a big opportunity and I wanted the job! (He had about 10 years experience where I was green as a cucumber.)

Anyway. Throughout the night he taught me how to ""wow"" clients throughout the night. We toured the companies stores and I became quite inebriated.

I ended up in the company's owned apartment (where he was staying) and I remember a flash of the bathroom. He told me I had been vomiting (I don't remember) and then I remember laying in the bedroom. Without going into too much details, I remember bits of pieces of him on top of me and me pushing him away.

I told no one for years. I ended up working under him, but he made my life hell when I requested a transfer with the higher ups. He is a very, VERY well-liked and charming man in the community. Everyone loves him where I am quite shy and reserved.

I ended up leaving the company and filing a police report. However, HR stated because our stories of that night were so different they were unable to take action.

I've stopped drinking and I'm going back to school for an unrelated field. The whole ordeal made me lose so much trust in people and I had to cut so many people out of my life, because people did not want to believe what had happened.

How can I move on from this? I have a house that I want to sell (my family says I am crazy) and just move to another country and start over. I don't want anything to do with any person involved with this situation.

Any advice from anyone? Am I completely crazy?",01Sep2020,1
808,"TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts


I have never been to a therapist before, but I think I might need one. The problem is that idk how to explain to my parents that I have been lying to them for around 7 years about my ""depression"". Ita hard for me to explain because I suck at explaining things but I'm going to try my best.

For around 7 years, as listed above, I've had what I think is depression. Lack of motivation, not wanting to eat, losing hobbies, random bouts of sadness, self esteem issues, confidence issues, self doubt, self harm, and even suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry if I have this all wrong, which I probably do and I'm probably just being dumb and dramatic, but for the chance that something is wrong how would I tell my parents?

They've made it clear what their thoughts both self harm and suicide are, and I'm afraid that I'll anger them by actually coming out and saying it. They have found my scars before and were angry, but seemed to forget about them and never spoke about it since. Plus they might get angry over me not telling them.

My friend keeps telling me to tell my parents and that I need help. I've gotten to the point of almost telling my parents once or twice but couldn't find the right words. 

Sorry again if I'm just being dumb or dramatic I'm just tired of hiding and it's a little scary. Also sorry if this breaks the guidelines.",01Sep2020,1
809,"So I (20M) am currently enrolled in school full time. Because of covid, I am now doing online classes. I had the option to live on campus, but decided to come home and continue school. Now that I'm home, I am really regretting coming back. On one hand I don't have to pay the ludicrous on-campus prices (off campus housing is scarce as well) but on the other hand being home is so so stressful. I love my mother and my siblings but now there is so much pressure and constant yelling just like when I was in high school and I absolutely hate it. In high school I was very depressed because of this unintentionally hostile climate and stress and my junior year and senior year of high school I felt suicidal. I know that i'm not the only one because two of my siblings who currently don't live at home were also diagnosed with depression as well as my mother and perhaps one of my younger siblings. I understand my mom is trying to take care of my siblings but the constant yelling is grating and I can feel my depression starting to set back in.

My mom is working full time as well as trying to do school and is struggling to keep up with those things as well as take care of my siblings. Often times no one cooks dinner and grocery shopping is extremely infrequent and my siblings hardly have the initiative to feed themselves. The house is a mess and I feel like they are barely staying afloat. Two of my siblings are in high school, but they are really struggling. They are failing classes, always late to school, missing classes, and one of them is a junior and can't really read or write. On top of that, their schools are now in person and I am worrying about them contracting covid because no one in our state is taking it even remotely seriously. The junior has also been caught smoking weed and drinking multiple times, and has been caught drinking by them self which maybe is indicating a drinking problem. 

My mom and also my dad (whom we live with every other weekend) are saying that I should start working but I'm not sure how well I would be able to juggle that and school. When I was on campus I was never expected to get a job because I was focusing on school and did some odd hours with a work study but now they are being very insistent. My mom wants me to start helping her out financially because she no longer gets child support for me from my dad since I graduated high school which I feel is fair. My mom has been telling me about all the things going on within my family and it's stressful and overwhelming. My dad who makes good money is refusing to pay medical bills for me or my siblings even though we are on his insurance and he claims us on taxes, every-time my mom brings this up through text or email he ignores her. My oldest sibling has a drinking problem like my dad and hasn't really been working in months, they say they are self employed but i'm worried they're doing sex work or something. No shade to sex workers, but my oldest sibling has mental health issues like depression and doesn't get checkups or doctor's appointments because of the previously mentioned dad not paying medical bills.

The other thing that bothers me is that all of my friends and my girlfriend of eight months is living by my campus about 5 hours away. i'm worried that if I stay at home I will be consumed by school, work, and helping around the house and won't even be able to visit. I suppose i'll be saving money but i'll also be pitching in for groceries and things like that so I'm not sure how much i'll really be saving. All semblance of a social life is far away and continuing on this current course seems bleak and depressing. On the other hand I would hate to leave my mom to have to wrangle my brothers as well as school as well as working, and I wish my dad would be more involved financially and emotionally but he hasn't been my whole life so I am not going to expect him to change his ways. I feel obligated to help her and would feel bad leaving but she said she would understand if I did.

&amp;#x200B;

 But what would you do in this situation? I think that maybe I'm just overly hesitant to work while also doing school, but I would like to see my girlfriend and friends more than once every one to two months minimum. 

Also sorry if i'm just oversharing or ranting in the wrong subreddit haha. Any advice or thoughts are appreciated :)",01Sep2020,1
811,"So almost a year ago, I had my antidepressant medication switched because it wasnt working. Sometimes, you can have a bad reaction to antidepressants, and it can make your depression much worse, and cause suicidal thoughts. I unfortunatly had a bad reaction, and it didnt help that my only friend left to poland for university, and that i had no friends at school. I kept telling my mom how much I was struggling, I cried nonstop, to the point where I cried constantly in school, which made people avoid me more. I told my mom multiple times that I needed to go to the hospital and I felt unsafe, she had told me to ""wait it out, it will get better, you need to stop having your constant little pity party."" after three weeks, I still was beyond suicidal, and couldnt take it anymore. I overdosed on all of my antidepressants. My mom found me and screamed that I ruined my dads birthday, and how I was a terrible daughter.

812,"My grandpa passed away this year in January, and the most notable thing he left behind was a property valued at roughly 1.6 mil, or something like that. According to my dad, korean law dictates that what should happen is that once sold, it should be divided among my grandmother, mother, uncle and auntie. This part isn't really the important part, so I'm not worried about whether this is accurate or not. Basically the estimation is that my mother should(?) inherit in the ballpark of 400k.   
My uncle lived with my grandpa in the last parts of his life. My aunt also, living in the same country, helped take care of him despite being in a different city.   


My mother and I live in the United States, so physically being there was kind of an impossibility for us. To my knowledge, mom has sent over money for support over the years and regularly called.   


My uncle seems to be getting the majority of the inheritance, and giving my aunt and my mother the approximate sum of $50k each. (This is a proposal, as the property has not been sold yet.)   


My dad is a little outraged about this, and I kinda understand why. A hypothetical 400k would be an improvement for our personal lives. ""I don't even need the full amount, it's just unfair to me and (Aunt) that we would inherit a split 100k while (Uncle) gets 1.3m!"" (Uncle and his family live with Grandma so their finances kinda blob together)   


My mother doesn't want to raise a fuss, she doesn't want to bring lawyers into this and fight over the inheritance.   


My dad thinks we should fight for it, and even take a smaller cut to compromise with uncle, suggesting that we give Uncle 100k and Aunt 100k of our hypothetical cut.   


An inheritance like that would ease college payments and rent in the future and take care of bills and things for us, but not taking it wouldn't kill us either.   


Should I let my dad rope us into a legal inheritance fight or should I support my mom in her endeavor to keep the peace?",01Sep2020,1
813,"This post is long but I really hope that someone reads it because I can really use advice. I am a 23 yr old female. When I was around 5 or 6 years old, I heard my parents have sex one night. One night turned into so many that it was like I had an automated clock inside me that would wake me up when my parents were about to have or were having sex. It went on for about 6 years. We lived in a two room house so my parents had their own bed and i had mine but in the same room. In that time span, I discovered masturbarion and porn. At around the age of 8. Ever since then I have not been able to stop masturbating. I have had a couple of sexting encounters with guys but just through text, never met in person. In 7th grade I did let a guy grab my butt and in 8th grade i had my first bf. Our relationship consisted primarily of sexting and nothing more. Since then I have never had a bf and my masturbating addiction has not been able to stop. Ive never told this to anyone or my parents. The longest i went without stoping was 2 months but I went through some problems and I turned to masturbation because it gave me a feeling of relief. Before i get the urge to masturbate I get like these flashes and thoughts in my mind of what i have seen and heard and then I start to masturbate. Ive never been with a guy but i am afraid to because i am terrified that i will like it and will not be able to stop. I dont have anyone to talk to about this. I have been struggling to find out what i want to do with my life. I have tried different jobs like desk and working in the sun but I cant seem to stick to one.

the main source of these thoughts is a teacher of mine. he berates me (and the whole class) by calling us stupid, shitheads and just generally calling us dim witted. he even encouraged the students who havent made up their minds about their life path (I'm in my second to last year of middle school) to commit suicide and gave detailed instructions on how to do it.

I dont know if I'm just not resilient enough or I'm just easily affected but it seems like I'm the only person in the class taking these insults to heart. all my classmates seem like normal, fine students while I'm here stewing in my own sad, pathetic thoughts.

im doing alright in school, in everything except the above mentioned teacher's class. whenever we get an answer wrong or dont answer quick enough, we get a ruler struck to our palm. I dont think this is normal.

Ok, so picking up from where we left off, basically we discovered each others’ ages, and we were kind of like “ok that’s weird” I thought that was where our communication was going to be end. But last night, I went back into his live, which idk if I should’ve done. I mean, I enjoy talking to him, but as long as it’s not going outside of platonic territory, we should be good right? and after the live, he private messaged me and we started talking, just goofing around and cracking jokes as usual. And at the end, he said “for what it’s worth, I enjoy talking to you” and I basically agreed. Cause it’s true. I have so much fun talking to him, it’s so easy with him. BUT now I am just skeptical. Like he knew I was 19, and he took the initiative to PM me. And I’m just wary bc I know the age gap, and I don’t want to be taken advantage of. Also, it’s just like, are there no other women his age around him who can joke around with him? Like is he trying to make me feel special to take advantage of me?

So this is the first serious relationship I was ever in and we were together for 10 months. After being together for 7 she had to move away due to college. After that everything went downhill. I didn’t like that our relationship became long distance but I was so infatuated with this girl so I wanted it to work out. Those last 3 months we fought so much and it was always my fault for being insecure. So one day we fought and she said she a had enough. She told me our relationship would be different now and I’m not sure what she meant at the time but she immediately started flirting with other guys on social media. I was in so much pain since this was my first serious relationship. I told her I wouldn’t be able to handle the pain of seeing her with other guys and not be able to do anything about it. This is where I fucked up, I told her the pain was too much and I might end up ending my life. I did feel like doing it in the moment but I knew I wouldn’t go through with it. She ended up blocking me and then and there I knew it was over since she never blocked me even when we fought. I felt like being an asshole since she was hurting me on purpose by flirting with other guys so I changed my phone number and deleted all my social media so she wouldn’t be able to contact me anymore. A few days later she texted my mom asking her if I’m okay but I told my mom to never respond to her. She still texted my mom every few months and I’m pretty sure she thinks I ended my life. So that was last year and I’m still hurting over her. I’m not sure what I feel when I think of her but i think it’s guilt? Should I text her and tell her I’m okay? I don’t know what to do. I feel like even if I text her the pain that I feel won’t go away.

So this is the first serious relationship I was ever in and we were together for 10 months. After being together for 7 she had to move away due to college. After that everything went downhill. I didn’t like that our relationship became long distance but I was so infatuated with this girl so I wanted it to work out. 

Those last 3 months we fought so much and it was always my fault for being insecure. So one day we fought and she said she a had enough. She told me our relationship would be different now and I’m not sure what she meant at the time but she immediately started flirting with other guys on social media. I was in so much pain since this was my first serious relationship. I told her I wouldn’t be able to handle the pain of seeing her with other guys and not be able to do anything about it. 

This is where I fucked up, I told her the pain was too much and I might end up ending my life. I did feel like doing it in the moment but I knew I wouldn’t go through with it. She ended up blocking me and then and there I knew it was over since she never blocked me even when we fought. I felt like being an asshole since she was hurting me on purpose by flirting with other guys so I changed my phone number and deleted all my social media so she wouldn’t be able to contact me anymore. A few days later she texted my mom asking her if I’m okay but I told my mom to never respond to her. She still texted my mom every few months and I’m pretty sure she thinks I ended my life. 

So that was last year and I’m still hurting over her. I’m not sure what I feel when I think of her but i think it’s guilt? Should I text her and tell her I’m okay? I don’t know what to do. I feel like even if I text her the pain that I feel won’t go away. I’ve fucked up a few times and made a temporary Instagram to check on her and every time I do that I end up crying cause I miss her so fucking much. We never had a proper goodbye so should I give her the chance to? Please somebody help me.",01Sep2020,1

I always encourage them to talk about what's bothering them, even if it's hard, it's good to get things of your chest. But I've never been able to open up to them about things that bother me. It's not bc they won't listen, I just can't. I hate talking about my problems, or what I'm feeling (mostly bc I have no idea how I'm feeling) My anxiousness takes over and I panic. 

I tried once to talk about my past with self harm, but I just couldn't, my heart started racing, my mind filled with a million thoughts, the room that was once warm felt cold, I froze and just stopped talking.

827,"I just got this messge recently and it seems that i have to choose between two types of math. Basic and Standard.

If you choose basic, you can go for any subject that doesn't have maths as their main subject in 11th and 12th. and the math will be easy and you can easily score good grades. 

if you take standard, you can go for subjects that has maths as their main subject in 11th and 12th. the math will be much harder and the questions will be high-order thinking type.  

it's just that- i want to take biology as my main subject and i don't know which one i should take. i asked the people around me and I've only got a 50/50 response. Some people say it's okay to take basic maths for biology whereas others say to take standard because it's a safer road and getting an admission in college will be easier. 

i honestly don't want to take standard because i feel like I'm not smart enough for it. but i will if i have to. my friends say  it's better because i will have more choices compared to taking basic math. i just don't have enough self confidence to take standard. I've talked to my teacher and my mother about it. my teacher said it's better to take standard cause it's the safer side. so did my mother as well.

 but I'm having second thoughts about this and when i tried to have another talk with my mother about this, she said to take whatever i want and it's my choice. but if i get bad grades in maths, she will be really disappointed. it felt like i was taking a huge risk. i really want to go for biology or PCB. i don't know which one i should take. please help.",01Sep2020,1

Alright so I’ve (17) been living with my parents my whole life (duh) and things haven’t always been easy. I’m bisexual and my parents aren’t entirely supportive, I’m a leftist in a very conservative home, and I believe I have mental illnesses but my parents don’t believe mental illness exists so I’ve never been able to get anything checked out. 

My family and I are almost constantly fighting as I battle with depressive episodes and bad thoughts quite often and they don’t understand. If I come out of my room things normally get political as my brother finds it funny to antagonize me with his political beliefs and whenever I bring mine up it always turns into an argument or if I stay in my room I get yelled at about how I never do anything and I just sit in there and hate the world or something. 
 
For the past few weeks things have been very tense my mom got upset at me a few months ago and things haven’t been even decent since. I’ve had arguments with almost all my family members that live with me (my mom and my brother) that have ended with them telling me to kill myself, physical violence, screaming matches, etc. I want to leave, I know that I should probably leave but I can’t. I live in the US and am underage so any real living space is out of the question as I don’t have credit and I doubt any of them would do sign anything for me. If I leave I would have to take my dog Alfie who is small but that causes other challenges plus I don’t have a license yet. 

I don’t know what to do or what I can do until I can leave or anything my brother is 18 almost 19 and totally could leave if he wanted to and he is the main problem but I don’t think he will ever leave he has no plans and doesn’t need them as my family backs him up entirely on anything and everything.

835,"I have been in my overdraft since last November. I had my first job from May - October, then the company went bust. I was earning £600 a month and then all of a sudden nothing. That was the most money I had ever seen in my account before. I've been on Universal Credit since then, had one seasonal job over Christmas which just about covered my overdraft and have been unemployed since. I wasn't worried because I had another job to walk in, but paperwork took a while and then lockdown happened. I have been -400/500 for almost a year now, the only relief from overdraft fees I ever received was when banks introduced 3 months free of fees.

I asked for help back in November when I was unemployed and wasn't receiving any benefits, they told me if I entered an arranged overdraft then they would freeze the charges which meant I had to spend more money in order for them to stop charging me between £20-60 a month. I don't pay rent or electric, I live with my Mother and the only direct debits I have are Spotify, Netflix and my contract phone. I've cancelled my gym membership and I cycle where I need to go to reduce transport costs. I spend most of my time at home, alone, because I feel guilty for even buying a coffee. Universal Credit is not liveable. I can't take out a loan to help me get by or to pay for my overdraft because my credit score is utter shit due to just BEING in an overdraft for so long. I can no longer increase my limit and my bank are now refusing direct debits.

I have been applying for every job being advertised in my hometown and have had a couple of interviews but overall no luck, so I am trying to find employment. I want to work so badly, I want to stop feeling fucking suicidal over a fucking overdraft.

Are there any organisations, companies, businesses, charites, churches or ANYTHING I can contact for help with this?

837,"So my friend and I are both in our late 20's. Over the course of the years, she's made all these ""plans"" to make money or make a name for herself. She bought software to become a travel agent, has been writing the same book for what seems like a decade, wanted to be a blogger etc etc. I've always been supportive, in that I say ""Hey do what makes you happy! But it's not going to be easy."" 

As of late she's been making youtube videos. She's been interested in becoming an influencer for a few years now off and on. I can honestly say her content is getting better and I'm proud of her for that. But she's asked me a few times to share her videos on facebook. Frankly, I'm not really comfortable with that. I don't really watch the same content. I also don't think it's that good just yet. I get that everyone has to come from somewhere, but I don't want to stamp my name on something and suggest something to other people that I'm not even into. I haven't made a ""status"" update for many years, with one exception. I try to lay low as much as possible online. 

I don't want to seem *unsupportive* by not sharing the video, but she seems rather intent and sensitive about it. I've honestly thought about sharing the video and making it so that only her and a few other people can see it, but that feels kind of gross.

839,"February 8th 2019. That’s the date I jokingly said to a little friend of mine who’s 5 years younger than me that I’d bury him in a toilet paper fort if I ever saw him in our local supermarket. It’s also the date he thought this was a great idea, and actually showed up to the supermarket to my surprise expecting me to do it.

That was the birth of a great friendship. I now know his mum, his little brothers, his dad is also good friends with my uncle. I’ve also discovered his mum and my mum used to be good friends in high school. For about 8-9 months we went out with each other pretty much every day. Exploring forests, venturing into derelict buildings, having days out to activity parks etc. He was a really smart kid and I love him to bits as a friend. 

One day, towards the end of last year/beginning of this year, he asked me to come out later, to which I said yes. He didn’t text me later, and I was bothered by it. I was being so petty, and didn’t message him to come out again. I wanted to, but didn’t want to put pressure on him to come out if he didn’t want to. As a result, he started running around with other groups of folks from a different area. They got him into smoking, weed, and alcohol. Perhaps even more. I hadn’t seen him since probably the start of this year, and honestly had tried to just forget about him and move on.

A few weeks ago I called him to check up and he was glad to speak to me. He was high, so I politely hung up the call. Another dumb mistake. I’m not against occasionally smoking weed at all, but I’ve seen what it can do to people mentally and financially and choose to distance myself from it as much as possible. This guy smokes it A LOT. He recently spent £150 of his birthday money on it and had it all smoked in two days. 

Yesterday was his 14th birthday. He was down my area on Sunday and due to me being with his brother I was able to go out with him again. We both loved it. Connected like we used to. It just reminded me how much I love the guy (platonically, nothing romantic). He had a lot of fun, and so did I. 

I haven’t been able to sleep at night since. I feel like I really let him down as a friend when I chose to get petty over him not calling me out that day. I feel like his weed addiction (and it is a weed addiction, I’m not trying to bash weed users. My family uses it to help with disabilities etc) is as a result of my younger, immature, flawed character in the past. 

I’ve never spoken to him about how I feel. In his eyes, we just drifted apart. He actually told me on Monday he’d love to come and explore places again with me and stuff so he’s not disinterested in reconnecting. 

I really don’t know what to do. It’s not my place to tell him what to do with his life or his money, but I would do anything to keep him as a close friend. He’s a really damn bright kid and could go really far in life if he cuts down on his drug and alcohol use.

Part of me is telling me to speak to him about it, at the risk of pushing him further away. This is the part of me that kind of hopes that he is taking drugs and alcohol to fill a void that we could find healthier ways to fill. 

The other part of me is telling me to just let him go, as I had been doing before. He is his own person and is responsible for his own decisions, and id rather have our friendship wither away on good terms than ruin good memories by overstepping my mark. 

Please give me some advice because I am really letting this dilemma get to me and I fear the stress will only get worse if I don’t come up with some sort of plan.",01Sep2020,1
840,"Sorry, this is super long.. Any help is greatly appreciated!!

My boyfriend has just joined the USMC, shipping out this month for MCRD San Diego. This is not a high school relationship - I'm 25, he's 28, and we've been living together for nearly three years. I knew he was going to join the Marines before we were even dating, so this has come as no surprise. Somehow, though, I did not mentally prepare myself enough for these kinds of decisions.. The first thing he did after telling me he had joined was ask me to move down to San Diego with him, and I'm very torn.

* First off, he will be joining infantry as an 0311 Rifleman, and will ideally be in or near hot zones rather than stateside. He signed up to fight for his country and he takes that quite literally. When he fills out his wish list for where he'll be stationed, it'll be 100% as close to active combat zones as he can get.
* Second, my best friend joined the Marines right out of high school as an 0341 Mortarman and my brother has been an airman for 11 years now, so I am no stranger to maintaining a long-distance relationship while on opposite sides of the world. I know it will be different since it's now my boyfriend I'll be maintaining a long-distance relationship with, but still. At least I'm somewhat experienced in this area. It will be challenging, especially since we haven't been apart for longer than a week at a time since we met, but it's nothing we can't handle.
* Fourth, because I know that (if this post gets any responses.. fingers crossed..) someone will probably ask: we have no plans to get married, and no plans to break up. We talked about the former and neither of us likes the idea of promising to spend the rest of our lives together just for the perks of being a military spouse. His four year enlistment is no time at all compared to spending the rest of our lives together.. We're committed to each other, and after watching both of our parents' marriages implode in spectacularly horrific ways neither of us feels any pressing need to sign some papers and wear a ring to prove we only want to be with each other. If we ever decide to get married, it will not be because he joined the Marines. As to breaking up, we had a brief and decisive conversation that it's off the table.

With all that in mind, here's my dilemma: I obviously want to be with him wherever he goes, but that is out of the question if he gets his wish to be overseas for the majority of the next four years, so does it make sense for me to move to the San Diego area with him?

* He'll be at MCRD-SD for 15 weeks (2 weeks quarantine, 13 weeks training) with no contact aside from letters, then moving up to Camp Pendleton for nine months of ITB. He gets weekends off, unless someone in his platoon screws up, in which case everyone is punished.. He'll be with a bunch of 18-year-olds, chances are he won't have more than ten weekends off in those nine months. After that he'll most likely be stationed overseas, and likely for 6 to 18 months, if my friend's time in the Marines is any indication. And it could be that he'll come home for two or three months before leaving again for another 6 to 18 months.
* All of our family is here - we typically spend our Saturdays with my family and our Sundays with his. More his choice than mine.. His family is great, but mine kind of drives me crazy. I don't really have a big problem with leaving them behind for a few years (we're from the Seattle area, we are not sun-and-sand-loving Southern California people and will definitely move back to this area when he's completed his four years of active duty), but the idea of having no support system down their is a bit scary to me. His grandparents (who raised him more than his parents did and sometimes forget that he's not biologically their son) live most of the year in Arizona, so they would be somewhat close by and happy to help out if I needed them, but five hours driving is still a good distance away.
* My job isn't a concern for me, at all. It was a great position until the pandemic hit, and now I seriously spend more time playing solitaire than working (I *was* the trade show planner for the 20+ conferences we used to participate in, before all in-person shows were cancelled for the year and probably most of next year too). If I move I'll have to find a new job down there, which is a pain but at least I'll be less bored.

I just signed a year-long lease on a new apartment (literally two days before my boyfriend swore in, so annoying!) so I have a year to decide, but I'm going to need that time to wrap my head around things and start making plans either way. I'm not afraid of moving to a new area, or living there alone, or any of that. It's actually something I've wanted to do since middle school, so the opportunity is a welcome one! But Southern California would not have been my first choice.. It would be closer to my last choice, really. Is it worth it to move there, just for the chance to maybe see my boyfriend on weekends if he isn't sent overseas right away, and to be here when he gets to come home? **Any and all input is welcome!** Unless you're a jerk, then go away, nobody likes you.

842,"I've been feeling pretty lost lately. During my first semester ( CS major student) I had amazing lecturers and I got good grades. I used to pay so much attention in class that I barely had to study before a test and got well above average in most of the tests. Welp, that was my peak. And my grades have been consistently dropping ever since. Now I've lost interest in studying and the lecturers are boring af. I don't like to think that my performance depends on how good the professor is but that's how it is apparently. I can't completely rely on myself when I don't pay attention during lectures. They always teach something which is not shared in the ppts or textbooks (watching a YouTube video helps sometimes but it's not always specific to the course especially when it's subjects like micro-architecture/ digital design and computer organization) . The textbooks my college prescribes barely has any content, so even if I were to read and spend hours understanding the textbook it still wouldn't be enough to get at least average. I've asked people who get good grades on how they study. They just shrug and tell me they study a week before the exam or sometimes just before an exam. I guess they're just really efficient  and smart or they're too embarrassed to admit they study a lot.  When I have trouble understanding something I'm too scared to ask my professors doubts because they sometimes they just refuse to explain it again because ""I should've asked this doubt in class"". I've tried.

I need a 2nd opinion on this. I don't know what I'm doing wrong besides poor time management skills ( Some tips on time management would also help ) or if I'm just straight up dumb. Some of you might say that grades don't matter that much, I agree. It's a personal thing. I want to believe I can do better. I haven't had the feeling of accomplishment in a long time.

Also back in the first semester of my college I had a lot of enthusiasm to learn new things. Now that enthusiasm has died and now spend my time gaming and watching shows.

My parents aren't frugal in any way and are actually pretty bad spenders and I do receive clothes and money for travel expenses, but I don't receive any allowance of sorts and that has been the case ever since I was little so if I want to go out with friends or want to buy something I don't have any other option than asking them for money. Yes I do have savings of my own from gifts I received for Christams and Birthdays and such but I am required to ask them for permission before buying anything with it. And if that something turns out to be something that they deem a waste of money like Video Games, merch, etc I am not allowed to buy it. I have broken this rule a few times though and spent my own money when I hang out with friends and that's when I realised that I actually don't seem to feel any guilt like I usually do. 

The only reason I could think that could cause this is that my parents have always told me that I was pretty demanding as a kid and they wasted a lot of money on me (which I don't remember much cause I was well a kid) so I may have originally started with this habit to make them see me in a positive light but honestly, first impressions die hard and I don't think they see me any differently right now. 

But I'm writing this here cause my birthday is coming up soon and it's been a few years since I ever received a proper gift that wasn't money that I couldn't really spend and I want to change that this year by gifting myself something tangible like video games or anime figurines cause I've always wanted them but was too scared of letting my parents know about it. I have saved enough for it but I don't think my parents will approve of it and even if they somehow do approve, they probably will buy it for me instead of letting me spend my own money which will just make me feel even worse.

So what should I do? First of all I really want to know if it's normal to feel this way cause I don't really know anyone who has the same problem and second is it a way for me spend money on things that make me happy even though they aren't useful or necessary in any way and not feel guilty about it.",01Sep2020,1

857,"First off, this needs some context.

My mum is not a stupid woman, but she can be at times. She had just got out of an abusive relationship with my baby half sisters dad. He would punch her, hit her, and just throw her around like a ragdoll. I was 11 at the time at this was the scariest few months of my life. I think I called the police a total of three times. One night, after a lovely evening of sitting around a fire in my garden, things went south fast and after a lot of shouting back and forth, it ended with me sitting in my room on the phone with the police shaking and crying because I thought he killed her.

Anyway, after a few months of normality, she met another excuse of a person. There are too many to stories to tell so I’ll only say the most important ones. One night, they booked a hotel at left at around 6:30. Then, at 2/2:30 am , the police turned up because they’d found her car upside down in a ditch. Eventually, I found out that her bf forced her into the car after them both drinking heavily and was going about 70/80mph. He then turned to her and said “I’m going to kill us” and swerved off the road.

Another time, I heard my older brother (20) and older sister (17) arguing in the kitchen. I sat at the top of the stairs and just listened and eventually I heard my brother shout “ OUR MUM IS A FUCKING HEROIN ADDICT! ARE YOU OK WITH THAT!?” 

After a night of me, my brother, sister and my mum sitting in the kitchen talking about all the shitty stuff her new boyfriend had done, she decided to end things. But now she’s inviting him round all the time and “trying to move past it all” even though he tried to kill her. My brother is gonna move out and idk what to do. I’m only 14 so it’s not like I can move out too.

There was also a  illegal issue with him that I found out about some time ago which could possibly put me and the rest of my family in danger. 

I still felt guilty yesterday and had sympathy with him after I broke off contact. But after sleeping over it I feel as happy as I could ever be!

860,"I dont know if this is the correct subreddit to put this on but, i need guidance on this or i might screw this chance up forever. For some context, i met this friend through a social app. Randomly meeting her in a public space, we hit it off pretty quickly. At some point, as weird and dumb as it sounds, i ended up actually having feeling for her. I brung it up one time but then she quickly dismissed it because she had a boyfriend. That was fine and cool untill one day, her boyfriend suddenly vanished. She came crying to me about it and of course i was there to help, thats not the problem here but its definitely the build up to the problem. Cause you see, she wasnt really a normal girl. Shes been through the absolute worst shit and i definitely feel that i witnessed her breaking point. She ended up talking about her feeling more and had breakdowns about missing him frequently. And being her friend i helped her. But i was careless, i was so emotional about the things shes been through that i was way too pushy about helping. It wasnt untill later that she told me to stop and of course i complied. It wasnt my place to meddle in her life but if you could understand the sheer volume of pain shes gone through, you'd probably get emotional too. But then after you would think that everything would be cool, but we constantly had falling outs. She would constantly push me away even though i wasnt as bad as before. She would usually bring things up but if i try to slightly inquire on anything, she would accuse me of going back to my old ways. Both saying some things we didnt mean one night, we hurt eachother so badly that we had to stop talking to each other. In the time period we stopped talking i figured it all out. I figured out exactly how to help her, i didnt need to be some psychiatrist, i needed to be a friend. But a few months after we started talking again she revealed the fact that she keeps no secrets with others and tells everyone everything. Of course this didnt bother me cause it meant she was just transparent with everyone. But the reason was to push people out from getting close to her. She said she kept trying to push me out over and over again so she wouldnt get hurt anymore. And then it finally clicked, the reason why she kept pushing me out is because she liked me so much. It seemed insane for me to think this but i asked her it and i was exactly right. She doesnt want to trust any of her friends with her deep dark secrets so she made it so everyone knows everything. She didnt want to be betrayed again like with her boyfriend, so she was harsh to me because of it. I kept overstepping her boundaries over and over again and i was an idiot for not seeing it. She never lets anyone get close, she keeps herself in a tiny bubble. She sees friends as nothing but people to hang out with and nothing more. Keeping all of her emotions bottled up inside and putting on a fake face for everyone. I knew this a long time ago but i just didnt realize it untill that moment. I was a horrible friend. So at some point she cracked, she basically told me that we were never friends and i should leave her life for ever also saying she had no remorse for my feelings. In which in the moment i was sad about but afterwards i completely understood. How can i make her trust people again? To make connections with people? To let herself be vulnerable? How can i fix myself to be better for her i thought? I still dont know. And this weekend i finally got a chance to get in touch with her again. But i dont know what to say. I dont know how to fix myself for her, to be a better friend and a better person. Im a terrible human being and an even worse friend. But i dont want to lose her, i never wanted to.

862,"So this is going to be slightly personal finance related and slightly car enthusiast related, I will try to keep it brief (sorry it's not). Also keep in mind my username which is very accurate, I am constantly analyzing my life and trying to optimize for the best decisions possible, but I am very conflicted about this decision and seeking advice. I often over analyze things to my own detriment and I'm wondering if this is one of those situations where I may regret the decision.

**Context needed to provide advice**

Myself and Fiance (getting married in December) are mid twenties in established careers w/ degrees, with a good financial position all around - well funded retirements, emergency funds, property owners, no unsecured debt other than this car I am talking about (and the mortgage), several thousand dollars of disposable income each month, etc. We are fortunate to be in this position and have frankly busted our asses together for the past 7 years to get to where we are. Kids are on the table but not for a few years so I'm not strictly worried about that yet

I am a car/detailing enthusiast by heart and have had the fortune to own several pretty sweet cars - a few Mustangs, a few regular sedans, plug-in hybrid sedan, electric sedan, and my current vehicles a newer model Tacoma and a newer model Tesla. My Fiance has a newer model SUV as her daily vehicle.

The general intent for me having two cars is so we can use the Tacoma to road trip, transport the hairy and dirty dogs (who we bring everywhere when we can), haul stuff around for when we moved into our house/being home owners in general, and other random things you do with a truck that you don't want to tear up your other vehicles for. Both the Tesla and Fiance's SUV are nicer in terms of appointments so the dogs do not go in those and we keep them clean, nice, and garaged. The Tacoma is in every sense a utility and the Tesla is in every sense a completely un-necessary fun car that gets looks and notoriety and is absurdly performance for the price tag.

**On to the decision**

So I constantly analyze our budget, free cash flow, retirement, etc. I have numerous models of retirement and cash forecasting in worst case and best case scenarios. You get the picture, this is my job at work so it applies to my home life as well. So I was reviewing everything like I usually am and I realized that the Tesla is just extremely expensive without any basis/need for it, especially lately where I am not nearly driving it because I've been working from home.

So basically what it comes down to, is it worth it to me in terms of the dollars I'm spending, to have a separate car that doesn't have dog hair, that fits with my interests and is ""cool"", and provides me a non-zero amount of enjoyment in life. For some reason when I was reviewing the budget this time it dawned on me - maybe not.

I raised the issue/idea of selling it with Fiance and she looked at me like I was an idiot, saying that the car is basically the only hobby or interest I have that I spend money on (not entirely accurate, but in terms of dollars spent on other things, quite true) and that if I sold it I would be sad and I would just buy another one later. This could be true, I don't know, I've owned a lot of cool cars in the past. At the end of the day it's not like I have a plan for the money I would save not having it - we would just have more money which would partially go to random things we need here and there and the rest would probably just sit in a savings account.

Side comment I have a bit of a mild obsession with keeping things clean (I don't want to call it OCD because it's not nearly as bad as real OCD and I don't want to undermine the meaning of that condition for people who really have it). So I do occasionally get stressed out about driving the Tesla in the rain or weather where it gets dirty inside or outside - or when sunscreen gets on the interior (oh god why) etc. I've always been like this and I think its one of the reasons I'm mildly OK with selling it is because I don't have to care about the Tacoma being clean or dirty - it just is. However, if I'm going somewhere nice or to work, not having to deal with dog hair is super nice as well and if I was only driving the Tacoma everywhere that would be a consideration.

**So what the hell do I do?**

Basically this. I've over analyzed this to the max. I'm so conflicted. I have the car listed on Facebook marketplace and tons of people are interested in it. I don't want to lead them on if I am not really wanting to sell it. I don't know what to do and I don't know what's reasonable. Please ask me questions and pick my brain and help me acquire a bit of sanity in this decision.

And finally, yes I know this is a truly first world problem - we give back a fair amount of our time in our respective professions in terms of volunteer hours and philanthropic activity, and will continue to do so, so I hope you all will understand the situation and how I'm just looking for help making a decision and not necessarily to have comments made that aren't constructive towards the intent of my post.",01Sep2020,1

The thing is that I just saw those people at university and at parties.

It sound rude but I think that the best thing to do is talk with them about it but I don’t know how... I don’t want to hurt them and I enjoy doing small talk with them during classes but nothing more.

866,"I was ghosted by a very close friend of mine last year. I won’t go into detail about what caused the fall out because I’ve come to terms with it. However, after thoroughly reevaluating our friendship, I realized that it’s possible that she was not friends with me the way that I was friends with her. 

I say this because, for one, she would vent to me alllll the time about things going on in her life and I would also being a listening ear. Some time we would be talking about a subject for hours. I noticed that whenever it was time for me to vent, that energy was not reciprocated. She would be short with me or quickly change the subject. Dont get me wrong, there were sometimes where she would listen but I mostly felt like my problems weren’t as serious to her. 

Another thing is that several of her friends have talked crap about me to her and she ran back and told me everything they would say. It was mostly petty sh*t but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that her friends always felt so comfortable talking crap about me to her. I get that you can’t control what other people say/do and I also considered that the majority of her friends were messy/petty, but it still never sat right with me. One day, she told me about how she got into it with one of her friends because she was talking crap about me. My friend ends up telling me everything her friend said and I can’t lie, it did piss me off mostly because what she said wasn’t true. My friend seemed pretty pissed off as well. So I decide to message her friend and tell her off. I normally would not do this but this time I was pissed because this was not her first time talking about me. Whenever me and my friend were discussing the situation, I told her that I confronted her friend about what she said. She ends up saying “yeah I would never confront someone about something they said about me because I’m actually secure with myself.” She might not have meant anything by this but it felt like shade. Almost as if she’s telling me I’m insecure because I confronted her friend when, in reality, I know she just didn’t want me to say anything to her. (I could just be sensitive, idk)

Honestly, after reevaluating our friendship, I feel like I was just someone that she used to dump all of her problems on. I didn’t think it was that way at the time but you know how they say hindsight is 20/20.

868,"Hopefully I'm doing this right. TLDR at the bottom.

I live in an apartment complex and my neighbor has two young kids( maybe 3 and 5). He got a puppy for his kids, adorable.

About once a week I see the very young kids walking the dog and hitting it. And I don'tean lightly. Hard enough for it to cry terribly. They hit, drag and pick it up by the neck. The dog can still walk but it's cries are unbearable.

I'm not much for conflict and the adults next door are known for being loud and physical. So I do the only thing I can think of and call animal control. They come, adults deny everything, AC leaves. I call them every time I see the kids beat the dog. 

After every visit, the woman gets on the phone and yells about how she is going to find who keeps calling AC.

I'm not looking for if I should keep reporting the abuse, I'm looking for how to handle the hurt I feel for this puppy. I don't feel animal control will do anything and this is far from the first time they've abused the dog. 

I can cope with the yelling, marijuana smoke coming into our apartment, the police visits when the are physical(never seen or heard them hit the kids), but I am gutted about what is happening to that puppy.

My husband says not to worry, we plan to leave the apartment before the end of this year, and we will be far away from all their drama. But I can't get the thought of that puppy being abused for the rest of it's life out of my head.

We can leave the apartment and get away from the cries, but the puppy is still there. 

My question is, how do I cope with these feelings? I'm a huge animal lover and I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I know that it's not my fault the puppy gets mistreated, but I feel guilty at the thought of leaving the apartment and the dog not having anyone to call animal control when its mistreat it. The guilt and sadness is overwhelming and I often can't sleep.

To be fair, I'm not sure if I'm the only one calling AC. Other tenants might be, the cries are loud and sad and the abuse is in broad daylight. 


TLDR: I regularly call animal control when I see my neighbors kids beating up on their dog(beyond just kids being kids and not knowing how to pick up a dog). Animal control comes and goes.

Lease is up before 2021 and I plan on leaving. I feel guilty that the dog is staying and being abused. I don't do the whole 'out of sight, out of mind' thing well at all when it comes to living things. How to I cope with this immense guilt and sadness?",01Sep2020,1

 Any advice on that please?  Thanks for your time.",01Sep2020,1

877,"Me and my SO are studying at the same university, on the same course. We're doing our second year. During the first years first semester, my SO failed 50% of his classes and was on the verge of dropping out. We talked about it and he made a promise to me, that from there on he'd try more. Next semester he did fail a subject, but it was an extra one so all in all,  he couldn't drop out(to transfer to the second year you mist have passed 75% of the subjects). 

The registration for this falls classes ended at 30.08. on 29.08 I wanted to make sure that i had registered to all of the ones i had to, so i opened the registration page and i discover that i couldn't register for any of the labs because they were full. Afraid that my SO had the same issue, i asked him to check his courses ASAP. He did that and discovered indeed, he did have the same issue. I decided to write to the uni to get it fixed and told him to do the same. He agreed. 

On the 31.08 we were chilling together, when he gets a call from the uni. Turns out, he hasn't passed all the courses from the spring. There was a difficult one, where he passed the exam and lab work, but some tests online were not done, so he couldn't pass. He calls the professor who tells him that he has 2 weeks to finish those and then he may pass. But there is an issue with that - the uni wanted him to go to from full-time student to half-time student, because otherwise, they might have to expel him.  So  i help him send the form and everything where we could write down that he wanted to take all of this years falls classes and some from last year, that he failed. As it is one of the most important things in our lives, i hoped that he had checked his e-mail the next day.  Turns out, no. I had to do that and the uni wrote back suggesting that he takes a break for the entire year and not those classes. 

Besides that, i also find out that he did not register to all the classes that he could have on the 29th and was hoping that the uni would just fix it....

It feels like he doesn't even care if he drops out to me and it makes me super stressed, because he pushes everything to the last minute and the is all sad when things don't work out. I don't know what to do, how to even deal with this. Every time we tried to talk about it, i get so angry because of his apathy and saying that he doesn't want to drop out.  I have asked him, why didn't he just do it when i told him to and he just said that something else was more important. I started to wonder, what if the doesn't even want to continue his studies, but to that he said that he does and he likes what we're studying. How should i deal with this?",01Sep2020,1
878,"I apologise if this is not relevant to this sub, but I needed to talk to someone about it since I feel so miserable now. I always wanted to but an air-rifle and I checked few websites to buy online, the prices had huge variations. So I went to a nearby local store, turns out he was my Dad’s friend. He showed me a few rifles and I liked one. He sold it to me at ₹11500 telling me that he had discounted it since my Dad is his friend. 
I returned home and checked the rifle online for some reviews, and found out it costs ₹7000, which is significantly lower than what I paid.

879,"My beautiful baby boy is currently living with my friend. I want him back but idk if it's possible. **TL;DR: I miss my cat, but I live with my partner and my cat is a raging asshole to his cat so I gave up my cat. Nothing has worked. Will I ever have my baby back?**



7 years ago I adopted this cat. At the time, my ex and I were living together and already had 1 cat about a year old. These two cats got along fine. A couple years later we added a third kitten who did not get along with the two cats but passed away shortly from FIP. A year later we get another third cat. These cats get along fine. We even moved homes after the third cat and they still got along fine in the new home.


My ex and I broke up and moved out. He took the oldest and youngest cats, and I took my baby boy.



Fast forward and now I live with my partner. He has a 6 year old female cat. She came from a place with lots of cats but has been living as the sole cat for many years with my partner. When I moved in with him, I brought my cat. Hell ensued. My cat is apparently a giant asshole. He constantly seeks her out and attacks her. For a while, peace was achieved when they established separate territories in the apartment. She stayed in the kitchen and washroom, while he stayed away from there.



Then we moved into a house. Nowhere was safe for my partners cat anymore. My cat would find her and attack her constantly. We couldn't do this. So made the choice to give up my baby boy. No way could I live with the guilt if my partner gave up his cat. A close friend of mine offered to take my cat. I visit sometimes, but it's very painful for me.



Is there anything I can do? I just wish our cats could coexist in peace. We tried slowly introducing them through closed doors. We tried feliway and calming treats. We've scoured the internet for answers, consulted a pet trainer. We've tried everything I can think of.



I miss my baby.",01Sep2020,1
880,"I feel terrible for running towards something.

For the past three months i’ve lived at home and I haven’t felt this depressed in years. Every other day I feel suicidal, I hate everything and just want it to end. I’ve officially reached my goal of money saved to be able to move. I finally did it and it’s made me happy and excited beyond belief. I’m looking forward to moving out of state and leaving it behind.

But, I feel extremely guilty and upset with myself that i’m leaving family behind. I’m from a really small town and have an even smaller family so it pains me so much to leave my mom and family. My plan is to leave next weekend but my uncle is having a celebration for his new child that I would have to miss which I feel like would make him upset with me. I have a “celebration of life” for a friend that passed before that. And I know I could just wait but i’ve put it off for so long that I’ll just keep finding excuses to stay and then eventually settle on never leaving because if there’s one thing i’ve found myself to be good at... it’s making excuses.

Leaving my hometown is something that makes my heart explode with joy when I think about doing it. I can finally leave the constant negativity that comes from people around me. I can finally leave and become who I want to be. I can finally not be this shell of a person I once was but at the same time, I feel like I have a responsibility to stay and try to pick up those around me and provide for my family because there’s so few of us at the expense of pretending to be who they want me to be.

We were getting a few new employees around this time and one of them was a very attractive girl I had seen during her interview. Since I was quitting, I thought that I should ask for her snap and see if I would have the confidence to do something like this in the future (I have a long history of being rejected and my self-esteem is almost non-existent at this point). I had no expectations but I ended up getting her snap. We talked and we actually have a bit in common. I later asked if she would wanna hang out and get ice-cream and she said yes again. Now, as I said, I have virtually no self-esteem. I basically asked her out on a date making it clear that I wanted to hang out so we could get to know each other better and see if we were compatible and the fact that she said yes made me ecstatic. I've been talking to this girl for about two weeks and we've barely gotten anywhere in terms of the date. She does seem vaguely interested but she also takes forever to ever respond to messages. I asked her if she would be free this weekend and she said she had plans for her friend's birthday.

885,"My college BF of 2 years is my life pretty much. We were so happy, fell in love fast, are inseparable. No cheating and little fighting, always spoiling each other and trying to meet up as much as we can. Things have been off, mostly due to his anxiety, for the last 3/4 months. I became a therapist to him basically and it felt horrible after a while. His OCD made him confess any bad thoughts he had in general, even ones about doubting his love/attraction for me/ being worried he found someone hotter or that my Snapchat score was too low at 115,000, I could go on. He refused to get help because he can handle it himself etc. He has always made it clear it was OCD and it sure matches anything I've read on it. 

2 weeks ago I started crying after a phone call with him, over yet another thing he confessed about doubting me.  I thought  ""holy crap, the right guy wouldn't make me cry like this"" and boom, I've been wondering if I could do better for the last 2 weeks. I feel so bad about it. This isn't the first time his OCD has reeked havoc, it did for 2/3 months last summer and I'm still not totally over some of rhe stuff he said.  I feel like it might be easier to start over with someone new, maybe a year from now or something? I just can't imagine him not being in my life anymore.

888,"I have a very small but close group of friends- around three people. We have known each other since we were five years old, and now we are high school seniors. We know. EVERYTHING about each other. 

But throughout this summer, I think I’ve developed a sudden crush on one of my friends, D (17 F). This experience was really strange to me because I’ve always seen D as one of my best friends and nothing more. 

But lately, whenever we are alone I just want to kiss them and always want them to touch me.. and they seem to like it? 

These feelings bubbled last night when my friends and I had a fire pit- and suddenly me and D were alone. She put her arm around me and I just kind of hummed into her embrace.. I said I loved her hugs and then she asked why. I wanted to kiss her right then and there but.. instead I scooched away like an idiot and didn’t get close for the rest of the night. 

When I got home, I had some time to sort through my feelings and realized that this relationship wouldn’t work. She’s so nice and I’m just kind of a urchin.. in addition, being friends isn’t the same thing as being a couple.. So If we get together and things go sour, I could risk breaking up my entire friend group and loosing her as a friend... I feel like it would be selfish.

But I don’t know what to do with these feeling at all. They are chewing me up inside and making me act stupid.

So:

Do I just spill my guts to D and see what she thinks? 

Or do I be responsible and just keep this to myself for the sake of her and the group??

897,"
(Sorry for my juvenile way of typing, I'm a bit upset) after purchase, my bus was towed to hillside auto. I needed the brakes checked and fixed , so i could get the inspection and registration. They had it for 6 months. No calls, No answers. FOR 6 MONTHS!!! 

After calling none stop I finally got an answer, 3 weeks ago. I asked the lady that answered, what was the status on my bus. (The only bus on the lot) and she replied, ""what bus?"" When I said the bus thats been on your lot since before quarantine started and told her when it was towed in. but she needed to call David and ask, he deals with the tows. 

she would give me a call back... NO CALL BACK. 

after another 2 weeks of calling, I finally get an answer. Same thing. She said she would call me back.

 And she did 2 days later. Now she told me the break issue was also transmission issue and my tire needed to be replaced because it was flat. (Something I already brought it up in a voice-mail) But I was hung up on the transmission. breaks and a tire, won't break my back. But a new transmission might..... 

She couldnt specify if it was the entire transmission, or a leak or part, a tiny rebuild or whatever the fuck you can do with a transmission. 
I know nothing about cars so I wanted to atleast google it.I asked for a code from the reader. She told me there is no code. My 2007 coverlet bus is too old to be OBD II compliant, so no code. The reason they know I need to work on the transmission was because, it won't go in reverse. 

Mind you, they had to pit the bus in reverse,  twice. 
In order to get out of the tight parking spot, (but I know nothing, maybe it was an issue even then) I mentioned that, she said she didn't know but she could give me a call back. Before she could hang up I asked for a price. She didn't know, they need to find the part. It's been a few days, still no call back.

I'm ready to sell the thing. I'd rather lose money then give anything to them. 

I really though it was going to be a good buy. my uncle was in town at the time, he checked it out for me. he's not a mechanic, just really old and likes to fix cars. He said it wasn't making any odd sound nothing on the dash( except the brake light) started smooth, ran smoothe.even checked the breaks a few times. Told me it felt like I just needed to bleed the breaks and I might have a faulty speed sensor. since nothing else felt off,after a few rides around the block.

 I feels completely defeated. Idk what to do. This exciting adventure I was finally starting has turned into a nightmare. I should have just bought a van. If i did, I probably wouldn't have had any issue driving it, or have an issue towing it, or finding another ducking mechanic to work on it.

905,"I [m] really like my [m] best friends sister [f], we're both the same age (26), talk often, and go places together occasionally. 

I know there's multiple ways you can like someone, not all relationships involve romance, emotions, friendships or ""click"" the same way. Yet the events of the past week have been quite, ""different"". 

Let me summarise:

* We went shopping together for a food and drinking night at her parents place, which involved her friends and my best friend (her brother). We cooked dinner together and were all hitting it off greatly. She and I shared some deeper secrets with each other when we were alone during the night. Hugged a lot and were just happy to be together, and expressed that to each other. She told me she was trying to pick up dating again with apps like tinder etc, and that it wasn't serious. She's looking for casual fun, to explore and recuperate from a previous relationship that had quite an impact


* The day after we ate dinner again and watched a sad and dissapointing movie, I went home after cause we were hungover and tired from the day before. Spoke about the movie the morning after that she had nightmares about it.


* We met up later that week, she wasn't feeling her best but I had invited her to come with to eat dinner and play some games with two of my friends. She was happy and excited to come with and we had a blast that night. She was also talking about the dude she was sort of dating and that she saw red flags, was asking me for advice, and said she wouldn't feel at ease discuss this with anyone else really. It was kind of weird to me, but okay, I just told her how I would deal with the situation. Later that night I said to her and my friends that I was going to look at a house that's for sale, showed pictures and she said enthusiasticly that she wanted to come with so that I did not have to be alone and 4 eyes see more than 2. I found that sweet and strange at the same time, but okay. I told her she didn't have to come with a couple of times during the week.

* Monday came by, the day I was sighting the house. Told her again that she didn't need to come. She said she wasn't sure about being able to come and she maybe had to move plans, but that she would try to come anyway. Again told her no worries, I don't mind and  just appreciate the gesture. Later she called and she said she'd surely join me. We went and had a blast looking at the house, she made some comments about her not minding faking being a couple, as long as they didn't ask outright. We made some jokes afterwards about her moving in cause there's plenty of place. 

* Then later today we met up again to drop of some stuff and just talk a bit. She told me she stopped seeing the one dude and was going on a date with someone else tonight, and was kind of making a few slight jabs at me but nothing offensive. Afterwards I felt a bit sad, but that's mostly because I think I now know for sure that she's not into me.

Let me preface that I know pretty much the only way to be sure is to casually ask her, face to face, whether we only click as good friends or if there are potentially romantical feelings from her side as well. I have asked girls out before, I have had crushes and feelings before, but those times the signals were more obvious either way. This time I'm honestly confused and that makes me less confident in myself, and therefore I might act differently from who I really am, which scares me.  

Anyway, sorry for the spastic ramble, I am not good with this at all. Just wondering what a stranger on the internet thinks. Thanks in advance.",01Sep2020,1

I’m figuring it out with long term partner now so of corse I don’t have contact with the new person any more. However I can’t seem to stop having dreams about them, and it’s making me feel guilty.

My neighbor tried to help yesterday by putting them in a hole, I think it was a bad idea, because one of them was dead in the hole. I think he made it too small.

They tried contacting the right people, and they said just to wait until the mother has came back. We found more droppings today, not seen the mom, and two of them are dead.

916,"So for context, I met F (crazy ex boyfriend) on reddit back in April of this year. At first, we started off great and eventually I learned about his issues with depression and suicidal thoughts and being the caring person I am I wanted to try and help him through this. I was patient with him at first, given his history but eventually the constant talks of cutting and suicide started affecting me and I relapsed. I didn’t tell him this because I didn’t want to upset him, but eventually he found out and we started having occasional arguments. So eventually stuff calmed down and for some reason I developed a crush on him and on July 2nd, we started dating (at this point I was still in a relationship, but it was open.) The first two weeks of our relationship was really great, I felt happy with myself and happy that F was happy, until about three weeks into the relationship he started to turn again. Started talking about suicide and depression again and I decided that I had enough, so on July 19th I cut him off. I ghosted him. Now this probably wasn’t the best way to break up with him, but I just couldn’t take the strain it put on my mental health and I realized how toxic he was (sidenote: F lives in North Carolina and I live in Maryland, he knows my old address and the school I attend and my phone number.)

So onto what happened yesterday/today. So today, I got a message from the ex I was in an open relationship with in July (I’ll refer to him as E.) E messaged me today asking if I had a good afternoon and what not, but eventually he told me to check my discord messages (this was how I was communicating with F before) and I told E that I had made a new account to completely separate myself from F, well I tell E my new discord tags and he sends me a long message written in morse code which said, “YOU HAVE FUCKED UP. YOU BROKE ME. I CAME TO YOU WHEN ALL WAS LOST. WE LOVED EACH OTHER. WE TRUSTED EACH OTHER. NOW, IT IS MY TURN TO GET WHAT I DESERVE. TOO SEEK REVENGE. PREPARE YOURSELF. THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WILL BE IN FEAR. SEPTEMBER  15TH, 2020” saying it was from F.

918,"Some background. S (16F) and I (16F) have been friends since 1st grade. We've been planning this trip since 3rd grade.

Lately, I've been getting more into planning it, because, well, I have depression. Thinking about travelling is one of the things that's holding me together. 

We're both juniors in high school. I want to go to college to become a nurse, and I'm planning on staying in my hometown (and maybe living at home) so I can a) not have to take out a bunch of loans, and b) save up for our trip. 

S isn't sure what she wants to do yet, but she's always been really excited to live together at some point, as well as being excited for our trip. But she just communicated with me that she wants to take a gap year, or years, after high school. 

I'm totally supportive of this. She's my best friend, and I think it could be really good for her to take a break from school and try and find her path. 

But, I don't know what's going to happen with the trip. Like... I want to take it after college so that I can travel BEFORE I get a job, and so that I'll have saved up enough to do so. But what if she travels during her gap years? What if she doesn't have enough money to go? What if she doesn't want to?

I have such a desire to do things like go to the gym, meet with friends etc but when the time comes, I can barely pick myself up to go.

This dingleberry has literally spent the time and money to go to court just to fuck with me on a personal level due to just doing my job. It’s not going to go through but fml it’s stressful.

To be honest it’s exhausting. I’ve started dreading every single client before I even know them because of course they’re going to be awful. 

And with everything in the news I’ve started thinking that humanity, as a whole, is just selfish, miserable, trash. Which is against my very core of being and I hate myself for thinking that. It’s eating me up inside.

928,"My parents have been divorced for more than 10 years and have been constantly fighting during them. The one who mostly starts these conflicts is my mother, especially if she has a drink and then we all have to listen to her yelling at him.

2 day ago my dad comes into my room and tells me to calm my mother down. Scared to death that something terrible has happened, I give her a call. At first she says that it’s nothing and then she starts going with the same old tune that a child needs a father (my younger sister and dad had a fight and have not talked in half a year), that everyone is constantly blaming her for everything etc. I try to calm her down, tell her that it’s between dad and my sister to sort this out. She then says that I let other people hurt me while my sister doesn’t, that she doesn’t want her to suffer like I did. This really hurt my feelings, but I calmed her down eventually and told her to go to sleep. I thought that was the end of it and I told dad that he should start sorting these things out himself.

The next day I find out that her and dad talked for 2 more hours that night in which the truth was finally unveiled. What she really wanted was for him to sell the house in a week (!) and get 2-3 times the agreed amount. They had in the past agreed that when dad was ready to sell they would split the sum. They are joint owners. My sister sent him a message that she hated him and she would rather have an alcoholic for a father than him. My dad who’s usually the non emotional type just started crying.

The selling of the house would wreck a lot of plans - the dog gets sent to the shelter; grandma leaves; dad rents a room; I have no place to return to for uni holidays; older sister has to move from her flat.

It’s just insane in my eyes. Now dad says he’ll try to make another deal with her. I know that I better be on my best behaviour with my mom until this gets solved or she will refuse to do anything.

She calls me and doesn’t mention anything about the day before. I told her I scored a good deal on a jacket. She said that when I’ve worn it I shouldn’t sell it and leave it for my younger sister, since it’s expensive and my mom is poor.

I said nothing, but that really grinded my gears. She made dad agree on an unreasonable deal( he just wants to be left alone at this point) and still has the audacity to say that she’s so poor and a victim.

I just want to play my part and once they sign the deal for the house, cut her out of my life. She is usually a good person and has supported me, but I can't bring myself to talk to her or look her in the face after I know all this.

Even as I type it out it seems cruel and I will surely not be able do talk with my sister once I do this and angry and tear filled calls will follow. But to me this is the only way to freedom. Is there another way out? What would you guys suggest?",01Sep2020,1

Hi,

I'm here seeking help from all of you. This is my story:

I'm a teenager, who just got done with college and landed a job in a MNC. So I have a weird relationship with my stuttering, sometimes i feel like i don't have it, sometimes it gets to a point where i can't even speak to my friends and i just basically don't initialize conversations and whenever they try to talk to me , I end the conversation quickly in the fear of them making fun.

So sometimes I struggle with stutter, it usually comes and goes depending on the mood that I'm in, If I'm anxious I get stuttered on every single word, and if I'm happy i don't stutter at all. So i began to think i don't have stutter, and I'm stuttering just because of some kind of anxiety. At the age of 10, the school that I studied in Invited a doctor who specializes in Kids, so i went to see him with my parents and he asked me a general questions to see whether I'm stuttering or not and during that entire 5 min conversation i didn't stutter at all, and the doctor said to my parents that ""He doesn't have any stuttering, he stutters because he sometimes try to speak faster than he is thinking"". So then as far as i can remember i never really stuttered for 6 years, then one day when i was in school, one of my friends asked me to go tell a classmate of ours something, and what i did was i kind of iterated what i had to say in my mind, and when i came up to that girl, i fully stuttered. That moment was so frightening. Then from that point on i had few stutter situations, during that time i had a crush on my best friend, and whenever she is around i would never stutter, even on a long lasting conversation. I was really happy, Then when we both went to different colleges, we got into a distance relationship, and i didn't stutter during any of this period. BTW she knows that i had stutter, but she also knew that i didn't stutter all the time. She never asked me anything about it,I was speaking normally most of the time , let say 95% of the time i didn't stutter. And one day everything just went downhill, we broke up, then i later found that she broke up with me, because she wanted to be with a guy who is in her college and that situation made my stuttering worse, i started to stutter every single word, it was bad i didn't talk much to friends, talking on the phone made me stutter even worse and it was a nightmare and it made me depressed. Then when things got better, my stuttering began to fade away, until one of my professors asked me to present a class on a certain topic \[I was a bright student\] and i had to tell him that i couldn't because my classmates would know that i stutter if i stutter during the class, after that incident i was super anxious whether my classmates would find that i had some form of stutter, so i would usually dont talk much, Then i got into a relationship with a girl in my class, and just like before i dont stutter when i'm talking to her, i dont know why, i can talk to her in person, on phone for hours and i dont stutter a single word. And during my job interview I didn't stutter at all as well.

So since my girlfriend doesn't know that i suffer from some kind of stutter i'm anxious to what would her reaction be when she find that out. Also what if i stuttering during job ? I'm super anxious about these things.

If any one of you have read this post this long, then please tell me from your experience whether i have stuttering or I'm stuttering because of my anxiety, I wasn't able to get clear answers from anywhere, i wasn't sure myself either.

Notes: Yes my parents knew that i suffer from this and only few of my school friend know about this and one of my best friend at college, but he said that he didn't notice that i had stuttering ever .So i dont know, Please help me.

Hi reddit. First time making a post that isn’t a meme so sorry if I get anything wrong, I’m on mobile and that’s doesnt help with formatting.

for background, I (15F) am taking algebra II over what our public school district calls non traditional learning. Basically we have live classes on zoom every day and also homework.

I’m applying for a program that allows me to graduate highschool two years earlier than normal for my state. The program is very hard to get into. They only take about 100 people, and many more apply. However, it is not wildly advertised by the state. One of the requirements in the application is a letter of recommendation from a math teacher.  I realized that I should probably let my teacher know well in advance that I’d eventually be asking for a letter of recommendation that only she could give. 

So today after class ended I stayed on the call till around  2/3  of people left and asked her what her office hours are. She says 8-9:30am before school everyday. Okay, good so far! She asks me if I have a question on the work. I say no, but can I send her an email after class? She says that is okay. I say thank you then leave the call. I didn’t want people in the class to know about the program because the more people that apply the worse my chances are.

I send her an email explaining the program and my situation. I talked about how hard it is to get to know someone over virtual learning, and that If it was possible could she write me a letter of recommendation later down the line (I’m talking in november or december) and finally if there is any way we can meet to discuss the situation further.

However, I check google classroom and she has posted a really long message talking about students emailing her.  I included it to help people understand more, but TL;DR she clarifies that she doesn’t want people sending her emails and people need to ask questions publicly.

She posted this publicly around 7 minutes after our class ended in the general class stream, and she still hasnt responded to my email. Nobody asked any questions but me and there’s no class after ours, so it’s pretty obvious it’s about me. I’m so ashamed and embarrassed. I’m not an easy crier so I had to quit my work and go cry in the bathroom for a bit. I understand that seems like an overreaction to some, But i’m easily affected by things like this.[teacher’s classroom post](https://imgur.com/gallery/hJChUJw)

I know it’s probably my fault because I didnt want to explain what the email was about on call, but i’m still so upset. What should I do to fix this? I feel like if I send her an email apologising I just inconvenience her more.  Thank you so much reddit.",01Sep2020,1
937,"I grew up in a tiny town in Arkansas where “fashion” consisted of wearing a t shirt and jeans (with no holes, no shorts, no shoulders, no fitted clothing, no v cut tops, no leggings, and no crop tops because it was considered “inappropriate” at my school). Additionally, i was not wealthy by any means growing up. My clothes often came from the sales rack of JC Penney or Belk (they were the only stores in my area), if I wanted more “popular” clothing I would need to drive 70 miles to the nearest mall where I can shop at Hollister or American Eagle, but my family couldn’t always afford it. 
Now I’m 21, a senior in college, becoming financially secure, and struggling to find what is trendy rather than “basic” as well as struggling to find where to shop. I have never been able to shop anywhere other than typical teen stores at the mall and don’t really have anyone to look up to for fashion advice. 
The “norm” around here is a sorority shirt and Nike shorts or a sweatshirt and jeans and sneakers. I’ve traveled from Southern California to NYC and I am in awe of how much effort people put into their appearance, i felt like a bum because I just don’t know how to dress.
The styles I look up to (aka in my Pinterest boards) can be described as...elegant? Romantic? Chic? Think of silky or flowy dresses in neutral colors, gold dainty jewelry, neutral cropped tops, dainty heels, girly business casual? Can someone help me identify this style with really names and where I can shop (ethical places). Feel free to provide constructive criticism as well as tips for how to shop like an adult with taste and what looks good together, what’s trendy, what I should buy that’s essential, and things to avoid entirely.  
If it helps at all, I’m 5’7, slimmer/athletic figure (small torso with larger thighs), dark and long hair, warm skin tone, and I have green eyes.",01Sep2020,1

Basically are school did Dofe and most of my mates signed up. For some reason at the time I did not really talk to them about doing as I wasn’t that interested but would have done it if I knew they were as obviously they would have made the experience. I did not sign up and the majority of them did. At this time I felt very left out due to the fact it was all they really talked about at school and always met up after school for Dofe meetings leaving me alone after school by myself on Xbox or whatever I was doing. As time goes by and are friendship group has formed into a more solid group all the members even if I wasn’t mates with them at the time have all done Dofe together and my other mates at the time who didn’t do it have left school or become more distanced from our new friendship group. I just feel left out like I have missed a massive part of our school journey and it seems like to me that’s all they seem to talk about. It just makes me really regret not signing up and makes me feel like I’m a less valued part of the group because I missed out on this big thing.

I come back here living with my mom have been here almost 2 months got a slightly better job here but absolutely despise living here as to why I left in the first place. Got arrested again for the same thing as before (misdemeanor again) and now I have the same charges In 2 states across the country from each other.

948,"Hey, all. 

So first off, lemme preface this by saying that I have incredibly terrible social and general anxiety that I am not on meds for, nor can I afford meds for. Even just doing *this* is ridiculously stress-inducing for me, but I just feel like I'm out of options since I don't have many people in my personal life that I can go to for advice, and most of them were either disinterested or were too busy to really sit down and talk to me. 

I got hired to work at a fast food place recently, and today is technically my third day there, since I had Monday off, and I hate it here. I've gone home every day fighting the urge to cry and have panic attacks that force me to pull over to the side of the road and just wait it out for up to thirty minutes before I can finally go home. And honestly, I'm not sure what's wrong because the job itself *feels* like it should be going fine. The managers are nice and do their best to teach and help me and they all understand that I'm new and I just need time to get the hang of things. I just feel more like a nuisance to them and coworkers who are trying to get work done while train me at the same time, which is difficult because, y'know, *fast food*. I don't think I can memorize all of the sandwiches we have to make and it *really* didn't help that they started me on a Saturday, of which is the *busiest* day and I just had no idea what I was doing and just felt like I was bothering everyone and I just apologized a lot over all the noise and the panic of people trying to get food out to customers. I haven't done cashier work yet, but honestly, I would *prefer* being cashier and dealing with Karens then doing whatever the hell I'm doing. It doesn't help that I'm going to college right now on top of being asked to come in every day this week, I just don't know if I can juggle classes with work.

I told myself I wasn't gonna work there for longer than three months, which devolved into 'if I still feel like hot garbage at the end of the week, quit' to I'm debating whether or not to quit when I go in today. None of my coworkers seem to like me much (especially one, whom I went to with in high school and she had this fun little habit of trying to get close to you to learn things about you just so she could spread said things around behind your back) and I just feel like I'm bothering everyone. I already have a secondary job I could apply to right now that's seasonal and would be *much* better on my anxiety than making sandwiches and calling out names and fighting the urge to cry for 6 hours every day. But that job isn't a guarantee. 

I just don't know what to do at this point - I'm tired, and I just want a solution. I don't know whether I should tough it out for a few months and use my (pretty shitty, ngl) pay to finally get on meds for the first time ever, or I should back out now because money is not worth my mental health. And if I were to resign, how would I even do it when I haven't even completed the training? I debated calling, but I have real trouble talking to people over the phone and I honestly don't think a 2 weeks notice would work, since I'm not a fully-fledged employee yet. Or maybe it would, I don't know. I also don't want to make my managers feel like they hired me only for me to be a nuisance, apologize a lot, and then quit because I couldn't handle it. I don't want to quit before I've even started. 

TL;DR: I started my job three days ago and my anxiety has skyrocketed since then and I just don't feel like I can handle it, but I also don't want to quit before I've begun. Help?",01Sep2020,1
949,"I’m an undergrad and as part of my last year of school I’m working with teens at a center. I’ll be tuning programs soon to teach them different things, show them how they can trust adults, and hopefully prepare them to step out into the world with more confidence once they graduate.

952,"So my dog and I are temporarily living with my sister.  We needed a place to stay until my own place was ready to move into.  My sister (let's call her Kelly) and I got brother dogs (Boxers, in case you care), but they're different litters.  We can call the boxers BigBoy (hers) and LittleBoy (mine). 

&amp;#x200B;

LittleBoy has had a number of health issues since I've gotten him, ranging from shitting blood to cysts to severe, self-injuring levels of anxiety.  I have to take him to the vet basically every few months, he's on a prescription dog food diet (Hills ID), and he has medicine for a range of issues that he takes as needed (Pepcid for acid reflux, Tylan powder for gut bacteria, Cerenia for cyclic vomiting, and Trazadone when he's alone to prevent self-injury and to supplement his behavioral training).  

**TLDR: My dog is not super healthy.** 

&amp;#x200B;

When we first moved in with Kelly, LittleBoy had runny shit, and my sister would make a deal over having to hose down the spot after the poop was picked up.  I told her that he just goes through this sometimes, and that with the Tylan powder and his prescription food, maybe even supplementing with raw food, he'd have normal poops in no time.  After a week on the Tylan powder with his meals he usually has normal poop again.  Kelly, however, insisted that the prescription food ""smelled bad"" and that the food she gives BigBoy is much healthier (Hills BioActive, large breed).  ""How can you feed him this garbage?  -just try my stuff.  Just try it.""  I refused, and began buying raw food, which helped LittleBoy's poop firm up.  However, Kelly kept on insisting that her dog food was better, and that I needed to switch over.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a stubborn person, and I've already tried four+ brands since he was a puppy, so I told her no.   
 Additionally, my vet had recommended this one, and they know his health issues.  I explicitly told her no.  This is very important. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, after a couple of weeks, I barely noticed his poop, because it was normal again.  We would normally trade off feeding the dogs, but within the past week she would usually get to the dogs first.  This morning I caught her feeding LittleBoy the food I had explicitly told her not to.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I caught her, and tried to replace it with his actual food, Kelly said, ""OP, you wouldn't listen to me, and I was tired of cleaning up his shit.  You were being irrational.  I've been giving this to him for awhile now, and he has normal shits now.""  

I communicated that I was upset, and she began to get even more defensive.  I didn't want to yell at her, and needed to go onto a zoom call for work, so I just said I had the right to feel upset that she went behind my back and went against my explicit instructions for my dog, and she had no right to tell me I shouldn't be upset.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still upset at her, and she gave me a half-hearted bullshit apology earlier (apologized but still didn't admit she was wrong), but I don't want to give in to her antics.  

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, LittleBoy has been eating this and he's been okay.  The cost isn't radically different than what I normally get for him, and he only threw up once the other day.  His health isn't something to hold grudges over, and I would be a shitty owner to make him suffer just for my pride. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, on the other hand, I don't want to give in and let her to think that what she did was okay, and that I accept her making these kinds of choices in the future.  If I let her keep feeding him this stuff, then she basically wins.  Kelly already has a holier than thou mindset about life, and she gives me advice all the time on things she doesn't need to, and that I don't want nor need (i.e. cooking, clothing, sex, relationships, family, etc.).  She's also given me plenty of flak in the past for how I live my life, the choices I make for myself and my dog, and basically gas-lighting me when it comes to certain past events. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate advice, please and thank you.  

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Despite my explicit instructions and disregarding my dog's health issues, my sister fed my dog a different food from normal, and tried to hide that she was doing it.  Caught her, and now she's saying that I shouldn't be mad because she's right.  The new dog food helped firm up his soft (but not diarrhea) poop.  Should I give in to the new food and deal with her holding this over my head for the rest of our lives, or continue to give him the normal food?**",01Sep2020,1

I don’t like to make excuses but I had a really rough roll of the dice during college as far as events out of my control, including a couple injuries that resulted in me missing a significant amount of class, most of which were “weed out” difficult classes.

956,"So I know during lockdown we have been hitting the markets constantly because we're stuck in our homes all day, so we're obviously inclined to eat (no wonder I gained 9 pounds). Anyway, so I'm korean, and that means we usually go to the korean market to buy our food. Before lockdown, we usually bought some flour, sesame oil, veggies, crackers, and occasionally meat. But ever since lockdown, we've been going ham on the pre made food (similar to how in ranch 99 there is hot food ready and you just need to to-go). Literally my dad buys the same 3 stews, one box of chicken wings, 2 boxes of korean pancakes, 3 servings of bulgogi, and pig intestines (theres more too). They are literally the same every week, and I remember that on Tuesdays we would eat this, and on fridays we would eat that. I'm not at the point of getting sick (bc ngl they're pretty good), but I think if this goes on for another 3 months I'm not so sure. On top of that, like any other asian food, the premade food my dad keeps buying has tons of msg, which is the part that is concerning. I think my family members are going to get sick and seriously experience health problems, and we cant even go to the hospital bc of risk of covid. I told my dad (in an indirect way) that we keep eating the same food every week. My dad says there arent that many options, but I know that's bull because theres no way the k-mart we go to has a small selection.

958,"So I'm 26 and currently out of full time work. I work from home for a little bit of money, trying to build a job for myself from home. I currently live with my Mom. 

My Mom has a husband who is an alcoholic, and has shown no signs of actually wanting to deal with his problem, he's also a very belligerent and angry drunk. 
My Mom understands this is a problem so he hasn't been staying with us, and has been working various jobs around the country. Well, he recently took a job in our home state, and his boss was supposed to provide housing for him, but apparently that housing is not ready. And that it'll take 3 weeks or more for the room to be ready. So she wants him to stay with us for that period and she asked me about it. 

So this is were the problem comes in. I have anxiety and I'm home most of the day for work, and for the occasional interview I've gotten for a job. I've been dealing with levels of anxiety I'm unfamiliar with this year, it's put me in the ER once for a suspected heart attack, I've had bad health anxiety this year, I've been going to the doctor off an on for 3 months throwing stuff at the wall to figure out what is going on with my body, and his presence would cause a spike in my anxiety, and the normal routes I would use to deal with that (going to my local cafe) wouldn't be available because they close early. So I stood my ground, and I said he either needs to get his boss to pay for his hotel or my Mom needs to help me find a place to stay temporarily (probably my grandmother's or my Aunt's) and she said to both of those, but that she understands my reasoning and that she is going to try to take out a loan.

959,"This has all happened within the last month. I can’t use a lot of specifics because of what I do for work, but my ex and I worked for the same company at different locations.

The return to work from COVID was extremely stressful for both of us and he was having trouble controlling his anger. I was feeling really overwhelmed by work and not happy with my situation.

He wanted to take a break but not see other people so that we could both focus on work and he could seek help for the anger problems and I was okay with that, but then he abruptly cut me out of his life completely a couple weeks later with little explanation and I am devastated. 

I thought this man was my soulmate and I am still deeply in love with him. It was incredibly painful and I still cry over it (privately) every day. He had asked me to marry him and we had discussed many plans for the future so I didn’t expect this. We were both respectful of each other and very careful to not discuss it at work or involve coworkers. 

Then I got fired. I wish I could go into more detail, but it doesn’t make sense. My former boss is well known to have a temper and so there may not be any deep explanation but it was also a really painful and stressful event. I wasn’t happy there and immediately got a new (better) job in my field but it still stung and it wasn’t on my terms. I now have a long commute and have to relocate cities. It’s a lot and I was already struggling with the amount of work I have. 

I was barely coping dealing with the heartbreak from these two events, and then a few days ago I totaled my car. It was my fault, I wasn’t paying attention. I think I got whiplash and a concussion, because I’ve been losing my shit ever since.

I just want to sleep constantly and have been out of work for four days. I haven’t left my house. I have been having horrible headaches and brain fog. I should have gone to a hospital but I’ve had a serious brain injury in the past and an intense fear of hospitals. At this point, I’m out of the woods in terms of danger but I can’t think straight or really “wake up” completely. I feel like I’m going completely crazy and it’s just really, really scary. A friend has been helping me and making sure I’m okay but I don’t know how to deal with all the stuff I need to do.

960,"Now to get things out of the way I ama bisexual guy, and I want to paint my nails. I am in high school and still live why my parents and grandparents. I talked to my mom and told her I wanted to paint my nails white or black. She said she would paint my nails and asked why I did;t tell my grandma and grandpa. Well the reason I didn't tell them was that I knew they would judge me so I told my mom not to tell them. At the time I was still heavily closeted you will see why that changed in a second. 

While I was cooking everyone's dinner my grandma is in the living room next to the kitchen and my mom is helping me cook. Out of nowhere, my mom decides to blurt out ""(my name) wants to paint his nails."" Instantly my grandma yells back ""NO, REALLY? COME ON THATS WEIRD."" I gave my mom the death glare to show how pissed I was that she said anything. And my grandma starts putting me down calling me weird telling me I have to move out of the house if I ever paint my nails. Then she started calling me ""gothic"" which is not at all true. 

If you ever met me in person I am a very colorful person. I am a very happy and chaotic person and I don't at all have a gothic look. She keeps drilling into me calling me awful names and just being awful and I just sit there and let her I don't say a thing. I felt really uncomfortable and felt like me being myself was bad and she started making me feel weird. I felt like I was weird for wanting this. But I knew people my age that painted their nails and I know people that get piercings and dye there hair and they don't get harassed and nobody really cares.

She kept drilling into me and I felt really awful about myself and my mom started crying cause she could tell I felt like shit but was just holding it all in. After I cook for everyone I walk into my room and lock the door and start to cry to myself. I didn't think it was that big of a deal but I guess it was. After that, my mom just couldn't bear me getting harassed like this so she outted me. She told everyone that I liked guys and then my mom walks in my room tears in her eyes and she says ""they know (my name) it's ok."" I felt like this was bullshit the overall situation was awful. I wanted to tell them myself I shouldn't have to defend myself for wanting to paint my nails it was just ridiculous.

I felt so bad about myself for no reason. After my grandparents knew I liked guys they calmed down a bit and told me they loved me and they are glad my mom told them.

I brought up that if I was with anyone present or in the past , it’s not there life . He states that he does it want it to be a (insert the last name household) .

How dare he say what he has said, they are not living the life I have chosen and whom I am with .  I’m not sure what I should do or how I should proceed . Should I seek legal counsel ? Should I try to talk to my parents and help with the fear ?

Well there’s this girl in my school that I’ve been knowing for one and a half year.

During those holidays we started going out, and I don’t really know if I can consider those as dates. We had a lot of fun, but that’s it. Actually it’s the first time I’m going out with a girl that I like (I’m 21).

Friday I’ll go out alone with her for the 3rd time, and eventhough the answer might be negative, I think that I’m going to confess my love to her cause I can’t just keep it to myself anymore.

I don’t know if it’s a good idea to confess now but how could I do otherwise in order to get it off my chest ?

Also, I am taking her to her home by car after the date, and I really don’t know how to act in case I get a negative answer to my confession, which is likely. 
Won’t the whole ride home going to be really weird ? Like, I’ll be really sad, should I hide it ? Should I tell her anything in particular ?",01Sep2020,1
963,"Car in front of me slowed down rather quickly so I tried to stop but ended up colliding going probably 15-20 MPH. No insurance claim was filed or police report was filed, I gave the guy my name and number and we went on our way, we had a mutual agreement to not get any insurance or police involved. His car didn’t seem too damaged, neither was mine, he only had a slightly dislodged rear bumper which looked like it could snap back in. Should I be worried? What legal ramifications could I be facing, and how much would the cost be to fix something like that. Side note, what if the claim of personal injury comes up, despite both of us saying we are okay and that there is no police report nor insurance claim on file. Thanks :)",01Sep2020,1

977,"My(23F) dog (9F) has been around for quite some time, I got her when she was about 5-6 and she was abandoned before that. My boyfriend had spent a lot of time with her and things were great. Once I moved out of my dad's house we had to give her away to someone who would supposedly take better care of her but that was a big mistake. The girl we gave her to had 3 big huskeys who had attacked my dog and she is a small shih tzu with 4 healing broken ribs. She ended up living with me (I live with my boyfriend and his family) and things seemed fine at first, she was sensitive and sometimes squealed when she was touched in a sensitive spot and we had to give her lots of meds for the healing process.

It's been about a week, she's doing a lot better and she will be getting her bandages off soon. But the problem is she seems to like everyone except my SIL(17). She winces when she goes near her, or squeals. She is super loving to everyone else, even my SIL's boyfriend who she has known only for a couple of days. My SIL does nothing wrong to approach her, she doesn't pet her anywhere she's hurting and she's very careful with her. For some reason my dog doesn't seem to care about her, but is excited by everyone else and seems to be scared of her and I'm not sure why. I'm not giving away my dog again.

978,"Ive been babysitting for him since i was about 12 or 13, im now 20 years old. He really didnt start paying me till i was about 15 to 16, he had two kids then and would pay me about 10 maybe 15 for always about 5 to 8 hours of work. But even that was always challenging. His first daughter was born blind and is autistic shes super smart! But needs her medication and other needs met on a strict schedule. His son is a amazing bright boy but cant say a word. So it was hard knowing what he wanted or needed somtimes. But i wanted to keep helping my brother as i did with all of my siblings and their children. He even started paying me a bit more when i turned 18, he would pay me $20 for about 10 to 12 hours of work and babysitting. Now to be honest i dont know if its a fair price i dont babysit for a living i just do it to help out my family. But i dont know if i want to sit for him anymore. I love him and his kids but it got to a point where if i said i needed time to myself or i didnt want to sit for him i was the bad guy and i somehow owed him. There was a long period of time where he was getting more breaks from his kids than i was, i would babysit for him all day just to asked to take them for a night so they can drink, something i babysat for a lot with him. I was and am still going threw a lot of stress and depression from giving so much of my life to children that arent mine. I even actually even begining to dislike the idea of having kids or being around them too long. My last straw was when i went to go babysit for him so him and his wife could take ""a one hour walk at tops"" is what he told me. I got there at 5 pm to babysit. He didnt get home till 4 am. And he was drunk. So i stopped babysitting for him. He still asks me all the time. And now it not so he can drink but so he can work. I feel bad for making excuses and saying no but im sick of it. And i dont want to be reeled back into the web of guilt he had me in. But a small part of me still feels like i should help out a be there for him. Honestly dont know what to do. Sorry this is so long. And sorry if theres lots of typos. Kinda at rock bottom with this situation.",01Sep2020,1

981,"They had been dating since January 2019 and I had not met her prior to moving in with my flatmate (lets call him Ben) in September of that year. I had not heard much about her other than the fact she was still in secondary school at the time and that she had come out of a relationship with one of Ben's best mates who had cheated on her and left her with some baggage.

So I met her in the October (lets call her Ava) and it was all fine to start with. One of my other flatmates took a particular shine to her (lets call him Tim) as she had his similar kind of ""humor"" which I just percieve as being mean spirited in all honesty. All in all she seemed harmless, or so I thought.

In a conversation we had about how we came to live together (wed had a lot of drama in signing the leases and such which resulted in a couple of our flatmates dropping out) she piped up to the group and told us that she had basically stalked all of Bens future female flatmates because, and I quote, ""she didnt want him to live with anyone prettier than her."" Now Reddit, please forgive me if im wrong, but does that not sound like her saying ""anon129 is ugly so I dont have to worry about her""? Or am I delusional? And even so the fact that she felt like she had to size up Bens female flatmates online is a pretty large red flag, but I let it slide as I didn't know whether she was joking or not. Big mistake.

Every visit shed make these comments that weren't enough to call her out on then and there, but where just enough to piss me off over time. She asked me how ""my diet was going"" whist I was eating a kfc even though I never said anything about trying to loose weight to her.

She would bang on my bedroom door and demand my hairdryer - I say demand as the girl never once said please or thank you for the thing.

She bought charcoal facemasks and handed me a different branded one saying ""it was because I was already black"" (Im mixed race so my flatmates would ask me for the n*gger pass and make racist jokes which was a problem in and of itself but she obviously felt comfortable enough to chime in) 

One night I was doing my makeup at the table whilst her and Tim were watching TV and about 15 minutes into my look she turned to me and said ""omg are you STILL doing your makeup?"" In such a sarcastic tone that I secretly picked up my last few items and finished it off in the bathroom since it was offending her so much.

She would follow Ben round the flat if I wasn't in my room and I would often find her hiding round the corner of the kitchen door as if she was trying to ""catch us in the act"" even though I have zero interest in Ben and even if I did Id respect the boundaries of his relationship. She would demand that he not shave his beard at any point before she visited as she thought he was shaving to cheat on her with other girls...like seriously controlling stuff.

There were various other incidents such as these staggered over time and eventually I confided in Tim and told him what she had been saying and doing. He completely turned on me, saying that I was delusional and that Ava was just trying to make friends with me. I was kinda shocked he was so quick to defend her considering he barely knew the girl himself and also a little hurt and confused so I resolved to just stay away from her on her visits. 

Recently, during an arguement I had with both Ben and Tim about an unrelated topic, I ended up confronting Ben about Avas behaviour towards me, giving him a list similar to the above about all her had said and done and that I had put up with it for his sake. For whatever reason he decided to send her the messages and gave me an ""explanation"" to each thing she'd done (for example the diet comment supposedly came from him telling her that me and Tim go to the gym together...still doesn't explain why she felt the need to call me out on it)

I also recieved a friend request on facebook off her brother who is in the military but didn't entertain a response to this.

Both Tim and Ben guilt tripped me into sending her an apology and I felt that hard done to I actually passed the phone over to my friend to type out and send as I genuinely feel I owe her fuck all. She accepted my apology and thats the last I heard from her before quarantine.

We are now in our new place for final year and obviously she is going to come and visit in the next few weeks.  I must have physically grimaced in front of Tim when he told me she was coming because he immediately told me I was gonna have to ""suck it up"" since she is Bens girlfriend and has a right to come to his home to see him. 

This has really tested my friendship with the boys but I need to know how to go forward with this. My pride tells me that she basically got away with being a complete and utter bitch to me and I should avoid her when she comes over, but there's another part of me that knows that ive technically made peace with her and should probably move on

Tldr: My flatmates girlfriend has been vile to me and I don't know how to go forward with her.",01Sep2020,1

You can only take out so much money at a time from an ATM so she asked me for help. I get paid in cash and have a good amount saved up. My mom asked to borrow $1600 that she would pay back. I said sure, because it’s my mom and I don’t really have a choice anyways. I never really wanted a dog, but here we are. It’s been over a month and I still haven’t gotten my money back. When I first started asking, my mom said she was working on it. Then, she said that she buys all my food and pays for housing and all the necessities. Then she starts complains about how much I spend on luxuries. I bought some food and a birthday present for my friend. This talk is worrying me that I won’t ever get my money back.

984,"My sister is 18 years old and will soon be leaving to go to an unaccredited Baptist bible college . Problem being, I guess they're not held to strict regulations or something because they're housing 5 people per dorm room, no mask policy, and still filling the church and classrooms at full capacity with no social distancing guidelines. She still wants to go.

She acknowledges that it's potentially dangerous, but says it's more important that she is in a Godly environment than that she's safe from Coronavirus (our dad isn't Baptist and she's been waiting years to go live with people of her religion, but mostly I think she's scared protecting herself at the expense of her Christian education is sinning) . I've tried telling her there are studies that prove it can have long term damage for young people, she could potentially endanger other people as well, I've said all sorts of things but she won't listen. I know these people don't have good medical advice, they once had her drink essential oils to cure a cold at a Bible camp. And she doesn't have good judgment. She did it. This isn't a safe situation for her or anyone else and I don't want her to be a part of it.

I have no authority in her life since I'm her younger sister, all I can do is give her information and hope she will make the right decision (which I believe is to wait until next semester) .Does anyone know of anything that might convince her of how dangerous COVID can be?

I know I shouldn’t let this get to me, but I feel very targeted almost. Like someone has just seen me on their list and gone ‘Don’t care about you’ and hit unfollow. Or what if they’ve heard something bad about me. I’d love to know their reason but asking them would just be weird.

994,"I’m 16M very shy, never had a gf before this all happened about a month ago what should I do?

We went on this trip with my moms friends family and this is what happened

Her friend is also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We live in a different state and I won’t see her again until next summer probably.

A couple days later I DM her on Insta, something I’ve never done before. We talk a little bit the conversation doesn’t last long and we haven’t talked since. I assume she isn’t interested since she only did one word responses but I still can’t stop thinking about her.

995,"Okay, I know that the title is a mess.  But there are two deceased people who I have a deep-seated hatred of because of how they hurt the people that I love.  One of them was my grandmother who was an alcoholic and dragged my parents through the horror that was watching her drink herself to death while they tried to save her.  She died twelve years ago, and they still blame themselves.  I understand that alcoholism is a disease and that people with it can't just stop drinking with the snap of their fingers, but I hate her so much for how much she hurt my parents.

The other person who I hate is more recent.  We used to be friends and had a falling out, but she was still friends with my best friend and dating another friend.  She had severe depression and killed herself a few months ago.  After her death, I found out that she was emotionally abusive to her partner, cheated on them, isolated them from other people, and would accuse them of not supporting her if they didn't agree with her completely and spend all of their time with her.  I was aware that she had this mentality that if someone didn't agree with her completely then they were horrible people who were against her, but it was so much worse than I had thought.  Now she's dead, and I'm so mad at her for how she treated people who I cared about, and I'm so upset that my friend is dealing with this heartbreak over someone who was horrible.

I know that mental illnesses and addiction influence your behavior (though I know that it isn't an excuse for being a terrible person).  I know that forgiveness is good and healthy.

It's been since the start of lock down so this has been going on for months, I just got off the phone to her and she just goes on about it forever, telling me about some new age order, how Trump is the best and is going to save lots of kids from pedophiles. I don't even argue with her about it anymore. I'm in my 20s and don't live with her anymore but my younger brother (17) does. I'm worried with her views and all this stuff she's might be becoming slightly racist. She thinks political correctness has gone mad and culture appropriation is bullshit. She's constantly talking about who is a blood drinking pedo and I can't stand it. Anything I say that opposite Trump is ""fake news"" and how ""they"" want us to think. Im worried some of this might rub off on my brother. She's already got my sister on side. Each time I talk to her I quietly think she's more and more stupid, it's really saddening. I understand she's allowed to have different views from me but some of the stuff is just too far. She believes all of this big conspiracy and I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.

So i train football and swimming, and go to school as i said.

I just dont feel that much organised like before, like i want to rest after school, watch movie after football, i just dont know what should i do in my free time.

I have so many funny and interesting things to do in free time: play UNO, Chess, watch movies or a TV show, go for a walk or a run, meet up with friends, play some games, i also like to edit videos. 

Beacuse of COVID-19(hate that name, i hope it gets dead soon...), i got to much free time and i wanted to test other things like i said. 

I just like lost my daily routines. Morning routine, night routine...

I will now not have to much free time, so i would ask what should i do in my free time? (Of course i know there will be answers, ""do what you like most""..., but its a bit hard to also decide) and can i get one interesting TV show? I like to watch myth things like
Finding bigfoot, like fake things but its really interesting.

1014,"My BF and I have been together 2 years, met first week of college. He's a good guy, he's always treated me amazingly- always wants to see me, calls every night, surprises me with thoughtful gifts, puts in a huge effort with my family. Basically always puts me first. This is why I feel so terrible about wanting to leave/doubting if I still romantically love him- it's not like there's been cheating or abuse just a grinding mental illness. 

Little things that weren't an issue are starting to bother me- like his ignorance of politics and a lot of general knowledge a college student should know, which admittedly is stupid and nitpicking. I just wish he had his own opinion of more things, but whatever, that would be icing on top of the cake. Sometimes, he can be quite immature, he cares way more about what others think than me, kinda like a teenager. He is quite lazy when it comes to college. We are in the same modules/lectures but I will start studying/doing assignments a week or 2 before him. He'll start the night before something is due and I will help him just about pass. 

He can also be a little insensitive. He suffers from terrible anxiety and goes through phases of frantically confessing things to me. He doesn't care how it affects me in the moment, he just wants to cure his anxiety by confessing and that really hurts. He's confessed bad thoughts he had about me and some still hurt even a year later about someone being hotter or sometimes not finding me attractive or me being a loser cos I only have 115,000 of a Snapchat score.  He has apologised over and over and made it clear it was just anxiety but it still hurts and part of me thinks I could never happily marry someone that would accidentally hurt me like this. I've heard like 30 of these and about bad stuff he did in the past. It's a lot.

I feel like such a phoney for the last 2 weeks or so. He'll be excited to meet me and looking for kisses and cuddles and I'm not feeling it a lot. He'll mention somewhere we could travel in a year or 2 or even our future house and I feel so guilty because I don't rhink I want this anymore?

1022,"If you're reading this, then I really just want to thank you for your time. I currently work as a tech support for a local internet provider in my area, taking calls from customers and working on tickets, like many jobs like that do. I currently get paid $10.00 /hr, which is definitely fine for me, plus there are pay raises on the horizon. It's a really nice, laid back work environment, and I work with about 2 or 3 other techs during the day. I work after-hours as well after the office closes, and from then until my shift ends, I work by myself.

Last year I had a call center job at a larger company, and it was rough. The policies and metric standards were unfair to employees, and I got terminated due to not having good enough ""stats"", despite my best efforts. There were a lot of angry customers (compared to my current job now), we had to put customers on hold and get pen-written permission for every single transfer or service call we did, and those even went against our stats. It was highly discouraged to take time after finishing a call to make notes, and you had to just go straight to the next back-to-back call without any time to breathe. I actually worked there a second time after being let go, since I thought I could do better. But before long, I just decided to quit there.

Maybe this left a bad impression on me, but now, I find myself hesitating, or lacking motivation, to answer incoming calls. I sometimes just can't bring myself to do it, whether I'm finding excuses, or just not up to it. If someone asks me to set up a router, I'm all for it every time. But for some reason, I'm afraid of what kind of interaction I might have with that next customer, including the ones who come into the office in person. The company I work for uses a program called Slack to communicate, and that's where I go when I have questions, which usually works fine, but I'm still afraid that in the later hours, no one will still be around on it to help me out, which contributes to my fear.

This has affected my ability to excel at my job like I've wanted to. I definitely love this job and am happy to have it, especially during a difficult time like we're in. I'll even say that most of my calls go just fine, and I'm often able to fix their problem. I'm studying IT after all. So what could I do to help myself feel more motivation or drive to just do my job and not feel afraid of what can happen? Thanks for your time and any advice is appreciated!",01Sep2020,1

1026,"In august, I texted a hotline because I thought I was going to kill myself and I ended up in the hospital for a week. This is the second time it's happened, the first time was two to three years ago. Because of that, when I got home a social worker came to our house two to three times. My parents honestly didn't make a good impression and I'm guessing neither did I. My mother essentially called him a manipulator to his face, and she thinks he's insane (he was fine, even if he wasn't spectacular). 

Anyway, they got mail saying all three of us had to go to court soon. They're being accused of neglecting my mental health needs and failing to maintain ongoing psychiatric services to address my diagnosis of major depressive disorder, PTSD, apparently anorexia (which I don't agree I have) and my past suicidal ideations. They were provided with pre-placement preventative services to include a Child Family Team Meeting, Family Maintenance Voluntary Services, parenting education, and counseling, and apparently they refused to cooperate with the services offered. 

To be honest, all of those things are true, but they keep repeating that the social worker is ""lying."" My mother keeps telling me I need to ""fight"" and that I'm essentially supposed to say things so that they don't put me in foster care. But she's also telling me she isn't /telling/ me what to say. I've argued with her all day yesterday and it keeps coming up. I understand she's stressed out, but I really don't know what she wants from me, it just seems like there's nothing I can do but answer whatever questions come up if they even ask me anything. 

They're making it sound like it's my choice and it'll be my fault if I end up in foster care. She specifically said I have that choice. I don't \*want\* that choice. I don't want to live here, but I don't want to end up somewhere worse. The only thing keeping me afloat here is my online friends and that's how it's always been. 

If I go into foster care and lose all contact to them I **will** end up offing myself. Everything's painful, and I just don't know what everyone wants from me. I don't want pressure. I don't want blame. I don't want to be the one calling the shots because my own damn parents are shoving it all down my ear holes since they have no idea what to do. 

Is there anything I can do, anything I should be doing? I just feel lost and like everything's about to go down the gutter. I don't have the mental capacity to take all of this. I feel like I should regret everything like texting instead of just dying, but I cant feel anything but nerves.",01Sep2020,1
1027,"Hello everyone.
I work at a nursing home as the assistant Dietary Manager. I have been working in this industry for the last 12 years. Let me tell you dietary in a nursing environment you are the bottom of the totem pole.   
Starting from the bottom and working my way to the were i am now. I have been at my current facility for the last 8 years. I started as cook, until i just felt like i was taken advantage of by the residents and staff and couldnt do it anymore. We made this new position for me because of my frustration. I wasnt sleeping, was easily irritated, panic attack almost daily. 

Within the last few years the irritation just keeps building and building. I am the most reliable person in the building. Need anything done i got you but If i dont do certain things they dont get done. 3 days a week are just soo much because of certain people, the other two are easy peasy. I dont feel like my job is ""rewarding"" anymore. 

Nursing staff has been really short as of lately, they cant seem to keep staff for obvious reasons. With covid policies and dining has changed but nursing makes it harder on all of us in the kitchen sometimes. We are essential workers so i have been working this whole time. I took a week off 2 weeks ago cause i just needed to get away. Since being back i still have all the same frustrations if not more. With covid it is just work and home, work and home.

I took out a loan to get my teeth fixed and get a new car. I was planning on getting a cheaper used car with the loan and the money my husband gave me but ended up falling in love with a car that was ten thousand over what i wanted intially. So now i technically gave 3 loans i need to pay off. One from the bank, one for the car and pay back my husband. August was financially hard on me. I am not one to ask for help. I can figure it out on my own. My temp tags are expired and having an incredibly hard time getting an appointment with the dmv. 
Got a letter 2 weeks ago that insurance denying my claim for the crown i needed and already got. The dentist office resubmitted the claim and got one today denying it again another 1,400. 

I am one of those people that do do do for others but doesnt ever get anything in return. I just dont know what to do anymore. The only thing i really have to look forward to is the new DnD group i started. Any advice on how to make this better i would greatly appericate.

1028,"Everything started back in primary school... I wasn't a terribly social person and I isolated myself from my classmates. I've always been a bit of a nerd. It's not a bad thing, from the contrary, it helped me join a very high-standard high school. But I used to have a hard time making new friends and being comfortable around people.  


Now, I can say I've grown up and I'm much more socially active. Since the seventh grade, I began using my sense of humour to make people laugh and have become much more friendly and open to new people... However, the mistakes from the past, coupled with a mild depression during quarantine, led me to have moments of severe anxiety.  


Sometimes, I'm just sitting alone at my computer, or in bed and get overwhelmed with bad thoughts... Thoughts like ""I'll never be good enough"", ""I suck"", etc. As I mentioned, I'm about to start high-school and I would really hate to experience the same thing as in primary school. But, my anxiety moments get me thinking I'll never be good enough for my new classmates.  


My best friend is quite the opposite... He's very outgoing, very popular and, although a bit arrogant, he's a very nice guy... That's led girls to crush on him for a few years now... Heck! I think every friend of mine has a girlfriend. I don't. I really wish I did, though... I'm probably not even mature enough for a relationship. But I'm kinda shy and don't know how to talk to girls. The feeling no girl could ever like me adds to the anxiety.  


I know I'm an interesting person. Quite a few people have told me that. And, yet, these moments of extreme anxiety make me think I'll never be interesting enough. I'm not comfortable around new people too quick. I always try to appear interesting to new groups of people but I probably end up looking like a clown. I'm scared to death not to let them down, although there are really no expectations. I think my jokes are stupid whenever I meet new people, that I look silly or literally anything to make me consider I'm not good enough...

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I start experiencing these episodes, my head is overwhelmed with a mash-up of thoughts like that... It's eating me from the inside. There's really so many, I barely keep count of them. How can I gain more self-esteem and confidence? I suppose a big dose of that could do a long way...

Once the needle was in my arm, the phlebotomist told me that she refuses to wear a mask and the only reason she does so is because the hospital makes her.

She then started telling me about how she freaked out on a man on Sunday who asked her where her mask was while she was in the grocery store. She proceeded to take off her mask, while we were in an enclosed cubicle, point at her face and says I told the man ""does this face look like it needs a mask? Mind your own business. You're nothing but a sheep""

Then she put back on her mask, took another tube of blood, and I was so uncomfortable that I said to her that I guess I am a sheep because I am paranoid and I don't want to get sick. Nor do I want my boyfriend who has medical issues to get sick. We always wear a mask so that we don't potentially transmit, or receive, COVID19.

Then she tells me that her daughter is a pulmonary specialist and there has been no cases of coivd at the hospital and that once again, people are sheep.

My question is, am an asshole if I make a report to the hospital? I don't want to get anyone fired and let me be clear, she was nothing but polite to me.

I work as a teacher at a school. We had resit examination a month ago. It was all online education due to Covid-19, so the exams were online too. I uploaded the exams and went on a holiday (somewhere away from crowds). When I came back, I saw the submitted papers (only 2, from the same class). I tried to enter the scores, but the system was closed. I was told to write a petition when I contacted the tech department to ask if they could open the system. I went to the school, wrote a petition about the subject and handed it. The secretary told me that it was the committee's job to approve petitions. The committee was going to gather the following Thursday. A while later, I emailed the secretary if the petition was approved and she said that they didn't have the documents they were in the student affairs. Then, I asked the student if the problem was solved. She said it wasn't...

At this point, I don't know whether my petition is approved or not. Most probably not. But I don't know what to do. I know I should have been more careful about all this. Being on holiday is not a good excuse... I don't know how I should investigate further about this and solve the problem if possible.

My constant fear is getting in the way of school and my social life, and I find it hard to cope somedays.

I want to go to a Doctor/Therapist who could help me stop being a nervous wreck 24/7 but I would need to bring that up to my mum, which is not easy. I have thought about going alone but that would not work since ny parents arent the type to let me just go out on my own and I cant use my friends as an excuse as none of them live close to me and really the only way I can get to them is my mum driving me. I would go to my schools counciler if it wasnt so terrible- I went once and they just told me to 'realise no one is judging you.' and pretty much just said 'get over it, pussy.' 

Another thing to note is that we are not a 'sit down and talk' family. I have never sat down with my parents and told them anything as my household is very unavaible emotionally.I have no clue on how to bring the topic of therapy up as I am terrifide of confronation/asking for anything, so any help would be appreciated.

1043,"I met my girlfriend [28/f] in November 2018. In 5 months time I [28/m] have to decide to leave my hometown in southern California to move to Memphis, TN for 3 years due to my girlfriends job in cancer research. I love my girlfriend very much, and have just recently moved in with her a couple of months ago, but the idea of leaving behind all my friends and family for a place I have no interest in living scares the shit out of me. 

My job isn’t an issue as I can work remotely, but I have some serious anxiety and depression issues I’m being treated for and the only thing that has ever made my life meaningful is my friends and family. But the idea of losing my girlfriend is equally as terrible to me. 

The idea of moving out of state has been in the talks since the start of our relationship, but this was something that wasn’t suppose to happen for another 2 years. But her original offer in Memphis was just revoked and was told an hour ago that this opportunity won’t be available to her if she doesn’t commit to it in 5 months. Combine this with me hardly seeing my friends and family due to the pandemic, plus all the trips being canceled that I was suppose to go on this year with them, and I feel like I am leaving everyone behind without a proper goodbye. I don’t know what to do and it’s tearing me up inside. I’m scared of what I’m about to lose. Anyone have words of wisdom they could share?


**TL;DR** girlfriend of almost 2 years needs to move to Memphis for 3 years for her job in 5 months time. We either do LDR, or I move with her. I’ve lived in my hometown all my life and everything I know is here. I never had any interest in leaving, especially to move to Memphis.  But I love this girl to death and the idea of growing apart from her via LDR scares me. But so does moving so far away from my friends and family, who are my biggest support.

**History**   
***TLDR;*** *i have asbergers (i dont like change), 18 yo leaving highschool after this last year*

Im a 18 yo male who currently lives with both his parents, i live in sweden. I was pretty recently diagnosed with asbergers (tame version of autism) aswell as depression which i take SSRI meds for. My mother has been very very sad over her relationship with my father (who might be autistic, we dont know but suspect) and i was told that she will serv him divorce papers the day after my birthday (turning 18)(he already knows about the divorce but it has to be official). We currently live in a house which my mother owns the majority of but the short story is that she isent financially able to buy my dad out of the house. There has been no physical or deliberet harm from any party and there is no bad feeling towards each other exept frustration and sadness.   


**What to do**  
So  my options are as follows:  
1. I move in with x parent, finish highschool (1 year left) then leave for university and move out.  
2.1 I somehow find a way for them to co own the house with one of them living here so i dont have to move (nice bcause i have trouble with radical change), and study where i live (big universities)  
2.2 I find a way for them to co own the house, stay here and then move away for university after i finish highschool, and they sell the house.  
3. We sell the house, split the money and i move in with x parent and stay/study wherever x parent settles.",01Sep2020,1

1050,"Hi redditors,

I really did not know where to post this so I apologize in advance if this is the wrong spot. But anyways, my friend and I are both in college and so neither of us have much money and she has none.

this is her general situation from a text she sent to a friend:  
"" abusive parents, luckily they let me stay on their phone bill but only for the time being, another threat they said if i try to leave the house to go on a walk or dogsit for a friend’s aunt. i am unable to get a job in real life at the moment because they blockade the door from letting me out (due to covid but i cannot even go on walks in my neighborhood) and they facilitate my bank account (i’m 19) they refuse to let me move out and continuously guilt trip me despite them having gotten physical with me in early july. i don’t feel safe at home and they have strict policies against me despite my age, i am not allowed to go downstairs in my house past 12:00am, and they are expecting me to pay for my college but dropping out is not an option. they put me on ssris and benzodiazepines when i was 14 and now take my zoloft (supposed to take 1 per day) and hide it from me causing the most depressive withdrawals. they are neglectful and constantly put me down with remarks saying they wouldn’t be shocked if i became a prostitute or such, yet refuse to let me get a job in the outside world because of covid even though i take all of the proper precautions. dad is an immigrant and i am the “baby” of the family so they refuse to let me go to a college i want, forcing me to pursue a computer science major or face the threat of them not helping me slightly with college finances. they do not want me to leave the house ever, buying my two sisters their own cars but refusing to buy me one because they do not want me to leave. they won’t let me take care of my own money and take it when they need it or whenever i (used) to go out. it’s a really toxic environment full of neglect and they refuse to help any depression i feel by withholding my ssri meds and making me quit cold turkey after all these years. they control almost every single aspect of my life, i am not even able to gain control of my medications, bank account, money, or have a car to get me from point A to point B for a job. i don’t know how i am supposed to make money to be able to move out when they are putting me in a state of stagnancy""

I told her to open a separate bank account and try to get an online job in the mean time to accumulate some money. I could not be a source of transportation for her if she did get an actual job because i live two hours away now due to university. She has a girlfriend and i told her to move in with her and get a job in the mean time but that still does not solve her dilemma of transportation. Could she possibly file for unemployment in the US to get help financially until she can afford a car and find a job without her parents knowing? She's already had to taken out loans for school but her parents are in charge of that.",01Sep2020,1
1051,"I think she stopped Monday and she was already super irritated when I came home tonight. At first I ignored it because I wasn’t sure if I had said anything. Turns out she had a yelling fit in our hallway cuz our apartment neighbors took up all the washing machines which is super annoying. They do it at a lot. 

I’m just thinking if she’s already snappy now it’ll only get worse. Mentally I’m not stable enough to handle that honestly. I also just took distance from all my friends cuz I realized they were toxic / kept me around to have someone to laugh at. So I can’t really just leave the house and stay out until she sleeps. I don’t get any shifts at my job atm.

What can I do to avoid her? I’ve been told she’s low key abusive by a very blunt friend that I’m actually seeing tomorrow. I don’t know her very well but I’m excited about it. Anyway.

I already get high every day so I can sleep at night. I self harm a little. I feel a little lost. I’m afraid of what will happen the next few weeks.

1052,"I'm sorry for bad spelling and grammar, or formatting this is one of my first post thingys. TLDR at the bottom.

I don't know whether this should be on r/relationshipadvice or not, so I went here instead. My ex-boyfriend (M18) and I (F16) had an online relationship/long distance relationship him living a 2-hour drive away. We had been talking/dating for about 7 months but never actually met in person. During the beginning everything was fine, but as time went on his white lies he had told nothing too big but there was a lot of them. We had started talking when I was 15 and him 17, during this time we didn't send inappropriate pictures but we had sexted a little. However, after I turned 16 we sent nudes back forth with him screenshotting a few. We were planning on meeting just before Covid-19, but couldn't due trains and hotels being cancelled. As a result, we facetimed nearly every night for the first 2 months of lock down, this is where the issue began. I felt extremely suffocated. We'd stay up till 4 or 5am and if I tried to have one night not facetiming or not that late, he would guilt trip me to stay. If  I wanted one night to myself I had to fake falling asleep early and turn my phone off, this made me feel so isolated because I could only speak to my friends in the limited time between me napping and calling him. Over time, my self-confidence was getting lower and lower as he'd often compare my to his ex-girlfriends who were skinny and beautiful, where as I'm rather short and fat. One day I couldn't take it anymore I ended the call and messaged him saying I wanted space. In his eyes space was having a go at me and still calling. Eventually, he pulled back and so did I, I went about a week away and I truly felt better. However, as I pulled more away he noticed and we broke it off, him saying it's clear I don't want to be with him and at that he unadded me on snapchat. I thought everything was over and it was for a while. He added me back a few times to have a go at me saying he deserves a proper reason and when I would ignore him or not give him a satisfying answer he would unadd me again. I got tired of him coming and going, so I unadded him and I thought that was the end and it was for a while. Till a few weeks back he messaged me and 3 of my friends on instagram saying he's a good lad, he deserves better, and how I used to treat him like a god what changed. It made me so uncomfortable for my friends because of what he was saying but eventually he left them alone. Until 2 weeks ago, he messaged me on his old snapchat account. He made fun of every insecurity I had betrayed my trust, made fun of me getting abused repeatedly, then threatened to send his friends to beat me up and to ""not go town"" or I'd get chucked in a van. I took these as empty threats, until he once again messaged me friends and sent one them an inappropriate picture of me in just my underwear. I had a panic attack that night, I had assumed he had deleted them when the relationship ended like I had. I sent a big paragraph laying into him getting everything off my chest about why and how fucked up what he had done, and rather than respond or even open my message he unadded me again. Now why I need advice now is because he has messaged my mum and deleted it before she saw it. I am so scared if he told her even half of the stuff we had done she would never look at me the same. I have such a close bond with my mum, but I also lied to her saying I'd never send nudes. I don't know what to do, I can't tell my mum about the threats or the photos, I can't get him to delete them. I'm scared for my safety as he knows where I live, he knows my friends, I'm worried if I message him I'll be giving him the attention he wants or will provoke him further. I can't go to the police because that means telling my mum, admitting I sent nudes whilst being under aged, and having the risk that I mess up my relationship with my mum and nothing getting fixed. I'm so scared.

Please if you have any advice or comfort, I don't know I've seriously fucked up and I'm terrified. I just want him to leave me alone.

TL;DR- ex-boyfriend still has my nudes and I'm scared about what he'll do.

1056,"Hi!

So im 21yrs old and my sisters turning 26yrs old this year and shes had a rocky life. Our childhood was fine there was no trauma or bad blood in the family but rocky as in her personal life.
 When she was 18 she done a Pharmacy course in university but dropped out after a year because she wasnt enjoying it. This caused a fuss in my family but they eventually got over it. She took a year off to think about what she wants to do when she grows up and worked in retail during that year off. She decided Dentistry was interesting so Her plan was to go into Dentistry (she originally wanted to do this but could only get into pharmacy) and she got into a university when she turned 21 but just days before she was meant to start the university called and said they cancelled the course. By then it was too late to get into another course so she ended up having to take another year off and worked retail during that time. So thats two years no university. The next year she managed to get into a uni doing psychology which she genuinely enjoyed and got As and Bs in it and she made it all the way to third year. But then she missed the deadline for her dissertation because she didnt reach the word count. This was during quarantine so it was easy to get distractbut it seemed a bit much for my sister. Then we (me and my mum) found out recently that she knew she missed it but didnt tell us cause she was afraid. I wasn’t there to see my mums reaction as I was outside at the time and I only found out through my mum and when i asked my sister she said she didnt want to talk about it. My sisters 25 at this point and turning 26 this december.
 A few days ago my dad came back from working abroad for 9 years. He comes and stays with us when he can take time off but has to fly back abroad because he needs to support his six children. Anyway so my dad came back and just a bit before that time my sister developed a habit of sleeping during the daytime and then waking up in the evening and only going downstairs at night time when everyones asleep. Im a night owl so I sometimes bump into her downstairs but its really awkward for me to stay more than ten minutes and then just end up watching a tv show together or ill just go upstairs. My mum and dad try talking to her seperatley but whenever they go in her room she hides underneath the covers and doesnt speak at all and knowing my sister she wont open up to me either especially since im five years younger and one of my brother is abroad, one she cant stand, another is too busy with his work and my other recently had a baby a few days ago so hes too occupied with his first child to get involved plus he lives three hours away. So theres no one in my family that she will talk to and i dont know if she’s comfortable with me asking one of her friends to talk to her.
 I know my sisters been to therapy before for depression but i dont know how long for since she went by herself so I’m really worried her mental health will deteriorate for the worse and I dont know how to help.
My parents are asian and don’t understand the concept of mental health and regardless they dont know what to do with my sister either so my familys kinda stuck as if its just me my mum and my dad in this house and someone hidden upstairs. Even though we live in the same house I barely see her if that makes sense. My mums basically given up on tryting to talk to her but my dads still trying but like i said she just hides under her blankets and doesnt say a word

so I need advice how can I help my sister who wont open up and i cant even guess how shes feeling?

1057,"Hey guys! So this may sound a little off, and there’s really not much I can do about this if I’m right, but I would appreciate some advice on how to handle it.
For some backstory, my grandmother used to run a camp with the guy, we’ll call him CC for camp counselor. After they decided to close the camp, CC went to this really rich school to start a summer camp there, and because my grandmother and CC were such could friends, they let my cousins, my sister, and I in for fairly cheap. I, as a child, had a lot of allergies to random stuff like sunscreen, chlorine, etc. This is important to keep in mind.
For more clarification, I loved the counselors endlessly. 4/5 year old me adored(and I still do) each and every one of them; this incident just seems weird to me.
As a regular activity, we would go in the pool and do swimming lessons, but I couldn’t always go in because the chlorine gave me rashes everywhere. Now, it wasn’t painfully for me, just itchy, but my parents thought it would be best if I didn’t go in the pool there. Before all of this though, when they just started to notice how often I would get rashes, they took me to the councilors’ room to check it out. I would say most of the camp counselors were 17 and up. I remember them taking me in there and telling me to take off my bathing suit. I did so I ended up being completely naked in front of them, not even in the nurse’s office. These were people I loved and cared about, but they weren’t technically family in the literal sense. Am I over exaggerating something that happens often or did something not right really occur?",01Sep2020,1

1059,"hi, i've never even used reddit before but this is all i can think of to come to since this is something reoccurring and it's even more intense this time. i could never even completely go in depth about this since there's so much rooted in but i'll just cover what i can. 


so, i have this long term friend and we've gone through hell and back. we met in a group chat over two years ago and even back then we were dealing with trauma with one another that was happening with some of the other people and close to when the group chat ended, we really started getting closer and eventually realized we liked each other. we dated up until the day before our one year when he told me we shouldn't be together anymore because he had stuff in his life he was preparing for and he wanted me to experience more. him being my first love, this was gut wrenching for me. id spent so much time with him, and though at this point i was expecting it, it hurt like hell and it did for a long time. i thought i knew him inside and out so when i found out i didn't of course i came crashing down. i had a support system, (since i was in another groupchat now that i'm still currently in to this day) and come to find out over a year later that one of them who was supposedly my best friend had called me a lost cause and had been talking to him on his other phone when he called me to break up and left me for the rest of the day. i won't get super into that but i feel it adds an extra layer.


we went a few weeks without talking, he had me blocked on a few platforms and wanted me out of his life. then one day i get a text because he had a dream about me and wanted to check in which at this point we were being neutral with one another and he was like are you up to call for a little bit up to an hour and i happily complied. an hour turned into the whole night, we had a bunch of intimate moments and it got to the point of him sobbing apologies to me.


the next couple weeks we were in a weird stage of if we had feelings for each other or not, which we did but we didn't want to act on them just in case. fast forward, pretty much every single day we fall asleep on the phone. we got closer over time, he had two relationships since he broke up with me and they stung like hell since i thought i was over it but truly wasn't. but we did talk about it after a while and we still talk every single day. i've been with him throughout literally everything, my best friend after all. when he had to break up with his other partner i sent him a gift and we bonded even more. he called on the way home from work or when he went out to buy food or anything like that, we're practically inseparable at this point and it's just perfect.



i didn't mention before, but throughout the second half of this we were friends with benefits for the longest time. all long distance. but anyways, he's calling me one night and we're having a deep talk about relationships and stuff and he tells me he obviously is emotionally unavailable but hypothetically if he were to get in a relationship yeah it'd be a good thing but he basically told me that he still thinks of me and it's weird for him. he said he doesn't wanna be in a relationship clearly but he mentioned that i'm special to him and he even told me that in the first relationship he was in since we broke up, he still thought of me. it gave me hope for something i knew wasn't good and that was when i started noticing my actions more. he mentioned he could tell when i'm jealous and we laughed about it.



but throughout this, our bond was stronger than ever and there were points where we called for days on end since he left one of his phones at home when he went to work so it'd still be going when he got back. i was suppressing my jealousy when he talked about how pretty some of his girl friends were, because i assumed it was just an immature mindset. but he legitimately told me if he doesn't find a relationship within the next few years that he literally would want to marry me. and it's not like every night he hasn't asked if he's conflicting me. my answers used to be an immediate ""no, dummy!"" but more lately i've been confused about my answer. i've been more hesitant to respond and suddenly.. i haven't heard him say anything like that in a while. a while being a couple weeks maybe, but yeah it stings.



 i know we have different lives but.. we've just done everything together. he was my first in so many things and putting it simply my person. i've talked him down more times than i could say, i talked him through a panic attack just the other day, he's had me sing him to sleep for nights on in. and i'm just now realizing as he's met someone else that i think i fell for him again. i never wanted to admit that, ever. my first heartbreak was something i still have trouble wrapping my head around, and it feels like it's repeating itself with the same person only stronger. but let me get to that.



so about a week ago, i realized myself not being in the best place again which is an understatement. i expressed to him i wasn't doing well and he told me he wanted to get high but he wouldn't because i didn't feel well. i knew i wasn't asking for much, hell i didn't even ask him, but for some reason i felt bad. then he mentioned to me he was gonna call his other friend at some point to make her feel better because apparently the night before, she'd sent him a bunch of voice messages while high and she was embarrassed. but the thing is, he promised her he'd call WHEN he gets high. and he could've waited until the next day. this was my first panic attack in a while and he called me because he could tell i was really freaking out, he managed to calm me for a little bit before telling me he took an edible anyways and that he was gonna call her for 30-45 minutes. this stung, yeah, but i was like okay i can manage for a little bit. an hour passes and i'm spiking again so i text him and i'm saying how i don't wanna ruin his fun but it's been a bit and i needed someone. he replies eventually, hardly speaking english because he was so high and then he says 5-10 minutes left before he calls. i wait for time to pass as i'm trying to stabilize myself because no one else was awake to talk to me and then its been another 45. i tell him goodnight then he finally calls and i'm crying trying to tell him what was going on but he was so out of it he could hardly help me. he said sorry a few times and it felt genuine but we both fell asleep and then the next day he texts me at work asking if i'm mad at him, to which i say no because i honestly was over it at that point and just wanted to move on. then later that night, he tells me he's gonna get high again even though im practically begging for a real conversation because there was something i needed to talk about with him. he said it would be a couple hours because he was calling the girl again and at this point i started suspecting and my stomach dropped at the thought.



id been suppressing everything that happened the night before so i finally told everything to my other best friend, the one i'm closest to in my groupchat and she made me feel sane and reminded me i wasn't in the wrong for being upset. she offered to call, and we did for a long time because she felt bad for my situation and plus we always have fun together. we played games and watched a couple short movies together, then i finally get a call from him. it took a few minutes but eventually i started crying and i was pouring my heart out to him about what i was going through and i repeated myself about three times but he was in and out of sleep and then he got a tone with me, which since i was vulnerable i just said forget it and cried to myself. he hardly mumbled again before falling asleep and i ended up calling him again the next morning to remind him of what i was trying to say the night before. we talked for a short while then we both had to go do stuff. he was still high for like half the day but then he called the girl again that night and i was starting to be in physical pain from my mental state so i called my childhood friend for a while until she got tired and it helped a little but i was still hurting and feeling replaced amplified that as expected. basically over these three days, he decides he has feelings for her and at that point it really hit me that i need to come to terms with the way i feel. he told me its been amazing having all these deep talks with her and it felt like our own didn't even matter. i was venting more to my friend about it and she made me feel less crazy, she's still the only one i've told because i don't really have anyone else to be quite honest and i trust her with it most.



so now it's a nightly thing since she's in college, they call every night and despite me having school as well and us having a three hour time difference, i have to stay up waiting and just hoping he'll call on time. he asked me how it would affect me last night hypothetically if they started dating and i was surprisingly open and honest about how i feel and i told him that i think im hurting a lot actually. he was hesitant but reminded me that it's probably because he was my first love and we talked a lot about it but the thought of all this genuinely hurts. i truly want him to be happy i've seen him at his lowest points, he even called me the other night and told me he was so happy talking to her and that being high has helped him feel spiritually connected to everything which is good for him but he really didn't sound like himself at points and it just really hurts somewhere deep that he's getting all of these spiritual conversations with someone he's just started talking to again and even that it's someone else. i feel selfish but it hurts bad.



i never wanted to feel the way our breakup made me feel again but it almost feels worse than that and i can't put my finger on it. we've talked so much about our future together, i know him talking to this new girl won't take away from what we've experienced the past two years but it hurts like it does. we were talking about change a lot last night and i just don't know what to do from this point forward. i've had so many signs that no matter what, he's the one, and that i need to be patient.. but it hurts. it hurts like hell and i don't want to wait for something like that. i've been so patient with him even throughout my immaturity and i want things to work out. i feel like i want more than this platonic situation, but then there's that part of me that has the idea i feel like this because it's something familiar.



he's just.. talking about meeting her and it feels unbearable. he says they're gonna get high together and watch this episode of avatar so they can experience the spiritual connection together and it's so much pain that it makes me lose my appetite and it's almost embarrassing being this bothered. we've never watched anything together because i know he can't concentrate on things, i've suggested movies and stuff but he was honest and said he wouldn't concentrate. i know him in and out and i have such a fear of losing the connection we've fought through hell for. i don't know if i need to move on or hold on and hope for the best. it bothers me so much that she has the chance of meeting him before i do. i feel like i'm at a halt. i just feel like if im not there immediately i'll be replaced, but why is it such an issue? the other night for example, he called and i was eating so it took a second for me to see the missed call but then when i called back a couple times it took him like 10 minutes because wow guess what, when i didn't answer he called her. i cant handle being replaced and he's reassured me that i'm not but i just.. don't think he knows the extent of it. i know him having to repeat himself is frustrating but it's not like i'm only afraid of being replaced in that way. i'm afraid he's gonna experience all these things with her and he doesn't feel the romantic part anymore.



i also brought up the friends with benefits thing because obviously we haven't done anything like that in a bit but he said that's the whole point and that it's just for friends with no emotional connected behind it which yes he's not wrong but any time we did something of the sort, he'd say i love you in a way i've never heard before and i could just imagine actually being there. i'm not ready to let that go but i know i need to not care so much. i just don't want to make the wrong decision and i'm so lost. i seriously don't know who to spill this all out to, i do have a therapist but the last time i mentioned him it wasn't on the best terms and she referred to him as 'bad boy' as a joke but.. i might try to bring it up next time. i am so incredibly sorry for all of these words and i sort of doubt anyone will read i just need some hope or words of encouragement from someone that knows my situation. like i said before, i've never even used this app but i wanted to see if i could get any sort of advice from someone who feels they can help. i'm the kind of person that always checks in and asks if you're okay, i'll stay up all night with you if you need it, i'll do anything to make sure my friends are safe and happy or even distracted. so reaching out for help like this is difficult for me. thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading, i just need to stop hurting from this because it's interfering with my day to day life and it really sucks. i wanna be able to look back and laugh at this.",01Sep2020,1
1060,"Sorry for the lengthy post. 


I (27f) made the choice to move to Puerto Rico a year ago. There were a few reasons, my dad was getting a liver transplant and after years of not having a relationship with him I decided life was short and I wanted to be closer in proximity. I also fell in love during the time I was here visiting and decided moving to the island to be closer to my SO wouldn’t be bad. Everyone told me to think of my decision, I had a good job in the bank &amp; was relatively comfortable In my living situation. But the environment of NyC was taking a toll on me and I wanted to be at peace for once and thought Puerto Rico would provide that. 

After a few months of living here however things changed for the worse. My dad wasn’t the man I had hoped he was, he wasn’t supportive of me, wouldn’t help me with resources and just basically wanted to see me struggle. When I asked him why he’d say “nothing in life came to me easy so why should it for you?” I was baffled. Up until then I had lived on my own, I had struggled, been homeless amongst many things and I never reached out to him for help. To me NOTHING CAME EASY. So why would someone in a position to help me choose not to? Plus I was his only child for 16 years before his new family. 

After I realized I didn’t have the support of my father I really leaned into my SO, we had a long distance relationship for a while and he seemed kind, supportive and really matched what I was bringing to the table or so I thought. We moved into a home that belonged to his grandparents (had since passed) and were set on fixing up the house and making a life for ourselves. I was unable to find a job in a bank as my Spanish wasn’t the greatest and they required a degree (which im currently in the process of obtaining) so I went to the next best thing I know of. Bartending. 

I found a job as a bartender and was working really good shifts when the pandemic hit. They cut my hours down drastically and tips dried up due to lack of tourism. Working in finances I know how to balance a book but my problem wasn’t money. Quarantine started and that’s when I started spending the majority of time at home with my SO sometimes days at a time before our next shift. And that’s when he became abusive. 

He began verbally abusing me saying how I was broke and only working two days and he was making so much more money then me, he would gaslight me and withhold affection if I ever tried to question his methods. He took things further and became physically abusive towards me, pulling my hair, smacking me, and calling me names. I’d have to hide in the other room and lock the door to get away from him, I even called his mother a few times to save me. She’d pick me up, tell me she knows he’s wrong but he’s not a bad person, talk it out with him and convince me to go back home with him. I didn’t know who else to run to or who to tell out of sheer embarrassment. 

How can I tell my friends and family not only does my dad not give two fucks about me but the man you all love so much is secretly a horrible abuser. I shrunk myself, I became less vocal, I tried to be invisible. I didn’t ask questions, I didn’t look for things. I went from an extremely social person to a shell of myself. Everything that I do is to shield the world from the truth that I’m a failure. But I’ve always been a fighter, things would get too much for me and I’d lash out all for him to beat me down again. I keep doing that to this day. 

I’m feeling at the end of my rope and I want to leave, but with little money and nowhere to go I don’t know what else to do. It only leaves me with calling my mom and asking for money to go to Daytona beach Fl. She loves my SO and idk how to explain to her why I’ve been lying  I’m so embarrassed and hurt and I just wanted to vent because I feel extremely alone out here.",01Sep2020,1

I was out like a week ago with a mate who knows two of the actual employees, and after they asked about me apparently the employee responded with something like ‘idk I think they fell asleep’.

After hearing this I felt awful and really astonished because I had no recollection of anything like this ever happening. I can remember being tired after one or two heavy lunches I had and yawning a bit, but that’s it. It’s not like I can remember the sensation of waking up or anything. 

I don’t know if they meant I actually went to sleep or if it’s that they thought I was bored or whatever. No one seemed to act weird or different around me the whole time I was there and no one seemed ticked off.

1064,"Hi, I'm 17F (in grade 12) and my school counsellor asked me if I could sit with this girl in grade 10, and help her get a little more used to the school.

She doesn't have many friends and is shy. Kind of a reflection of me in grade 10 to be honest, but I won't compare.

I'm a fairly open person, I'll talk to people at random, start conversations, etc. What I struggle with is small talk (?). 

I need something to continuously talk about, but because she's shy it's pretty much just me that starts the conversations.

I usually can talk to people, but it makes it a little difficult when they don't talk back much. Which isn't their fault, I had the same issue. I still kind of struggle with it aha.

More recently, I had to move last minute to a town around 45 minutes away from the city I go to school in and I don't drive right now. My classes are all online, but my labs and practicum are obviously in person and I don't have the means to get there.

I am living off of student loans right now because due to COVID, I can't have another job while doing practicum (so nothing gets spread to the facilities). So I have just under $5000 to live off of for around 3-6 months still. 

My boyfriend is not working as well as he is a double amputee and we are working on getting him AISH or disability, but that isn't going as well as we thought it would. He is working on going to school as well so eventually he should have loans as well but I'm not sure when or how much he will get.

If one of us gets our license, my boyfriends mom will give us her old car, but she won't give it to us to practice on and she lives 3 hours away so she can't come out here to teach us how to drive. I have my learners, my boyfriend doesn't.

1079,"Dear redditors,  


My parents and I are both in the process of building houses. Theirs will be finished in a couple of weeks, mine will be in april 2021.  


After hearing some good reviews about a fairly new kitches business in our area ( 2 colleagues of my mother bought and got their kitchens from the place )  we decided to go there and see what he could offer us.   


As we were told his prices were quiet low compared to others in the area. My kitchen was 10500 euros at his store, while it was 12500-13000 at other stores. Knowing kitchen stores have big margins I thought this guy might just take less margin but do quiet a lot of orders.  


We both agreed to a contract with the store in the beginning of june and we payed our deposit ( 3150 &amp; 3600 euros ).  My parents kitchen should be here by the end of the month. My dad couldn't really reach him on his phone this past week so he decided to stop by the place, seeing that the store was closed and equipment was removed from the showroom kitchens. We immediately thought we had been scammed. After doing our best to reach the guy we got to speak to him and he was telling all different kind of lies which I'm not even gonna bother you guys with.  The neighbours told us we weren't the only victims and this basically confirmed our suspicions. We got scammed.  


We were really mad and threathened him and threatened to break into his store and get us some stuff which was still there. When my dad got a drill and started breaking the locks (scared the hell out of him) he send someone over with a key so we could remove a kitchen, we did and we took some cheap equipment which was still there. Probably worth 2000 euros together.  


A lot of conversations between us have taken place over the phone and he just keeps lying and lying that we are getting our money back. Then minutes after he confesses he has nothing left. What he has done with all the deposits ( it's a lot, probably 30k+ ), nobody knows. He is genuinely scared of us because we have threatened him a lot. We are really decent people who don't harm a fly but he doesn't know that and thinks we are criminals. He has now also transfered me 500 euros he borrowed from his brother as that is all he can get at moment he says.   


What can we still do? Legally the guy probably owns nothing. So the legal way is no real option.   
How easy can it be for him to get a small business loan just to pay us back?   
We live in the Netherlands.  


P.s. in our country the covid situation helped grow the market in furniture, kitchens and bathrooms by 20%, so he has no real excuse to losing the money in these times.

1082,"Hi, I'm going to miss out some details so that this is kept as anonymous as possible, but the prerequisites that you should know are these: 

* Both the accuser and my friend are of age and are both girls
* They both live in the UK 
* My friend has been sexually assaulted more than once

I'm not sure what I can really do to help her. A bunch of her friends have turned on her and she's not good mentally. Physically I am not sure, she says she hasn't harmed herself but I feel she may be lying. I don't live close enough to her to go visit, so my only real option as of right now is to speak solely online, but I am planning on seeing her soon. She's had bad run ins with mental health services and the emergency services before and doesn't really trust them, so please don't advise a hotline or anything for her to call.

My friend is not the type of person who would ever commit such a crime. Even whilst drunk, she will always maintain that consent is of the upmost importancey. In one situation the accusor got my friend drunk and tried to get her to initiate a sexual encounter, but she refused as she was under the impression the accuser was drunk, to the point where she refused to even hug her. Given this encounter and what she's like in general, plus the fact she's been sexually assaulted herself, I can't believe for one minute that she would do such an awful thing. Of course I wasn't there so I can't say for definite. 

I've recommended she stay away from alcohol and drinks plenty of water, I make sure to remind her to take her anxiety medication because that really helps her, and I'm always there for her whenever she needs someone to talk to or just someone to vent at. But I feel like I'm not doing enough, I need to be more proactive rather than reactive, but I do not know what I can possibly do. I've tried talking to the friends who instantly gave her shit, and I just got blocked immediately. I don't want to confront the accuser because I feel like that would just add fuel to the fire, and my friend said she doesn't want me to talk to her, so I will respect her wishes.

She has other friends who support her, but only myself and 2 other people have vocally said that they believe her, the rest are just not attacking her and seem to be either staying out of it or waiting for proof (as the accuser currently has not provided any proof).

1083,"Me (24f) and my bf (28m) love each other, have been together since I was 18.
We have a 4 year old and a 5 month old.

In the beginning of our relationship we fucked all the time. Which is pretty normal. But I told him that I need sex pretty often because my drive is high and I just dont feel connected without sex. He was the same way so I stayed because that is a very important factor to me. 

Our relationship has been pretty good, we only argue occasionally normally we do good and we are happy.

It's been a few years of things slowing down. Not by my choosing though. I understand him being tired from work. But I just dont feel wanted. 

I rarely even get compliments. Even during sex he never tells me I'm hot or talks dirty. I've bought some fun bedroom stuff and he just doesnt even seem to care. I bought lingerie for the first time in my life. To try to spice things up but hes so blah I'm afraid of even trying. I'm just afraid I'll get no reaction like I normally do. 

I dont want to live the rest of my life like this. I know maybe I should talk to him about it but I dont want him to just start doing these things because I told him to. 

I have self esteem issues and maybe I rely too much on his opinion of me but it's because I love him and want to know that he thinks I'm hot or sexy. I never get anything from him.

I just hate it. It's making me want to get the attention in that way, elsewhere which is wrong. 
I've talked about maybe me getting a girlfriend, fwb type thing but he's not okay with it.

So he wants me to himself but wont even give me attention in that way. I'm just so upset and tired. I want to be with him forever but I dont want to feel this way forever. Sex is just really important to me. I just dont feel like I'm enough or I'm not sexy enough. 
Maybe becoming a mom so young ruined his view of me. I never even wanted kids I just had them because of him. 

I've read articles about how to get his attention and spice things up but none help. No matter what I do I get nothing... I'm just over it. I masturbate all the time and its honestly the only action I get. When we do have sex he never finishes and I'm left hanging.",01Sep2020,1
1084,"This summer I (M) stupidly had consensual sex with a guy (several guys if you count oral sex). I am 17 and they were all in their 20s, but none of them were above 25.  I recently got concerned that this may have fallen under the category of statutory rape. I live in Pennsylvania and when I googled the age of consent here this is what it says: 

""The Pennsylvania age of consent is **16 years old**. Nobody **15 years of age** or younger can legally consent to sexual activity. The Pennsylvania statutory rape law makes the de-facto age of consent in Pennsylvania **18** due to the Commonwealth's corruption of minors statute""

This is very confusing to me, as it first says the age of consent in PA is 16 but then seems to go on to say it's 18? Some websites confirm it as 16 yet some, including [ageofconsent.net](https://ageofconsent.net) basically reapeat the sentence posted above. I was wondering if someone could PLEASE explain to me for certain whether it is 16 or 18. 

The reason I want to know so bad is I am going to see a therapist on Tuesday and was hoping to discuss my feelings about these encounters among other things. I wasn't forced into anything but they still had an impact on my mental state I would like to discuss. If this does fall under statutory rape will my therapist be obligated by law to report it? If I really don't want to deal with the consequences of that as I 'd rather simply move on, should I not mention it to him?

An answer to either of those questions as well as an explanation on the age of consent in PA would be much appreciated as this whole situation is stressing me out a lot.",01Sep2020,1
1085,"I have a friend who is in her upper 30's and divorced about 5 years ago. Since her divorce, she's been on a string of relationships which have been hard to watch. (A short summary for perspective)

TLDR: After a string of bad relationships my friend is selling her house and buying one with her boyfriend of 1 yr. She doesn't like children and he has partial custody of 2 youngish kids. Her counselor has apparently not cautioned her, but her aunt has. Do I say anything?

She started out not wanting to have any emotional attachment. She wound up in a dom/sub relationship, she thought with two men. It wound up being a single man concocting an involved mindgame with possibly several women. She reported him to the police. (Her marriage ended with her husband stealing from her and his job to support a drug habit. Honestly none of us figured it out, but should have.)

She next dated a married man who was in an open relationship. This was the healthiest relationship I've seen her in, and he did help her to explore new things, consider some new ideas. There was also a number of bad qualities, and eventually with a lot of effort we supported her through the decision to separate. It was like watching a smoker quit. 

She's now been in a relationship for a year with a guy who does have several nice personal qualities. He seems on the surface to be friendly &amp; nice enough. In part due to corona and my own stuff going on, I've seen very little of him, which makes me really reluctant to judge the situation. But, he shares custody of two boys, and my friend openly dislikes children. One is 5 and one is a preteen. She keeps saying when they're there they just stay in their room anyway, they won't be in his life forever anyway. She says she likes the younger one, but not the older. When they sit down for meals together, it gives her anxiety. They both have dogs and she's devoted to hers, but the dogs don't get along. She doesn't like how he polices both the dogs and children due to similar patterns of behavior. This is just a summary for brevity, but she's described a number of things that make it hard to be supportive. 

Just from the outside, I feel like if I read about her situation in an advice column, I'd say ""This person needs to stop, think about their priorities and the reality, and get counseling."" But, she's about to sell her house and buy one with her boyfriend, and has expressed repeatedly that her main priority is to not lose him, especially after they had a recent sort of blowup and potential breakup situation. Her reaction has definitely been to hold on tighter and insure she can't split from him at all costs. I think she's going to be stranded and miserable, and have ethical concerns about her wanting to be a stepmom with no interest in being a mother. 

Finally, she does have a counselor and when she told me her Aunt expressed concern I suggested she talk it up with the counselor and take her time. The counselor taught her coping mechanisms for dealing with the anxiety. 

Am I wrong for judging this at all? Should I keep my mouth shut? Or do I risk my friendship by voicing these concerns (somehow)?",01Sep2020,1
1086,"Preface; This is some out of pocket, grade A ridiculous shit and frankly I don’t know what do or wether or not I will survive the coming weeks. There’s a boat-load of context needed so bear with me please. I’ll also post some screenshots with supplementary information to back up my claims. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m no longer safe in my city. Frankly this all happened on accident and I’ve exhausted every support system I have and all that I can do now is keep running. I live in a dangerous place. A high murder rate that keeps on rising and as a result of my own actions and some incredibly poor luck I’ve now got a target on my back that may never go away. So let’s start at what I !think! is the beginning.

&amp;nbsp; 

I was dating this girl for a few years. It wasn’t bad, or at least I didn’t realize how bad it truly was until it all ended but that’s not really the point. Towards the end of our relationship- while trying to fix things- for a brief moment (a day) we considered a poly amorous relationship. We entertained a girl from our work who (although we didn’t realize she was lying) was at the time moving on from her ex. I didn’t believe the things she said about him which was a mistake on my part. Some of the things that were thrown out there included; diagnosed ASPD, murderer, stalker, psychopath, *gang member,* etc, etc. I now realize that this had been a setup the whole time and things are getting worse by the day. Long story short he kicked her out and we allowed to her to crash on our couch for a few days before she could get her stuff to her family’s house. (I actually never even saw her at our house but that’s beyond the point.) This may have been a ploy just to get our address but I doubt that, I think she just didn’t feel safe.

&amp;nbsp;

See with the advent of social media, stalking/tracking has become easier than ever and the individual in question has already admitted to stalking me at the time (when the aforementioned situation was ongoing.) my apartment complex where I was living started putting up signs about suspicious individuals skulking around at night. Despite all of this I was none the wiser to the position I was really in. 

&amp;nbsp;

After my relationship ended (cheating, thanks ally) I started to look for some solace (vagina) and out of nowhere a very hood girl from high school started to hit me up. We hooked up once in the back of her Saturn and then she asked to move in with me. Again I wasn’t paying attention as I’m a little white boy who didn’t know shit about shit and didnt think much of it when she told me she was actually in ms-13 (she was actually part of a different gang but again, beyond the point it’s just another example of me being oblivious.) I was a little unsettled by how interested in me she was becoming so I cut contact relatively quickly and moved onto the next one. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now as I was unknowingly being set up and stalked, I met my next actual girlfriend on accident. I invited a girl who I was facebook friends w over and unfortunately when I went to pick her up my car broke down in my driveway. When I asked her if she could get a ride she actually mentioned asking my stalker BY NAME and I still didn’t get the fucking picture. In the end she asked her friend (my next gf) for a ride to my place and that ended up being my downfall. Her BF at the time came and we all hung out at my place and smoked some, had a good time, and that was the night. Now you might be thinking “so hey when is your life going to be put at risk?” And I promise you we’re getting there. Unfortunately how elaborate the scheme was means I can’t really emphasize the gravity of the situation without all of this context. 

&amp;nbsp;

New girl and me start hanging out every single day (from the first day we met, although she had a bf, we didn’t spend a day apart until we broke up.) I ask her if she’s gang affiliated, she says no. While hanging with her and her man at the time I see some odd symbolism on his wall. Tree of life, roses everywhere, and the interesting fact that he used to be roommates with my stalker (when they lived together with roughly 12 people a body was found in one of their roommates trunks, and that person went to jail and eventually killed themselves.) A few weeks later she broke up with her boyfriend for me out of nowhere and that lead to our relationship.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward a week or two and I help her move out of his house. I ask her new roommate if he’s gang affiliated, he says not anymore but the red symbolism in his house and wardrobe tells me a completely different story. Now low key behind my back she was fucking my stalker, her ex, and her roommate, but honestly right now that’s the last thing on my mind- it’s just another point to be made about the ridiculous level of manipulation I’ve been put under here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now long story short I met her “step-dad” who ran a trap where gang member would regularly hang out. I know for a fact he is in a gang and multiple times he and the people he was with made large references to gang activity that I let slip my mind, or rather willfully ignored. He made a comment in passing that the area she lived was “hot” with activity but I figured I’d be safe considering my (perceived) relationship w her and those around her and the fact I was keeping my nose clean and focusing on my relationship.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the really scary part. I pull up to drop her off at her apartment at roughly 3am. She gets out, goes inside, and that’s that. I turn my head to back out and I see someone walking towards me. It’s someone I’ve seen hanging around before, flashing guns at us while we’re outside, but I’m schizotypal (non-psychosis, just flat affect and general non-social tendencies) and again I didn’t have much of a reaction other than “oh I’ve got these gang people around me I’m probably fine.” I couldn’t have been more wrong.

I look over my shoulder to back up and I see him pull out the same pistol he shook at us before and cock it while staring me dead in the eyes. Whoop fucking whoop. I hit the gas to back and hide in her building until they finally let me in. Keep in my I sent her about 40 messages BEGGING to let me in. BEGGING to save me. No response. Not until 30 minutes later do I hear anything back. One of my friends from out of town actually messaged her roommate and told him to go and unlock the door but he just blocked her. 

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously this left me a little shaken. I didn’t feel safe there anymore but I still wanted to pursue the relationship so the next day I made a plan to drop her off from the side building. It worked one time. The next day I went to do the same thing and there’s a suv blocking the path. I’m in the car with my gf and she’s shaking and freaking the fuck out. We’re arguing, and a white sedan pulls up beside us. I feel my stomach drop because I now realize I’m blocked in from two sides. I hit reverse and whip back the way I came. As I’m leaving the neighborhood I peek out of my side window and the the person in the sedan is lining up a shot at me, this time w a underbarrel flashlight on his pistol. I’m gunning it 50 out of the neighborhood and pull up to the nearest gas station and break down. My gf says “I can’t do this anymore” and flags down a cop car to take her home. I’m too shaken to take her home so I hide in my car laying down. We don’t talk for 3 days until she says she doesn’t want too but for reasons unexplained we need to break up. I’m hurt but I’m more concerned about my safety and I fully understand.

&amp;nbsp;

I hide out for a few days in my new apartment. See unfortunately I moved to the hood in the center of the city and signed a lease only a week or two before all of this went down. Genuinely the most dangerous area in the city. What a genius right? Now I can’t leave the house without having a panic attack so I decide it’s either the bridge or the hospital for me. I go to turn to jump but at the last second I admit myself to the local psyche ward on the grounds I don’t want to fucking die. 

&amp;nbsp;

I met a lot of people in there that were very nice. I also met a lot more gang members in there who I- thanks to my medication making me significantly more trusting, leads to me giving them my contact information. Yeah, great job Dave. Now I get out and I briefly take a look at my ex stalkers page. I’m confused to the point of panic. See half of my life secrets I told are now his page, layered relatively subtextually but obvious enough to get the message. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m suspicious. I message him on Snapchat playing a good game of “oh I need some advice” and he acts very buddy buddy. He admits to stalking me in the past and says “oh if I had a problem with you you’d know” but when I call out the cars following me daily with the same plate numbers he makes a thinly veiled threat along the lines of “if you don’t want to die don’t live in the hood.” Okay then. I’m on guard 24/7. I only leave the house when the coast is clear. All of a sudden I remember this guy has an obscure YouTube channel, and i go to check it out. Keep in mind he made a post about his birthday as well, and invited me to come. Telling me multiple times I’d be safe w him. But at the time I was suspicious, so I went and took a peek at his channel. This is where things start to get wild. I go back to when the whole situation started, early June, when he’d been messaging me on fake accounts. Keep in mind my ex is trying to get me to come to her apartment or her stepdads to give her some of her things I still had. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I find an interesting little podcast on his page where he talks about what I assumed would be the state of the world. I couldn’t have been more fucking wrong. In the video he talks about how he can figure people out by gauging their mannerism and watching them for a few weeks. Followed by this he says me and my exes name verbatim. This throws me into a state of shock. I pull-up more videos of his and find him literally detailing the situations I’ve found myself in, as well as him posting videos about the various murders he’s committed. He talks about how his friend hurt his feelings by simply eating his hot-pocket and he set him up with a girl who had hiv. (I recently found out he was talking about ms-13 girl, thank god I didn’t catch it.) In his next sociopath video he tells how he invited he friend over on a Friday and killed him “on accident” by poisoning him. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now things start to go off. He invites me to his birthday party over Snapchat. My ex’s roommates toxic ex starts messaging me out of the blue and asks if I want to go to the party with her, weird right? I check the information on the post and it’s right down the street from my house, right when I’m supposed to be getting off work. Sounds fishy right? I know he runs with gang members and he’s admitted it on his page. After I say I might come I skip town and stay with my parents for a few days. He goes off grid on his channel but posts taunting messages on his Facebook. He’s also been inviting me to his house saying that I can come over whenever and I’ll be safe with him. My ex has been messaging me saying she can’t divulge but I need to run away and get out of the city and she’s sorry it’s all her fault.

At this point I’ve lost my job because I can’t go into the city anymore. I have nowhere to stay and I’ve been hopping from campground to campground sleeping in my car. I’m living an actual nightmare and I need to get out of the city but I just don’t have the capital or the connections. Ive put my family in danger just staying there. (One of the cars that was following me did a hit an run on my moms car. Same description same plate.)

&amp;nsbp;

TLDR: Got caught up in some gang shit on accident. Been manipulated into a corner and have nowhere to go. I’m on edge, I have to leave or I might literally be killed. I’ve deleted all my social media, discovered fake account rings for gangs to hit unsuspecting individuals, been the target of attempted murder, received countless death threats.) I haven’t told anyone where I’m staying and I’ve disabled location services on everything since I know he’s hacked into at least one of my emails.) WhAt the fuck would you do? Can someone help me? I’m thinking of packing up what I can and being homeless for a while until I can find a new job. I have almost no savings, I’m stuck in a 300/m lease somewhere I can’t go. Help. Also when I mentioned to my ex’s stepdad I got pulled on twice he said “no wayyy” in his usual sarcastic tone which makes me think he either knew or is less than concerned.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly at this point I don’t give a fuck. This dudes YouTube channel is .D.o.g.p.o.i.s.o.n. (Without the dots) if you want to see him calling me out watch lactose tolerant 3 and skip to 33:06 and watch for 2 minutes. If you want to see him detailing the sneaky shit he’s been doing watch tales of a sociopath. If you want to see him call me put subtextually watch his final boss videos, how to get out of being robbed, anything where he’s in the white collared shirt with his hair waved back. The boxer reading is literally just him threatening me. (He’s told me some of this, I figured out some on my own) I’m on borrowed time and I need help.

1090,"This is extremely long and I apologize for that ahead of time. I’ve just had some recent discussions really opened up my eyes and I guess I need advice? This is for sexual assault. I really don’t know how to begin so I’ll just into it. 


I’m 22F and this happened when I was 17, specifically fall trimester of high school. I was working part time at a fast food place. Near the end of my dinner shift, a classmate of mine and a guy I didn’t know came in the restaurant, I took their orders, and they dined in. My shift ended shortly after they got their food so I went over to say goodbye, and ended up sitting there chatting with them a bit. They both told me they were high on marijuana, which at the time it was not legal in my state, and they were getting some food before going home. The stranger was a friend of my classmates and he had just bought a new car. It was a manual 80’s Camaro, and they had just finished driving around in it. The stranger introduced himself, let’s call him Kenny, and asked me if I wanted to go for a ride in his Camaro. I was hesitant but nonetheless I went to his car and he drove around a few blocks until we got back to the restaurant. After that we talked for a few more minutes but then I got in my car and drove home, and they went home as well.


The next day I was in class with that same classmate, and he told me that Kenny thought I was really pretty and fun to talk to, so classmate gave me and Kenny each other’s numbers. 


So now Kenny and I are texting, we’re talking about how fun it was to meet each other, just having casual conversation through text getting to know each other more. After a couple days of texting almost nonstop we met up at a local parking lot to leave my car so we could take his Camaro and drive around. Driving around back country roads is just something we do where I live because the landscape and greenery is beautiful. So we end up going for a drive, he takes me to the neighborhood he used to live, and he even let me drive the car home because I grew up only driving manual transmissions. It was a fun night overall, and he took me back to my car and we both went our separate ways home. 



Over the next few days we continue texting practically nonstop. It was obvious we were both into each other and we wanted to meet up again to hang out. However, I was a 17 and he was 23. He had lightly mentioned some concerns about my age. I thought this was kind of him as I really wasn’t ready to have the type of relationship he was by default that I was in high school. He brought my age up once and then dismissed it pretty quickly after, saying I was very mature and he liked that about me so he didn’t care about my age (I’m seriously cringing at every single red flag I type). Another thing that confused me was his Facebook said he was in a relationship with a girl but he told me he was breaking up/had broken up with her. And since I was 17 and thought he truly liked me, I believed he had broken up with her and Facebook just hadn’t been update, even though she was still posting things and tagging him in them. I was so naïve. 



We continue texting daily. Everything is still going like it had been for the past week or two. He was telling me he wasn’t with this girl anymore, he was saying he wanted to be with me and he really liked me a lot. And then he said he wanted to see me again. So we coordinated a time for me to drop my car off and meet up with him. I left my car in a parking lot and got into his pickup. We stopped by his friends work that was down the road, he introduced me to some people and then we stood outside the building for a bit with one of his friends while they smoked cigarettes. While we were standing there I remember Kenny looking over at me and saying to his friend “isn’t she beautiful?”, but he said it in a smirky way almost. I was still head over heels at the fact that he said that about me to his friend. A guy had never talked like that about me so 17 year old me was swooning. He was a man, so mature and grown up. Extremely attractive and chiseled. He was eye candy with a caring heart, and my head was so far in the clouds I could not be pulled down. 


So after leaving his friends workplace, we drive down the road a bit to the convenience store to grab some refreshments. He asked what I wanted and I said watermelon Arizona tea, to which he laughed and said he’d find something I’d really like. I didn’t know what that meant so I was excited to see what he was going to get. He comes out with a can the size of an Arizona tea, watermelon flavor like an Arizona tea, but it was NOT Arizona tea. It was watermelon Four Loko. I hadn’t had any experiences drinking at that time in my life, so I didn’t know how alcohol would effect me, how much would do what, and quite frankly I didn’t like the taste of it so I only took small sips. He had gotten himself a six pack of beer but he didn’t want to open any until we got to the back roads where we were going to just drive. 


After about 15 minutes of driving he picked up my van and felt that it was nearly full still. He ask “why are you babysitting it?”, and took a few drinks himself. I told him I didn’t really like it, but he told me he thinks I just need to drink more and develop a taste for it. So I drank a few good swigs but nothing insane like crushing the whole can right then and there. After a little while we stopped at a part of the road where the river floods over the road because Kenny wanted to smoke some weed. He didn’t have a pipe or anything so he tried making a smoking device out of a Gatorade bottle. I don’t remember it working very well but we were trying to smoke the little nug he had. He also drank one of his beers from his six pack during this time. We continued driving after about 15-20 minutes of being stopped there. 


We’re now driving through the back road area. I was sitting in the middle of his truck bench seat so I could sit right next to him. He had his arm around me, my head on his shoulder, and my hand on his right thigh above his knee. We were driving and suddenly he pulled over and started making out with me. This is the first time anything has happened between us. We made out for a few seconds, and then he continued driving. I remember him saying “sorry, I finally just had to kiss you”, and feeling all the butterflies everywhere. My toes tingles, my hands buzzed, my heart raced, I was dizzy... or were those induced from intoxication? Back then I thought the things I was feeling in that moment was the warm and fuzzy feelings you see people have in movies. But now that I’ve been drunk, high, and cross faded as an adult, I recognize that feeling and I know what I felt then was not warm and fuzzy from him. 


He continued driving, I went back to having my head on his shoulder and hand on his thigh. I don’t remember what he said, but he said something and then did a loop and started driving the way we had just come from. He turned onto a bridge which lead us to a secluded area where it looked like people had possibly gone camping over the years. He parked the truck and I’ll never forget him looking at me and telling me to take my pants and underwear off. I knew what was happening immediately, and I was uncomfortable and completely confused. I didn’t want to have sex with him, I hardly knew him. I wasn’t ready to do that with him, nor had it crossed my mind. I was trapped. No cell phone service, no one around for miles, pitch black and it’s 11pm. So I did what he said and took off my bottoms. I didn’t want him to help me take my clothes off, it made me more uncomfortable to think about than doing it myself. He started doing some foreplay which I’ve never liked so I am to the max uncomfortable now. I asked if he had a condom because I knew that even if I didn’t want this to happen I could protect myself from other things occurring from it. But what do you know, no condom. And for him no condom didn’t mean no sex. He had me lay down on he truck bench seat and he processed without a condom. 


I cried. I cried softly because I didn’t want him to hear. I didn’t want him to get scared off by me crying, so I did it silently. After a few minutes I felt like I was going to vomit and I told him to stop. He didn’t, he keep going. I laid there for a few more seconds until I finally pushed him away and told him I was done, this was not going to happen anymore. He stopped that time and we both redressed, got in his pickup and continued driving. I was now in the passenger seat rather than the middle seat. 


It took about 20 minute to get back to my car. I was now stone sober and shaky. I wasn’t mad at him though, I was mad at myself (I’ll circle back to that point). I was staying the night at my friend house down the road and by the time I get to her house it’s 11:45- midnight and she was awake just to say hello and then we went to bed. I stayed up all night so mad at myself. Everything that had just happened that night was my fault. I got in his truck willingly, I put myself in that situation, it was my fault he had sex with me because I didn’t keep myself out of that risky situation. I was so mad I did that to myself. 


The next week goes by. Kenny isn’t responded to hardly any texts, and when he does seems completely uninterested in our conversation. I would try so hard to keep up the conversation and try to make plans. Finally after another week of trying to reach out to him I took the hint and gave up. I basically had a one night stand with someone I kinda knew and then he ghosted me. I’m upset but I got over it. 


A couple years go by, we still have each other on Facebook. Kenny is in and out of engagements with people (he had two engagements that didn’t work out before me) and I date other people as well. I have a lot of guilt and shame tied to that night with him. I beat myself up often for getting in his truck. When I would talk to people about that encounter, I would say I’m the one who decided to get in his truck, drink, and smoke so that was my consequence therefore dismissing anything about it being rape. And everyone I had every talked to agreed with me. Every single person agreed he did not rape me because I voluntarily did all those things that led up to him having sex with me. But today I have a very different conversation and realization than I had ever had before. I explained the situation above to a friend and she was appalled when I said it was my fault it happened so I don’t hold it against him even though I do have trauma from that even. It was my mistake, I caused my own scar. 


She was so shocked to hear me say all of this. She told me although it was my choice to get in his car and partake in those events, that doesn’t give HIM the choice to do what he wants with my body. And she opened my eyes to what really happened: he bought me an alcoholic drink he knew would get me hammered over the tea I actually asked for. He pulled over and smoked weed with me. I know I could have chosen not to drink or smoke but I didn’t feel like I had a choice. I used to be that person that would do anything to make people happy, and specifically would do anything no to piss someone off/make them mad at me. I was still a minor who easy to manipulate, and he took advantage of that. For so long I’ve felt disgusted with myself for getting into that situation. After talking with my friend today I feel like I have been holding myself accountable for something that I shouldn’t be. 


About 6 months after this, I was 18 and I was dating a guy we will call Jerry, who was 20. Jerry paid for a tattoo that I had been wanting for a long time. That night I stayed the night at his house as he lived about an hour from my house and I didn’t want to drive home just to drive all the way back the next day to see him. That night when we were about to go to bed, he said since he paid for my tattoo I owed him something. I was shocked by this but he made me feel guilty since he paid for my tattoo. I truly felt like I owed him sex since he paid for it. Luckily he had a condom. I did not want to do it as I had just had my situation with Kenny and I was not ready to have sex with someone. But there I was again. I was screaming inside but too scared to make him mad to say anything. He stopped after a few minutes. I thought this was another one of those times where I put myself in the situation so I deserved it, but it was another situation my friend was horrified to hear. 


I’m lost. The advice/thoughts/opinions I need are for how to proceed. My friend thinks I should take legal action against Kenny for sure. This is mainly so I can get the proper help I need from these events as it effects me more than I realize. I have trauma that I recognize is from those situations from both Kenny and Jerry. For so long I thought I was the reason for what happened so I’ve never dealt with the trauma and it really effects me and my relationship. Many times when my S/O is on top of me during intercourse I will have a panic attack or get extremely uncomfortable and we have to stop. Foreplay isn’t enjoyable, and send panic through my body as well. I feel guilty I can’t fully give myself to my significant other because of the past. I don’t know what to do. Is it even right to take legal action? It was 5 years ago almost. I don’t want to ruin the guys life, I just want to get help to get over it all. The guilt, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, I don’t want it to have a hold on me anymore. I would love to see a counselor or someone but broke as a joke is an understatement and USA healthcare is ridiculous.

I’ve known these two friends for sometime, almost 12 years and grew up with them throughout school etc. 

We have recently been in contact again, and gone out for drinks (all three of us), and we are all single due to similar circumstances... which is how we ended up re-connecting. 

Now, I have a particular liking to one of them, and they’re both honestly brilliant. 

Tonight, we all went out for drinks, so it was a nice chilled evening, and we all shared stories about what’s been happening within our lives etc...

The thing is, me and one of the girls have been talking a fair bit, which means that I had cogs turning in my head, and ultimately meant that I really like one of them more as a friend... 

You see where this is going, right? 

I don’t want to split up the friendship group, because we’re all close again, but I really do take a fancy on one of them. 

Am I a bad person? Should I forget and try and move on, instead of risking losing the friendship?

I know that no matter how old we are, we will always be kids to our parents/those who raised us, however this feels like too much of a problem in my case. I was never allowed to disagree with my family because they would say I am immature, even though it is a normal process to fight with family members. I would love to leave them and move out but I  feel like it could be a stupid choice because there are many business opportunities with them(even though I always hated this idea of working with them).

Since I got into adulthood, I didn't have any issues with replacing those childhood habits with better alternatives. But I find it really, REALLY hard to not go back to them when I have to sit still.

Example: I write as a hobby, am a IT Tech (homeoffice in the pandemic) and like gaming. The issue is that since I sit still for long periods of time without any kind of movement, I start chewing my tongue. 

I don't do it consciously. When I notice, my tongue is already severely swollen and hurt. I tried watching my behavior but as long as I focus again on the task at hand, it comes back.

1101,"Me(M22) and this girl(22), I’ll call her M were friends for a majority of our teenage lives. It was a platonic friendship as we both had our own partners on and off during the friendship. We were inseparable tho and trusted each other completely/did everything together. But in early 2017 I fell stupidly in love with a girl. But she was insecure of me and M’s friendship and wanted me to cut it off. I was so stupid for agreeing. About 1.5 years later my gf cheated on me and we ended things. This was only a few weeks after I found out messages of my dad cheating on my mom. 
I didn’t really have anyone to turn to so I tried talking to M again. I admit I approached it terribly, basically just ranting about what happened without taking her feelings into account. But she had told me that I had hurt her ALOT when I cut her off and that she wasn’t sure she wanted to be friends again/ she would need to think about it. At the time I was devastated by that (Now I can see she made a completely reasonable response). This + all the cheating going in my life got me messed up in the head. I basically ghosted her again  and did the same with everyone I knew. Eventually I just deleted all my social media, changed my number  and haven’t used any of it for almost 2 years. Until this week. I had done a lot of self reflection and gotten some help for all the stuff I had been dealing with at the time for those 2 years. Now I feel pretty okay with myself and what happened. But in those two years I would always think about M. I didn’t even miss my ex or anyone else but I missed M all the time. And still do. 

When I downloaded social media again this month she popped up in my recommendations. I’ve been hesitant about whether to even bother sending her a friend request. As far as I can tell, I was a selfish asshole who left her TWICE. Sure I may have had my reasons but it doesn’t excuse any of it. From what I’ve heard from mutual friends she seems to be doing well. And I’m genuinely happy for her. And because of that I don’t think I should try to hit her up. She’s moved on most likely and doesn’t deserve to have all those bad feelings be brought up if I try to talk to her. But I can’t help but feel so sad that I can’t sleep and my heart hurts.

1102,"I have a gmail account associated with an online business, like businessName@gmail. I do have the domain but I keep the gmail since it is what I started with and sometimes customers, especially old repeat ones, use that one.

But this kid, at least I assume kid, for the last few months has been signing up for everything under the sun and putting my gmail as their email address. Being a not-creepy adult I delete the accounts where I can as they are created and the ones that don't seem to allow for deletion I change the password on.

Now, I will admit I am a bit behind on modern phones. I have an iPhone 5 so a lot of apps don't work on it and really I only use the thing for phone calls and texting. I was unaware that a large number of apps let you use the email associated with the account to reset the password but **do not unlink the app from the device even when the password has been reset.** (Which really makes me think Apple and Google need to reevaluate their app guidelines but that is off topic.)

This kid was fully using these Apps even though I had changed the password. I can't delete the accounts because you can only do that from in the app, which I cannot download because my phone is too freaking old. 

Recently this kid created a Life360 account which has granted me way too much of their personal information. Scary amounts. And yes, I changed the password but the account did not unlink from their device. To top it off its not just the person data of this kid but also their entire family. The one good side is now I have their parents email addresses and phone numbers.

I figure I should send the parents an email about how their kid has been (hopefully by accident) using my email address and granting me access to all this crap. I want it to stop so I can stop cleaning up these stupid accounts and I really don't want this child's personal data!

I decided to re enroll and am currently enrolled in a major that's a ""safe"" bet but that I don't have very much interest in. My parents have been pretty vocal about their opinions and I felt forced to just pick a major and try to get back into school asap. Well now, my financial aid has yet to go through(1st time receiving financial aid) because forms are still being reviewed, I'm being charged out of state tuition due to my previous transcripts being out of state so I had to petition for in-state tuition which still hasn't been approved (I've lived in my current state for over a year now, which is their minimum for in-state tuition).
I've had to ask my parents to borrow money to pay for my classes until everything goes through and I can pay them back. It's the first time I've asked to borrow money since I was 14 and it was hard to admit I needed help. After a few days of thinking they agreed, but haven't given me the money yet because the school charges an outrageous fee to pay with a card and they have no checks linked to the account and getting a temporary check is apparently out of the question

I've been so stressed.. I want my degree so much, I've put in years and thousands of dollars of my own money into this, I'm no where near close to my degree because of switching my major and not having an advisor my first 2 years of college due to an oversight.

&amp;#x200B;

And throwaway, duh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in March, specifically 25 March, I became friends with this girl, who was Slovenian. 

At first, everything was good, we were best buddies and I loved talking to her. Then slowly, I noticed her 'mask' (I don't know if that was the right word) started to slip off. 

She always made me feel terrible about such small things, for example, once I [rolled my ankle](https://imgur.com/t/ankle/L7sSbAx) on accident and she started basically screaming at me calling me stupid, an idiot, and how 'no one does that!' I remember me telling her that she was making me feel terrible, and instead of a simple, ""oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that."" I get a ""BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA BAKA WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO THAT?"" Like it was my fault I rolled my ankle? Okay then. 

She also always bragged about, well, being Slovenian.  It felt like she was saying to me almost every day, ""Hey! Did you know I'm from Slovenia? And you're from the crappy Belarus that no one likes?"" Now repeat that cycle for almost two months. 

This girl did other stuff that I don't really remember. 

So 3 months ago I decided to end our friendship because I was just sick of her. 

Now, here I am, 3 months later, still thinking about her. It's usually just like fake conversations. Like where I imagine a conversation between us that won't happen. And I really want it to stop. It's pretty annoying seeing your brain not accept that we're not friends anymore and move on. 

I have tried to restrict any accounts that @ her or just post her stuff, and I sincerely hope this helps.

1109,"ok, so i am 14 (m) and i have 2 siblings (one of each gender) and i do not get along. so, during the pandemic i have lost contact with most of my friends, leaving me alone with my family. and the only people who i trust, are either my dad (who lives the other side of the contary) , or can only be talked to via discord or steam. and because i don't live with anyone i like (except the dogs) i spend most of my time in my room, playing video games. 

and my mum is your stariotipal karen, and she hates video games and wants me to ""spend time with my family"". yeah, the family that i don't even like. 

my little brother crys all the time and overreacts even if you pat him on the back. then he said i slapped him.

my little sister is better but still gets on my nerves a bit.

and my MUM! well, for example she wanted me to: go camping, then get my friend from the other side of the country round for a week, then the next day, my two shitheads of my many cousins round for a week, midway through she brought my elderly grandparents and there dog round, they are going next sunday, which means i only have 3 days until school. 

its just to much. 

i constantly feel tired and worn out, so i sleep in constantly, meaning i get told off, making me want to stay in bed longer to avoid her, to then get told off more. 

the ONE time i made her see sense was when she wanted us to go camping after we got back from our dad's (yes, my parents broke up when i was little) which is the only time i feel relaxed, and then i broke down crying that i didn't wan't to go camping with her as i don't like camping. my dad turned around and drove 20 minutes back and picked me up, and took me back to his.
so i spent a week at his, he had a lot of work to catch up on, so it was just me, but he would take every other afternoon off, so we go on 1-3 hour bike rides (i love mountain biking). and the rest of the time i was by myself. i didn't feel lonely, i felt free. the was no-one to juge me. i could do whatever the fuck i wanted. That is even how the posts about my rubber ducks came to be. 
for the first time in about a year (the problem started getting worse around then), i was happy. not false happy or temporarily happy, that week was one of the best weeks of my life (yes, that about sums it up).

so now I'm tired exhausted, and just feel horrible.

here's another example! 
i usually spend Christmas at my granmar's house but my grandad was a bit ill (vomited once), so i spent my Christmas in the house of a guy we only met once, and who got into arguments with my mum all through Christmas day. it ruined Christmas because she put us into a strangers house. 
i never saw him afterwards, which was a shame, as we saw eye to eye on a lot of things (including my mum).

she fucking ruins everything. i just need dome advice. and if you are a relative of family member and know who i am and show this to her, I WILL FUCKING BEAT YOU TO DEATH WITH THE BACKSIDE OF A HAMMER. yes, a family member found my old account, so i ditched it and made this one.",01Sep2020,1

I'm currently in my last year of high school in the Netherlands, 12th grade in many other countries.
Last year I started a two-year high school honours program at a university. All went well until the last assignment of that year. We were completely free in what to do for it, as long as it had to do with validity, reliability and such about doing research.
I couldn’t think of what to do and ended up handing in some half ideas for feedback as was suggested, but way too close to the deadline. 
Luckily they weren’t too strict about it and gave me some more time. However, this deadline had to be moved multiple times, because I simply procrastinated on working on it way too much.
I had a chat with a teacher there, and she suggested i quit the program after that first year, but because I was excited for the research paper we would do (in duo’s) the second year, they gave me the summer holiday to work on the assignment.

That deadline is due Thursday. It's Tuesday night right now, don’t have too much time tomorrow, and I haven’t made any progress over the past few weeks.

1111,"I studied a few years in nursing at University, but never really enjoyed it. I wanted to quit for a long time, and when I got the opportunity to study overseas in a different course along with my sister, I did. The problem with studying in a different country is, even though I get a student loan, it is a lot more expensive, and all of the expenses will go in my debt.

I ended up enjoying my experience overseas a lot, not just the different course. I loved the lifestyle, being a little more independent. I liked the course too, but it was never something I dreamed about - it was fine and interesting, and the professors were definitely more helpful and welcoming than the ones I had in nursing. But I was finally loving my life.

Because of Covid, I had to come back home, and the current economic situation is making me scared to go back. I'm 22 and never had a job, so my parents are paying for the entirety of it, except for food which I pay for on my own. If I went back, I would get myself a part time job to help pay for it, and it could most likely cover the rent and other expenses. Still, the debt worries me. It is about €30k in total debt, plus about €15k for rent. However, if I stayed home and finished nursing, I would pay much less (because it's a much smaller university and I would live with my parents), and the course fees would be around €1k.

The last year I did in nursing was terrible for me, I was close to failing and I was miserable to the point my professor was pulling me aside and asking me to visit the university psychologist. Before I went to study something different, I already knew I wanted to quit nursing. So it worries me that I might not even be capable of finishing a course I don't enjoy. I could still go back to the other course after finishing nursing, but that would mean I would have to pay the fees myself - no more loan.

I'm still unsure of what my true passion is and what I want to do for the rest of my life. My sister, who is my best friend, is dropping out of uni, which means I would move overseas completely on my own this time. This is scary, I don't like the idea of leaving the only ones that care about me (my family) behind. Especially in such a delicate situation, I would be lying if I said the virus in a university setting doesn't scare me.

My mind has been constantly racing and I haven't been able to rest in a very long time. I'm so stressed and anxious, and I'm sure the rest of my family is tired of it, but I can't help but feel this way. I feel like I'm being selfish for wanting to go back, because I enjoyed life overseas so much, but again, the course (which was the main reason I went) does not feel like my true passion.  However at the same time, I'm afraid that if I stay I'll be wasting my life on something I don't love - that is if I'm even capable of finishing without failing.

Instead of getting a dorm, I got a apartment since my tuition would be cheaper and I'm a junior because I went to a community college. Anyways, my dad wasn't happy with either decision. He wanted me to go to the university that was less than a hour away from home and get a dorm because ""paying rent is hard."" Let me add, my rent is ridiculously cheap. I owe 541 per month since I live in a student apartment. He tried to gaslight me into regretting my decision but I saw through it. My mom wasn't too happy either but she recognized that I'm an adult and making my own decisions is part of life. Anyways, I've been trying to get a job since I got here and he keeps trying to convince me to not go back to serving because its ""not guaranteed pay."" Whatever the fuck that means. I called him today and told him about my interview but I told him I probably won't accept it because I probably wouldn't get enough hours. He raised his voice and said I need to get a job and don't go back into serving and I surprisingly called him out for yelling. But he kind of just ignored my remark. My thing is I probably will go back to serving since that's where I have most experience and it's hard trying to get a on campus or retail job thats compatible with my school hours. My dad always does this bullshit. He didn't want me to get my car shipped and instead keep it there in my hometown. My sister asked him before I moved how was I gonna get my car down here and he deadass said ""she can make her own decisions, even though her decisions are bad decisions."" Let me remind you guys I will be 22 in three weeks. So I'm not a freshly adult I'm in my 20s for fucks sake. My dad called me out for calling my mom and my grandmother more than him but I think its subconsciously because I don't like telling him my plans because he wants me to do things his way, in his words ""he's trying to guide me but I don't listen."" He tries to throw my mom in there but my mom only gives advice but she doesn't insist she's right or try to manipulate me like he does. I think he gets it from my grandmother because she's a top manipulator lol.
For the record, I love my dad. I'm his first daughter and his first child in general. He was 19 when I was born so we basically grew up together so I do love him and enjoy his company when he's not trying to pull his typical bullshit.

1114,"Yes, this is a throwaway account. I don’t want any private information getting out about who I am that might get back to me and put me in danger or make me lose my housing. 

(Context) 
I have two older brothers. Both had sexually abused me in my childhood and I have since been able to convince my parents that I no longer wish to see them. I have also been through therapy to help with PTSD and other trauma related to the abuse that happened to me as a kid. 

I do live with my parents who are currently providers for my housing, and I currently can not afford to live on my own. 

I’m confident enough that I do not think my brothers can hurt me any further and if they tried to I’d be able to defend myself. 

With that said, technically, I don’t have to worry about them anymore. But over the last few years I’ve had genuine concerns that at least one of my two brothers (I’ll call him B) could seriously hurt someone. He doesn’t show any remorse for hurting me or anyone else. He has admitted to me (in the past, before I cut ties with him) that he fantasizes about raping women and killing people. 

Some notable things are fantasies of hurting animals (specifically dogs, we grew up with a lot of dogs), raping me, killing and chopping up our mother, killing coworkers, and raping women. 

I understand it’s one thing to say something and completely different to actually act on them. But I want to express how serious I think it is and that he has a bit of history of enacting violence. He has done some sexual acts to a dog of our family’s that has since passed. He has sexually abused and raped me. He has tried to kill me (or has said he has tried to kill me) twice via suffocation. 

My other brother (A) isn’t as outrightly violent and I do have a genuine hope that he has some sense of morality and empathy. He has admitted to also wanting to harm a coworker with a blade and besides a past of sexually abusing me has (not-so-directly) expressed wanting to force sex on women. 

My parents refused to talk to me about concerns I’ve had over the years. My mom still refuses to talk with me about the whole thing. But a few days ago I was able to talk with my dad who admits to me he is worried that B “Has got a few screws loose”.

I understand a bit more now that my parents genuinely feel bad that they didn’t protect me from my brothers, but also that my brothers are their children too and didn’t want them to go to prison. 
My brothers did go to therapy for a while but my parents took them out after they refused to work with or talk to the therapist. I don’t think they are aware of how dangerous their actions could be if they do act on/ are acting on them. 

(My concerns)
The problems I would face with simply reporting this and calling it a day is that I have no evidence of being sexually and physically abused by my brothers as it took place years ago. But I’m terrified that they may potentially hurt someone else, or if they have kids they will hurt their kids. I’m at a loss and I don’t know what to actually do to at least make it known to police or anyone who might be at risk that they need to be alert and watch out for anything suspicious or dangerous. 

So, r/Advice; is there any ways I can at least report a potential threat to authorities without it being swept under the rug? What can/should I do? Is there something more that I can do than crossing my fingers and hoping all goes well? What do I do if I find out my brothers have hurt someone else?

I know it’s a lot and I’ve been stressing over this for years, but I’m desperate for any advice. Thank you in advance to anyone who reads this and has any ideas.",01Sep2020,1
1115,"I don't want to make this too long, but I just moved for college. I moved about 5 hours away. Instead of getting a dorm, I got a apartment since my tuition would be cheaper and I'm a junior because I went to a community college. Anyways, my dad wasn't happy with either decision. He wanted me to go to the university that was less than a hour away from home and get a dorm because ""paying rent is hard."" Let me add, my rent is ridiculously cheap. I owe 541 per month since I live in a student apartment. He tried to gaslight me into regretting my decision but I saw through it. My mom wasn't too happy either but she recognized that I'm an adult and making my own decisions is part of life. Anyways, I've been trying to get a job since I got here and he keeps trying to convince me to not go back to serving because its ""not guaranteed pay."" Whatever the fuck that means.


 I called him today and told him about my interview but I told him I probably won't accept it because I probably wouldn't get enough hours. He raised his voice and said I need to get a job and don't go back into serving and I surprisingly called him out for yelling. But he kind of just ignored my remark. My thing is I probably will go back to serving since that's where I have most experience and it's hard trying to get a on campus or retail job thats compatible with my school hours. My dad always does this bullshit. He didn't want me to get my car shipped and instead keep it there in my hometown. My sister asked him before I moved how was I gonna get my car down here and he deadass said ""she can make her own decisions, even though her decisions are bad decisions."" 

Let me remind you guys I will be 22 in three weeks. So I'm not a freshly adult I'm in my 20s for fucks sake. My dad called me out for calling my mom and my grandmother more than him but I think its subconsciously because I don't like telling him my plans because he wants me to do things his way, in his words ""he's trying to guide me but I don't listen."" He tries to throw my mom in there but my mom only gives advice but she doesn't insist she's right or try to manipulate me like he does. I think he gets it from my grandmother because she's a top manipulator lol.


For the record, I love my dad. I'm his first daughter and his first child in general. He was 19 when I was born so we basically grew up together so I do love him and enjoy his company when he's not trying to pull his typical bullshit. How do I politely remind him that I'm an adult and my decisions are my decisions and if I do fuck up, then it's apart of life?",01Sep2020,1

So I had inspired 2 of my friends to trade options in the stock market with me. I’ve always done it on the side for a couple hundred bucks for side money every week but I never took it seriously till now due to quarantine. I have been doing this for awhile now almost 2 years. So for the next 2-3 months I was happy to explain how it worked, and explained a lot of things I wish I knew early on. One I spent more time with and was pretty grateful and we still collaborate on future opportunities we see. While the other one treats trading like gambling blindly following other people’s signals. (Which is pretty much where u pay to copy someone’s trade). He does very high risk plays and it has paid off for him. He’s made 24k in 2 months. While I made $2.7k in the time. We both started with the same 10k account size too. Now granted I’m not sure if he can sustain this and I don’t wish badly on him, but it just pisses me off how he has done so well so fast.

How should i act after A touchy massage between friends, urgent advice needed

People of reddit,
I need your advice
So me, (M 25) have a crush on my friend (F26) let’s call her Emma for a while now.
I tried to move on and not mentioning it, but I couldnt get over her.

So last sunday, we were on the beach with 2 other friends, and we spent the day drinkimg and swimming
During the sunset we decided to take our last dip in the water and watch it calmly, i was too tired to swim so i decided to grab a beer and enjoy the sunset waiting for them
They stayed in the water for a while, and i ended up having 6 beers before they came

One of my friends told me that she needed a massage, i was drunk and we were laughing and i gave her a massage, then Emma came, and saw us, I suggested to give her a massage as well
She accepted gladly, and sat on the sunbed between my legs, and i started massaging her, 
I was so drunk and told her to lay on me so that it becomes easier to give her a neck massage
She did and soon enough i remember our friends getting away for a while and me kissing her neck and back and smelling her, i even told her to leave her phone which she did without hesitation

I am a dentist myself, i know im young, but that is another story
She was complaining about jaw pain, so i asked to face while out bodies were touching and i was touching her face and her mouth obviously, checking for thr problem, and then she layed back on me



I even started touching her boobs and she didnt mind at all
I even gave her a foot massage 
Later our friends came back and brought more beers
I had to go to the bathroom,
Came back and sat in my place, my friend brought her towel and sat back between my legs and while i got more drunk, i was hugging her from behind and kissing her hair and neck all the time

And we even joked that i need to marry her after i get my first million $

After a while, it was around midnight and all of us had to work the next day
So we hurried up and took our stuff and left the beach.

The next day we were talking and I made sure to talk to my friends as well...i needed to know if i made something more stupide
I talked to her joking, i wasnt sure was have I said while drunk 
She was so positive and we talked the whole day
And my friend told me she sent her a short video of me dancing in the car on our way home( i was not driving LoL)


My question is, i am gonna see her tomorrow to work on something
I dont know if she will say anything about what happened, i am not sure how to behave
Im so in love with her but i think she had friend zoned me, because we are friends from years ago and i recently started to really love her, 
I have wanted to tell her for a while now, but i am afraid of the rejection so i decided to switch my attitude towards her slowly before i tell her about my feeling( not sure she didnt notice LoL)

Should i apologize to her for what have i done?
Should i mention it at all?
Should i act like i did nothing?
Thank you!

I'm getting really worried and I don't know what else I can do.

He says that his parents know about it and apparently tried to talk to him about it in the past, but he's not getting treatment for it or anything. I'm tempted to send a message to his mom asking if she can help him or find him a therapist. I've never talked to her directly but I have a way to potentially get in contact with her. The only thing is that whenever I ask him about talking to his mom, he gets really scared about it and practically begs me not to. He says that she's gotten angry with him for having mental issues in the past and thrown stuff at him and I'm worried she might blow up about it again and do more harm than good. Still, I don't know what else to do and this might be the only chance to get him some actual help before something truly terrible happens to his health.

I rejoin the server and just start questioning him and just starting insulting him, to be honest I didn’t notice that I brought up one of the things we were meant to keep secret, but after I remembered I removed it straight away.

He just got kicked out of his place because his dog got into the trash and his landlord got reeeally mad, didn't like that my bf suggested emptying the trash of meat so the dog wouldn't be interested. All in all clearly not a dog person or a good fit. 
SO now he has nowhere to live and there is a housing crisis in his town as many mountain lovers flood there and take up housing options for the winter months. 
I fuckin suggested him coming to live in my city because it is super cheap to live here and there are SO MANY places for rent right now. Literally billions! Pet friendly and all. 
But no. 
He does not want to leave the mountains and said he might have to skip town and just find another mountain town to live...
That means moving farther away from me, God knows how far. 
I'm just shocked that I must mean so little to him he would rather run farther away from me than compromise for a minute and make it work. 
I feel so shattered and heartbroken as if we've already broken up because it feels like we are inevitably going to.

1146,"I know that immediately a lot of people will be thrown off by my age and tell me i’m being stupid. I understand and if that’s all that you’ve got to say to me, I would appreciate it left unsaid. Thank you and I once again understand your concern! I’m engaged right now with a wedding planned in about 6 months. 

My fiancé and I had an unexpected pregnancy back in February and it ended in an ectopic pregnancy. I had internal bleeding and almost died because of it. For about a month and a half  I genuinely believed I was going to be a mom and we told our immediate family obviously and the support and planning that went into that time was overwhelmingly great. I haven’t been able to get over it and all i’ve thought about since then is having a baby. It’s been extremely difficult for me. 

After this happened, the doctor told me that he thinks that although i’m able to get pregnant again through my other tube, having a baby past 30 will prove even more difficult for me than it’s would for others given the health of my individual reproductive system. 

I don’t have the type of personality where I like going out to clubs or hanging out with friends. My perfect day is just staying home. I had a very rough childhood which caused me to grow up quickly and a lot of the things people do in college for fun I did in high school and never found the thrill. I just don’t like it. I find it difficult to relate to people my age and I have very few friends (some of which are decades my senior) but I prefer it that way. 

Logistics wise, my fiancé and I make about a combined 70k a year and my fiancé is about to finish up with college so it should go up. I’m in school as a pre med, but I genuinely enjoy my classes and don’t really have many problems. I work nights as a CNA and have about 4+ hours a shift where I can just sit down and do my school work. I’m also 100% okay with taking a year or two off even if it delays things in the long run. I would really like to avoid having a child in medical school though, I would just like to start and finish that. Undergrad feels a little bit more lenient with taking a year off then getting back into the grind. Which is what I am more comfortable with and as i mentioned previously, I don’t want to run into complications that come with having a baby after 30 (AKA after i’m out of school). 

My fiancé would also like to get a job from home as he works in coding and computers so that he can be a stay at home dad while I study. We both really want this baby. Our families are extremely supportive of us and especially my fiancé’s family is very well off so all fiancés would 100% not be a problem. 

I feel like the only hesitation I have is just the stigma that comes with having kids young. I feel like I’ll be ridiculed for planning a kid so young.

That was two days ago and he hasn’t responded. Should I just let it be and wait for him to get back to me or should I send him another DM about it? He hasn’t read the last one.

1149,"I have pretty bad anxiety and am 90% percent sure I'm depressed and I want to start fixing my life. These mental blockers are making it near impossible to anything with my life, which of course just makes me more depressed.

The first thing I need to do is go to the doctor and get a full check up, because I think there may be some kind of illness I'm avoiding but I am TERRIFIED of going to the doctor because I've convinced myself it's cancer or something. It's gotten to the point where I went in for a covid test and my heart rate/BP was shot through the roof out of fear.  Now, I'm just avoiding going to the doc's but am also freaking myself out with all these symptoms n such.

Any good advice?",01Sep2020,1
1150,"The title says it all, I'm male 19 and undeniably not that attractive looking. For a few years I've been trying to meet someone, but it always ends up with me being ghosted or ignored. I do chat with people in person fairly often, but that has a dead end and trying to get things a step further never works.

Lately I've been trying to meet people online on certain sites too, just for the sake of it. But everytime I send that person a picture of myself, I end up getting blocked within a few seconds. I don't even know what to do at this point anymore. Is it even worth it to actively look for a companion? Oftentimes weeks, even months go by without me being able to chat with anyone, and when I do try to do something about it, I fail miserably and feel extremely guilty for bothering whoever it was that I tried chatting with. Last night it happened again, and right after that I deactivated all of my social media accounts because I've had enough of it.

1151,"So basically for the last year I was doing my Masters in film and on the side I was teaching film for one hour every Saturday in a theatre school (well until Covid). In June my boss died leaving the theatre school in the hands of people my age; early to mid 20s. 

So now I’ve just finished my masters and I applied for a job as a film programme director in a college and it’s pretty good money. 45k for a four day week. I went for the first interview, did well. Went for the 2nd interview and got offered the job. Yay! 

Except one of the four days I have to work is a Saturday which is not ideal as I teach in the theatre school on a Saturday. So now I’m conflicted. I love teaching in the theatre school and feel indebted to not abandon the new directors after our boss died before their first year in charge but I’d be fucking crazy to turn down 45k for four days a week from October to May. 

My solution is that I accept the film programme director and just take two hours off each Saturday so I can still teach in the film school. Any advice on how to handle this?",01Sep2020,1

1154,"This is my first reddit post and I’m on mobile. Beware. It’s also very long, but I need to include everything prior to this for context. 

I know that some of the things in this show poor behavior on my part, however I would ask not to be judged on that at this time. 

Here is the backstory: 

So my (18F) twin sister (18F) and I are not very close. This is due, in part, to me moving out of my mother’s household and in with my grandparents when I was 14. My mother and stepfather are alcoholics and it was, in general, not a good place for my mental heath. I fear that my sister, let us call her Lena, resents me for this. We work in the same place and live together, but we don’t generally talk about anything deep unless it’s to joke over our upbringing and ptsd. A great coping mechanism, I am well aware. 

My sister began dating this boy she met online about 5-ish months ago, let’s call him Harry (22M). I dislike him immensely. We fight every time we talk. He lives an hour away (by a very tricky highway) and previous to the following part of the story, my father had told Lena that neither him nor I will drive her up to see this boy. I was expressly forbidden from taking her to Harry’s house. Lena does not have her license. I believed they were having sexual relations, but every time I subtly asked her, she acted entirely disgusted by any mention of sex. I could tell she was lying (at least about them just hanging out), but I knew I wouldn’t get much out of her, so I dropped it and moved on. 

It came to a head one Sunday morning a month or so ago. I woke up, perhaps around 10/11, and she was gone. Upon questioning my father, it seemed Harry had picked her up that morning with an Uber. I’m talking 8 am. She had told me the previous night that he kept pushing her to go to his place and she didn’t want to, so I was angry and confused upon learning that she left. I was mostly angry because she told me (once I texted her that morning) that she hadn’t figured out a ride back and “I’ll just take an uber” just wasn’t good enough for me. I’ve heard the stories and I didn’t want to risk her on an hour ride back with a stranger; we both knew I would fold and drive out there to pick her up whenever her little heart desired. So I went into her room, feeling a little lost, and found her iPad. It was by luck that I knew her password, and I got in. I read her messages with him. I got an idea of what was going on and I was distraught. I knew I shouldn’t have invaded her privacy but I was just so worried and angry and I thought I should make sure she’s okay, you know? The messages ate at me. They kept talking about how she would run away with him and how they’d get married and how, when he was fully accepted back into the military (he had previously left because he didn’t like it or something equally as stupid), they could live on base and raise a family. She could cut off all contact and they would make it work. (He had, at this point, also quit his job as a gas station clerk, because he didn’t like it. He had no source of income and kept asking Lena to give him money, be it for cigarettes, or to renew his license, which he needed for the military, or so I was told). He would constantly insult me and my father over how we “tried to keep them apart.” How my dad was pathetic and wanted to take away the only good thing in Harry’s life. I read further. From what I could gather, they had been having unprotected sex. They never said it outright, but she had mentioned that getting pregnant wasn’t an option and she’d be shunned if she did (she wouldn’t) and he kept responding that it was fine and he pulled out in time, so I just assumed. 

At this time, Lena was living with our mother and stepfather and I was living with my father due to the pandemic. Lena would visit our father’s on the weekends and I would take her to work 5 days a week (before I was rehired there). Then, Lena was kicked out of our mothers and could not decide whether to move in with my father and I, or with Harry. 

I tried to get her to rethink her choices, but she kept rambling about how she couldn’t be a burden to her family anymore and she would move in with Harry. my father talked her out of moving in with Harry. We thought that was the end of it. Until the next week, she had 100% set her mind on moving in with him. Harry came the next day with a uhaul and took some of her stuff up to his house. Super sketchy, in my humble opinion. She stayed down here and was attempting to put in her two weeks in when our coworker (45F) and sister in law (26F) talked her out of it. Lena now agree upon living with my dad, but we had a problem. Her stuff was still at Harry’s. 

I was sick of Harry at this point, and told her we were going to get her stuff. Me and Lena talked and I finally got to show her that he was manipulative and he didn’t care about her. When she told him that we were coming to get her stuff, he attempted to get her to stay the night. I put my foot down, saying that I would take her up to get her stuff. Not stay the night. She relayed this and he lost it. He called her and asked to put him on speaker so that he could speak with me. I was ready. She asked him not to fight; she hates confrontation, a trigger of her ptsd from our living situation. She reluctantly puts him on speaker and he starts spewing some bs, and she says “Harry, please don’t fight....” and he straight up said to her, “we are just talking, like two adults. Don’t interrupt me again.” And I saw red. 

I told him we had stuff to do, (we didn’t, not really), and he hung up. He flipped on her, blaming her for not telling him she had stuff to do and now he looked like an idiot and she knows he hates that. He left her on read, and we left. Upon making the drive up, he got petty. Told Lena her stuff would be on his porch. I gleefully told her I would help her get it. About twenty minutes later, he told her her stuff would be in the house. I told her I’d stand on the porch and carry it down. He responded that I was not allowed on his property and he would carry it down. I was livid. I told her that if he didn’t want me on his property, I didn’t want him near my car. He got mad, as expected. “She can’t tell me where I can or cannot be.” And poor Lena was just trying to tell him it’s a fair compromise. He spat back “so you’re taking her side?!” 

We retrieved the items, Lena promised me she would break up with him, and we drive home. 

It was about this time that she told me about Cody (25M). He hit her up on Instagram and they had been talking for a few weeks. She thought Harry had tried to do a cheating test with Cody, so she never gave it a chance to progress and always mentioned she had a boyfriend. Imo, he was very kind, respected her boundaries, and allowed her to say no without demanding a full explanation, unlike Harry. He was still sketchy, but he at least was polite. 

I hadn’t heard about either Harry nor Cody for a week or two. She kept putting off breaking up with Harry, and when I brought it up she would scream at me. She never mentioned Cody again. They had hung out one or twice while I was at work. He picked her up and dropped her off so I was less mad, but he also lived an hour away.

That’s just the backstory. I apologize for length. Now here’s where I need the advice. 

Today, she was napping and I was in her room. Her phone went off, it was our younger sister (12F) asking for some login or something. I asked Lena, who sleepily replied she didn’t have it. I tried to text back my little sister, but the phone was locked. When the password option came up, I got curious. Would it really be the same password?? And it was. So I texted my sister back and my finger slipped and accidentally got into her and Cody’s messages... 

I knew I shouldn’t read... but I did. And I learned they’ve been at least having oral sex. I didn’t read further for fear of her waking up. 

I went back to my room and I admit I shed a few tears. I know that she’s 18, but I can also tell that she’s getting mixed up with things that she shouldn’t be. I don’t know how to help her! She’s my sister and she doesn’t even trust me enough to ask me to get her condoms or anything, which I would! Maybe a few looks and a lecture ab being safe, but I would. 

She’s still in a relationship with Harry, and while she hasn’t been up there since we picked up her belongings, she’s still having sex with one guy while she’s dating another. There was an unread message from a third guy, who called her baby boo. This third guy (18M) is an ex of hers and lives across the country, but I don’t know if they’re just really close and that’s why she has a nickname like that from him. 

I don’t want to assume she’s having a relationship with all three of these guys, but I also know for a fact that she has had sex even before meeting Harry and Cody, and lied to me about it. 

So I’m asking for advice. 

Do I pressure her into telling me the truth; like what’s going on with Harry and Cody? Or do I let her make her own mistakes and watch her face the consequences? Do I try to be overly supportive without mentioning I know so she feels like she can talk to me and tell me the truth? 

I can’t come clean. I never plan to. Not only would it further damage our relationship, it may make her rethink everything I’ve said, and think I actually have been trying to push her away from her boys, and run back to either Harry or Cody, who would have her cut all contact with me and my father. It’s just not an option. 

I just want her to be safe. I don’t want her to end up like my mother. I don’t want to lose her.

Tl;dr

My (18F) sister (18F) is making poor life choices. I know because I read through her messages. So do I let her make her own mistakes, show her I’m here for her if she needs me, or do I force her to tell me what she’s lying to me about not doing?",01Sep2020,1

Luckily, I started my first ""Big Girl"" job this week, and will be financially set once that ball gets rolling. Finances were always a taboo topic in my family, and I have a fiercely independent mindset. I also know that my mother is in a tough spot (not ""lose the house"" tough, shes just struggling to stay out of debt herself) so I feel uncomfortable asking for financial help, even if it's $100 that will be paid back within the month.",01Sep2020,1
1156,"I am still in the process of finding out who I am, but at the moment I think of myself as a combination of asexual and demisexual. It honestly shocks me how much sex is on everyone's mind and how weird I am for barely feeling sexually attracted to men. I often feel extremely surprised that within my groups of friends people constantly feel attracted to each other and have sex with each other. This just doesn't come naturally to me. What makes it even more awkward is that I am very tall and considered attractive by majority of my friends. 

Sexuality or lack of thereof should be one's own business and of course I hang out with people who appreciate me for who I am, but even knowing that, I still feel a lot of pressure to find a partner or a lover. I know that people shouldn't judge but I feel like they do anyway as if being asexual makes me defected.",01Sep2020,1

I want to give them to the kids in my complex but without seeming like a creep or pedo! I put out a jar filled with lollipops and a note saying “take some for you and your friends and leave some for your neighbors. Remember to be kind”

So far I think some lollipops have been taken. 
Is this a good idea to continue on just slowly putting more and more candy out in a jar? I was thinking of saving them for Halloween but it might be old by then and I literally have so much to even last til Halloween.",01Sep2020,1
1158,"So heres my situation; my cousin is FtM and is dating his bisexual gf. They met at work and have been dating for maybe 3 weeks or so now. I met her for the first time yesterday and all three of us hung out together for basically all of the day. It was really fun. 

As some backstory, I have not hung with my cousin since much at all for the past couple months because they are what I label as serial daters. They are polyamorous and have had probably 40 or more relationships in the past 5 years. They date often and have had upwards of 4 partners at a single time. An important note, these were all online, all LDR. The longest relationship they were in was 6 months and they never met that person. But hearing about the new relationships they hop in and all the drama involved was draining and I had to check out after a couple years of enduring it. So this hang out yesterday was a rare occurrence.

Anyways back to the story, I met their gf and I made efforts to break the ice and tell stories and just have fun. She opened up a lot and was crying from laughing which I havent really been able to make someone do in a while so that was nice. But we had multiple times of being alone and we had a lot in common. I was trying to involve my cousin many times but they were either too stoned or browsing their phone so it was often me and her talking. There were a good couple times where I'd catch her looking at me and her eyes would dart away. 

I couldn't help but feel some sort of chemistry between us. She came over to my place later with my cousin and immediately she got excited and suprised when she saw my periodic table I recently got on my wall. I know that sounds dumb, but she knew the exact youtuber, got excited about the poster, and the fact that it was a periodic table too. Like fuck man that had me surprised. 

Later in the night we had left to get some food and on my way home I jokingly mentioned, ""well shit maybe now I'll look into getting a job where u work."" My cousin has tried to land me a job there before but I was hesitant due to my fears of working with family and it souring the relationship. But they were like ""I'm telling you, you should work with me!"" And their gf added on saying ""Yes! Please come work with us!"" I mentioned immediately after, ""I'd feel bad, I don't want to infringe on your friendships and friend group."" The gf said, ""I'd love if you joined our friend group tho."" 

From there on we hung out more and started talking and just vibing really well on our favorites shows as kids, as well as memes, jokes, and interests. I really started to feel bad as time passed and I made sure to keep involving my cousin, but they just werent interested much. They held hands as they left later in the night and I was happy to see that, yet I couldn't get rid of this feeling.

Honestly as of today I feel really confused and shitty. I love my cousin and I know if I was in their situation I'd be livid if I found out my cousin was making moves behind my back. So I refuse to do anything to get between them. I've thought about getting a job where they both work like I joked about, but I fear that could exasperate the situation and or my feelings. Normally I can suppress and get rid of these feelings but their gf has me feeling different. 

I do not want to get between them, and am worried if i already have. Yet I feel frustrated cause this situation sucks, I dont want to lose this person all together if things go south between my cousin and them. Yet I feel it has to go if I dont want to jeopardize my friendship and bond with my cousin. What could I do to work through this? I'm just so lost and unsure...


TLDR; Me and my cousins gf really get along well if not better than my cousin and her. I feel like shit because this is a shitty situation. I'm unsure what to do but I wonder if the feelings are mutual between the gf and me.


Edit: I just remembered that my cousin had actually dated my best friend at the time about 3 years ago when I set them up. Only lasted a few days tho, but I helped set them up. Not sure if thats helpful, but maybe gives an idea that we've been wingman for each other before.",01Sep2020,1

I have a wonderful wife and a 9yo girl and 6yo boy. They’re amazing. But sometimes I feel like when I’m with them, I feel like I bring it all down. I’m negative, sensitive, get angry over stuff, can’t just enjoy the time together, etc... 

And yeah, sounds like an easy fix, like “relax man, just enjoy your family” or “don’t get so worked up about stupid stuff”... but it’s not easy...

I’m realizing these last few years, that, although I’ve felt like a thinker/do-er type personality, I seem to also be a feeler, meaning I’m very swayed by my emotions and feelings... I guess, in my life, that mostly means that I get frustrated with even the slightest inconvenience = My kids are being sensitive or moody, my wife not agreeing with me, someone being too sensitive, someone having attitude... it just propels me toward anger and bitterness. And I react in a way that doesn’t help, but makes things worse!

In my defense, I have never been violent. I could never hit anyone. I may have thrown a few objects in my life. But I would never harm someone out of anger..

However, emotionally, I feel like I abuse my wife and children. Make them feel guilty. Ridicule them. Belittle them. Make them feel inferior.. and EVERY TIME, afterwards, I feel like shit.

1163,"My fiance and I are both 23M. He currently lives in a household as an only child with a mother who is verbally and emotionally abusive and a stepfather who is emotionally unavailable. He has been blamed for their marriage issues, her depression, and many emotional issues they face that they force the blame onto him for. Because of this, he started having suicidal thoughts at a very young age. He's been through a lot and I'm so incredibly proud of him for still being here and holding his head up high. He is so attentive and loving and kind to me all the time. He constantly ignores his own feelings to attend to mine and my sorrows and issues often overshadow his. I grew up with several older siblings that all had emotional issues and two parents that were not expecting me. I was very much the ""oops"" baby that was born over a decade after the child before me. My parents, no longer having the patience to raise another child so late in life, were abusive in many ways. Because of this, I experience many bad emotional and mental issues and have been diagnosed with BPD and clinical depression along with a handful of other labels. Here's my issue. I often times listen to my fiance tell me his feelings of inadequacy and depression, along with thoughts of suicide. My immediate response is always anger and I'm not sure why. I care about him so much and I want him in my life forever. I have to force myself not to tell him horrible things, such as that he would feel better if he just grew up and left his household. I know the reason he's still there and that's a topic unrelated, but I agree with his reasoning. However, I still constantly complain and whine that I miss him and I hate that he's ""choosing his parents over me"" which I know isn't true. When he tells me his thoughts, they often get overshadowed by my own. He has even told me that he doesn't think he ""deserves"" to feel depressed because I have obviously been through ""so much more"" and have more severe issues. I need good coping mechanisms for depression, especially a partner's depression. I'm so scared I'll say something horrible that I don't mean and he'll just get tired and leave. He's used to having people he cares about say awful things to him, so he's always justifying my actions, but I KNOW they are not okay. I need to change so he can be happy and our relationship doesn't break apart because of this. Any advice is appreciated. I understand I'm an asshole to him, I know I'm wrong. I just want to find ways to be better. As soon as he moves out, I'm going to gently push therapy and medication options his way. He does go to therapy, but his doctor is a family member who doesn't really show interest in any of his issues and pushes different pills his way. Please help!

He was basically having an OCD meltdown and it almost ruined my family holiday for me in summer 2019. I had to keep checking my phone to calm him down and was hearing hurtful crap he insisted wasn't real, about his attraction to others. He has apologised over and over, but his OCD takes over from time to time still, and has been bad for a few months now again. Still no professional help.

My whole social life revolves around him. He is close friends with the only guy I'm still friends with from school/my hometown. I'm friends with some of my BF's college friends, but those connections will be gone if we end. The only two girls I'm friends with from college are doing all their lectures online/off campus this year. It's my own fault for not making an effort to make friends/ a social life- if I had one I would gladly go to college, I would have more reason to go than just to see my BF. My life has just been my BF, his friends and study for the last 2 years. I have the option of being **on campus for 2 hours every Friday** if I chose one particular module/lecture OR I can do **all my lectures online for the year**. The only reason I would chose this Friday lecture is *to see my BF*. I have no reason to go to college if I'm not with my BF anymore and I would be paying €70 every week to stay in some nearby hotel. My BF has to be on campus, I have the option of staying at home. I have *2 weeks* to decide whether or not I'll take this one module on campus just to see my BF. If we break up, I have to still waste €70 per week  to attend a lecture until mid-December. I'm at a loss here. I was hoping to wait another month or 2 to see if things improve. Please help?

TLDR: having serious doubts about my BF and I have 2 weeks to decide whether or not I want to join him in college this year",01Sep2020,1

I'll make this quick. I'm 20 m, and honestly I'm so tired of being alive. My country (USA) is a complete shit show, college, despite liking my major, is dragging me down, I'm tired of dealing with people and having responsibilities. I'm not lazy, I'm a hard worker, I'm just tired of doing it.

I've dealt with depression for like 6-7 years, been on meds for 3. It depresses me even more to think I'll be dependent on a fucking pill for the rest of my life. I try to be active, I try to have hobbies, but eventually the commercial break to life is over and everything comes crashing back.

I feel like life is so pointless, we get a job so we can support ourselves and then we die.

 Everything is so divided right now, everyone's at each other's throats, and I don't want to continue living in it.

I don't think I have the balls to kill myself, but I've been looking at euthanasia in other countries. I just wanted to put this into words somewhere and let my mind ramble. Don't bother sending me hotline numbers cause I can look that shit up myself, I'm not interested. I'm just tired of living.",01Sep2020,1

I've tried a cold shower but felt much more relief with the warm/hot water. Unfortunately I ran out of hot water and started getting too cold to stay in much longer.

1183,"I was friends with this person in october 2019 on this Discord server. We became friends, and I see him arguing with people. He tells me these people are transphobes, and sends me out of context screenshots. I agree, and life goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later we fall out of touch and I find myself being in more common servers with the ""transphobes"", and I have no contact with the old friend. Later, I find out that the people who were labelled as transphobes were not actually so, and everything they said were taken out of context. 

&amp;#x200B;

After learning this (though for unrelated reasons) I join a big discord server which my old friend (who spread the rumours about the others) owns. First thing he does upon my arrival is accuse me of sending gore infront of 1.4K people (Back then i was an edgy idiot who sent questionable stuff, but never gore. It doesnt matter anyway, because it was a long ago + we're old friends AND he's the owner of the server)

&amp;#x200B;

i dm him and he refuses to apologise. Our friendship has ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually i get fed up and ask the server if anyone is willing to talk about the situation i have (i didnt say what it was). The dude immediately tries to shut me down by saying ""I'll help""

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I get fed up and decide to invite 2 friends to do the lightest trolling you've ever seen. This was an actual exchange:

&amp;#x200B;

user: i work at pizza hut

&amp;#x200B;

them: domino's is better

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I get banned for that (despite the fact that there is someone in the server who spammed with alts, and they're still allowed)

&amp;#x200B;

I later find out that more rumours have risen about me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to today

&amp;#x200B;

the people who were NOT transphobes reveal the truth, sending me images of exchanges with them and the traitor friend in another server. Whenever anything mean was said to him, the traitor friend would send ""HAHA"" in caps, just to rub it in. That was when i realised that this dude is both a bully and a rumour spreading manipulator (he spread rumours about me and 3 other people. Those people are seen as Neo Nazis, Pedophiles, Transphobes etc. thanks to him)
